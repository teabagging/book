Its about a young highschool girl who gets angrier and angrier everyday. All the kids at her school would do mean things to her all the time. They just kept getting worse. Little did she know she had telekinesis powers that could change the whole towns outlook forever. I can see why she did what she did. All the anger building up inside of her she was about to explode. Although it starts off a little slow, this book is definetly one of the scariest and most thrilling books I have ever read. I had never read a Stephen King book before this one, but I had always heard wonderful things about them. I started out just reading it because I had to for a book report. By the time I got all the way through it I was ready for more."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"They always say a book is better than the movie. In this case, they were right. I read this book many years ago and was amazed how well it was written for a first book. The main character, Carrie, was both strange yet it wasn't her fault. Her complete innocence of the world was due to her mother's shielding of her from the world. Both of my teenage girls have read this book and were thoroughly entertained."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Besides the fact that this book was the first published book by Stephen King, it has nothing that claims for attention, nothing special.Sometimes known as an author for teenagers, Stephen King shows in that book why. The plot, that is not very rich - but is powerful, revolves around a teenager who doesn't know nothing about the world becauser her mother is a religion fanatic, and think this world is crazy - well, I wouldn't disagree with that hehe - and think that it would be better to lock her daughter inside her houser than let her become a lost soul in this world. The other girls tease her because of her innocence, and people find her ridiculous in general. And, much to her mother's chagrin, she also has a power called telecinesy, through whick she can move what and whoever she wants just looking and wanting to do it. The problem is that this power is not under her control - and that's when the horror begins - and she gives pain even for the ones who do not deserve it.The plot is good, and I couldn't think of it in another way better than the way it was written... Not exactly the way, but the scenarios where it took place: house of Carrie, School, end of grade's day... All in a small town. The book, completely different in its taste and matureness, hold the reader, yes, but books like IT, THE SHINING, PET SEMATARY and CHRISTINE are obviously much better than that book. Anyway, this is a wonderful Stephen King piece as any other could be. Ever a joy!Marco Aurelio."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"In my opinion this book is still one of Stephen King's best. Simple idea, unexpected plot, excellent automosphere, direct horror. This book reads like a true story indeed, so many documents and scenes are so vivid and you wonder whether it is merely fabulous or not. Via this book Stephen King tell us he is a born story-teller. BTW, After reading over 10 of King's books, I must say that I still love his early direct, earnest style rather then the recent psychological, sinuous, over-embellished one."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As I see this book in the store I'm thinking to myself &quot; Man this book is way to small.&quot;If you are a King fan like me you are used to books like &quot;IT&quot; and &quot;The Stand&quot; and most of his others books.Then you see this little 245 and kinda laugh.Being a King fan I bought it.Man was I wrong for laughing.This is a definite page turner.This story of a girl mystified me.I don't know how he compacted such a story in so few of pages.This is one you must read.Don't pass it by."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book is fabulous and horror filled because it tells the TRUTH about human nature and the microcosm that is high school. Though written in the early 70s we still see the same types walking the halls today-the Carries, the popular bitchy rich girl, the Sue Snells and Tommys and so on. In the film, Carrie is the beautiful Sissy Spacek. Sissy would never be the Carrie that is in this book, that Carrie we are told has stains under her armpits....Carrie's humiliation and the destruction she unleashes are not to be missed. This is vintage Early King, he says its raw and somewhat disses it, but it is his best work."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Great book. The story line was awesome and it's some of King's best work. It was the perfect length for my attention span :-)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As with most, this book is hugely better than the movie. Although the movie is quite good. Carrie's inner voice is creepy, her Mom is downright frightening and the girls at school are the Original mean girls. It's a short, great book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen King's Carrie is not so much a classic tale of horror and retribution as a study of the effects of repression. Carrie White is bullied: by her class mates who see her innocence as a thing to deride; by her mother, a religious zealot who subjects her daughter to bizarre and terrifying rituals.Carrie also has another factor that ensures it is just a relevant today. It's well written. King ensures that Carrie White's character is no mere thumbnail sketch. He gives her depth as well as flesh, and by the time she wields her terrible power upon a town bent on shutting its gates upon her, well...we're sort of on her side.King uses several devices that made this book different in its day. The use of letters and newspaper cuttings reminds the reader of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Horror set pieces such as: when Carrie has her first period in the shower and the spiteful reaction of her classmates; the slaughter of a pig with a sledge hammer and the notorious bucket of blood set to christen Carrie as she's crowned queen of the prom.It's good to see that Carrie has been branded a classic. And to think if it had been up to Mr. King himself the original manuscript would not be gracing the bookshelves of adoring millions, it would still be in his kitchen bin!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The story of Carrie White, although not told conventionally, is a fast and fun read, if not one of King's best.Carrie White is the student you probably remember from one of your schooling experiences: the plump outcast who never achieved any semblance of popularity and remained something of an outcast from the clique-based social hierarchy. I remember a girl like Carrie White well, albeit in elementary school not High School. King developes Carrie well, a character to be sympathized with but not pitied, a somewhat lowly character but not a pathetic one. Character development is also important in the characterization of Carrie's mother, who cannot be made too evil or over-the-top while still being oppressive, and King strays close to the line without going over.But then again, people rarely talk about the characterization in a King novel, so I suppose I must devote time to the sci-fi element: Carrie White is a telekenetic, capable of moving objects with her mind. Like Ramona Quimby in Roald Dahl's children's book \\"Ramona\\", Carrie begins to train herself and develop her powers, until she is capable of essentially everything, something she proves in the tour-de-force latter third of the novel.As mentioned, Carrie is not told conventially. King abandons the traditional novel format and instead tells the story as if it really happened, citing invented scientific studies, autobiographies, eye-witnesses, police reports and interveiws. This either adds to or detracts from the novel, depending on your opinion. I'm on the fence; while on one hand this is certainly fresh, on the other it seems perhaps King did not have enough material to fill a traditonal novel and resorted to this format instead. Similarily, I am tempted to give the book 5 stars, but the negative part of me is going to prevail, if only because the specific event that leads to Carrie's unleashing of her power seems poorly thought out for such a significant event. 7.5/10"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Wow. What an amazing novel. This novel tells the tale of Carietta White, a high school loser who is tormented by her classmates and overzealously religous mother. In Carrie, Stephen King further develops his unique style of writing, using several mediums to convey the story: character thoughts offset in parentheses, hearing committee testimonies, associated press tickers and so on.King does a great job developing character and plot early in the novel, but what makes this work so strong is King's ability to make the most minor details relevant later in the story. Carrie isn't necessarily a horror, per se, rather a suspenseful thriller. Throughout the whole novel you're just waiting for Carrie to snap. King did a great job of keeping the level of tension taut as an overstretched drum. All in all, Carrie is a tough one to put down until you've turned the last page...and an eerie foreshadowing of the teenage vengeance prevailant in today's high school shootings."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I am not a big fan of Stephen King books, although I have only read three of this books. The first one I read was &quot;Carrie&quot;. I saw the film, loved it, so gave the novel a try. I must say it\`s difficult to get imagery from this book, and I did not find King\`s use of words powerful or frightening at all. They were too raw and unpleasantly accurate to intrigue me. But what really aggravated me about &quot;Carrie&quot; is the way King constructed newspaper articles, obituaries, and interviews into the story. It totally weakened the plot, and it sort of got confusing at times. Brian De Palma\`s classic film adaptation, I feel, is a lot better. The plot was produced with more focus on adolescence, and the severe emotions the main characters felt. There also a lot more powerful and unexpected moments. Strangely, De Palma\`s version of the prom scene is a a lot more chilling and electrifying than the book\`s. I actually found the novel\`s depiction of the climax rather funny. In all, if you\`re looking for a compelling, terrifying horror story, don\`t read &quot;Carrie&quot;, it won\`t do anything for you."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"this book was great I give it a 5 out of 5 reason being is that horror is not the only aspect of the book, it all so deal with bullying and child abuse something people can understand and can get that which is normally not in horror. I can understand why people feel it is not he's best but for a first book is really good."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Masterpiece! One of his best books. Very frightening. A lot more in the book is covered than in the movie."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The book was way more better than the movie! More detailed and more action! The movie would have been better if it would of stayed in tune with the book"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I love Stephen King's work. I like getting freaked out, though sometimes I regret my choice of picking up one of his books because he does horror a little too well. \`Carrie' is one part creepy, one part sad, and a billion parts oh-no-she-didn't.It's hard not to feel sorry for Carrie, after reading about how badly she was bullied by the other students at her school. Degrading her daily, no wonder she eventually snapped. No one could have suspected her hidden powers, or just how much chaos she could create . . .I've never seen this movie, but I've heard it's just as good and ghastly as the novel. After reading this, I'm determined to watch that.Compared to his other books, Stephen King's \`Carrie' is fairly short. I went through the book in only a few days. It was gripping, the plot moved along swiftly. There are no chapter numbers, but brief \`newspaper articles' are inserted here and there, adding the element of reality and bringing the story even closer to home.I think \`Carrie' is a great book for any fan of horror. I recommend you read it right away. I give it 5/5 stars."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Vintage King. Character development is so complete it gives this reader the feeling he is part of the story. A helpless voyeur, unable to do anything else but observe (almost like the character in &#34;Autopsy: Room Four&#34; from his collection, &#34;Nightmares & Dreamscapes). Carrie's story is not only engaging, it is compelling and powerful. A young woman, possessed with unimaginable power in one of the most vulnerable times of a woman's life, struggles with the things in her life that makes her different. Her fragile ego is constantly being stressed by the ridicule she must endure and all the hateful things done to her. The story could not have ended better, though, of course, bittersweet on an incredibly horrible scale. (Incidentally, the movie with Sissy Spaceck and John Travolta is really quite good, and does not harm, whatsoever, to the book.)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"High school is certainly one of the toughest years we can experience in our lives. We have to study hard for exams, obey all of those school rules we hate, and even try to become popular. Not to mention that we can be teased at or embarrassed in front of our classmates. For one high school girl, it's more than personal, especially on her prom night.In Stephen King's first published novel, we follow Carrie White in high school and day by day, she is continually tormented by her classmates and even teachers. Some examples are getting hit with a towel in gym class, having peanut butter put in her and having her first period in class. But at home, it's a nightmare living with her insanely religious mother who is trying to save her from demons in her life. Then later, Carrie is asked by a classmate named Tommy Ross to go with him to the prom and Carrie agrees. But at the event while dancing and being crowned prom queen, she is drenched by falling pig blood and a roar of laughs burst from the crown. Realizing that she won't take the teasing any longer, she's about to unleash her secret powers of telekinesis for revenge.King's first novel is truly a flawless one out of all the others in his later career. He captures the true feeling and mind of a high school girl which is surprising. The story gets off in a good start and then in the next part, it gets more intense and realistic. \\"Carrie\\" is also a perfect read for teens and can bring them into King's world. Despite some of other novels by King being more classic, \\"Carrie\\" will always be known as Stephen King's first incredible novel."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"another of Kings book that was made into a decent movie that followed the story plot to a tee. this is the first book that he sold under his name (he had sold a book under his alias before this) this is the book that made Stephen King a household name."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is remembered generally as a story about bizarre superpowers of the mind, but it is a far deeper look into the effects of bullying at school and abuse at home. This particular edition has a very interesting foreword by King that describes the two real-life girls that were his inspiration for the Carrie character.Yes, there are supernatural powers involved. But even more than the (very good) film, we get a look at how very natural forces shape Carrie into someone that can use those powers for destructive purposes. The book is also more balanced, with the school principal being a sympathetic character rather than yet another bully."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"CARRIE by Stephen King.STORY BRIEF:Carrie was abused by her religiously fanatic mother and reviled and bullied by her classmates. When she reaches puberty she gains a telekinetic ability. She can move things with her mind.REVIEWER'S OPINION:Others have called this \\"haunting sheer terror\\" and \\"gory and horrifying.\\" I feared the horror would keep me awake at night. But it did not. Actually it put me in a good mood.CAUTION SPOILER:I saw the movie years ago and I had no desire to read the book. I erroneously thought two things would depress me: a high school girl being bullied and the mass killing of people. To my surprise I was not depressed. Maybe because it was so outrageous, or it had a comic book feel, but it was fun somehow. Whatever magic you're using Steve, I'm buying. It feels like the author is a teenage boy who likes to write comic book stories with Pow - Kapow. Steve doesn't rip me up emotionally like the male authors of The Story of Edgar Sawtelle and The Book Thief did when they killed characters. And most female authors have depressed me when killing good characters. Steve writes differently.NON-SPOILERS:The subject of bullying is usually depressing, but it wasn't here. When Carrie was being bullied in the shower, I felt some sympathy, but it was more like \\"watching an ick traffic accident.\\" I was watching rather than identifying with the victim. The history of other abuse to Carrie by her peers and her mother was done mostly through telling (referring to after the fact) rather than showing. So that lessened the suffering experience. But then, more importantly, Carrie showed dignity. I admired her actions and standing up for herself related to going to the prom. The things she said to her mother and Tommy were so normal and perceptive that she didn't have a victim feel. I didn't expect her to be this way. For example, a teacher came up to Carrie at the prom and said \\"You ... are ... beautiful.\\" Tommy asked Carrie what the teacher said. Carrie said \\"I think she wanted to say she was sorry.\\" The author surprised me with unexpected things.I like stories with someone getting revenge. But I don't want to label this as revenge. I didn't feel typical revenge feelings when Carrie was doing her thing. Although in a minor part of the story, I was happy to see something bad happen to one character and Carrie's revenge on two characters.Writing style: many points of view. Many scenes are narrated with different points of view. Some scenes are excerpts from articles written in the future. Some scenes are surviving witnesses being questioned by authorities. It was a little unnerving - jumping around like this. But it worked, and I really liked being in various characters' heads.This was the author's first published novel. It is about half the length of typical novels.NARRATORS:Sissy Spacek was the main narrator and she was fabulous! I loved her interpretations. A man with a deep bass voice narrated three titles. The last title was \\"Part 3 (pause) Wreckage\\" The way he said it made me chuckle. It had a comic book feel. He said Wreckage the way someone would say Kapow, but slow and subtle.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 7 hrs and 28 mins. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.

Originally written in 1974, this was SK's first novel, and in my opinion is one of his best.We all know the story.. A girl who is bullied and abused at school discovers that she has telkinetic powers. Amongst the back drop of her rabidly abusive peers, her psychotic, religious fanatic mother, and the malicious towns-people who wish nothing ut ill on her and her mother Carrie continues to develop her powers with frightening speed and accuracy. As type of atonement, one of the abusive girls (Sue) decides it would be a good idea to have her boyfriend attend the prom with Carrie, this idea goes horribly wrong when another girl decides to pull a prank that brings out an explosive rage in Carrie that no one ever suspected.This is a very quick short read, the storyline itself is punctuated with \\"survivor testimony\\", goverment inquiries and research into the events. The ending to this book is beyond phenominal and in my opinion is one of the best Stephen King endings that one can ask for. You will not be disappointed and you sure as hell will not want to put this book down. I finished it in one day only stopping to go to work. After reading page 1 you will be craving more and more, and after the ending you will be wanting a second book!!Buy IT!!Definately pick this book up, you will love it. Also see the movie both are great."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I love this book, I can't put it down. You really relate to the character by empathizing with her. Even though I seen the movie and know the outcome, every word has me hooked and feeling on edge for what's going to happen next. I got this book a little under two weeks after I ordered it. It was worth the wait!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have read this book so many times, and I still can't get enough of it! It's a very well written book about a coming of age story in which the main character is trying to find her place in the world. Just enough suspense that it keeps you reading and finding out more until the very end."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is, of course, another eerie novel by Stephen King. I recommend this novel to anyone who appeal to dark eerie novels about the human psyche of loneliness. This novel ties the sick and demented perspective of religious fanatics. I will admit the novel has rather dull sections especially towards the middle pages. Though others may enjoy this section I found the plot to be over hyped and rather dull by it drifting from the dark lonely theme of the novel. As the novel progresses to the climax and resolution suspense is well built. King's ability to switch back and forth between character point of views and articles that portray the main story is perfected. The creepy mindset Carrie contains at the end of the novel is brilliant. This is yet another excellent novel by Stephen King. The movie did not do this novel justice and I highly recommend reading the novel and not watching the movie. The novel contains the unique elements King intended to out stand in the novel."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have recently read King's 11/22/63, and since I'm a writer myself (unpublished), I wanted to learn how to break the story up using newspaper clipings, parts from fictional books and such. So I turned to the one of the greatest classics, Carrie.I found Carrie's story to be more intense, brutal than the movie (but the movie wasn't bad as itself). Carrie is a fast paste book, no doubt, but it was very brilliantly written. I know King said it as \\"A young book from a young author,\\" but Carrie really shows King's true talent.For those who are thinking reading this book after watching the movie for God knows how many times, you must pick this book up. The story is a lot better (you get the chance to learn more about the White family), se the major differences between the book and the movie. It won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I know this was Stephen Kings debut novel but I'm just now getting around to reading it. I expected it to go pretty much like the movie(should've known better the book is always better than the movie)but there is so much more in the book. Excerpts from newspaper clippings appear throughout so you know that something is going to happen at prom, however it doesn't spoil the ending it just makes you want to read faster so you can find out quicker. It is a quick read but not easily forgettable. Right from the start I was feeling sorry for Carrie having to live with the bullying and the crazy nut of a mother. So by the end of the book you understand why Carrie does what she does. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book is one of King's greatest stories. The plot is very intriguing. You expect Carrie White to get even with the bullies at her school, but not in the way it actually happens. I loved the book and the movie. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I think Stephen King's Carrie is a excellect book I think Stephen King is an excellent writer,but he could have made Carrie a little more interesting.I guess I feel like this because Carrie is a harder book for me to understand because I'm only 13,but Stephen King's books are for pre-adults maybe they would unerstand it better then me."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book is a true work of Stephen King. He is at his best with this book of cult and gore, a true crowd pleaser. The description and realism that he creates is indescribable. Yet at the same time he creatively mixes horror with a story about a girl who didn't fit in. Remarkble, truly."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As with all of the King books I've read, I was unable to put this one down. King did a fantastic job of presenting the reader with a character you can feel sorry for in a situation which is very real. Although I loved this book, I felt that it did not deserve 5 stars because of the long, exhausting news and magazine clips printed throughout the book. It would have been better had he simply stuck with the main story rather than confusing readers with senseless interviews. Other than that, this book was excellent and I would suggest it to anyone who has a lust for horror and drama!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I thought this was a great book, It was for every taste. Steven King really captured the misunderstood pearsonality of Carrie White in a thrilling horror story. The writing was very well put, and I couldn't put the book down! I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book has to be one of my favorites. I read nothing but King and other horror aouthors. I love the way that he protrays her as the victim untill the very end. I watched the movie a million times and have read the book over and over. It's just great."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book was great! I however don't think it deserves five stars. More like four and a half stars. Some parts of the book are a little slow (such as the testimonies) It is only the second King book I have read but I am now in the middle of &quot;Bag of Bones.&quot; I cannot wait to read more by this awesome author!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen King has really done it this time! Carrie was a great book and fun to read.

But it was great how she got back. The ending was shocking. The one in the movie was kind of korny."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book was really really good! I enjoyed it a lot. I think a movie should be made based purely on the book. In the movie we don't actually find out that Sue and Tommy were not in the *Pig blood* prank. Sue wanted Tommy to go to the prom with Carrie as a sort of atonement for her earlier actions (she made fun of Carrie along with everyone else). There is also the fact that Tommy had actually started to like Carrie. This is one of the most important things. And it is what makes Tommy &amp; Sue such great characters. I was very sorry for Carrie in the end and also sorry that Tommy dies. Carrie was basically not a bad person but circumstances made her snap. I think the articles given in between from &quot;The shadow exploded&quot; and &quot;The white case committee&quot; made this book even more chilling. So everyone...do read this book. If nothing else, it tells us how people can just snap when they're subjected to extreme torture and cheap pranks. At least it will teach you to be kind to any &quot;mortimer snurd&quot; or misfit."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"One of the few SK books that I didn't like. The plot was good, an abused teenage girl goes beserk on the fam and classmates when she figures out that she has &quot;super&quot; powers. However, i found it difficult to follow(with all of the newspaper clippings and court interviews, etc. The only really poignant and at the same time worthwhile was the final &quot;fight scene&quot; with the mother. Nonetheless, if you are a &quot;true&quot; SK fan, you should read this merely because it is &quot;the book that made him famous.&quot;"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The book Carrie by: Stepen King was very good.

This book is a simple idea, simply executed, and simply concluded. No surprises here. Perhaps something good for early-or-pre-teen horror fans to cut their teeth on, but for anybody who's even looked at his later stuff, this doesn't hold anything new. (Maybe things are a lot more severe in America than the UK, but aren't King's teenagers a little ... well ... sociopathic? Psychotic? He makes High School sound like its run by a generation of neo-Nazis.)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is one of King's best novels, a distillation of what was to come, but Simon Leake's ignorant remarks using movies as the standard to criticize literature is very common.

In college Jordan possessed that amazing athletic ability that would make him an awe inspiring icon, but lacked the skill that would make him the greatest player ever(shooting and dribbling) King was the same way in Carrie he showed his gift for horror and the paranormal that would make him a best selling author many times over, but he lacked the things we would find in his later books like believable characters and subtelty. Overall the book is terrifying but lacks the fine tuning to make it a really good book. This book is not a complete book, its one dimensional."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Written well but the story's just as bad as the movie. So if you liked the movie read it."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I picked up this book, after reading Cujo, Christine, and 4 past midnight. However, this wasnt at all what i was expectingAlot of people have already said that it's more of a coming of age story. Well, the story was okay, but the writing wasn't very good, unlke his other books. This one kept going back and forth, between reports, people, and narratives. As well as confusing, it was boring.I personally dont like non-fiction writing, but alot of this was written as if it was.I would recomend it to anyone who enjoys the nonfiction style but also enjoys the supernatural."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I'm a HUGE King fan, so of course I had to read his first published novel. Unfortunately, about halfway though, I began simply trudging through just for the sake of being able to say I read it.The book is full of excerpts from newspapers etc. detailing the incident at the end, and none of these work to build any suspense or even interest in the coming event. They are dull and repetitive and I began to dread finding one as I went along.The story is told in a somewhat jumbled and uninteresting fashion, and the worst of all is the complete lack of likable characters.All of the school kids are shallow and uninteresting, and Carrie White is just as shallow and uninteresting. Carrie White does nothing to make me like her as a character. I found her bitter, awkward, and just as rude and hateful as the school kids. She elicits no sympathy from me.All in all, the story is bland, unremarkable, poorly constructed, and dull dull dull to the very end.I'm glad that he published this book, only for the fact that it gave him the career that paved the way for him to publish his many other novels, which I adore.But I understand why he originally pitched the manuscript into the trash."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This novel could've been great. Its 'star' is a teenage girl (Carrie White) whose problems dwarf those of most high-schoolers. She had no chance at a stable life. Her mother is a religious nut. She has to wear homemade clothes to school, although that may not have been so bad in the post-hippie 1970s. The climax of her torture, however, is a doozy, and after reading it, you'll surely be ashamed for thinking how rough you had it as a teenager. It's bad enough to have your first period in the girl's showers, at the age of sixteen, without knowing what's happening to your body. Carrie is terrified of bleeding to death, and that's when the other girls decide to take a cue from Lord of the Flies and throw tampons at her, leaving her feeling so damaged and threatened that a telekinesis is awakened within her. This power feeds off the resentment that her tormentors cause, leading to a well-deserved and rewarding retaliation from dear Carrie. As you can see, the story itself is appropriately satisfying and tragic. Several of its premises could have inspired parables of their own. With all this potential for greatness, what went so wrong with this book?The biggest tragedy of Carrie is not the fate of its characters, but its inescapable status as Stephen King's first published novel. I feel sorry for all his works, of course, because each one shows glimmers of hope within the junkyards of words that Mr. King apparently feels no need to edit. He seems to be in love with every turn of phrase he can think of, unable to part with a single one. Carrie wasn't the first novel he wrote, but it was one of the first, and can you think of a worse existence than that of a novel being written by the inexperienced Stephen King? I can't say he's gotten much better over the years, but his endlessly annoying use of nonsense words like 'ohuh' (as if anyone has actually said that, ever) should have been a clue to King and his wife to leave this one in the trash.If you haven't read Stephen King but want to, don't start with this book. In fact, you don't ever need to read it. It'll just make you think less of him. Start with'Salem's Lot, or with any of his other books, as long as you avoid this one."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book is one endless, feverish, terrifying nightmare. The fact that there are no chapters makes it seem even worse.It starts out incredibly gory with a detailed description of Carrie White's first menstrual period, which occured later in her teenage years in front of all her female gym classmates.There are no comfortable moments in this book---it's all pure awfulness... Except for a brief section right at the start of prom night when Carrie talks to another girl about her dress. The author seems to be good at giving us a character that could actually escape from the terror around her and then crushing every hope of that happening. Many paragraphs from books about the horror of Carrie White's prom night are stuck in the middle of everything, telling us something very bad is going to happen at the end---which is probably the only reason, really, to keep reading. You want to find out what happens. Unfortunately, though, the foreshadowing excerpts pop up everywhere and get very, very dull.The book centres around the life of misunderstood teenager Carrie, who is the victim of her violent, dominating mother who is obsessed with the Bible in all sorts of bizarre, horrible ways... And the mother is probably the most disturbing character I've ever read about. Ever.This book is hard to read, partly because it is so much a never-ending nightmare and partly because it gives you a weird kind of hope for Carrie even if you know things won't work out. Carrie develops telekenetic powers and then most of the characters die... Which is no huge surprise, because we're told from the start of the death on prom night.Poor Carrie. The book is also hard to read because, although it is fiction, you think that if only Carrie's mother wasn't so evil and controlling, she could have had a normal life. Plus the gore is disgusting."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I finished this book in just over 2 hours. The characters were undeveloped and the plot mediocre.

The movie was way better than the book. It was about this girl named Carrie (of course) who was tormented by all of her classmates.

Towards the middle of the story a popular guy named Tommy Ross asks her out to the prom. So when they get there people are staring at them. They win high school king and queen and when they get up on the stage, what happens is unbelieveable. I don't recommend this book to anyone. EVER!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen King hits a home run in his very first published novel, \\"Carrie\\". He tells a believable story about a misfit girl with a supernatural gift and the horror that ensues when she's forced to put it to use."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is a novel that is often unfairly branded with the horror label because it was written by Stephen King. It's not a blood-and-guts, gory type of monster or ghost story, it's a drama/thriller with supernatural elements that would probably be labeled a tragedy if that was a term used for novels. The oppression suffered by the title character at the hands of her merciless classmates and fundamentalist mother seems all too realistic, and a good part of the book focuses on her torment in facing these real-life ordeals. The inclusion of her telekinesis, which finally empowers her to lash out at those who cause her misery, could be attributed to the fantasies of a young writer who had faced bullying and harassment himself in school hallways. Carrie is one of several stories King wrote about the bitterness and resentment young people experience as a result of social awkwardness and anxiety, including Christine and the Richard Bachman novel Rage. Carrie's most tragic quality comes from how King allows the character a brief moment of knowing how wonderful life can be, giving her a glimmer of hope that she can have the same happiness as everyone else, then subjecting her to traumatic pubic humiliation and the murderous religious fervor of her mother. Their deaths, and those of most of the town's graduating senior class, bring the tragedy to a close and leave the reader to ponder the cruelty and worthlessness of ostracizing or harassing people simply for being different. Carrie teaches a lesson as necessary today as it was 37 years ago when the book was published."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is one of the select Stephen King novels that transcends its genre. Without ever having read it, most will recognize the story of the homely high school senior with telekinetic abilities. For this reader, the author's point of view was more interesting than the protagonist's special abilities. King advances the plot retroactively, with faux media accounts: newspaper articles, wire reporting, a survivor memoir, and a report from the fictitious White Commission. The unusual literary technique adds haunting realism to a story that could otherwise be lost in a growing heap of competing teen paranormal series.Carrie's first period at age 16 parallels growing telekinetic abilities. It starts off modestly enough. A light bulb burning out. Rocks hitting the roof of a house. But the more powerful her emotional agitation, the stronger the paranormal reaction. King's prose is always authentic. Even more impressive is how he brings such potency to a young woman's torment. The idea of teen bullying received new emphasis after Tina Fey'sMean Girls (Full Screen Edition)and David Cullen's disturbing account of the Columbine shootings.When Carrie is at home, she is physically safe, but psychologically abused by her mother--a woman for whom no church on earth is holy enough. She holds services three days a week with just one congregant--her daughter. This isolation is compounded by the father's death before she was born. Mrs. White is against sex, men, the color red, Baptists, Rock music, Satan, and virtually everything except the King James Bible. She is known as a freak, and her daughter bears the scars of that reputation at Ewen High.Save for the protagonist's powers, nothing in King's anti-Cinderella story in unrealistic. The dialogue, narration, and vivid depiction of small town life all ring true more than 35 years later.Carrieis not just a horror classic, it is a true masterpiece of contemporary fiction. The first King novel published, it fully deserves its 5-star rating."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is the story of a high school girl- the bottom rung of the social ladder, violently oppressed (and repressed) by her fanatically religious mother- who matures into her telekinetic powers and in the end is pushed to use them in a tragic and devastating way. The story is good, but not outstanding, and it's not the type of Stephen King scary that will creep you out at night.I think the main value of Carrie lies in the moving depiction of the experience of a girl who has been bullied and picked on her whole life, and the brink that she eventually reached as a result. In the end, though Carrie White takes on the role of villain, the reader still deeply sympathizes with her (contrast with Jack Torrance in The Shining).The presentation of the story is slightly annoying. Narration constantly shifts between first person, third person, newspaper articles and a book being written about the events in the story, which is somewhat jarring. And a lot of the writing is just plain bad (which King freely admits- Salem's Lot was an improvement tenfold). So I'm giving the book three stars, though the story deserved four.Anyone who is (or aspires to be) a serious King fan must read this book though, despite its foibles. This is where it all began. Also, seeing how hard work and practice can tremendously improve the craft of writing should be an inspiration to young aspiring novelists who read Carrie along with some of King's later work!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Years ago, I avoided reading Stephen King on the belief that his books were evil and twisted. However, after my sister convinced me to watch \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" I realized this man had some storytelling genius and I wanted to know more. Since then I've read some of his classics, \\"The Stand,\\" \\"'Salem's Lot,\\" and so on, finding King to be a writer who plumbs the human condition from a distinctly American point of view.Now at last, I've read the book that kickstarted it all. \\"Carrie\\" is one of King's shorter work, and yet it packs as much punch as his longer books. The scenes are now iconic--Carrie taunted in the shower, as she experiences her first period; Carrie crowned queen of the prom; Carrie covered in pig's blood, as a final and ill-timed practical joke by her taunters. Although the book appears to be about telekinesis, it is really an exploration of bullying, religious extremism, and small-town New England. Carrie is the butt of the schoolyard jokes, and her vulnerability is heightened by her own mother's misguided thoughts of what Christianity is. We've seen these types in the real-life news, ones who latch onto the trappings of religion and wield what should be a gift of grace like a weapon of hate. In this case, Carrie is the victim--but she makes her bullies pay. Boy, does she!King sprinkles his story with newspaper clips, doctor reports, and trial transcripts. The greater narrative tells of Carrie's rise to prom queen and subsequent descent into lonely yet triumphant mayhem. She is a girl who refuses to live out a future in her mother's image. She hopes to break free. But when others refuse to let her do so, she makes them pay by blood and fire.This is a raw, sometimes vulgar, book. It gives many hints of King's later work--\\"Firestarter,\\" in particular. We get our first taste here of his empathy for the downtrodden and misunderstood, his dislike of religious wackos, and his skill at making the paranormal seem chillingly normal."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"At its heart, this novel is a cautionary tale about the evil that can arise when a person is maltreated by society. Carrie's deadly powers are first manifested in this novel while she is being bullied by her classmates in the school showers, and it is the nastiness of her peers that leads to so much destruction in the end. Other themes in the novel include adolescent sexuality, religious fanaticism, and the aforementioned highschool bullying. There is plenty of emotional depth, pathos, and supernatural thrills to make Carrie a potentially GREAT book!So why the harsh 2-star rating?well, for some reason this very short novel (by King's standards) felt like a much longer read than it should have been. King chose to intersperse passages of news print, critical articles, legal extracts, and autobiographies into the main narration of the novel, which interrupted the flow of the story. For the first three quarters of the novel this intertextuality was a mild irritation, but then as the plot approached its climax King began to stuff more and more different extracts into the narrative, which made the pace unbearably slow (when really it should have been speeding up). i felt like i had to read through about 8 different accounts of the same event and it became very tedious! King might have been trying to make the story more \\"believable\\" by including all those extracts, but instead it produced the opposite effect!Well, now I'm feeling a bit guilty about criticising a great writer's first novel, albeit one produced several decades ago. This obviously isnt King at the height of his powers. Its just a bit sad that the flawed structure of the story spoiled what could have been a 4-star, or maybe even a 5-star book. I'd only recommend this for aspiring writers who want to learn about some mistakes that should be avoided, or obsessed fans who feel like they need to read everything that King ever wrote. For everyone else, you might like to check out Salem's Lot or Misery (these are my personal fav's)."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"High school. One of the most confusing and emotional times of your life. For a severely bullied Carrie, it was also fraught with discovery - When she gets her first period at the late age of 16, she discovers a strange power she had forgotten she could utilize.I can't count on all of my fingers and toes the number of people I've seen bullied in high school, myself included, but I've never met anybody who was bullied quite so badly as Carrie White. Excluded, laughed at and picked on, Carrie bears the brunt of an entire school's discrimination, simply because she is shy and has a strange mother. Carrie relates to so many in this way - anyone who was ever picked on or beaten up at school can relate to her pain, and grows to hate Carrie's tormentors as well. However, Stephen King has offered another side to the story - the reader gets the chance to explore the minds of the other kids who mock Carrie. Some do it for malicious joy, whereas others simply go with the crowd and know inside their hearts that teasing Carrie is wrong. That factor set this novel aside from others that address bullying in high schools - it is easy to see inside the minds of everyone involved and learn what makes them tick.I've only just started to read the works of Stephen King, so I figured that Carrie, his first novel, would be a brilliant place to start. I found the story to be extremely well written, both technically and dramatically. The novel adopts several different methods of telling the story, such as with interviews, extracts from newspapers or books to just good old fashioned third person narrative. The switches in tense and person are always well explained and hardly ever confusing. Carrie was easy to pick up but impossible to put down.An easy read with a realistic, yet satisfyingly dramatic plot line, mixed with a good bit of gore and some awesome, well-explained powers made Stephen King's first novel a memorable experience. I'm very glad I've read it."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Also appears on The Screaming Nitpicker.High school teen Carietta \\"Carrie\\" White grew up with an unbalanced religious fanatic for a mother and without either a father or friends she could rely on. Kept from doing things or buying clothes that the average teen would, the change in her life begins the day of her first menstrual period at age seventeen. The emotional trigger that is pulled that day unlocks her latent telekinetic powers and she starts to put them to use. These powers, combined with one girl named Sue's guilt over what she did to Carrie and her attempts to redeem herself, set the stage for one of the most terrifying and memorable fictional events in modern times: Prom Night, the Black Prom, Carrie's vengeful rampage through the town of Chamberlain.The strange thing with this book is that you know exactly how it's going to end and what happens, both because Carrie is both an infamous book and movie and because the epistolary form of the novel gives away multiple times that people will die on Prom Night and even who will die. But it doesn't subtract from the suspense at all to be told what happens; I found that it excited me more because it told me what was ahead and made me want to read the accounts of those who were involved instead of third parties who weren't there.All of the characters felt realistic and flawed to me: Carrie, the shy, abused, and bullied girl who becomes more and more unhinged until she finally breaks; Sue Snell, the girl who did something she regretted and went to great lengths to try and fix what she did in some what; Chris Hargensen, the bully who hurt Carrie for years and just started to get an inkling of a feeling that she was doing something wrong just a little too late; Billy Nolan, the complete monster (okay, so he wasn't as three-dimensional as others); and Margaret White, the severely-unhinged and religiously fanatical mother of Carrie. Everyone had life to them, even characters mentioned only once or twice.After I was done with the book, I remember Chris's hesitation when it came time to pull the string and dump the pig's blood on Carrie. What if she had decided against it? Would the buckets have remained unpoured and Carrie would have had the best night of her life? After getting along with Freida and other, would Carrie have started to make friends? How would Tommy have dealt with loving both Sue and Carrie? I wanted to know about everything that could have happened, but didn't- it made me want to see an alternate ending. There's the possibility that Billy would have pulled the string after he got sick of Chris's hesitation, but there's also equal chance that he wouldn't have. Yet even if the bucket had remained untouched, there would still be Carrie's mother to think about, who had been planning the whole time to kill Carrie when she got back. Would that have been Carrie's trigger instead of the pig blood? We will never know.This book gave me one of my favorite moments of all time, one that made me mentally go, \\"Oh snap!\\" It was when Chris Hargensen's lawyer dad John Hargensen and Principal Henry Grayle had a mental face-off. Chris was supposed to go to detention for throwing tampons and pads at Carrie and when she didn't, she was suspended for three days and lost her prom tickets. John comes in to try and get the prom rights back for her and a mental face-off the likes of which I have never seen before happens between the two men. While they argued legal mumbo-jumbo back and forth about the rights of the school to punish one of their students and how teachers can handle students, I was on the edge of my seat. Once I was finished with that scene, I went back and read it again just because it was so awesome! Mr. Grayle definitely won that battle, showing off Chris's ugly record like that, along with threatening to sue on Carrie's behalf.One small point bothered me about the novel, but I'm willing to let it slide. This novel is told in epistolary form with excerpts from fake books and accounts from people who lived in Chamberlain then. Yet this book contains Carrie's point of view when it's never seen that she write in a journal or leaves behind records; Tommy's thoughts and feelings just before his death are in here too, along with Margaret White's. When these characters die without leaving behind any records, where would these bits come from? This is my first true epistolary, but I would think that the entire book would have to be made up of records of some sort, not just pieces of it. I'll give it a pass because it's my first epistolary (my issue might have to do with being an idealist and not knowing how they work) and because it's in third-person. We don't ask about who the narrator is in every third -person book, do we? Exactly.How could I not give this book a five-star rating? It was suspenseful, terrifying, classic, and I couldn't stand to put it down! (It also helps that if I gave it even one ukulele, the fictional and ghostly spirit of Carrie would come and kill me, according to my wild daynightmares.) I highly recommend this book; after reading it, you will more than likely see why Stephen King has become so popular. If you will excuse me, I'm going to go find the movie on television."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I saw Carrie (1976) several years ago, and remember hiding behind my couch for a good part of the movie. The same thing happened with the 2002 made-for-tv movie about a year after that. Why, then, did I decide to read the original source material for my year of nightmares, you ask? I wanted to start reading Stephen King, and decided the beginning was the best place to start.To be honest, I started this book last October but only got around to finishing it now, lol. Anyway, the book, for the most part, was pretty slow. There was definitely a feel of anticipation to the flow, and you could always tell something was about to happen, but it didn't. Not until the end, or close to it, at least.I like the way King told the story: through letters, newspaper and magazine articles, books, and interviews. And then of course, the actual narrative structure, told mainly in Carrie's point of view, but also the other character's. It shifted back and forth between the two story structures very nicely and swiftly.My favorite character would probably be Sue Snell. She appeared to be just another one of the bitchy girls, much like Chris, but turned around to be a completely different character... she was actually dynamic, and had a different side she learned to show. A side filled with love, care, and honesty. Chris was a total bitca, as was her boyfriend, whose name escapes me (lol and I like JUST finished :P). They were definitely the villains of the book, alongside Margaret White, who I will get to later.The story was more of an depressing one than a scary one. Sure, there were creepy and eerie parts, but overall, the novel felt like an emotional metaphorical journey of a girl on the verge of adolescence, and who didn't know how to deal with it .The supernatural element was added by King, I assume, to fictionalize the story more and make it seem like something that it wasn't.The only character I found to be actually frightening was Margaret White, Carrie's mother. She tried to kill her daughter! No sane person does that. She's overtly religious and thought Carrie was the spawn of Satan. Um, okay. For one, you're the one that conceived her! Do not ridicule and abuse your daughter just because you can find no other way of escape. Bitch. Rot in hell.So, the ending was also pretty creepy, but in the naive way... like, the letter the woman wrote to her sister was so full of innocence, that it was just sad and creepy knowing what might come and happen.So, in the end, this novel was a great introduction into the mind of Stephen King, and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"*Carrie* is the book that made Stephen King rich (the book was bought for $400,000 by a paperback publisher, if I remember correctly), and that's a pretty good start for a writer, not to say miraculous start. So what's the book about?I suspect everyone knows, more or less, what the novel is about: a bullied girl with psychokinetic powers seeks and finds revenge. Now, to the good stuff.The book is written in several voices: there's the classic third person narrative focused on characters, but there are also a number of excerpts from various sources, such as books, written by researchers or witness of the \\"Carrie White Event\\", inscriptions found on walls or in notebooks, Q&A; from trials, and etc. This is very interesting because you get several points of view, all with their own style and focus, and it keeps the prose dynamic, as none of these things is sufficiently long to bore you.The writing is good, apart from minor editing flaws (such as redundant adverbs - -ly words - and repetition of the exact same word, usually an adverb, in two sentences, back to back, and a few typos, \\"valuting\\" instead of \\"vaulting\\" and such). I understand why King had some reserves about his first (published) novel, but don't be afraid, it's really minor and unless you're very critical of writing, you may not even notice.The novel touched me on a personal level because I have always hated bullying with a passion, having witnessed far too much of it. The 1999 introduction to the book, by King himself, lets you know that he too was a witness to school horrors of the sort.The narrative isn't strictly linear, meaning you go back and forth (but not much, never so much as to disorient the reader) and that's a good technique because you get given hints about the \\"future\\", yet don't know enough to actually guess what will unfold. King wrote the novel in 1973-4, but in the book you'll find references to books from 1982, relating events from 1979 (in the future, at the time of King's writing). I found it really enjoyable to move from a point of view to another, and from a time period to another. This is done seamlessly.In conclusion, this is a good novel. The true horror of it, I found, was that bullied children, in our world, do not have super powers to defend themselves. *Carrie* seems to herald the advent of school-shooting; what psychokinesis fails to do in our world, guns will do."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I was introduced to the mind of Stephen King in an odder way than most. I was on a school bus, 8th grade or so. And there was a new kid going to our school. I introduced myself. \\"Hi, my name is Carrie.\\" And he just looked at me for a few seconds. Then he said, \\"Is your mom into horror?\\" I had no idea what he meant, and so I asked my mom. She pulled a book off my dad's bookshelf (the cover almost worn away) and handed me Stephen King's Carrie. \\"It has nothing to do with you,\\" she said. But she was wrong.Though it was an awkward introduction, reading Carrie was one of several critical inspirations that made me an avid reader and author myself. It's just one of those books that pulls you away into a different world. If you have any imagination at all, you have probably wondered what it would be like if only you could do things just by thinking them. What awesome power would such a gift provide?King selects telekinesis as the subject for his first novel. And he chooses an unlikely girl for this gift. Carrie is not powerful. She isn't even cool. She is an outcast with a secret she is afraid to use. Bullied at school and tormented by a religious fanatic mother at home, Carrie tries to find her place in a world that seems always to be closed to her. She hides her ability to do things just by thinking about them, until fitting in becomes too hard. Though the supernatural powers in the novel are frightening, the story's darkest heart rests in small town secrets, dysfunctional family life and the everyday cruelties we are all willing to do to each other. By the time the reader follows Carrie to its explosive and bloody conclusion, it's hard not to wish for her sweet revenge. Who of us has not wanted to show \\"them\\" they shouldn't have done that?The writing, as always is exceptional. And King's ability to get into the heart and mind of his characters is readily on display, even in this earliest work. The pacing and suspense are slightly different than in later novels where King truly hits his stride, but Carrie remains a fascinating read that will grip you long after you put it down.Carrie SaloAuthor of the Supernatural Thriller - The Sounding"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This review refers to the Unabridged Audio edition(CD-Simon and Schuster) of \\"Carrie\\" by Stephen King...Other than her creator, Stephen King, can you think of anyone better suited to get into the head of Carrie White than Carrie herself?

The plot centers around a young girl Carrie, and her struggle to fit into high school due to her extremely religious mother. Due to the movie's iconic images, I'm sure most people will know what's going to happen before even picking up the book. Still, it is an entertaining and worthwhile read.My one complaint is that King writes in a journalistic fashion (including interviews, pages from other \\"made-up\\" books) to build the whole story about what happens to Carrie. The style (which King borrows from Bram Stoker's Dracula according to his introduction for Carrie) detached me from the story--it focused on POVs from side characters that weren't interesting. It also lessened the impact of some of the novel's suprises and twists. However, the book is worth checking out and much shorter than King's later and sometimes overbloated novels."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The book \\"Carrie\\" is a rip-roaring venture full of shocking surprises around every corner. Just prepare for some unexpected curveballs thrown your way. You couldn't expect anything less from Stephen King. This author is known for his strange and abnormal story lines.Carrietta White, more commonly known as Carrie or that freaky girl, is a miscalculated seventeen-year old that has no friends and is the target for all bullies. But that's not the only problems she has. Her mother, Margaret White, has one ethic and that is Christianity. Most may say her methods are a little over the top and pretty twisted. Almost everything is seen as a sin in Ms. White's eyes and if Carrie \\"sins\\" no good can result from it. Nothing ordinary comes from the White household; just ask the neighbors. They've seen some bizarre phenonmenons coming out of that eerie home.Because of everything Carrie undergoes, she is full of vengence. Though, part of her still longs for love. Unfortunately, the evil overcomes the good and Carrie must have sweet revenge. What will come from this ill will? \\"Make a date with terror and live the nightmare that is Carrie.\\"When you read this novel, you will come to find that it is extremely difficult to put down.

This book will keep you intensely reading all the way to the last page. You will learn to love the famous novel, \\"Carrie.\\""},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15, and a freshman in highschool. My closeness in age to Carrie made her situations all the more real to me. I loved all the details King provided...the school locker room, Carrie's house, her clothes, the way her body looked, even the painfully intimate details about her period. I guess all the little facts and detailed descriptions made me feel as if I had a bond with her somehow.This book also made me a little nostalgic for the 70's. Not having lived throught that decade, I really enjoyed the 70's teenage culture and references. I wasn't too keen on King's use of newspaper articles, however...I would have preferred narration...but nevertheless it was an interesting way to reveal background information.Even though I've read this book countless times now, I still have the feeling of being so utterly powerless as it progresses. I wish I could intervene and stop Chris and Billy's plan...but the tragic ending is always inevitable."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"So here it is. Stephen king's first book that he had published. This wasn't my first reading of stephen king. I had read INSOMNIA previously before reading this one.Carrie is a blend of life, adolecent behavior, in crowds, blood, blood, and more blood. There seems to be an empahses on the blood.I admit that the only reaction that I had in me, when I first read the book, was that of disturbing shock. I won't spoil anything here but there are many moments of 'ew' and 'I can believe that person did that' moments.I was intrigued as to why stephen king used interviews and articles in his story. They were fictional but it did give the story a weight in truth. Clever gimmick, Mr. King.I guess the book could be labeled as a tragedy. So, read it only if your are in the mood to be really down."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book is an almost disturbing in the showing the agony of the hatred and insanity some people are forced to endure. Steven King uses such imagery and brutal realism that makes you feel so deeply sorry for Carrie White's life. He describes events that show how truly hateful and vindictive teenage girls can be. King plays upon emotions when describing the extremes and bazaar events that went on in the White's household. Throughout the story King would use flashbacks to the night of the accident and the events of Carrie's life that lead up to it. He also used the testimonies of modern time people to help create a picture of what happened and how many people were affected by the life of Carrie White existence. I really enjoy Steven King's writing style. I think his techniques and ways of writing keep you interested and nose down in the book. I think that this book should be for teenagers maybe over 15. There is some gruesome and more mature subjects. Overall I think that Carrie was a good horror book, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen King has, as with many of his books, created a chilling, suspenseful tale with Carrie. This is an exceptional read about a victimized, misunderstood, and sheltered high-school girl named Carrie who is eventually pushed too far. I found the method of writing to be very personal, haunting, and forthright which allows the reader to become connected with the pain Carrie endures. The feature that really draws me to this book is its believable plot. The only aspect that the reader may question is Carrie's telekinetic powers. However, scientific back-up of telekinesis is provided throughout the story. With this, I tended to find the plot more believable, which always makes a horror novel more chilling to me. Though it was short, I found Carrie to meet the expectations of any great horror novel. Carrie is a classic, fun and chilling novel that I would recommend to any fan of horror."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Raised by a religious fanatic mother, Carrie White had been teased and tormented by her classmates for years. She tried to fit in, quietly rebelling against her mother when she could, but her classmates are unforgiving. Things get worse when Carrie gets her period for the very first time at age 17, and not knowing what is going on, thinks she is bleeding to death. Carrie is dealing with the humiliation of that incident, plus the discovery that she has the ability to make things move simply by looking at them, when Tommy Ross asks her to the Senior Prom. Carrie begins to think that she might finally fit in with her classmates, unaware that two of them are planning on playing a nasty prank at the Prom. Little do they realized that that prank would unleash Carrie's powers causing destruction her town may never recover from.Written over 30 years ago, Stephen King's first novel still has the power to scare readers. He captures the high school years perfectly and anyone who wasn't part of the \\"in\\" crowd (and perhaps those that were) will emphasize with Carrie. King has said that he didn't particularly care for the character Carrie, but I found her to be a sympathetic character. King, in fact, makes her especially sympathetic when describing her home life with her nutcase of a mother and her inner thoughts and feelings. Sue Snell and Tommy Ross are likable characters, if a bit unbelievable (King tries hard to make it work, but Sue's reasons for having Tommy invite Carrie to the prom, and Tommy's acceptance of those reasons never quite ring true). Chris Hargenson and Billy Nolan are nasty villains and deserve what happens to them.King uses an interesting technique in this novel. \\"Carrie\\" book is divided into three parts: Blood Sport, Prom Night, and Wreckage. Blood Sport is an apt title as there are images of blood throughout the book; even Carrie's prom dress is red. There are no chapters, instead King intersperses fictional newspaper and magazine articles, fictional excerpts from books written about Carrie, letters, and interviews with survivors and others who knew Carrie along with the action as it unfolds. King is not a subtle author, he employs lots of foreshadowing throughout the book, and he makes it clear from the beginning that most people will not survive Carrie's wrath. As in may of King's books, there are a few problems with the editing - the spelling of the name of Carrie's high school changes, and, although her father died before she was born, at one point King has him alive when she was a young baby. Fortunately, these minor inconsistencies do not detract from the story.This is a quick read, but an exciting thriller."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"\\"Carrie\\" is always marketed as a horror story, but its main appeal is almost sociological. The telekenesis comes into effect when Carrie feels very upset or angry; it is really a story of a poor, young girl, who is bullied at school and at home and becomes unbearably upset at times. The 659 [if I remember right] who die in the book gives a feeling of, \\"Couldn't all this have been prevented?\\" The ending is pretty bleak. I have to keep reminding myself that this is a Stephen King book, as his books usually have something upbeat to finish on [\\"Pet Sematary\\" is another exception]. As far as horror goes, this is pretty serious.I love this to bits and I am a 20 year old male. I have had similar experiences to Carrie in some respects [obviously not in terms of menstruation!]. People who have been bullied throughout school like this better than others, I have found. I have also noticed that Popular people from school [which I can't help writing with a bit of resentment still] find it harder to sympathise with the girl."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As much as I love Stephen King (and I do) I'd never read Carrie. Perhaps figuring it wouldn't hold up toBrian De Palma's masterful film version. I picked up Carrie as part of a Stephen King reading group I joined. I'm glad I did.Carrie is a lean and mean tragic thriller. The structure of the story is most likely already known to most people: Social misfit Carrie White is a pariah at school and has a very dysfunctional home life with a domineering mother. A surprise invitation to the prom leads to tragedy.However, even knowing the story the book was very much worth my time. Even here in his first published novel, Stephen King is a masterful storyteller. The novel uses a semi-epistolary form with King's narrative broken up with sections containing excerpts from government reports (The White Commission), bits of testimony, song lyrics and even graffiti scrawled on desks. His characters are very well drawn (as is usual for Stephen King) and his narrative draws you in and keeps you wanting to turn the pages.I found the book very enjoyable and well worth my time. I only wish I hadn't put of reading it for so long."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"In 1974 Stephen King an impoverished high school English teacher, so poor that he couldn't even afford a telephone; when CARRIE was accepted for publication by Doubleday he received the news via telegram. The book received mixed reviews and the hardback printing sold less than thirteen thousand copies--but when it went to paperback in 1975 CARRIE became a publisher's dream, selling over a million copies in the first year alone.The core story of a person possessed of unexpected powers who takes revenge on tormenters was not new, but King gave it an unexpected and remarkably insightful twist: he stripped it of supernatural overtones and set his tale in the hot-house and hormone-driven world of high school, where a herd mentality leads students to bully and torment any student who seems outside the norm. And Carrie White is very much outside the norm: unattractive, not particularly smart, and the daughter of a highly neurotic and abusive mother whose religious hysteria has warped both Carrie and herself.When a particularly nasty episode of taunting occurs during gym class, Carrie comes to the full attention of gym teacher Miss Desjardin, who punishes the other girls involved with a lecture and a series of after school phys-ed detentions. One of the students, Sue Snell, is both embarassed and ashamed of her participation in the incident and resolves to make it up to Carrie: she has her boyfriend, Tommy, take Carrie to the prom. Another student, Chris Hargensen, refuses detention and is barred from the prom--and decides to make use of Sue's kindly gesture to exact revenge: she creates a truly hideous prank designed to complete Carrie's humiliation for once and all.What neither girl, nor any one else, knows is that Carrie has discovered she has the ability to move objects at will: she is telekinetic, a gift she herself has only recently discovered. When Chris' prank is indeed successful, Carrie's powers emerge full-force and she turns on her tormenters, both real and imagined, turning the prom into a holocaust and continuing on to lay waste to much of the town.Although he has created a number of exceptionally well-written novels, with 'SALEM'S LOT perhaps the most obvious example, Stephen King is not a literary writer per se, and this early work has more than its share of awkwardnesses. But there is no denying its power: CARRIE has a direct and very raw power that remains chilling more than a quarter of century after it was first published: dark, furious, visceral. It is a fast and very compelling read, a novel you pick up and then do not set aside until, exhausted, you reach the final page.It also taps into something that we now see on in our newspaper headlines with depressing regularity: a growing wave of school violence. Over the years there had been a number of attacks on public schools, with perhaps the most infamous being the 1927 Bath School bombing, but such incidents were extremely rare and usually involved a disgruntled adult as culprit... until the 1980s and 1990s, when they became and sadly remain shockingly commonplace, with the 1999 Columbine massacre simply one of the most notorious of recent memory.King could not foresee the future, could not know that such real life horrors were in the offing--but, as he indicates in a forward to the current edition of the book, he well recalled the pack mentality of school children and their cruelty to any one they considered an outsider. It is also worth noting that he was himself a high school teacher at the time he wrote the novel, and he was doubtlessly aware of the viciousness of high school bullies from an adult standpoint as well. In creating CARRIE, he seems to have tapped into the underlying rage that would explode at Columbine, Redlake, and too many other schools to count.It is not surprising, therefore, that CARRIE's dark tale of high school brutality and horrific revenge makes it a novel frequently banned from public school libraries. But this may actually be a mistake. Although the details of the story are the stuff of fantasy, CARRIE contains a warning: even a mouse will attack if it feels cornered, and where the hyper-intense emotions of adolescents are concerned, that attack can be horrific indeed. It is a lesson, sadly, that our teenagers have been very slow to learn.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"A girl is terrorised by her completely insane whackjob fundamentalist mother.

As a reclusive nerd type at an American high school she is not treated too well.When a prom night very cruel psychological and physical prank combination traumatises her, she has finally had enough."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Better than Brian DePalma's hit movie was the book that spawned it, Carrie, a worthy debut novel from the man who would become the top-selling novelist in (at least) American history. It's easy to explain why King has become so popular. Here, he begins a long tradition of believeable, relatable characters living in relatively normal places that have horrific, impossible situations cast upon them.Without her powers of telekenesis, Carrie would be simply that invisible girl with no friends, no hope, ridiculed at school, berated and abused by an ultra-religious freakshow at home. In writing her, King not only sets up a modern fable of revenge, he also lashes out against teenage bullying, religious fanaticism, the powerlessness of ordinary, well-meaning authority, and the hell that is adolescence. After that, the supernatural is simply window dressing, a device meant to amplify what we already fear about ourselves as people.I should say here, too, that the best way to experience this book (although a simple reading will do ya just fine) is to have the miraculous Sissy Spacek (yes, the same actress from the inferior, dated film) read it to you on the audio book. The effect is simply astounding.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: a Horror Fantasy\\".)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Like many, I unfortunately saw the movie before reading the book so there were expectations. Although most movie adaptions of King's work are not true to the source material, \\"Carrie\\" is an exception. The plot plays out pretty much like the movie (except for the ending), but it's still worth reading. The reason is that the book more effectively gets inside of the heads of the characters and you're left with a better understanding of the situation and feel more sympathy (or anger) towards the characters. This is naturally easier in this medium than in movies and King accomplishes this. Carrie is not a villian but a distraught teenage girl who has to deal with the typical problems of adolescence in addition to a borderline-psychotic hyper-religious mother. Oh, and she paranormal powers. The book does an excellent job at describing her tormented life and the odd behaviour of her mother. Motivations are better understood than in the movie and it's much easier to feel sympathy towards Carrie. Although most people think of the ending scenes when they hear of \\"Carrie\\", the build-up is the best part. Her and her mother make up a very twisted family. Their dysfunctionallity is fascinating and Carrie's demons will undoubtedly evoke sympathy, if not a little bit of empathy.The book is barely a horror novel. The perpetrator of the supernatural crimes is presented in a sympathetic fashion and there is no monster except for the mother and Carrie's peers. Instead of being horrified, I was honestly pleased with Carrie's reaction. The supernatural elements could have been removed and not much would have been lost. For this reason, I would even recommend this novel to those who don't normally enjoy horror and fantasy."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I LOVE this movie, but I had no idea that the book could be even better! The book follows pretty close with the movie, but the book holds so many more details about all the little things you wonder about when watching the movie. The book provides a lot more detail about Carrie's childhood, and her mother. It also goes into more details about the disaster that Carrie causes. Great Book!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I wonder if this book was Stephen King's only as well as his first published novel, would he be remembered at all today? Possibly he'd be a footnote, known to trivia buffs as the man who wrote the novel on which the mid-seventies Brian De Palma mega-hit movie version of Carrie was based. But the fact is this was just King's starting point and thirty years of great work has followed. Carrie was the one that started it all, and for that reason it deserves to be read, but as for its own merits, well, I dunno, I just never quite warmed to this disturbing little book, and read it only after I'd put a dozen other King books behind me. But to each her own."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"King created a world where you believe in the possiblity of people like Carrie White.

It is about a girl named Carrie who has telekinetic powers (it means she can move things with her mind) and is techincally she is a loner. Her mom is a fanatical religious person who makes Carrie pray for every sin she has done. Everyone in the book in the story seems to hate her for some reason and in other words, she is a prisoner in her own home. It is a great thriller in suspense and terror and death too. I feel sad for Carrie for all the things she went through her life, but your WILL feel sorry for everyone else at the end."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I thought Carrie was a pretty good book.It was a bit slow in the beginning, but the climax was good.This book would have been better, if there was more action in the beginning.

I think that this book wasn't the best book I ever read, but I found that I was looking forward to reading a couple more pages in this book whenever I could. I think that I liked reading this book for a couple reasons, but the only one that I can think of right off the top of my head, would be because of how it was written, with a certin flare, it was written with energy, and that energy rubbed off while reading this book. I recomendit to friends, and I recomend it to you."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I was still interested in Barbie when Stephen King made his impromptu visit to Virginia Beach, VA. Now I sometimes regret that I was born that late; I would never be able to tell Stephen King about my love and affection for this novel unless I drive 10-20 hrs in my mom's car. He has a knack for depicting those growing pains and then twisting them into the grotesque and arabesque like no one else. I've read his other novels, and aside from the &quot;Different Seasons&quot; collection, I haven't read anything else of his emotionally up to par as &quot;Carrie&quot;. The problem with a lot of horror stories these days is the pyrotechnics: you get all these cool little knick-knacks of boggey-boogey tricks that substitute a real story with real characters (Witness the R.L. Stine explosion and its sister satellites). You also get a lack of sympathy: we can't care about these characters who run for their lives if they're callow, shallow creatures. Not so with &quot;Carrie&quot;; she made me sympathise and care about her problems: the tormentors at school (who also have tormentors of their own), the Tormentor at home and her Tormentor, and finally the Tormentor in her mind. We get a glimmer of hope in one point of her story only to be shattered by a tragedy...which unleashes another tragedy after another. Although, it isn't &quot;physically&quot; scary (there isn't all that much gore compared to his other novels), there is a nervous tic about the novel--the calm before the storm, the whimper before a bang, something that makes &quot;Carrie&quot; more eerily sad instead of crudely &quot;scary&quot;. Carrie is the Cinderella, taking care of her evil Stepsisters and RealMother. Sue is the Fairy Godmother whose good intentions went awry and Tom was the hapless Prince. The ending, neither tidy nor happy, left me feeling both horrified and heartbreaking. How about that.

I saw the movie first, and I rushed right out and bought the book when I was fifteen. And two years ago I gave a speech in my college communications class on why &quot;Carrie&quot; was my favorite book. This book is a god-send to anyone who had to take crap from the kids in school (like me) How many times have we all fantasized about reigning down a fiery death on those who have humiliated us.

There are some good and bad points of the book, but most are good. When I read this book, I was on the edge of my seat most of the time. There were many outrageous and frightening parts of the book, especially when Carrie locked everyone in the gym, and you knew that everyone in there was going to die. I also liked how King portrayed the beliefs of Carrie's mother through her actions, such as locking Carrie in the closet to pray. This shows how Carrie came to be so evil. The only part that I didn't find that great was the resolution of the book, I had to read it twice to figure out what was happening. King was a bit vague on the ending.

Of course, it's not that simple and it's a tribute to King that there's still a lot to enjoy in a story where I pretty much knew the plot step by step thanks to watching the movie beforehand.Still, it's really best to concentrate on what's good here, because the only real flaw of the story is that I knew it already. And that's not really anyone's fault but my own. First off, it's easy to read, made up of first-hand experiences of the various survivors of the Carrie White experience, which we are told through retrospective newspaper articles has become somewhat of a legend. Thankfully this doesn't make the book appear disjointed, but has the effect of leaving the reader on a cliffhanger every now and then as we get to see the experience of 'Prom Night' from various people's perspectives, not just Carrie's. Also, surprisingly, King does offer sympathy to all of his characters and is mercifully unsparing with his unflattering description of Carrie and plump and covered with pimples. This isn't a romantic tale of revenge but one of horror after all. If some of the scenes have lost their potency - I couldn't help but feel that the much-hyped shower scene of the movie at the beginning of the book would have had more of an impact at the time of writing.The bottom line really is that for anyone who hasn't seen the movie and doesn't know the plot off by heart this is a really great and highly original book. It's just such a shame that the movie is so famous, and such a landmark in the horror field, that the book might seem to some to be redundant. Well it isn't, there are plenty of surprises, and it's a very enjoyable book with very well mounted tension and fantastic characterisation. But it's impossible to view it from an objective status if you've seen the film."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I found this book chilling and haunting. Overall, and awesome book! I think everyone who reads it will like it, and even if you don't, it's not a book that would have taken up a whole lot of your time."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is a very good book about a girl named Carrie White who is constantly teased by her peers and mistreated by her mother. Her mother makes her beg forgiveness from God in a small closet over very insignificant things like having a first period. But, when she is invited to go to the prom with the most popular guy in the school, things go horribly wrong. I would reccomend this book to anyone who liked &quot;The Shining&quot; or &quot;It&quot;."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Okay, I actually thought this wasn't scary. I found it a good read because I like reading about school rejects, and I like reading Stephen King. This is about a school reject with telekinisis and a super-religious mother. The ending is quite good though it didn't scare me a bit... now It... that was scary. Being that I'm a ten year old and that clown likes to eat children. By the way my name is Kelly."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I once read that Stephen King actually threw out the manuscript of Carrie, and that his wife, Tabatha, retrieved from the trash and mailed it to a publisher, and the rest is history. Had she not done this, the world would be deprived of a great novel. 'Carrie' is different. The entire book is written from many peoples' perspectives, which gives the reader many points of view. Not only is this unique, but the reader gets an unbiased view of the story. Excellent suspense and unique writing make 'Carrie' a winner."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Movie was much better, read the book first."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"It seems that Stephen King was following some sort of Template when writing this book. Because this book is so bare, so naked, so &quot;should've-been-longer&quot; that I'm surprised that it got so famous.I won't go into plot details because it's been gone over and over in all the other reviews. The book is divided in three parts. The shower room and it's consequences, before the prom and after the prom.The book starts at a breakneck speed with the shower room scene and slows down to a screeching halt afterwards. The pace only picks up when Carrie and her mother are on scene.King wrote this book in a very interesting manner. He put up fictional newspaper and book articles on the story. Without them the book would be even shorter.IT seemed to me that King should've elaborated more on Carrie's past. The other pranks the kids put on her.Without the prom scene (Which is described to perfection) this book would've been a two star book at best. It literally saves this book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have read many Stephen King books and when I read this one I automatically labeled it as his best. It was short but fast paced. The main character was portrayed with a lot of detail instead of a few vague references. Every character was shown in this manner. This book shows the horrible reality of how people are sometimes treated. This book was his first and his best. Though his others are great in their own ways.Was this review helpful to you?"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I tried to read King's first novel years ago and just couldn't for some reason. I have no idea why. After reading The Shining, however, I thought I'd give it a try again and am very glad I did. The Shining was very good but I was a bit disappointed that some of the key scenes from the original movie wasn't in it. (that's Hollywood for you.) Not so with Carrie. That movie gave me the creeps as a kid and so did the book at 25! It's a fast read (200 pages) and jam packed full of action and suspense. The best part of this book by far is the character development. I felt so....bad is the only word I can think of....for Carrie in the end. The book really makes you understand and feel sorry for what she has had to endure throughout her short life. I'm not a very emotional person, but that just about made me tear up a little. That's what I look for in anything (books, movies, music, art)....some kind of emotion, whatever it may be. This one touches a few: it makes you very sad, at times mad, horrified, and scared. I've heard a rumor that King actually threw this book away after writing it and his wife retrieved it and made him send it in. If it's true, the entertainment world as we know it owes a great thanks to Tabitha King. Could you imagine a world that never had a Stephen King? Scary."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is the first Stephen King book I came across and the first I've read. Therefore I knew I wasn't going to allow myself to expect much. As a horror book, it wasn't the best I was going to come across-it hardly made me flinch. But as a book in itself, it was a very worthwhile read. The book could be described as-eerie, it doesn't get to you while you're reading the story but after you put it down it will keep taunting you. The lives of those described in the book will roam around you head for days afterwards and it will make you think very deeply about the society we all live in and the frame it causes us to be trapped within.Carrietta White has very religious parents. Infact they are fanatics of a whole religious illuminati. At a young age, the two meet in a religious ceremony and after becoming suspicious that there is a conspiracy going on in the church-they flee and get married. Unfortunately, after bearing Carrietta-both parents see her as a great misfortune for their betrayal to God after having a sexual intercourse. Carrietta's father, Ralph White dies before her daughter is born when a steel girder fell out of a carrying sling on a housing-project job in Portland. When Carietta is born, she is born a beautiful little girl to her mother's extensive disgust. Therefore she doesn't let her daughter go outside too often or let's her any freedom. As Carrie grows older she shrivels under her mother's unwillingness to love her and she feels in whole, deprived because of her mother's near-fanatical fundamentalist religious beliefs. By the time Carrie leaves for school it is all shown by her appearance. A girl with such lovely looks is covered over by an ugliness so dispicable that people tense at the showing of her face. She tries desperately to fit in to a world that turns away from her repetetively but she must stay in the religious border her mother has created for her.What the story and news articles that has a main role in moving the story proves is that Carrie has Telekinesis, TK. It is the ability to move objects by effort of the will alone in situations of extreme personal stress. Unfortunately, the book talks about how such a wonderful posession becomes a horrifying scream at life-of her fellow schoolmates and of Carrie's own.Sue Snell is another character who takes up a similar role in the story as the news articles do, she talks in her book about the whole event about how deeply she felt for Carrie White. She manages to dig out most of the personalities that are presented in Carrie and how social difficulties pull out Carrie's strange ability in deadly ways, ways that could have been prevented but unfortunately ends in the destruction of a quiet town.It's a very good book for those who want a lighter Stephen King read or those who are teens. It is also a valid read for those who are looking for a Stephen King book and haven't read any of his books as of yet."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I Think that seeing the movie first kind of ruined the book for me but anyway I love the book because it gives soo much more detail then the movie did. This is my first Stephen King book and I think I will be reading a lot more after I finsh Carrie."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is King's debut novel and it is one of his best. Written during a period in which he was personally struggling, it displays that struggle in the character of Carrie. That's what I like about it."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Since it has been nearly 20 years since I read many of Stephen King's books, I thought that it was probably time to start going back and re-reading some of them. I decided to start in chronological order with Carrie. Carrie is the story of an awkward teen that has been continually picked on her entire life and finally takes her revenge upon the world using long-dormant powers. In a sick sort of way you kind of root for her to take the entire town out. At any rate it is one of Stephen King's best stories with enough pulse-pounding anxiety to make you want to read the entire story in one sitting. Thankfully it is really short and you can easily burn through it in a few hours. A true masterpiece from the master of horror."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This may shock people, but I've never actually read a work by Stephen King before now, even though I've heard of him. With Carrie though, intrigue outweighed my fear of horror and I was eagar to know, well, what made this book a classic.I was hooked from the begining of the book, and I loved every aspect, from the narrative style to the characterisations. But if you're looking for horror, well, I didn't feel scared at all. In fact, I thought of it more as a psychological study than a horror story, with its predominant themes of bullying and a twisted bildunsroman story/ending.A more detailed review can be found at: [...]"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I love that expression so much. What a classic! Some of King's recent books, err, many of King's recent books have been carp, but when he was in great form back in the day, he could scare the pants off me. Carrie was absolutely among them, and having just read it again for the first time in, what, two decades?, it was still a great read. As I said, what a classic!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I read Carrie many many years ago and just recently I decided to reread Stephen King from the beginning. Of course, this was the first published so this was the first one I read. This book still kept me up in the middle of the night reading, it gave me very weird dreams, and when I finished it, I still felt like I had just finished a work of genius. This book is very scary, very bloody, but it kind of reads like nonfiction, which to me makes it even more scary. I love this book, and I highly recommend it to all my customers."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Absolutely loved the description in the book. The story was slow in some parts and the style was much different than King's later books, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I can't speak rationally about KING, the Master, he's such a SPLENDID writer!...he's written some bombs (Cujo), but most of his work is exceptional and this Young Adult novel was written before they were called that and it's just terrific. People don't change from era to era. There's always going to be good people, bad people and a whole boatload of in-between. King showcases this beautifully in his first novel. Wonderful. Real. Poignant and tragic."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"We all see the terrifying results of school bullying. Stephen King takes reality and adds a fiction twist to it. What if a misfit teenage girl had telekinetic powers? Carrie is one of his best works, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I believe this was King's first published novel. I know this was the one that started his career.I've read this book twice. The second time around, it was like reading it the first time again. It's interesting, engaging, full of believable characters, and has a killer plot/theme as its base. I have not read a lot of King's books, but this IS a good one. Way better than the movie, in my opinion; though nothing beats 'The Stand', even though it is over 1000 pages."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"\\"If only it would be today and Jesus coming not with a lamb and a shepherd's crook, but with a boulder in each hand to crush the laughers and the snickerers, to root out the evil and destroy it screaming - a terrible Jesus of blood and righteousness.And if only she could be His sword and His arm.\\"Everyone has, no doubt, heard of Stephen King and his first work, Carrie, and yet it is paradoxically easy to distance oneself from the giants in the field. After a point, it's easier to think of everyone on the subway holding a newly released copy of Under the Dome than it is to remember the realities of King's writing. When I began Carrie, my first King novel in two or so years, I was immediately reminded of all the reasons that I read twenty of his novels in a period of just under three months. By the time I finished Carrie, I also remembered the annoying aspects of King's writing that are just as much a part of his style as the positive parts.Carrie is a mercilessly mocked misfit that comes to embody supernatural revenge through her latent telekinetic powers. The structure of the story is built entirely around a single massive set piece. The events are deserving of the focus lavished on them, but the extensive early foreshadowing serves to dampen any sort of surprise. The novel is told through an untold number of viewpoints, both pseudo-nonfiction and a standard third person. This cornucopia of perspectives leads to both great and terrible things. On the upside, we come to sympathize with (almost) every side of the equation, and therein lies the novel's greatest strength. On the downside, the pacing of the book is often slowed down at critical moments. Learning about a man running terrified as he's pursued by what feels like every demon of hell personified in an endlessly wronged schoolgirl? Awesome. Learning about sixty of them for every street that Carrie crosses? Not so much.The strength of the novel comes from the characters, and the star of the cast is, of course, Carrie White. The number of truly innocent characters in fiction is fairly low, but Carrie is without a doubt one of them. She is both nave and cynical, both pitiable and, by the end, reprehensible. In her character, King has taken a phenomenon as common as anything else in the world - the outsider, mocked by the whole for being different - and turned it into a tragedy as personal and as unjust as any global atrocity.Of the other characters, most manage to come to life through their dilemmas and problems. Undoubtedly the greatest of the secondary characters is Sue Snell, who tries to right the wrongs done to Carrie. Of course, she's far from black and white. She was there along with everyone else, taunting Carrie, and only now does she feel the cruelty of what she did. Often, it's impossible to tell whether her actions are motivated by a newly found compassion, or whether they're merely empathy in the guise of selfishness. And it's not just that we don't know, the character doesn't either, and she admits it.The only character that really falls flat is Carrie's mother, Margaret White. For the first, but certainly not the last, time in his career, Stephen King investigates religion, this time in the guise of Margret's zealotry. Unfortunately, this is probably his worst treatment of it. The early glimpses of her views are disturbing, but you soon come to the realization that there isn't much under the surface, and some of the more outrageous aspects make the entire affair seem kind of silly. Dirtypillows, for instance, are just not a very frightening, nor realistic, term for breasts. I mean, fine, sexuality's evil, but I just have trouble conceiving of the sheer act of puberty being sinful.King's prose in Carrie is similar to his writing throughout his career: down to earth and easy to follow. It's easy to imagine these events taking place in some nearby small town, and King's diction is a definite part of that. His writing feels like the raw speech of the average man and as such conveys a sense of time and place like few others are able to. The most interesting element in it here is his conveying of thoughts - often contradictory to the majority of the prose - in parenthesis, such as:\\"Carrie tried to swallow an obstruction and only(i am not afraid o yes i am)got rid of part of it.\\"Carrie isn't flawless, but its successes - primarily the characterization of Carrie White - are so powerful that you'll be haunted for days to come. Without the faintest aura of pretension, Stephen King manages to show the reader something about the consequences of their actions on others. Highly recommended, if you're in the mood for a bleak novel that may just show you some things about yourself and your interactions that you didn't wholly realize."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"There has to be an outcast like Carrie White in just about every high school in America. I think that is why people can relate to this story. Not just because everyone knows such a misfit, but because at one time or another, everyone has had to deal with helplessness, ridicule or cruelty.The book also deals with a girl becoming a woman and defying the wishes of her fanatically religious mother. By incorporating religion into the story, King is able to cast Carrie's telekinetic power as seemingly demonic while allowing the reader to feel genuine pity for Carrie.While Carrie is able to extract a measure of vegeance, this is ultimately a story of tragedy. It is a lesson in the cliques and cruelties of high school and lends particular insight into the heights of human goodness and the depth of human evil. If this story is even remotely similar to what the world of girls is like, I have to thank G-d that I'm a man.This is a great classic horror novel not to be passed over!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie was the first book I have ever read by Stephen King. It is a great horror story about a girl who basicly gets back at her enemies. Carrie has been tricked and tourched. She has a freak mom and sooner or later it all comes to an end. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes books about getting revenge, Likes Stephen King books, or someone who has never read Stephen King. It is a great first selection!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I loved this book. It was the first Stephen King book I ever read, and because of it i suddenly fell in love with his writing.This novel is about a young girl named Carrie White, who is faced with the everyday challange of trying to fit in. But when the Prom Night arrives for all the kids in Carrie's middle school, and when Carrie gets persuaded into going, hell is to pay when Christine Hargenson plays her grande finale joke!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"It's difficult to write something new about this book, so much has been written before. Aside from short stories this is one of easiest stories King has written, it's brief and to the point. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"In 1974, a struggling reading teacher and aspiring part-time author named Stephen King published his first and most integral novel in his career, because it let him write full-time and it devoloped one of the best fiction writers of the 20th century, and the name of that novel was Carrie. Originally written as a short story, King was for no apparent reason disgusted with Carrie and threw it away. And thankfully King's wife Tabitha later found the story and read it in one sitting, and in realizing its genuis she almost forced him to publish it. After publishing it, Stephen King was immediately offered a staggering 400,000 dollar movie deal, of which King kept half. And of course this put King into the spotlight and as an author to look out for, and it allowed him to write full-time. Carrie the movie devoloped into one of the most memorable horror movies of the 70's, equally competing with the likes of The Exorsist and Rosemary's Baby. Carrie is a novel that deals with the troubles of high school, teen anxiety, and a certain bucket of pig blood. Here's an overview of Carrie:Story: As the novel opens, we meet humble Carrie White, who battles constantly with being an outcast and dealing with her mother's extreme religious beliefs. After an unfortunate hazing accident in the locker's showers, caused by fellow classmates Chris Hargensed and Sue Snell, Carrie begins to hate her classmates and even more her mother, who is the prime example of a way overprotective mother. Carrie then takes a week off and begins to discover powers she barely knew she had, a kind of telekinesis that is passed down through generations and allows the user the all-powerful ability to distort objects to her will just by thinking. During her break, Sue Snell and Chris Hargensen are punished by having to go to a session of detention, and if they refuse to go, the school will withhold their prom tickets. Sue Snell, filling pity for Carrie and deeply sorry for what she's done, agrees to the detention, while the school miscreant Chris Hargensen refuses her detention, and is of course disallowed to the all-important prom. Sue still feeling sorry for Carrie makes her boyfriend(School Heartthrob,yada yada) Tommy Ross take Carrie to the prom, while Chris makes her boyfriend get a bucket of pig blood and place it above the Prom King and Queen throne, already knowing that Carrie and Tommy will win. Come Prom Night, Carrie is having the time of her life and for the first time in her life she feels accepted, And even more amazing to her, she is crowned Prom Queen. But upon reaching the throne, Chris Hargensen dumps a bucket of pig blood on Carrie. Carrie, enraged and feeling betrayed by her classmates, begins to use her powers to burn down the gym, with her classmates trapped inside, and continues to wreak havoc throughout the entire town, burning it like a dry leaf. And the last person Carrie kills is her mother, and she makes her heart go &quot;Slower and slower&quot; until it reaches a &quot;Full stop&quot;. That night was from then on known as The Black Prom, and over 600 people died.Writing: Although this is the one of the shortest novels Stephen King has written, it is one of his more complex and most thoughtful books to date. He shows what its like to be under the constant control of an unwanted mother and how it can affect somebody. He really makes the reader feel for Carrie, at first pitying for her and then in a macabre sort of way, rooting for her as she gives her classmates what they deserve. King is clever in his use of paragraphs, as he infuses (Fake) news articles, essays, book excerpts, and even a phony death certificate to make the story all the more plausible and use up the space between paragraphs. King's writing is fast-paced and relentless, never taking a break and almost forcing the reader to finish the novel in one sitting(I did). He cleverly uses similes and metaphors in his writing that are at times hilarious or phantasmaghoric. King really lets the reader believe in Telekinesis too, through his use of essays and examples of telekinetic happenings, and you get a tingle out of it. All in all, Stephen King writes Carrie as if he's been doing it all of his life, not his first novel.Carrie is a fast paced thrill-ride from start to finish and I recommend it to everybody."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"...back in 1971, when it was published. Today, in light of the fact that we have \\"The Ring,\\" Freddy vs. Jason,\\" and other scary movies, and \\"Rebecca,\\" \\"Dracula,\\" and other scary books, Carrie loses its horror. I mean... Edgar Allen Poe was considered the scariest writer of his time, and today? Well, I've read his stuff and he still doesn't scare me, but I like him.Anyways... this book doesn't need to be scary. It's good. And I'm sure everyone can relate in some way. I know I can.If you're looking for nightmares, then this is the wrong book. But if you're looking for Stephen King's first classic, his awesome prelude to some 50-odd amazing stories, then this is the book for you. I liked it, and I am an avid fan (and positive critic) of Stephen King. This IS a classic!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I think that this book was very interesting. It kept me wanting to read it and the plot was good. The way the other girls made fun of her and how she got revenge. I loved the ending and I did not see that coming, but I really liked it. I think this book would only be for mature adults and would keep everyone involved in it. I would recommend this book to my friends and family."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I LOVE Stephen King. His writing in incredible, his detail extraordinary and his characters amazing. His novel, 'The Stand,' is the best book I've ever read, and despite it's length, I've read it six times, twice original version, four times uncut.Now, understand, this is not a bad book. It's a good book, really good. But, coming from Stephen King, I found it a dissapointment. It was interesting, and I could sympathize with poor Carrie, and I loved the way the book would change from Carrie's pint of view to Sue's point of view to chapters from fictional books to newspaper clippings and to court interviews. That meant the storytelling was unpredictable and provided the thoughts of lots of different people.So, what's wrong with this book? Well, it's coming from Stephen King. And he's written so many modern classics, and this just fell short of his other great works. This is, of course, understandable, since this was his first published work. And it shows. The characters in this aren't particularly memorable, not even Carrie. I felt bad for her, and all, but she just didn't do enough until the end, and you didn't get in her mind enough. I don't know how to quite say the problem with the story, but when it was over, it just seemed to hallow for the master. He greatly improved with his second book, Salem's Lot. His amazing detail is rather absent in this story.Also, and this is a very rare case for me, I found the movie to be FAR better than the book. The movie was simply amazing, one of the saddest, most tragic things I've ever seen. The music, acting and camera angles all added up to just an amazing work of film. It expanded upon a lot of things from the book and just added so much more character development. Usually, the book-to-movie for King is totally opposite of this, but this is the exception.So, this is a good book but not up to King's high standards. If you've never read a King book, this might make a good start, but i suggest you read it BEFORE seeing the movie because if you do it the other way, you might be dissipointed with the book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"After reading Carrie I can see why it is a Steven King Classic. Carrie demonstrates the amazing description that King is known for, although it can sometimes be overwhelming. the writing style was unique but magnificent.

I have an extremely busy schedule and don't usually have much time to read, but every time I picked this book up, I had a hard time setting it down. Once I started reading, I was anxious to find out what was going to happen next.The main thing that I enjoy about King's work is his descriptions. He always gives you superb descriptions so that you can have a great visual image of the characters and the settings.To anyone who enjoys sci-fi thrillers, I would highly recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"CARRIE is the third novel I've read by Stephen King. The other two are BAG OF BONES and THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. I liked CARRIE the least of all those books, but it was definitely a fast and sacry read. Margaret White, Carrie's mother, was very cruel and entertaining and the newspaper articles and interviews are intriguing and fun to read. CARRIE was also a good book because it wasn't long at all and the dialogue and writing was easy to comprehend. The greatest characters are Sue Snell and Tommy, the best people King ever thought up in his creative head. CARRIE was fine by my entertainment standards!!!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I wasn't into reading all that much. The first book that I read was Carrie. I was very surprised. I liked it very much.

They are voted King and Queen of the Prom and everything is going great until they play a bad trick on her.

I was a little dissapointed, but I guess I was expecting too much."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I just finished reading this book today. It took me a total of a day and a half to read this 253 page book, which is extremely fast for me. This is without a doubt one of the most fast paced and horrifying King books ever written. No wonder this was the book that spawned his great career. This book had great character development and the ending was shocking. I have not seen the movie, so I did not know what to expect when reading this book. I also recommend The Shining, Misery, and Christine by King. Bottom line is...this book is great and fun to read. Take the word from a true King fan. And please...don't ever bully someone weaker than you, it might come back to burn you."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I want to open by stating that I am a 'tried and true' King fan -- I love his novels and shorter fiction (Okay, Tom Gordon is a stretch). Carrie is definately a successful attempt by King to create characters that continually haunt the reader. Margeret White, for example, is a truly psycopathic, terrifying character who literally ruins our heroine, Carrie. We believe the insane, abusive zealotry found in Mrs. White; she neverendingly haunts our imagination, with large upper arms and daddy's bible in hand. Additionally, Carrie is drawn as a character teens and adults find appealing; we empatize with her view of society and its inherent cruelty. Carrie, furthermore, is an unleashed but polluted beauty or a Blakeian 'Sick Rose.' Although King is sucessful in his creation of character, it is the linear and occasionally predicatable plot that detracts from the perfection of the story. The progression from Carrie's womanhood and maturing of her TK power to her all out frustration with momma and the tantalizing teanagers works well, but King's plot/subplot development is not at its peak. Instead, King seems to apply a more creative narrative structure -- a structure of clippings, testimonies, and journals that clearly works well. Carrie is an example of King's earliest success that shows his expertise in riveting character development."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book had me fascinated form the first chapter to the last. During the climax, the vivid images of everything that happened went through my head. It kept me up way past my bedtime (I'm 14) reading it. I couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what would happen next. The best part was undoubtedly the scene between Carrie and her mother which leads to Mother's untimely demise. A must read for anyone who enjoys King or sheer apocalyptic holocaust reigning down on Small Town America."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have read two of Stephen King's books (The Shinning and Carrie) and I'm reading &quot;Desperation&quot; and Carrie is the best of his books yet! &quot;The Shinning&quot; was good but a little too gory. &quot;Carrie&quot; is more freaky and makes you think. I liked &quot;Carrie&quot; because I could relate to her. I was one of the girls that got picked on, not poplar and everything. So, reading this book really made me think. I'm going to see the movie if my dad will let me (hey, I'm only 12). So, read &quot;Carrie&quot;. But, my advice to you, don't read any of his books at night!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie didn't scare me at all. But, how many of us didn't cheer for Carrie when she killed Billy and Chris? The destruction of the town is so vivid, that you can see it. And, for all the hatred we readers bear for Carrie's mother, it's still chilling to read how Carrie killed her. Worth reading. Dirty trick, dirty trick."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I beg to disagree that his work is flawed although SK himself claims it to be too raw. I enjoyed reading the book &amp; watching the movie as well. Carrie is indeed a popular figure &amp; has travelled from generations to generations. &amp; upto these days, I can still clearly remember Carrie/Spacek's naive face. I couldn't wait for Carrie to punish her bully schoolmates for they deserved to be gotten back for all their mischievousness. But kids are kids &amp; so be it. I just wished that Carrie was able to control her powers &amp; punish only the guilty &amp; not the innocent ones. But had it been that way, the ending would have been less tragic, &amp; therefore, would have had a lesser impact."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The Carrie of the book inspired as much empathy as Sissy Spacek's movie character, but the others much less so. In the film you felt some empathy for Sue, Miss Desjardin, and Tommy because of their empathy for Carrie. The teacher in the book is basically evil minded, Sue is a mix, and Tommy is on the good side. The most substantial difference is what happens at the prom. In the film, only a few of Chris's friends laugh (it's implied that the other laughter shown is only imagined by Carrie), in the book everyone laughs. In both book and film I'm totally on Carrie's side and applaud her actions; if I had her power in her circumstance I'd do exactly the same. In the book there is a final poignant interaction between Carrie and Sue. I should say finally I consider both the book and film masterpieces. If you want to know the root cause behind Columbine and such read this."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"&quot;Carrie&quot; is a great book. It was the first Stephen King book I read, and it has become my favorite book of all-time that I have read so far. I found this book to be very interesting, and I am glad it was semi-short compared to others, because sometimes I just don't have the time to read a long book. &quot;Carrie&quot; was actually the book that got me hooked on horror. I loved it and it influenced my taste in books, and helped me to find my interest."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is a tortured teenager attending high school. Her mother is a disturbed religious fanatic, who forces Carrie to take part in her absurd religious demands. With no friends, Carrie is an outsider. But there's something different about her, for she has telekinesis, the power to move objects mentally. When a school hunk asks her to the prom, she at first refuses, but then gives in. She makes her own dress, fixes herself up, and despite her mother's protest, attends the prom with the hunk. While at the prom, a bratty girl who takes part in the torturing of Carrie at school, plans a little surprise. She arranges it so Carrie will become the Prom Queen. Carrie can't believe it when she is called up on the stage to accept a crown. Then down came the blood. A bucket of pig blood covers her as her eyes widen and she looks at the laughter-stricken audience in horror. What happens next? Remember, she has telekinesis."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Being his first novel, it is pretty good. The way he not only tells the story through characters but also through other fake newspaper articles and fake books about the story of Carrie. Confusing in the beginning, but he uses good description and action in the end. The movie has done the same. A sequel is already in the making. Read this one first and see the sequel!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"One of the few where the movie was as good as the book (almost) I always picture John Travolta and Sissy when this book comes to mind. Anyway, the story is just great...never boring and an exciting ending. Read it!!! Thanks Mr. King!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is THE most macabre Stephen King book. Tales of mistreated people always affect me and I could not sleep for thinking about this book for weeks. I think that it is the most delicate material he has ever written about and is just a classic. Along with Tommyknockers this is my favourite King book and I don't think that any he'll ever write another to change my mind. I was glad to see the film do it justice, which is more than can be said for the Tommyknockers film!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"An orignal masterpiece that is so well written I at first actually thought it was based on a true story. This is defintely one of king's best!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"To be honest with you, the book is thin and compelling. The movie is even better. the book is what made King the man that he is."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen king's carrie is an excellent book. it's one of those books that doesn't let you put it down.There is an outstanding plot.The chararcter descriptions were very good.The use of such uniksplainable phanomanon like telekaneisis as the main subject.The fact that the story is made up of bits and pieces from news reports,biographies and actual narations from people as they remember the inscident. I feel that this is a good book to read when you have absolutly nothing to do.This book will definitly keep you occupied.This is a well writen book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The novel by Stephen King, &quot;Carrie&quot; may be an oldie, but it is still a goodie. It is on of the best if not the best novel I have ever read....it is running somewhat of a close race with Frank DeFelitta's &quot;Audrey Rose.&quot; I think that everyone can relate to &quot;Carrie.&quot; There are always those people that royally tick us off, and some of us dream of getting them back (not burning them alive in a gym) but you get my drift. It is definitely a novel that many people can relate to."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is the type of book that you really think about. I mean sure it was King's first novel, but still, before I knew it the book was already over. But I think, beyond all, Carrie was a great novel, not as good as The Tommyknockers or Insomnia, but still a great novel. Let me give you a brief summary. I mean a real brief summary, the story was very short. A girl named Carrie has telekenetic powers, and she's out there to destroy anyone who ever said a word about her. Hell, she's out there to destroy her whole highschool. I think DePalma did a great job directing the movie in comparison with Kubrick directing The Shining."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I FELT CARRIE WAS A STEPHEN KING MASTERPIECE . MOST OF HIS BOOKS ARE. THIS BOOK (CARRIE) SHOWS PEOPLE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE PICKED ON. AND HER MOTHER,S CHARACTER SHOWS JUST HOW OVER PROTECTIVE SOME MOM,S REALLY ARE. I RECOMEND CARRIE TO EVERYBODY WHO LIKES AGOOD OLD FASHONED SCARE. THIS IS STEPHEN KINGS NOVEL THAT MADE HIM FAMOUS.THIS IS HIS 1ST PUBLISHED NOVEL."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is the first novel of Stephen King's which I have read and which is not part of the Dark Tower sequence. It is also his first published novel which could mean that the writing was a little rough around the edges but damn, King can tell a story!The title character is Carietta White. You know the girl. She was in your high school, just with a different name. She was different. Her family was different. The other kids flocked like vultures and teased her without mercy. You know the girl. She grew up mostly without friends. Even the other outcasts wouldn't go near her. Carrie's mother was ultra-religious and certainly stunted Carrie's social growth and skills. Even the teachers didn't really like her. This is Carrie.But Carrie is different. Carrie has powers she barely understands. Carrie can make things happen. Telekenesis. She can move things with her mind. Under very stressful circumstances things happen. A rain of stones which only falls on her house. Exploding lightbulbs. Shaking bookcases. Things happen.When Carrie has her first period in the girls shower after gym at the age of seventeen and thinks she is bleeding to death because she does not know what is happening the other girls are mean, like a pack of jackals literally smelling blood. Now it's begun. Both the novel and the transformation of Carrie White starts here.This is Stephen King we're talking about. Things will take a turn for the worse and end in that famous prom sequence we've heard about and seen in the movies. Carietta gets pushed one too many times and her power makes her very, very dangerous.Like I said, King can tell a good story. There is a bit of clunk around some of the edges, but King's writing has passion and we can feel for Carrie even when we see her slowly slipping and slowly cracking and slowly snapping. Carrie isn't the villain here, which would be a twist on a normal horror story. Carrie is a victim who snaps. A broken protagonist.I didn't know that King could write this well. Sure he's sold a kabillion copies of his books, but from Carrie I think it's clear: this is a special talent. He writes books people want to read. The American Dickens in his first novel.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book by Stephen King is about a girl named Carrie White who lives in 1974 Maine with her mother. Carrie's mother is extremly religious and abusive. Carrie is made fun of by the other kids at school because of how she dresses and her apperence in all. This whole story actully starts out good at the point where Carrie starts her monthly cycle for the first time in gym class. Carrie is made fun of and has objects thrown at her. While trying to tell her mother her tragetie that happened at school she makes Carrie pray in a closet for her sins. Soon after Carrie learns she has telekinetic powers.Carrie's tormenters is lead by this one girl, Chris, who has this plan to destroy Carrie for ever. Chris finds out that Carrie's one and only friend,Sue, has asked her boyfriend to take Carrie to the dance instead of her to me Carrie feel better. Chris plots to have Carrie win prom queen and once Carrie steps on stage and the crown is placed on her head a bucket of pigs blood will fall onto Carrie. As The pigs blood drips down her face, Carrie unleashes her super natural powers and gets even with those who have hurt her."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Sure, the writing in this book is \\"young King\\", but that's better than most authors even at the peak of their talents. All the raw skills that would make Stephen King the bestselling horror author ever are here, and this is a fast and enjoyable read. Even if you've seen the movie, you owe it to yourself to read the novel. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have read just about everything that Stephen King has written and I can only think of a couple of short stories like 'the Mist', and maybe just one book 'Salem's Lot' that I enjoyed more than Carrie. Primarily the reason I enjoyed this book so much is that it is a real departure from his later day formula writing. This is one of Kings very first books and it is a little raw in comparison to his later work 'Shaw Shank', 'Bag of Bones', but in many ways that rough quality adds to the books appeal.Of course, even if you haven't read the book yet (like myself until a couple of days ago), it will almost be impossible to be surprised by the ending. Who amongst us has not seen Sissy Spasek drenched in blood at her prom, it's an iconic American image. But that aside, this is a very enjoyable book because it really gets close to the 'horror' label that King has been slapped with his entire career. I can always get into a King book because it stumbles around the edge of terror, but am pretty much always disappointed because of his insane need to offer up a very happy ending. I'm sure that King has sold twenty times the amount of books that he would have had he continued on this edgier path. But I often think of what could have been had he been a little more daring. Its kind of like Elvis ending up singing Blue Hawaii in a Las Vegas night club when he had started off as such an edgy charismatic youngster.Anyways, I highly recommend this book if you like King at all. If you have yet to read much King and are wondering where to start out, try 'Salem's Lot' as a novel, or even better, a collection of his short stories like 'Skeleton Crew.'"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie, a teenage reject, religiously victimized by her mother has had her dream chance of a lifetime. One of the most sought after boys at school asks her to the prom. Then there's the mayhem!A brilliant book. Better than the movie. (TYPICALLY!)Stephen King, the best writer in the world, bar none, has graced us with his first ever masterpisec, which paved the way for every other book, novella and short story he has ever written. A GEM! ;-)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Though &quot;Carrie&quot; is definitely the work of a writer who is still finding his voice, it is a remarkably tight and gripping book, and remains one of my personal favorites of King's work.The tale told by King and King's wife Tabitha, about how she literally pulled the first pages of the book out of a trash can, read them, and then encouraged King to continue with the story he had started, is somewhat apocryphal now. Nevertheless, upon reading the first few chapters of &quot;Carrie&quot; one can see what grabbed her attention. The reader is immediately involved in the story and irresistably drawn all the way to the end.The story of Carrie White is that of someone who is essentially ordinary (almost painfully so), but with an extraordinary ability. How these two elements come together is the substance of the book, and there is a lot of substance here, both in terms of storytelling and thematic material. King's talent for strong character and capturing the feel of everyday life is already obvious in this book, and it is put to good use.&quot;Carrie&quot; remains one of King's most compelling works, even 30 years after it was written. Thank goodness Mrs. King had the wherewithal to get him to finish it!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen King's first book, Carrie, is the story of Carrie White, a nerdy girl who has the power to move things with her mind. Living with her repressed mother, a religious fanatic who is almost comically over-the-top in her fear of sexuality (a theme that King would later treat with a more subtle hand in most of his later books). In the book's justifiably famous opening, 16 year-old Carrie starts her first menstural cycle while in the shower after gym class. The other girls in her class have a rather cruel, if all-too believable, reaction to Carrie's fright and this sets in motion a chain of events that leads to Carrie being invited to prom by the most popular (and apparently the only genuinely nice) boy in school, yet another terribly cruel practical joke being played on Carrie, and finally Carrie White's revenge. King's narrative alternates between telling Carrie's story and presenting \\"evidence\\" in the forms of excerpts from a survivor's memoir, articles in Esquire and Reader's Digest, a nicely off-center psychology textbook, and the reports of the government commission set up to cover up the implications of Carrie's final rampage. It all comes together in an effective but rather jagged mosiac that confirms that King had talent from the beginning but still makes for an uneven read. Indeed, King's trademark ability to create a cast of credible characters isn't extremely evident here with the key exception of the title character. Carrie White is, for all intents and purposes, a nerd and the pain that she feels and her conflicting responses of self-loathing with self-righteous, almost arrogant fury at how she is treated will be almost painfully familiar for anyone else who spent high school in that outcast social group (it certainly brought back a lot of not-quite cherished memories for myself). Its almost saddening to discover that King himself disliked Carrie and held her responsible for her misfortunes because his recreation of her pain is so spot on perfect that one finds it hard to wonder how her creator couldn't have felt badly for her. No, she isn't always sympathetic and her final, destructive vengeance is carried out with intentionally murderous intent but its hard not to understand how her hatred was generated at the hands of the often thoughtless cruelty of teenage culture. I don't know how someone who was popular in high school might react to the book but as a former high school nerd, I can say this brought back a lot of uncherished memories and Carrie's plight kept me enthralled despite the many times when the book felt rather uneven.Though it might not matter much in the overall scheme of things, King also does a good job of making credible Tommy Ross, the jock wiseman who agrees to be seen at his school's prom with the school's most unpopular student, an action that sets forward the book's apocalyptic conclusion. Ross's noble choice in asking Carrie to the dance is not an entirely credible action and King, at times, is obviously trying to convince himself as much as the reader that this could actually realistically happen. However, in his few scenes, Tommy Ross is drawn as a sympathetic, believable character and is presented with such skill that one comes as close as possible to actually buying into the credibility of his actions. Though a relatively minor character, Tommy Ross is an early prototype for the plain-spoken, intelligent but unpretentious, defiantly blue collar characters who would make up the majority of King's future protaganists.Back before he became THE Stephen King, Stephen King was a generally down-on-his-luck teacher living in obscurity in Maine and making a few extra bucks selling a few well-written horror stories to racy magazines (some of which, King has often recalled, ended up going out of business before getting around to publishing his fiction). Though it wasn't the first book he completed. It is a novel of a writer still searching for his voice and who is writing in a genre that he is not totally comfortable embracing. Indeed, while the novel can be labelled a work of horror, it still contains signs of the insecurities and pretensions of the not-yet succesful King with Carrie's story, at times, being forced rather roughly into a metaphor for the whole decline of society in general. However, this is all probably meaningless nitpicking because in the end, the only that matters is that Carrie -- whatever its flaws -- is still a gripping read that grabs the reader's attention for page one and shows signs of the talent that would later make Stephen King a brand name."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is the first Stephen King that I've ever read and I must say that the book was superb. The book explores into the mind of Carrie, a misunderstood highschool girl. After Carrie notices that she can move objects using her mind, she looks into it and sees that she has telekeinetic powers. If you've seen the movie, read the book. It is 100 times better. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, read the book 1st. The movie will ruin the book. Although the book is not a horror novel, it is still a fascinating science fiction. This book will hook you with the explosive shower room scene. This is a great book for anybody that is looking for a good fast paced read. I'm only 12 and read it in 2 days it was so good. Read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is one of those stories that you think you've always known. You can almost predict what the characters are going to do and what's going to ultimately happen. So did Stephen King do a lousy job writing a story that's predictable? I think not. King has the razor sharp keenness that only a fine writer can possess to pinpoint the exact turbulent emotions a person goes through in his adolescence. As we read about the characters in the book, we are subconsciously reminded of our own adolescence experiences. We are being shifted into the teenager thinking-mode, and we would imagine what WE would do in the similar situation. That's perhaps what makes this superb fiction possesses a familiar feeling. Nevertheless, the book scared us (it scared me at least). Not because of Carrie's supernatural power, the fear is more due to the cruelties and insensitiveness of teenagers in the book. Most teenagers are nasty, shallow and selfish creatures. What scares us the most is that we're reminded of our own nasty side of human nature when we were young: picking on the weird looking kids, poking fun of the nerds...Shame on us. Some of those kids grow up to be Carrie, or the gunmen in the Columbine shooting incident."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I first read this book in high school and could not put it down. The memory lingers strongly to this day. You are drawn into the pages by the realism and situations that King weaves. Who can forget the awkwardness and cruelties we all faced in high school. We all knew someone like Carrie who was the brunt of the most cruel jokes and pranks. I say the movie did not do justice to the book. For one thing a movie cannot capture the emotion and clarity of things that King so masterfully writes. It's no wonder he became the great author he is today. A sheer masterpiece like this one is a real credit to his talent."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"When I think 'Stephen King', one of the first things that springs to mind is Carrie (probably after Misery). It's been many years since I saw the movie (back in the olden days when we didn't have DVDs, only VHS), and there's a reason it's a cult classic.But when it comes to the book, it's creepy in a different kind of way. More subtle, more tense and if I hadn't seen the movie before reading the book, more engrossing. Carrie is an easy girl to feel sympathy for, but a difficult girl to like - I wanted her to break out, to scream, to shout - but then again, when you've got the whole supernatural freaky power thing going on, why would you?For me the let down was that I didn't feel creeped out by the book the same way as I did by the movie. In fact, I only managed to watch the movie once because it got so far under my skin. The book however, was just a creepy read - not spine-tingling-skin-crawling horror, but a more psychological kind of creep.This is another book that the movie, quite simply, ruined for me. And one of the very very rare cases that I enjoyed the movie better."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"My approach to reading the prodigious works of Stephen King was to read his books in sequence. I started off with his short-story collection \\"Night Shift\\" and moved on to \\"Carrie.\\" I don't think this book is his best work (that begins with \\"Salem's Lot\\"), but it is worth reading.Nobody could ever accuse King of lacking creativity. What he did with Carrie White -- a young outcast who gets her first period and taste of love gone wrong -- and the phenomenon of telekinesis is plain awesome, and with this novel, he began to redefine the horror genre.My only two complaints with the book is how King, in his narrative, bounces back and forth from the omniscient narrator to injecting inserts from fictive magazine articles and books, seemingly to make the telekinesis phenomenon more believable. Also, he begins his annoying penchant for failing to provide closure at the end of the book.That all said, I'll offer a mostly positive review of this novel. The only prerequisites for buying this book are liking the horror genre and being capable of maintaining the suspension of disbelief. While many have cited this work as a statement on the cruelty of kids (and it is all of that), I think what you will get most out of \\"Carrie\\" -- if you've never read King before -- is a sense of his unmatched ability to add layer upon layer of characterization to go with his tremendous insight and sense of humor, which somehow fits in well with his horror. And King does dialogue as well as anyone.The book is thoroughly readable and Carrie White is a sympathetic character. For a man to write through the eyes of a teenaged girl this well is an accomplishment in itself. If you haven't already done so, I think it's best to approach Stephen King through his early books as opposed to randomly. And don't make this your last King book. I'm more than 30 novels into his work and I recommend you buy and read this book and then get prepared to watch him get better and better all the way to \\"It,\\" when he went through a period of drug and alcohol problems. Then he got back on track and the rest is history. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This was a good book, especially knowing the fact that it was the first work that really put Stephen King on the map as a writer. It might not be the most horrific thing for today's standards, especially in comparison with some of King's later works, but it sure was a hit at the time. I enjoyed the writing style but I must admit I prefer most of King's later works like The Dream Catcher and many of his short story collections."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I am not sure why it has taken me so long to read this book as I am a huge fan of Stephen King's but I am so glad I finally got around to it. Carrie is one of his best works and I did not want to put it down. I loved the way it was written and my heart just went out to Carrie in so many ways. If you are a fan of Stephen King then you really need to read this book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Wow. I didn't think it would be that good because it was his first book. But I was amazed to see how sophisticated the writing was, how he got inside each of the character's heads, good and bad, and managed to weave in the action of the story with the supporting \\"material\\" from newspapers, scientific papers, court cases, etc. Really impressive debut. They should really let this crazy kid write some more."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"One of his smaller novels, but one of his best! this book never slows down and the writing style really works well. Carrie is a well written story that doesn't leave you guessing, but holds you in suspense the whole time."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"im in middle school and its one of my favorites. i highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a good Steven King book"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"It's where Stephen King began and to be his first novel it's a very good book.After i read Carrie and Shining (which is a masterpiece ) i'm gonna read SK's second book, Salem's Lot!Here, the King of Horror was born!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I love to read his stories they take me away, turn me around, and bring me to an understsnding. get it?"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I've always hated horror movies so never thought I would care for Stephen King. Yes, the book has been around forever and I've just read it. I did not particularly care for the style of writing that jumped between various \\"official reports\\" and the main story line. In fact I almost put it down for that reason, but I kept reading, determined to finish my first horror novel. I don't plan for it to be my last, but I hope the style of future reads differs to my liking."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Though lacking some of the style and poise of later King works, Carrie is nonetheless a chilling tale from The Master. Despite being an unlikeable personality, we feel sympathy towards the protagonist, Carrie, so at the end we aren't sure whether to condemn her actions or root for her. This is strange because King recently admitted that he never liked her, and felt that she deserved the abuse she got. Seemingly, he based Carrie White on two people that he taught before he took up writing full time.As Stephen King's first published novel, released in 1974, no one could have predicted that Carrie would be the beginning of what would become the biggest publishing phenomenon in history. But it is surprising how well this tale of a young girl with telekinetic powers holds up after twenty-one years. Perhaps it is because the novel is still intense, still vivid, and still an apt commentary on modern life. Even after years of slasher films, mass murderers, and nuclear threat, Carrie still has bite. It is the classic Cinderella tale, with a twist. A twist so violent that the final one third of the novel burns with total wreckage, loss, and repercussions.Carrie sets the stage for much of what Stephen King experimented with in later novels, but it is also a remarkably solid novel in its own right. Well written and chillingly realistic (even in the face of the supernatural), this novel will resonate for many more years to come"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I thought that this book was pretty good, I mean I couldn't really put it down. There were some parts that were kind of gross and I would say them here but I don't want to ruin the book for people who are going to read it now or soon. The book I rated was 4 stars because it was kind of hard to follow at first but after a while you pick up on it. The storyline was an cool one that is very easy to hold someones attention, what makes it interesting is that a girl with an over protective and over religious mom who won't let her leave the house talk to anyone or anything that she should be able to do finds out that she has the gift of telikensis where she can move things using her mind. It was a really good book and I think that anyone who likes horror and much suspence should read this book!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I saw the movie first but I have to say, the book is even better. I liked all the details in it and it was really easy to read. I read the earlier version and in it there were articles that had supposedly been published in local books and newspapers of the town that it happened in. I love this book and would read it again."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I am not a big fan of Stephen King books, although I have only read three of this books. The first one I read was &quot;Carrie&quot;. I saw the film, loved it, so gave the novel a try. I must say it\`s difficult to get imagery from this book, and I did not find King\`s use of words powerful or frightening at all. They were too raw and unpleasantly accurate to intrigue me. But what really aggravated me about &quot;Carrie&quot; is the way King constructed newspaper articles, obituaries, and interviews into the story. It totally weakened the plot, and it sort of got confusing at times. Brian De Palma\`s classic film adaptation, I feel, is a lot better. The plot was produced with more focus on adolescence, and the severe emotions the main characters felt. There also a lot more powerful and unexpected moments. The book just didn\`t do anything for me."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book Isn't as good as I would hope. It is to brief, it gets scary in the last twenty pages. If you want a good scary novel, go towards Cujo or The Exorcist. Maybe even try reading Watchers, that is a great book, but don't bother with Carrie!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The first time I read Carrie I thought it smaked of a &quot;first try.&quot; After having been in love with &quot;IT&quot; for months I found &quot;Carrie&quot; a bit lacking. But then I read it over and over and over and I found that not only did I sympathize with Carrie, I wanted to be her, help her, recognize her. I could swear I'd seen her walking the halls of my high school, that I had been her standing in the shower, that I had looked through Chris' eyes and threw things.The cruelty and assurence of being on the right side that King won't let you get away from is what makes this book a perfect documentary on how adolecents treat each other. The terror lies not in the decriptions of gory deaths, of blood and guts but in the fact that everyone went through this, everyone put someone else through this, and people are still going through this. Being beaten down, judged, torn between home and school because neither place is really safe.Of course you cheer Carrie as she burns the city and destroys her enemies. How else could one externalize what years of taunting relly feel like, what they actually do? Carrie's classmates destroyed whatever they could of Carrie, and so did she.

I first read this novel in high school where Carrie White's character was unfortunately present. I recall girls who were emotionally, and sometimes physically, battered by classmates and was once badgered by a bully myself. This book is also part of the early 'raw energy' of Stephen King as a writer, before he was launched into legendary status as a popular horror novelist. Though there isn't a happy ending in 'Carrie', I'm still able to sympathize with her character and see some justice in her wicked vengeance. This novel will remain on my bookshelves, safe from any future garage sales, and re-visited often.Chrissy K. McVayAuthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I can't hold up CARRIE as an extremely deep or enlightening novel, but it was one that I had a lot of trouble putting down at the end of the day. It takes a fairly simple premise and milks it for all that it's worth. It's not particularly frightening or scary, just a simple, tense story told very, very well.The characterization is really nothing to write home about here. The people have their places and their actions to perform, but don't really exist in all three dimensions. I didn't find this to be a problem though, as I wasn't expecting anything particularly outstanding in this department. However, one character's shallowness did begin to annoy me after a while. The eponymous Carrie has a mother, of course, and to describe this woman as a clich&eacute;d and one-dimensional stereotype would be to pay a compliment to the characterization. I'm not particularly offended by the single portrayal of an over the top, religious, fanatical fundamentalist, but the sheer superficiality began to seriously annoy me. Now, obviously, the book is set up in a way that the reader isn't supposed to empathize with this insane woman, yet I felt as if I was being hit over the head with this crude caricature. Having a character that the audience can boo and hiss at is one thing, but to draw a person whose very presence in the story made me want to hurl the book the length of the room is another thing entirely. If she had just been a little toned down, I doubt she would have been nearly so aggravating.The story-line is quite simple and probably known to many more people than have actually read the book (or seen the film). But this doesn't work against the book. Indeed, the story constantly undermines climactic moments, by telling us the events far in advance of their appearance in the narrative. Nearly every shocking event that occurs in the book has already been mentioned in the little asides that are scattered throughout. This is a very effective way of heightening the tension. Learning a lesson from Hitchcock, Stephen King knows that it's the suspense rather than the actual blood that keeps an audience hooked. We know precisely what's coming, but it's the journey itself that is of supreme importance. With every hint the book drops, the tension is racked up a notch. By the time I reached the conclusion, that I had already anticipated, I was completely spellbound.CARRIE is a simple story of childhood bullying, nonconformity and revenge, with a healthy sprinkling of horror thrown in. The characters don't need to be terribly deep, because anyone who ever interacted with children know these people already and can fill in the gaps. It feels slightly uneven and sloppy in places, but that certainly isn't enough to derail the whole book. This was the first Stephen King book that I'd ever read, and based on my enjoyment of this one, it certainly won't be the last."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Strangely enough, Carrie may be as far as Stephen King ever deviated from straight narrative storytelling in his entire career. It's not very far at that, but it is far enough apart to make the story interesting and engaging. Rather than simply following a course of events, King frequently breaks the course of the narration to include excerpts from various fictional publications regarding the event that the novel itself revolves around. The method is effective, mixing technical discourse on telekinesis with the emotional content of the story to draw the reader along. In keeping with another common theme of King's work, there's also no real &quot;villain&quot; involved in this story, simply a confluence of forces yielding an undesirable conclusion. The end result is that this story feels very real. Compare Carrie, for example, to 'Salem's Lot, with it's singular villain at the lead, and you can see the difference. While the Lot may be charming, it is this story which carries (no pun intended) more impact to the reader simply because it hits closer to home. This book isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, though--don't get me wrong. While it's truly amazing for a first publication, it's still more than a little rough around the edges. It fortunately does not suffer from King's occasional ... of the word processor, but the storytelling style and voice that became more and more evident as Steve's career developed is much less apparent in this story. Who would I recommend this book for? Well, as usual, the book is good for anybody who has some time to kill and wants an engaging story. King has been occasionally accused of overdeveloping his backstory, but I think that in this case the backstory is integrated well into the overall story, allowing it to stay engaging, rather than dragging in places (as, say, Insomnia might). Parents may or may not want to steer their children clear, as it does include some rather frank discussion of menstruation, and the book itself concerns itself in a higher sense with the trials of puberty, but there's not much here that I would find objectionable. All things considered, the only thing that stops me from giving this piece five stars is the fact that it does feel just a bit rough around the edges, without the flow and fluency that is typical of King's later work. Overall, however, a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is a story that almost everyone knows, basically because the movie is such a classic and to this day is watched over and over againg by old and new fans of the story. The novel however is even better. The movie isn't too distorted and basically is the same as the book, however what makes the book even better is the fact that you understand a lot more about Carrie and some of the other characters, but mostly Carrie. The story also continues on a bit longer and the action of the end events are much more exciting. After reading the book I watched the movie and was amazed at how much more I actually understood the movie. For anyone interested in horror or Stephen King, this is a most. It's King's first published novel, and it's also one of his shortest which makes it nice for a young reader or some who just doesn't have time to read a thousand pages of the Stand. The book really is great and I feel it gets looked over a lot because the movie was and is still so popular, but while the movie is great the book is a lot better."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"There's something special in the way King narrates this novel. The medical reports, the witnesses interviews, and the newspapers collages placed side by side with the story give you the impression of a real case. Carrieta White discovers her power when she was a child, a power that remains calmed since the, until a shameful episode awakes it again. Having for mother a crazy religious woman and surrounded by insensible schoolmates she took vengance during what was a special episode for her.... a vengace that brought destruction and hate. In the end, Carrie was only a girl who wanted to be normal...and happy. But there's no happy endings in real life."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"To treat it as just 'horror' would only do this coming-of-age-telekenetic-girl-having-her-period-for-nearly-300-pages, an injustice, because it is also an original modern All-american high school tale that is the solid writing undercurrent that carries the high concept pitch that floats on it, this his first novel saved from the bin by his wife who said 'hey, this ain't bad' while they lived in a trailer home, got King his first six digit check, the idea can be summed up the image of huge full size jesus swaying inside the neighbour's trailer living room with the daughter always kneeling down before it, King blatantly lived by the die hard writing tip #1 of -- write what you know... and that is why Carrie is so whacked out."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is an all-over awesome book. This book contains witchery, demonic slaves, and one over-religious woman, being Carrie's mother. It's briefly about a possessed teenaged-girl that can't seem to figure herself out. She isn't liked by many of her high-school peers. At her prom, a few young pranksters try and pull and trick on her and it goes terribly wrong. The book is entirely better then the movie. If you liked the movie Carrie, you absolutely must read this chilling novel by Stephen King."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I really enjoyed the book Carrie By Stephen King a great deal. The book was basically about a girl who grows up living with just her mom and how her mother is very religious and makes Carrie pray all the time and tells her that natural things that are supposed to happen to people are sins. Carrie learns to realize that she has some sort of a power but she cant make it work it only works when she gets really mad and she mumbles things under her breath like for instance when she in being tormented by the group of girls in the locker room she makes the light bulb smash just by getting so upset or when a little boy says something to her when shes walking down the street and she says she hopes he falls and smashes his head open she turns around and hes on the ground with his bike on top of him. Although parts of it were twisted and i didnt understand why anyone could bring themselves to do those sort of things it was still a good book. I almost want to feel bad for Carrie even though i know she isn't a real person because of what the other girls do to her especially Chris Hargensen. I dont believe how Carrie was brought up was right. Her mother was wrong in punishing her in the ways she did such as putting her in the closet so she could pray for hours and hours. I dont understand how her mother came to be this way since her parents were pretty much normal. I dont see why her mother doesnt tell her things that she needs to know like about women and what their body does. I think it is cool how in the book it gives you like a section every now and then on reports that they do on Carrie and her TK. I enjoyed this book very much and i find Stephen Kings books to be very good. I recommend you to read this book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is a story of a girls horrible life that changed into a bloody revenge. Having to endure a life of torment by her classmates Carrie finds that she posses the terrifying power of telekinesis. Telekinesis is the power to be able to move objects with the control of your mind. Carrie saw that her newly found power could be used to take revenge on those who caused her all of her pain throughout her life.While reading Carrie, the whole book is able to keep the readers at the edge of their seats throughout the whole book. The plot of the story begs the reader to continue reading. When starting to read this book, the reader is initially hooked by how the reader express how horrible Carries life has been, he shows examples of her being bullied. Suddenly strange occurrence start happening which keeps the reader buried in the book to figure out what is happening to her, then finally once her talent is reviled the reader cant put down the book, in order to seen what, and how she gets her revenge.Carrie is a book appropriate for younger teen, but can still be appreciated adults as well. The book does not contain a difficult vocabulary, this is because the story is being told from the stand point of a high school teenager. What is appealing to the range of all ages is that the book is based on certain human emotions such as self-consciousness , hate, revenge, and fear, which are concepts that everyone has felt at one point in their lives. Everyone has thought dirty, nasty thoughts against someone they have hated, this book brings those visions to life, and paints the reader a gory picture of what happens.The book is for not for the light hearted reader, at time the reader might find themselves having to put down the book to take a breather. As a personal note to the reader, beware, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The story of Carrie White, written by Stephen King, portrays the quintessetial outcast in a suburban high school setting. Constantly being the butt of everyone's jokes, Carrie finally unleasher her telekinetic powers in a horrific night of revenge. This novel gives an insight into the mind of the typical high school reject, allowing all to truly understand that the ridicule they are put through is unbearable, leaving them no one to turn to and unlimited power of destruction over everyone else's life and her own. A scene at the outset of the book exemplifies this excruciating torture that she is put through when Carrie, the main character, is horribly made fun of when she is experiencing her first period. As the novel closes, Carrie can no longer take the constant bombardments of everyone in her life, even her mother, and she ultimately explodes on the city as a whole, unleashing her telekinetic powers in a fit or rage brought on by a deceptive night of false popularity."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Wow! I read this at the beginning of 7th grade and have loved it since. I remember I was extremely bored and so I thought, a horror story sounds good right now. I thought it wasn't going to be scary. Boy, was I wrong! It confused at a FEW parts. I watched the movie afterwards and I was surprised at how alike they were. That story prolly haunted me for a month! I kept seeing Sissy Spacek's (Carrie) eyes wide open (which was scary looking...if you've seen the movie you know what i mean). I definately recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I would really like to see King rewrite this book. Just to go back over and smooth down some of those rough spots, turn this book from a good horror novel with a few weaknesses into a first-rate horror/thriller.Much of this book is good. The characters are believable, if a little static. The setting manages to help the story along without become too much a part of the action. King's explanation for Carrie's abilities, along with the behaviour of her mother, foreshadows the end long before it comes, but that's all right. Horror isn't about the shock, really, it's about the moments that lead up to it.The only problem is, in a lot of places where you'd expect the story to speed up, it slows down. This'd be all right if it slowed up for a purpose, but it's usually just for a bit of someone's jounral of a scrap of a newspaper article. Later on, King would learn more about how to mix together mundane sub-plots with the horrific plot to make the horror build all the better, but here it feels more forced, more artifical somehow.Still, for being the first book that every made me jump with surprise in a public place, four stars."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie was a novel I was reluctant to read. For one thing, the movie didn't impress me as much, and it's hard to read about someone that shares your namesake. But as soon as I pulled it from behind a rack of dusty books in a public library, I knew it was fate. I was immediatley pulled in, wondering how Stephen King could have such a wonderful first book.It starts with interviews from neighbors and students. Carrie White is a senior who has been scarred from a religious fanatic mother. Carrie also happens to have trained herself in telekinesis. These interviews all lead up to the fateful night of the Prom.Do yourself a favor. Read Carrie.You'll be spellbound."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Maybe its trying to teach us a lesson about bullying and picking on others. Maybe its trying to communicate how destructive religion can be when taken to the extremes and abused. Maybe its about telekinetic powers and the possibility that they lurk inside those we wouldn't even suspect. Carrie might be any, all, or none of those things, but one thing is for sure and that is that Carrie is about karma. Chamberlain, Maine apparently needs a hard lesson taught to it about \\"what goes around comes around\\" and Carrie White delivers it with destructive capabilities by the time the book is coming to a close.Stephen King may think his early work is \\"raw\\", whatever that means to him, but that doesn't make it any less engaging. True that his early novels, especially those written under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, are not as long or epic as novels such as Insomnia, It, or Desperation, but the sheer stripped out horror of Carrie, Pet Semetary, and The Bachman Books are enough to put fans of the early books or the later ones in their bedrooms with all the lights on, wondering what lurks behind each corner. The writing style is definitely more primitive than his other novels, and the plot moves a lot quicker, seeing as the total page count comes in at 245 in the version I own, but it moves at a good speed, building suspense throughout the plot that lets the reader know that the climax is going to be quite the bloodbath.Taking place in a small town in Maine, as most King novels do, the story follows one Carrie White, picked on and harassed by the majority of her peers at school only to come home to a religiously fanatical mother who forces her to pay horrible prices for her so called \\"sins\\". It's enough to make anyone suffer a mental breakdown, and as the plot unfolds, Carrie discovers that not only does she have the power of telekinesis, but that the strength that comes with this power is daunting.So, when the school Prom comes around and a fellow classmate named Susan Snell begins to feel regret for picking on Carrie, she gladly pushes her boyfriend Tommy Ross into taking the tormented outcast to the school dance. However, the problem comes up when various other classmates not so regretful or fond of Carrie pull the most devastating trick they can come up with to ruin White's Prom Night: which, surprisingly or not depending on if you've seen the film, involves pouring pigs blood all over Carrie when she is crowned Prom Queen as a joke. Let the chaos begin.Spending the last quarter of the novel discussing the destruction that Carrie wreaks on her hometown, the novel gradually builds up to this point by interrupting the flow of the plot to include letters from classmates, excerpts from books on Carrie's chaotic lashback against her classmates, and newspaper/ticker updates involving the destruction. While it is a very suspenseful buildup, sometimes the interruptions are not appreciated and for anyone who has seen the movie, not much of it comes as a surprise. If you've seen the film you'll probably find it superior to the book, strangely enough. But if you've never been exposed to the movie version, the book is sure to grab you quite well.This is far from Stephen King's strongest effort to date, but it is quite original and was one of the better 1970's horror novels with one of the better 1970's films to go with it before spawning a horrible sequel which King had nothing to do with. As much as the plot focuses on telekinesis, there is a lesson to be learned from it, whether King intended to include it or not, and that lesson is that you reap what you sew. Her classmates harassed and ostracized her, she decided to strike back, its that simple. King seems to have an odd knack for predicting the future as both this and his now out of print early novel Rage (about school shootings taking place years before Columbine) both accurately predict the violence capable in everyone, especially high school students recently it seems, when they are cast out of large groups. If you're not a King fan but want something good by him, get Pet Semetary or some of the Dark Tower books or maybe Different Seasons. If you are a King fan but haven't read this, get it whether you've seen the movie or not. It will give you a little more insight into the differences between the novel and the film and will show you the early stages of King's writing style from an angle thats not easy to find."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I could tell easily that Carrie had to have been one of King's first novels just by the way it was written. Carrie doesn't read so much like a narrative, but as a collection of different viewpoints trying to tell the same story, one of a tormented young girl with telekenetic powers who exacts revenge on those who treated her badly.In Carrie, we read selections from the &quot;Carrie White Commission&quot;, convened to discern why and how Carrie practically destroyed her community, from Sue Snell's autobiography, which exudes some compassion for Carrie in the aftermath, among others. Overall, the effect did not work for me: I found the book confusing and the writing just subpar of what King has since delivered. I suppose since I had seen the film version before reading the book, that made Carrie tolerable reading.If you're new to King, I recommend The Shining or Misery, and suggest watching the film version of Carrie instead."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This was the first Stephen King book I read an prbably the worst.

She was such an outcast, and everyone treated her horribly. Once she had started her menstrual cycle, she discovered that she had a special power of telekinesis. She was able to move objects with her mind. She went to her prom and as part of a cruel and sick joke so she could be laughed at and humiliated by the entire school, pigs' blood was dropped on top of her. She was so traumatized by that and angered her that everyone was laughing at her, so she got revenge on those who teased her by killing them. At the end, she dies along with her mother.

I thought the clips from the other books and magazine articles added to the realism and chilling sense of impending doom. I did see the movie (some staion airs the edited version every Halloween).

While 'Carrie' is admittedly raw and even downright rough in some places, it illustrates just what King is capable of and carries the reader into the dark places that only King can take you. Carrie White is an intricate character that is essentially, the ultimate victim. The reader has no choice but to completely loathe and completely empathize with her as the story unfolds. Carrie is portrayed as a pitiful annoyance, the scapegoat, the target...yet we all have known her at one point in our lives, whether she was someone in our childhood, or our own worst fears personified.Carrie truly is a victim. A victim of her religious fanatic of a mother, a victim of her peers and even her teachers, some of which cannot even remember her name. No one likes Carrie White and that is something that she has to live with on a daily basis...something that she is reminded of time and again as she struggles through life. It is not until well after she discovers that she possesses a special gift, that she realizes that finally, she may be able to do something about it.King guides us through this tale with a combination of straight-forward story telling and a series of interviews and newspaper articles. This method, while quirky and at times distracting, is necessary to convey the view of both the main characters and society as a whole. The media, whether we like it or not, shapes our attitudes and opinions of others and we are forced to face the question of who and what is acceptable as defined by a small few. The tactic serves King's purpose well, it keeps the reader on track and allows you to understand just why Carrie White is intolerable and yet, the most worthy of understanding and tolerance.As the story reaches it's fatal climax, Carrie finally realizes that she will never fit in and her rage and her &quot;gift&quot; essentially destroys everything around her. The ultimate victim evolves into the ultimate power and finally, the ultimate sacrifice.This novel may never be considered King's best in terms of literary critics, but it still an exceptional story and its shortcomings are overshadowed by this factor alone. If you have read any of King's other work, give his first novel a try as well. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"First King novel, I liked it but it could have been better. But since it was his first novel I do admit it was good, I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Well, if you read this book, you learn of stuff that you have never heard of! It has a lot of scary and dramtic things in it but I suggest that everyone read it! It's exciting and fun to read! I am not a big reader but this particular book caught my eye and I decided to read it! I have seen the movie but reading it isn't the same as seeing the movie! If you see the movie than you can't imagine it yourself as how you think it is! But reading the book helps you to imagine things that you never thought was possible!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"i saw the movie and it was really good so i thought i'd read the book. it was really good but not that scary it was well written and very interesting although it was much diffrent from the movie"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Actually, the book is not that scary but that's me who doesn't get scared easily. But the suspence is great, the story amazing and Stephen King has managed to delight me when I hadn't read anything from him yet. I had heard of the film but I never saw that classic of terror. I should though, even after reading the book. The fact is, the book is wonderful and you can't put it down. The author says it is 'raw'. Well, if this is what he calls 'raw' I wouldn't know what to call a masterpiece... You have to read this book. Because you will never see things the way you do now again..."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I've read both the book and watched the movie, and can attest to it's staying power. Although not as polished as his later works, the rough edges only add to the obvious torment our dark protagonist feels.Contending with a bible-belt(?) mother and extremely evil classmates, it's a wonder that Carrie did not snap eariler. Her life seems dismal until she realizes that she has telekinetic powers that enable her to do the extraordinary.Although the movie is low budget by today's standards (strings and wires are visible if you know where to look) this book remains very enjoyable because you can picture it happening any time. Even if it was intended to deal with the angst felt by the baby boom generation (and quite possibly the frustration women were feeling in narrowed roles)it remains relevant to my generation as well."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is a great book to read if u have a good stomach. There were some points when i had to put it down becuase it was very gory and descriptive. Examples include the smell of blood and Carrie's outraged face. I love when a story is also true because it addds tension and fear to the novel. Even though this is one of King's earlier works I think it is an excellent book and King deserves a standing ovation for his work!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I read most of Stephen King's books about 10 years ago in high school, and recently I decided to buy them all and read them again. I started with &quot;Carrie&quot; since it was his first novel. It is less polished than his later works but he still has the same story flow that makes you keep reading. One thing I always liked about King's books is that he can change back and forth between subjects without losing you, and by making you interested in both of them. For instance, in this book the constant notes of the Carrie White commission provide premonitions of what is to happen later. Overall, I still like King a lot, especially his stuff before 1990. I'd recommend starting with this one if you haven't read his work before."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot, I had trouble putting it down. Part of the reason for this was the lack of chapters, but it was mainly because this is such a good book.Carrie is a character that I empathised with a great deal. She faces daily abuse at home and at school -I was myself bullied at school although thankfully my home environment was supportive. I see her as being a kind and attractive young lady who does not deserve any of the abuse she receives. During the course of the book, she discovers that she has powerful telekinetic abilities. I do not see what her actions near the end of the book as revenge, but as what happens when a tortured individual 'snaps'. She didn't plan what she did, it was merely a reaction to the dispicable way in which she had been treated. No one deserves to be bullied, but it happens throughout society. This book sends out the message that bullying is unacceptable.This book is excellently written with a good storyline and a strong main character, I would recommend it to anyone, this is truly a 'must read' book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As most people probably know, Carrie tells the story of a young girl relentlessly picked on by her peers at school until she finally snaps. Unfortunately for those other children as well as the entire town they live in, Carrie White has mental powers that turn her descent into madness into a miniature Armageddon. At its heart, this story is a Greek tragedy. King reveals early on what will happen, so the tension comes more from the reader wishing the inevitable march to death and chaos can somehow be averted than any real suspense about what will happen.The more we come to know Carrie, the more we want to see her come through her ordeal and have a chance at a normal life. She has been so abused both mentally and physically by her mother and classmates that it is easy to feel great sympathy for her. Further, some of her classmates actually try to turn things around and give her a fresh start. If only she could break the shackles of what has happened to her, perhaps... but it is not to be. The author tells you up front what will happen, and of course it does. When one girl puts a plan into motion to humiliate Carrie one final time at the prom, she triggers an event that costs her and most of her classmates their lives along with hundreds of other town residents (again, this is not a spoiler, the end result is revealed very early in the novel).While not nearly as well constructed asThe Dead Zone (Signet), Carrie reminds me of that story more than any other King books I have read. Both feature characters that might have lived very different lives if not for mental powers (though John Smith in Dead Zone had a much higher likelihood of this). Both books also have a feel of predestination to them, that the characters are caught in a river of events that will sweep them to a future they would not choose for themselves but can't escape. While Carrie has its flaws, the core characters are strong enough to make this book a compelling read. Even if it isn't King's best novel, it is well worth picking up."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie, by Steven King, is a book about a girl that had trouble with kids in her high school. Carrie White was an overweight girl with many pimples. She had an extremely religious mother that thought anything that Carrie did was a sin. She would beat Carrie and throw her in a closet to pray. Carrie's father died before Carrie was born and her mother didn't even know she was pregnant until she had Carrie.One morning, period one at Ewen High School, Carrie was in gym. She was in the locker room when she started bleeding. She didn't know what was happening. She thought she was bleeding to death. She was seventeen years old and she had just gotten her first period. Everyone started throwing used napkins and tampons at her. She got to leave school early and on her way home she saw a kid fall off his bike, she was thinking of that too. A long time ago a similar thing happened. She found out she had telekinetic powers and learned how to use it to get back at the other kids that teased her.The way Steven King wrote and described each event made it easier to picture the scene while you were reading it. Being in high school it is easy to identify with the peer pressure he included as well as the torment of the unpopular students he described.I am not a big reader however I enjoyed this book. Although sometimes you could predict what might happen next, the way he tells the story keeps it interesting.Steven King wrote a good thriller. If you get a chance read Carrie. Carrie started a whole new kind of book, it started a different level of scary books."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen King's first novel Carrie is a classic film of horror.Sissy Spacek portrayal of Carrie White. Her performance wasamazing on film, combined with performances by newcomersWilliam Katt, Nancy Allen, John Travolta, and Amy Irving. Thisfilm is worth buying on DVD.This brings me to the unabridged audio version of Carrie (7.5 hours, seven CDs, Simon & Schuster Audio). This audio narration is done by Sissy Spacek. I like Spacek's simple narration. There is a problem with her narration. She has lost Carrie White's voice in her narrative effort. As a simple story, she does a great job . . . but you have to feel for the Character of Carrie (and you don't).In the audio version of the book, you can understand how this material seems slightly dated and needs a slight updating.Which also brings it down a notchBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"A book that changed American fiction and my life. Many do not remember what American horror/suspense fiction was like before Stephen King. \\"Tales From The Crypt\\" or gothic romance novels were it. A few sci-fi writers had produced some great stuff, but for the most part, it was a disrespected genre. Carrie was published when I was in 6th grade, and the local library put it in the adults only section. My sister-in-law read it and passed it on (a sin worthy of stoning in the small Maine town I grew up in.) I was horrified and fascinated by what the girls did to Carrie. I knew it could happen, had already seen it happen in a mild form. What I didn't know was how close to home Stephen King's novel would be. For the first time, there was a novel about teens that didn't sugar coat teen life in a Nancy Drew fantasy. It prepared me for the years immediately ahead, when I would be physically bullied by the \\"popular girls\\" - the gang who threw rocks when they caught me alone, beat me up at the town ice rink, spread nasty rumors and generally acted like popular girls all over America. For the first time, an adult actually put on paper what teenage girls do to each other. There was no turning of a blind eye, instead there was a microscope on that behavior. When Mr King took it one step further and dared to write what would happen if the victim had the power to retailiate... he instinctivly knew that she would be pushed too far and use that terrible power. Because the bullies always push too far. And I freely admit, if I had been given a special power, that little witch and her gang would have all been sorry for every tear they made me shed. Carrie made me feel I had the understanding of at least one adult in the world."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is the first novel by a young writer named Stephen King. It takes place in the near future year of 1979. The plot: a girl named Carrie White gets bullied, gains telekinetic powers and gets revenge on her tormentors. Much of the book is written in an epistolary structure, through newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts from books. This is an entertaining book. This King guy may have a future writing horror novels."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is an amazing book. You'll never be able to forget Carrie.Impossible to put down and very well written.

I was suprised at how the writting style is different from stephen's other works, this is more like a story and has articles from witnesses and other people added in. Very easy to read, I read it in about a 6 hour car ride."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is the third Stephen King novel I've read, just ahead of It and The Shining. Of the three, Carrie I'd probably rate as number 3- it was King's first book, and there-fore, is weaker by the standards of his later novels, but a good book none the less.We are introduced to Carrie White, a 16 year old girl is is chubby, hated at school, and has the power of telekinesis, or \\"TK\\" as it is referred to in the book. We follow her through an honest feeling of the awkwardness of being an outcast in high school- alot of people know that feeling, and the book hit's close to home. You'll recognize alot of the characters here, not as characters but as real people you'd known in high school.King has a way of giving real life to his characters and narrative, which some authors still can't seem to get right.All in all, a great book by a great author. One of the few times I've thought that the book and film version are both equally good, even at an apples and oranges kind of deal.Just one question; who would pay 400 dollars for a hardcover?"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I know this is minor complaint, but I couldn't figure out how old Carrie was in the book. Everyone assumes that she was sixteen. The Shadow Exploded (p. 54), a book frequently referenced that gives detail regarding Carrie's life, notes she was born September 21, 1963. However, the program given out to the students attending the Chamberlain High School Spring Ball had the date of May 27, 1979 printed on the front cover, making her fifteen. Further, the newspaper reporting the rain of stars happening on August 17, 1966 mentioned Carrie as being three years old when, in fact, she was only two. Finally, we know that Sue Snell and Tommy Ross were in the same senior class as Carrie. Sue mentions in her book that after graduating Chamberlain Jr High with Carrie, she set her sights on college, while Carrie was in line for secretarial school. Anyway, the point is, assuming they were all about the same age and in the same class as Carrie in May of 1979, doesn't it seem odd that they were all fifteen or sixteen at the time of high school graduation?"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book, could not believe how accurately Stephen King depicted the mind set of a sheltered teenage girl. I was expecting a good read, but this far exceeded my expectations. Cannot wait for the film adaptation with Chloe Moretz."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I just finished a re-read of this book. It was a bit different than I remembered.I think I took a lot more away from it this time than I did the first. Perhaps it's in light of the current problems regarding bullying amongst teenagers, or perhaps it's just that more than 20 years have passed since I last read it, and I am viewing it from a different perspective. Whichever it is, I enjoyed revisiting the town of Chamberlain and all its residents.I also enjoyed (very much) how the story was related. Little bits from the White Commission (the investigatory body formed to discern the truth about what happened in Chamberlain), fake AP news bits, and tidbits from books later written about the Carrie White case.The only thing I would've have liked would be a little more meat to the story. Not something I would normally say in regards to Mr. King! : )All in all, I'm very glad I re-read this book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book has a great story. It's a little slow at times, but it's a nice length and still a pretty quick read. This is the first Stephen King book I ever read, and it definitely made me want to read more. (I've read two since, and am reading another now) The last 30 or 40 pages are incredible and definitely worth chugging along through the slower scenes. I was very impressed with how tense this book got and well it ends. It's a bit of a wait for the grand finale but once it comes you just can't put it down. Carrie is really sad, and takes a while to build suspense, but considering this is King's first published novel I'd say it's probably one of his better novels out there."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen King really is a good story teller, the book isn't that long but I like it regardless. If you like other Stephen King books, you should give this book a shot."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I'm a Stephen King fan so this is not easy for me to say but... Carrie is not one of his better books. It was the first book he published and you can tell.

I think that's why I didn't enjoy this as much as if I never heard a thing about the book. Still it's a really good read even if you do know about \\"the prom\\". Nice and short (I wish more books edited this way).King does a great job walking the line between unbelievable and plausible. He gets how human behavior varies with the clever banter he has between his characters, just a joy to read. I'm a late comer in his fan club and I'm looking for my next King novel to read.

Haven't found a King book I didn't like."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"If I remember right this was the first novel that Stephen King sold, and the first to be made into a movie. It is a great story, about a girl entering late puberty, scorned by her classmates due to what they perceive as her weird way of dressing, controlled by a hyper religious mom. Carrie develops telekinetic powers and the tables are turned on everyone who torments her. Great character development and a well known horrible ending. A great introduction to King for those who have not read the story."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book had a deeper and more complex scare than the movie. The levels of abuse from Carrie's mother draws chills down your spine and makes you wonder how many people are in the world that are REALLY like that. I've seen the movie several times but never read the book. That was a big mistake. Carrie's revenge is much more devastating than the movie let's you believe.It reminds me of all the modern day school shootings we are experiencing today. This is a Stephen King's Classic and a must read."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book was very interesting and very hard to put down. It doesn't help that there are no chapters. Although a few parts were ruined by people talking about the movie, I enjoyed it very much and finished it in one day."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have to say that I was suprised by this book. It was my first time reading a Stephen King book, and I thought I would get confused with all the science fiction stuff, but I was confused very rarely by this book. In some ways I thought it was better than the movie because the book goes into more details of all the characters lives. I liked that it was a lot different than the movie, and I didn't feel like I was reading the movie script. I think this book is great for anyone who's a Stephen King fan. This was very good considering it was his first book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is of course entertaining, what King novel isn't?, but it does have it's problems. Carrie is about an outcast in a small rural town named Carrie White. Carrie has a fanatically religious mother and is picked on relentlessly by the other girls in her high school. When the girls finally push Carrie over the edge in a horrifying scene in the girls shower, she realizes she has telekenisis, and she intends to use it.Overall Carrie was an entertaining novel. What I didn't like is the completly unbelievable portrayal of Carries mother. She doesn't even say anything that isn't fire and brimestone or she doesn't do anything but pray and kick Carrie into the closet. Most of King's psychopaths are fairly believable, like Jack Mort in Drawing of the Three and Jack Torrance in The Shining, but he misses the mark this time. I also thought the villians like Chris and Billy were very one dimensional. They are not complex and they are totally unsympathetic.I won't grade down to much for these problems because this is his first novel and it's a damn good first novel. I liked how he used newspaper articles and excerpts from books to fill in the background of characters. Overall if your a King fan you'll like this, but if your wanting to get into King, read The Shining or Salem's Lot, you'll like those better."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"...Perhaps one of the most exceptional horror stories published the second half on the twentieth century, \\"Carrie\\" is a story that relates to every single teenager at some point in their lives, which is what makes this Stephen King novel one of his most powerful works ever. Carrie White is no ordinary high school girl, and the other students obviously knows this, and they treat her like living hell. But what they don't know about Carrie is that she is ready to snap--to abolish all of the shameful feelings that she has about herself, to quiet her critical, overly-religious mother, and to inflict revenge on those who have hurt her with her telekinetic powers. King portrays his Carrie in a spell-binding fashion, taking us through the tribulations of her first period, the secret love that she has for one of the most popular boys at school, and the riveting prom night in which Carrie's inner demons take full force. Although not long (256 pages), \\"Carrie\\" is the definition of a page-turner and a novel that should be read in one setting in order to get the full effect. A true trimumph of horror, emotion, and hate. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Yep, when Steve first starting writing Carrie, he gave up on it and through it into the garbage. His wife Tabitha saw it in there, took it out, read it, and convinced him to finish it. So, I think we all owe much thanks to her for that. Who knows? Maybe Stephen would never have gotten his break if it wasn't for that? And what a break it was! At the time, he was married, had two children, was working as an English teacher, and was selling short stories to magazines. He was living pay check to pay check and had to pick up extra jobs in the summer. He could hardly afford anything (even proper medecine for the kids!), so when his agent called and told him that the paperback rights to Carrie sold for four hundred thousand dollars, you can bet that it changed his life!And now on to the book. This is on of the finest written debut novels ever. Steve gets inside not only Carrie White's head, but all of the other characters: from Carrie's religious fanatic mother, to the sex-crazed teenagers. I've always been amazed at how well King develops characters that are nothing like him, and unless Steve is keeping a really big secret, I doubt that he has ever been a teenage girl, struggling with a psychotic mom and newfound telekinetic powers. I think we should credit Tabitha (a fine writer herself) again for helping out. Not only is King good at character development, but he also knows how to move a story along. This is a short novel, so of course the pace is pretty fast (I read it in a day), but even on longer novels like It (let's pretend Insomnia and Dreamcatcher never happened) he keeps the plot going and knows what is important to the story and what to cut out of it. Overall, Stephen King's constantly brilliant writing ability absolutely astounds me. And, as a fellow author (yet to be published), also makes me a bit jealous.This is definitely a book you should read. It's not one that will go down in history, but it is an exciting, entertaining book that you won't put down until the final page has been read, and when you think about it, not only is that an accomplishment in itself, but it is all that a book really needs to be."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie, by Stephen King, is an intense novel guaranteed to make the reader wonder about their current surroundings. A high school girl, Carrie White, who has been deprived of many luxuries, is the school's outcast. Her mother, the cause of most of her pain and misery, forces Carrie to be an outcast, not only in her school, but an outcast of society, by not exposing her daughter to \\"normal, everyday life\\" occurrences. Also, Carrie is not what one would call an \\"ordinary\\" child. She has been blessed with a sixth sense, telekinesis. The people of Chamberlain, Maine, all believe that Carrie is a devil worshiper and choose to have nothing to do with her or pick on her because she is \\"different.\\" Who knew she would actually reprimand the people.Among the many great qualities of this novel, is the introduction of reports taken and written during and after the destruction of the high school's junior/senior prom. These features add a nice twist to the book in that the reader can see both perspectives, Carrie's and the townspeople. King places them into the novel to add just enough information to keep the reader interested.The format of the novel adds to the story too. King presents the story as a flashback of the nights events. Foreshadowing of the \\"incident\\" is evident in Carrie. The reader is not aware of what is coming up but knows there is some kind of drastic event about to happen.This novel has no bad qualities to it. It is presented in a way that keeps the reader interested and involved while placing the reader in a horror story.I recommend this book to anyone who remembers his or her high school years. Carrie is a unique horror novel that proves that anyone's high school experience could not have been worse than Carrie White's."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"... Carrie by Stephen KingStephen King with once again a terrific novel. Although it was published in 1974. It was the first time I had read it. Just like most of Kings books. This one is a Science fiction thriller that you can not put down because the vengeance and chilling acts of violence take place on a regular base. The main character is Carrie White. She has the ability to encounter Telekinetic Powers and becomes a mass murder. With Kings quick-moving dialogue the novel never leaves you spellbound and hungry for the next twist in the plot.Once Carrie starts her horrifying rampage of revenge. As a reader it makes you feel complete sorrow for the receiver of the horrible harassment she dealt with from meritorious amounts of classmates. After reading the novel it should make you think twice about hurting others self-esteem and have a whole new perspective on what our world is like.After being placed in a complete different state of mind. I have realized this horrifying terror story is satisfactory for any type of audience. With the exception of the reader that don't enjoy reading about death and Science Fiction. I would recommend this to anybody especially if you enjoy Stephen King. I don't believe there is enough word to describe what kind of chilling suspense that the book Carrie compacts. It changes your views and leaves you with a blank. Thinking to your self. What if that really happened?"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Some, King among them, say this first book is raw. While that may be true, put this novel against nearly every other non-King horror book, and understand how good it really is.It is terrifying and original. At the same time, however, it forces everyone to look into their high-school personalities and ask &quot;what would I have done?&quot; Most like to think they would have opposed Carrie's abuse, but few can say that honestly.It's no Stand or Shining, but it's quick and freaky.(A quick clarification: Carrie is not based on two of King's students, but rather two of his fellow classmates growing up.)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I picked up \\"Carrie\\" after a 15-year hiatus from Stephen King's fiction (although I read his memoir on writing last year and enjoyed it a lot), and it was a slap in the face reminding me that I need to read more of his stuff. \\"Carrie\\" is a heavy articulation of the inexplicable and how we react to what we don't understand. And, given the recent spate of revenge-style schoolyard shootings across the country, \\"Carrie\\" also sticks out as a prescient social commentary. If only we'd listened.While other reviewers have been bothered by the narrative's melange of fictional, narrated segments and purportedly factual excerpts from trial transcripts, academic publications, etc.--and even what looks like a Xerox of a coroner's report--I think it's crucial to understanding one of the levels on which King's novel works so well. Part of what's at stake in \\"Carrie\\" is the relationship between fact and fiction, and how this relates directly to our understanding of what we can and cannot know, what we can and cannot explain. The cross-examinations of Carrie's friend Sue Snell drive this point home toward the novel's end; Sue is repeatedly asked how she \\"knew\\" what she is telling the court, given the haziness of the evening's events, and all that she can reply is, How do we \\"know\\" anything? This plays powerfully throughout one's experience of King's novel, because it begs a discussion of how something that we know is fiction (and thus not \\"true\\") can have such a powerfully visceral effect on us (read some of the many reviews on this site for evidence of how effective the horror in \\"Carrie\\" is). This is big game for a novel written so early in a writer's career, and King handles it well, opening up all sorts of questions that demand answers but that resist those answers with hostility.Recent events have shown just how accurate King's portrayal of the cruelties of the American high school experience has been, and he is also right on the money with a media critique (the tragedy's survivors are turned into celebrities and memoirists, and Reader's Digest chimes in with a ridiculous \\"Drama In Real Life\\" contribution). Where the coolness quotient is the center of every high school, beware of those on the margins. King's conclusion is even more ominous in its suggestion that this cycle is unbreakable.And what about that surprising conclusion? What's most amazing about it, perhaps, is that it's not a surprise, not one bit of it. From fifty pages into the novel, King has already told us who will die (hundreds of high school students, most of whom have been terribly cruel to the protagonist, and a few others from the town), who will be responsible (Carrie herself), and how it will be done (a tragic fire in the high school on Prom Night). The true test of his authorly mettle is that you read on anyway, and you are unable to stop. It's not surprises and expectations that push the reader of \\"Carrie\\" to the end; it's more like a voyeuristic need to actually see what we've already been told. This marks King off--along with Highsmith, maybe--as the truest heir to Edgar Allen Poe in American letters.Even the few moments that ring slightly false or unfriendly in this novel (high schoolers thinking like four-star generals, for example, or the pretty drastic portrayal of Christian fundamentalists) are never less than interesting. \\"Carrie\\" is a powerful and powerfully disturbing look at how people try to come to grips with those different to them, and how often and catastrophically they fail."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As one of Stephen King's new readers, I've had a pretty good run. I've read two Stephen King books that I loved and one that I liked. This is the first bump in the road on my path to reading more Stephen King. I didn't love Carrie and am sad to say that I wasn't really impressed with this book.The first thing that I disliked were all of the interviews and newspaper excerpts that were frequently used. Things like that are usually used in a more subtle way. Not only does he give away the entire plot by doing that, but in every single instance it took me out of a story that I was not completely into in the first place. I fail to see the effect that this had. I understand that he used it to sort of tell the story, but wouldn't it have been more effective to simply let it unfold naturally instead of reading it all second-hand? Anyway, that right there sort of bugged me.I guess the biggest reason that I didn't really like Carrie was because I just didn't care about a lot of the characters. I felt there wasn't enough background on them. Sure, I sort of sympathized with Carrie (it's kind of hard not to), but at the end of the novel I was like \\"Hmmm, it's over\\". I felt no turmoil for the events that unfolded. Usually, I find thoughts creeping in days after reading Stephen King's works and I'm still thinking about the characters. With Carrie, I doubt I will.So, while Carrie was a quick read, I was majorly disappointed in it. There were some good parts (the end was gripping), but you can really tell that this was Stephen King's first novel. It hasn't put me off reading any of his other works (mostly because, besides this, what I have read is great), but I wouldn't recommend it for any first-time King readers who just want to get a taste of his books before truly committing. I'd say to pick something else."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I read &quot;Carrie&quot; when I was in high school. Stephen King captured the essence of teenage life with great accuracy, I thought. At school people talked about the same things the shower girls in the first chapter talked about: parties, who's going out with who, who's dumping who, and a whole lot of other shallow topics that seemed really important at that age. For a first novel, King handled the dialogue well.Everyone knows the story: a misfit girl finally gets her revenge on a town that rejected her. Being telekinetic is something I'm sure a lot of people would envy, even if they don't envy Carrie's plight. But ultimately the school and the town brought their destruction on themselves. No one can ever predict when someone will snap and wreak havoc. Bullied students who aren't telekinetic have to rely on less subtle means such as pipe bombs and guns. And usually, the taste of revenge is less than sweet. But the results they aim for are quite the same: heartbreak, grief, confusion and despair. Perhaps bullying should be a criminal offense?I once read somewhere that when King was writing this novel he was so frustrated with it that he threw the manuscript in the bin. It was his wife who salvaged it and forced him to keep working on it. I also read that first novels are almost always autobiographical. Was King ridiculed in his youth? If so, then his international success as a writer is surely the best revenge."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"It was better than the movie and it was a very grounded way to look at what a normal person would do with telekinesis"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Blood, blood, and more blood. Menstrual blood, pig blood. Gushing blood, thickening blood. Blood dripping from fingers, spilling on legs, splattering from buckets. And a sickeningly sharp portrait of a telekinetic girl cornered by her mother and her high school piers into a dead end which offered only one way out - death. I admit I was lost at times in all the accounts of the Prom Night massacre told by different participants in different mediums, but I loved the resulting climax, the tension and the masterfully woven sense of terror. Love Stephen King, love his work, loved Carrie."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen King's 1974 novel \\"Carrie\\" was the fourth book King wrote, but the first he had published.He based the book on two girls he went to school with who were shy and introverted and in the novel he brought both girls together and formed Carrie who possesses telekinetic powers who seeks revenge on her clasmates who have tormented her for years. In the book Carrie is also being raised by a Bible-thumping nut of a mother who only makes life for Carrie even more hellish.This was the first book of King's to be made into a motion picture and it starred Sissy Spacek in the title role and garnered her an Oscar nomination as Best Actress, something rare for a horror movie. That film spawned many sequels and remakes with the latest to come out in 2013 and starring Julianne Moore as the mother."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"After reading Carrie, King's first published novel, there is no doubt why Stephen King rose to be one of the top authors in the horror genre.Carrie is not a huge novel, in fact it's a pretty quick read. This book is the tale of Carrie White, a girl that has been bullied and torn down at every turn by her overly religious mother and her fellow classmates. Carrie is also telekinetic (TK). A person can only take so much before finally breaking, and boy do we get to see Carrie break--and the whole town pays. What I think makes this book really work is if you take the TK out, you have a very REAL story.We know from the very start that the story has a very bad ending. Throughout the story, there are snippets and excerpts from court documents, interviews with survivors, etc.. This really builds up the excitement to the final moment when all hell breaks loose.Even non-horror fans can enjoy Carrie. Get this book and read it!!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is a novel that is often unfairly branded with the horror label because it was written by Stephen King. It's not a blood-and-guts, gory type of monster or ghost story, it's a drama/thriller with supernatural elements that would probably be labeled a tragedy if that was a term used for novels. The oppression suffered by the title character at the hands of her merciless classmates and fundamentalist mother seems all too realistic, and a good part of the book focuses on her torment in facing these real-life ordeals. The inclusion of her telekinesis, which finally empowers her to lash out at those who cause her misery, could be attributed to the fantasies of a young writer who had faced bullying and harassment himself in school hallways. Carrie is one of several stories King wrote about the bitterness and resentment young people experience as a result of social awkwardness and anxiety, including Christine and the Richard Bachman novel Rage. Carrie's most tragic quality comes from how King allows the character a brief moment of knowing how wonderful life can be, giving her a glimmer of hope that she can have the same happiness as everyone else, then subjecting her to traumatic pubic humiliation and the murderous religious fervor of her mother. Their deaths, and those of most of the town's graduating senior class, bring the tragedy to a close and leave the reader to ponder the cruelty and worthlessness of ostracizing or harassing people simply for being different. Carrie teaches a lesson as necessary today as it was 37 years ago when the book was published."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"His is the first real horror story i've ever read and let me tell you that i was not dissipointed! I really love the detail, the gore, the horror of it all, and, of course, the ending!! This book is truly a brilliant example of a good and well written horror story. I do however reccomend ages 14 and up at least. I don't mean to be a kill joy but im eleven and at first it really shook me up a bit. Which is really something because i watch things like paranormal activity and insidious. So watch out."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I've read plenty of Stephen King books over the years (some of my favorites are \\"The Stand,\\" \\"The Shining,\\" \\"It,\\" and more recently, \\"Duma Key\\") and if there's one thing Stephen King fans kind of expect out of the master of horror (besides lots of scares), it's a big, long book you can sink your teeth into. \\"Carrie\\" was King's first novel and it's anything but big and long. It's a pretty simple story, and if you've seen the movie, there's not a whole lot more to the story than that. Carrie White is the daughter of a religious nut, and has certain...abilities...that take center stage during the novel's frightening climax. She's been bullied and teased over the years, she's an outcast, but there are consequences for making Carrie's life a nightmare.It's an interesting tale that's even more appropriate in this day and age, given the rise in school teasing thanks to the internet and cyber-bullying. It's also interestingly written, with a good portion of the story told in epistolary fashion -- in other words, a lot of the story is told through newspaper clippings, interviews, letters, etc. All of this felt a little unusual for a Stephen King novel, and I've read that he didn't really think too much of it after it was written. But again, it was his first novel, and a pretty great one at that.If you're a Stephen King fan, it's a must read. If you're looking to get into King, but don't want to dive head first into one of his magnificent epics, this is also a great place to start."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"After having read about a dozen of his novels, I don't think any of his other works are as affecting as Carrie, though a few come close. This is really a SF/horror novel about a teen coming of age with all the problems teens deal with but with the power of telekinesis, and with a radical religious mother at home. She is basically all alone in the world and an easy target for bullies.It is far superior to the filmed versions.The final third of the novel is flawless in its writing, its execution, its structure. It is just an amazing piece of writing. Without ruining any of what happens (which is not like the film), King manages to create a character we grow to not just feel sorry for but love. That is a tremendous achievement.If you really want to appreciate King at his best, go back and visit his first novel. I think it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As with virtually everything Stephen King has written, this is enjoyable reading. It is also a quick-read for anyone who is intimidated by the length of some of the author's later works. I think the basic premise of this story appeals to many people because Carrie is, in many ways, the ultimate underdog, a girl terrorized by an insanely religious mother, victimized and persecuted by her peers, and alienated from the world around her. Everyone in life has been a victim or a bully, and I think the story of Carrie White does impart an important lesson to the folks out there who are treating someone they know the way that Carrie's classmates treated her. For those of us more sympathetic to Carrie's plight--the high school &quot;outcasts,&quot; the &quot;poor,&quot; the unpopular, the nerds, etc.--the story really matters here. Many of us daydream about the revenge we will exact from those kids who made fun of us all those years ago, and Carrie White shows us that revenge is not all it is cracked up to be. Carrie's &quot;triumph&quot; costs many innocent people their lives, and it doesn't really do a whole lot of good for Carrie herself.You don't need me to tell you why you should read or re-read this book. This is Stephen King. By this point in time, unless you are just coming of age, you have already read this book if you are one of King's legions of fans or even if you were ever curious about this man's phenomenal success. Even more of you have probably seen the movie. While the movie was pretty faithful to the book, not even the magic of cinema can convey the true weight and atmosphere of this (or any other) book. Carrie is also King's first published novel. This is very important to would-be writers--clearly, King was still learning his craft when he wrote this novel, and thus the process of reading it provides any potential writer with a great learning experience. The format here is significantly different from King's more mature work. The story is told through several &quot;voices,&quot; including a third-person account from a &quot;survivor,&quot; extracts from research articles and newspaper items based on the events, as well as a more traditional author's voice. Thus, we get several perspectives on the characters and events. The story is not as fluid as it might be because we switch from one viewpoint to another as the tale unfolds. While I much prefer the style of King's later works, especially in terms of getting inside a character, King still infuses Carrie's world with realism and believability, proving that he can create masterful atmosphere and mood with any number of literary tools."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I've seen plenty of the films that have been based on Stephen King's many novels, but this is only the first book that I've actually read by him. Much like the film that is based upon it, this book isn't so much a tale of horror, but more a coming-of-age tale. In it, we see young Carrie White, a total reject and loser by the standards of her peers, struggle with becoming a woman and realizing the strength of her newfound powers.Carrie is hated by the kids at her school, primarily because of her crazy and religiously twisted mother. Poor Carrie had \\"outcast\\" painted on her from her birth, which her mother saw as punishment for having sexual relations with her now deceased husband. Picked on constantly, Carrie begins to test her \\"flex\\" power that seems to have greatly increased in power since getting her first period. Things come to a head at the school prom, but that's all I'm going to say, since this story is so well known.Called \\"gory and horrifying\\" and \\"sheer terror\\" by reviewers on the back of the book, I didn't find any of that in here. In fact, I saw this more as a tale about a young girl who is so tired of being teased and attacked for being different that she seeks revenge. Of course, she has a rather unique and violent way of getting revenge, but I think that every outsider growing up wished that they had some sort of power that could protect them from the other kids who were popular, bullies or just plain mean.Of course, Sue Snell is another character that I'm sure we've all been at some time in our life. She picked on Carrie just like the others, but knew deep inside that she was wrong. She also knew that if she stood against the majority, she'd be ostracized exactly like Carrie.In short, this is a really good book. It's very fast moving and reads rather easily. The constant switching between thoughts, settings, and characters did become rather annoying at times, but overall this is a good story. It isn't that scary. In fact, it's more a reflection of society than anything.Recommended. It won't be my last King novel."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"CARRIE is a terrific book on its own; as a debut, it is simply astonishing. King's first effort does not at all seem the work of a novice. I loved the device of using excerpts from books and articles supposedly written about Carrie White and Prom Night; these chapters give an almost documentary feel to the book. In fact, for some reason, this book reminds me vaguely of HELTER SKELTER, which was, of course, a true story.Another thing that lends atmosphere to this is King's use of parentheses to show the reader his characters' thoughts and impressions (did he invent this? I can't think of another author who does this), giving the reader a real feeling of identity with the characters.It is also a very moving book; in addition to being a jolly good horror story, the characters evoke real feelings of sympathy. Carrie's plight is a familiar one; King evokes the middle-class high school pecking order with devastating accuracy, and the story, ultimately, is not only scary, but very sad.It made a very good movie, incidentally. I recommend both. I've read a lot of Stephen King, but this one is still my favorite."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I first read King's CARRIE when I was in the eighth grade. I am now a high school sophomore and this novel still remains a favorite. It's a tale of an outcast who discovers that she's been blessed, or cursed, with the rare and incredible powers of telekinesis. This means she can move objects and make things happen merely with the power of her mind.Both home life and high school life are nightmares, almost literally. King opens the story with Carrie getting her very first period in the locker room after gym class. She's up in arms about what to do - at 16 she has never experienced nor heard of such a thing. Her classmates turn vicious and scream chants of \\"Plug it up! Plug it up!\\" started by truly cruel Chris Hargensen. The girls then hurl tampons and sanitary napkins at her from the broken machine on the wall. Poor, helpless Carrie stands there, utterly confused and humiliated all the same, looking \\"the part of the sacrificial goat.\\" The \\"fun\\" stops when Ms. Desjardin, the gym teacher intervenes, slapping Carrie to snap her out of her hysterical fit.Carrie is sent home early that day. Out of all the girls, Sue Snell feels the guiltiest and wants to make it up to Carrie. So she convinces her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the prom. If you've seen the 70s movie, you know what goes down at the prom. If not, read and see.At home, Carrie deals with a religiously fanatic mother who never spoke about menstruation because she believed it was sinful. Mrs. White is a single mother who preaches, what she believes to be Christ's ways, all through the neighborhood. When Carrie is \\"bad\\" and \\"sinful,\\" she gets thrown into the prayer closet to \\"pray for forgiveness.\\" Everything in Mrs. White's mind is sinful. And because Carrie's father died, she has no one else to turn to for help.This novel, at times, is honestly horrifying. Lovers of scary stories (and King) are sure to enjoy this read. Some complain about the passages of Carrie White and her telekinesis but I found them to be the ideal story tie-in and quite useful to explain Carrie's past and further talk of her powers. If you've seen the movie, you may almost feel as if it's a must to read this book but that really isn't the case here. The book stands wonderful all on its own."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Fans have been waiting a long time for this Stephen King classic to be released on Audio CD. At first, Spacek's presence as reader seems like a dream come true, but it's actually a case of inspired stunt casting. Fans of Brian DePalma's film will likely be chomping at the bit to hear Carrie herself revisit this story. Spacek's audio interpretation is formal, stoic, and elegant...yet it lacks the urgency and intensity she brought to her work in the 1976 movie. Strange to hear this talented actress inhabit this pivotal role once again, and of course, fascinating on some level. But her interpretation of Carrie, despite her sincerity, is somehow aloof. It's in her reading of the character of villainous Chris Hargenson (the part Spacek was originally to have played in the film) that the narrator really delivers. Delightful to hear the sweet, refined Spacek curse up a storm and wallow in King's artful low-rent slang. Also a hoot to hear Spacek reciting lines delivered by Piper Laurie in the film: there's a bit of throaty, smoky angst that comes through many listeners will recognize and find welcome--especially, \\"I can see your dirtypillows...let's burn that dress together and ask for forgiveness.\\"Minor concerns aside, I imagine hardcore King fans and devotees of the DePalma movie will think they're in Audio book heaven, and for those who missed the 1988 musical version on Broadway, this CD makes a worthy addition to any \\"Carrie\\" lover's collection. The book is unabridged: all the memorable scenes and events are intact. Worth picking up, and a real oddity."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"'Carrie', Stephen King's first novel, is truly remarkable writing! Most authors don't have quite the stinging debut they hoped for, but this book deffinetly did, even today. The story is about a teenage girl named Carrie White who has a trumatic life, where home isn't safe, school isn't safe, and she isn't safe. She grows up with her psycho catholic mother who often locks her in the closet, and at school is constantly cutdown. cutdown doesn't even describe the humiliation and torture, the hell of carries life is the true horror in this story. So all of a sudden Carrie snaps, things start happening when she gets overwhelemed, and she starts gaining telekentic powers and hurting and killing anyone who stands in her way. I appreciated King's writing and description. He truly is a genius of his craft, and creates a realistic cast of characters. The story is really depressing, but if your like me, you enjoy reading the humiliation and torture, and keep reading in your morbid giddiness. This is my first Stephen King novel I have fully read, and I have never seen the movie, which makes the book much more fun. This is a classic."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"CARRIE is an absolute classic. It was the first book by King that I ever read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I passed my copy on to my good friend, Leah who devoured it in a few days, and went on and on about it when she returned it to me. Carrie White is a seemingly innocent schoolgirl who is constantly tormented by her cruel peers and her strange mother. Carrie holds a power inside her that comes purely from anger and hate. Her mother, Margaret White, has a very strange view of Christianity...forcing Carrie to go into a small closet and pray for forgiveness after events as innocent and simple as her first period. Carrie finally gets a break when Tommy Ross asks her to go to the Prom. Little does she know that her hateful classmates are planning a surprise for her. Innocent teenager, or demonic prophet of Satan...Carrie will make you shudder."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stones fall from the sky. The neighbors watch in horror as they devastate the house. They don't touch any other part of the street except for the white house, and the neighbors can hear the wails inside. Stephen King always catches my attention with the first lines of his book. Carrie is no exception. I believe it is one of the best books King has written. The reason I think this book is one of King's best is that his books are usually full of horror. This one is also, but this book also talks about real life experiences. That is why I think this book is good. The book starts by talking about Carrie's adolescence, which mostly consisted of her being made fun of. That happens a lot in high schools in today's age. A lot of people are singled out, stereotyped, and made fun of. That has been the root cause of a lot of tragedies in today's time. He also points out the way high school affects people mentally. High school is one of the building blocks of how kids act socially. If all people do is get made fun of, they tend to be bitter and mean. So I think he brought out some good relative topics, and that's why I think this book is the best. I do not like Carrie's mother at all. She is an eccentric, overbearing, religious psycho. All over the house, she has religious pictures or paintings of evil times that happened in the Bible. She preaches to be faithful to God yet she mistreats her daughter. She was so stubborn in her beliefs that she did not tell her daughter about her period because she thought this was sacrilegious. Carrie had her first period in the gym, and everyone made fun of her. Her mother didn't tell her; therefore she was made fun of by the rest of her class. Her mother does nothing but malign her daughter and then make her pray in a closet. This confinement did a lot of psychological damage on Carrie and was one of the reasons she was always made fun of. In the beginning of the book, King wrote that as a young girl Carrie was very pretty. But since her mother always manipulates her she makes Carrie feel terrible. I think that the mother is the cause of all Carrie's problems. That is why she is the character I dislike the most. I sympathize a lot with Carrie in this book. She has to deal with a lot all of her life. When she was in, school she had to deal with all the kids that made fun of her. Then when she got home she had to deal with her mother. Her mother is one of the biggest causes of her grief and she makes Carrie do her bidding. When she finally gets to the point where she rebels against her mother and gets some freedom, the kids at school make a joke out of her. Her whole life Carrie has been made fun of and put down. All Carrie wanted to do wanted to do was fit in and be part of the crowd. But because of her mother and her past, she has a hard time trying to do that. I think that the other kids could have accepted her or just left her alone. They had to play tricks on her and make fun of her. That just made the anger grow inside, and I understand how the rage unleashed on everybody. I sympathize with her life and understand why she did what she did. After going through all that she did, she is someone to feel sorry for the most. I believe that Carrie is one of King's best novels. He has excellent and realistic characters. In my opinion, a good book is one that people can relate life to. King is an excellent author, and this book I would definitely recommend for all the new King fans."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is King's famous debut novel. Though until Brian de Palma made the film, few people had even heard of it. But the film version launched the careers of King, de Palma, Sissy Spacek, John Travolta, and others.I admitedly have not yet scene the film version, but the book was great. King seems to be under the impression that this novel is very raw and unpolished, and perhaps he is right--I admit it isn't as polished as many books I've read, but I don't see this is a bad thing; if this is the case, perhaps it is what made the book so good. It was a very riveting book. King was also sucessful at getting at the emotional core of Carrie White, and other characters involved. It is a very worthwhile read, and goes by very quickly as it is only about 200 pages long (the original hardcover is 199 pages in length; I do not know the page count on subsequent volumes.)I definately recommend this book to anyone fond of the Horror genre or King's work (sadly, many people--dare I say most?--who read King do not read any of the other works within the genre; this is sad because some of the other talents out there surpass him by far.)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Few books I have read have provoked a response like Carrie did. King leaves out nothing in his first novel which he said he just had to write for all of the Carrie White's of this world. Things shocking and downright horrifying are told in great detail by King leaving me stunned. Unlike most of his novel which take the first 100 pages to really develop, King draws you immediately into Carrie's world in the opening scene. We are left shocked and sympathetic for poor Carrie, just like Susan Snell. King also provokes sympathy for Carrie through the horrible treatment from her mother. We are kept glued to the pages till we can't wait to see what will occur on prom night. I won't ruin prom night for you but let's just say that there are a lot of surprises, especially if you know nothing about the book or movie like I did. The format of the novel is a little peculiar and it takes awhile to get used to. At times, I just wanted to get the story moving along but the articles give useful and vital information to knowing what was happening outside of Carrie's world and mind. Carrie is also not as long as most, but King utilizes every word on every page to touch our every senses of the imagination. The dialogue looks to be a beginner's but is still very good. I am just finishing up high school and I see the kind of behavior of Carrie's nemesis' all the time. Every high school in America probably has a scapegoat like Carrie in it. It helped me especially to really think about the things that I say to people and the way I treat them. After reading Carrie, it amazes me the way we hurt each other every day in life whether we mean to or not. I can't blame Carrie for acting the way she did, and do not feel any smypathy for the kids that died that treated her the way they did. Carrie is the real victim in this story and it's a tragedy that there are too many Carrie's out in the real world that just want someone to love them. I loved the book and I'm sure you will too. It will really make you think about yourself and how you interact with people every day of your life."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This was the first book I ever read of Stephen King's and I was drawn in, hook, line and sinker (and a few other cliche's that come to mind). Perhaps it was that I was in high school at the time, and so are the main characters. Perhaps it was that I love the \`58 Plymouth Fury, which was the focus of the novel. Perhaps it was that I love a blend of ghost stories and psychological thrillers, and Christine fit both. But I think it was all of these, and the magnificent style that Stephen King had; the way he pulled at your mind and made you feel with the characters.The premise is not too hard to accept for any die hard horror fan: a car with a seemingly evil soul. But what draws you in is Arnie Cunningham. He is the quintessential nerd you either were, or knew in high school. You get to see this pathetec, yet lovable character taken from his own innocence by the evil of the car, and you get to see this through the eyes of his best friend. By the end you feel like you were Arnie's best friend too, right to the very end...I have enjoyed many of Stephen King's novels since that day I picked this one up, but never have I enjoyed any of them more than this. Many have come close...but none were better."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Oh my, this is great pre-modern King work. The introduction alone is great.I'm sure you have at least seen the movie, which I've heard is good, but in the words of (insert famous person here), &quot;The book is always better than the movie.&quot;Anyway, back to the book: it switches from first-, second-person, and news/ interviews from the aftermath.I say &quot;the aftermath,&quot; because after Carrie gets mildly frustrated, she kills 409 people ( and 18 are still missing ). Int he aftermath, a &quot;White Commission&quot; ( no doubt modeled after the Warren Commission ) is set up to investigate the &quot;disaster&quot;.Conclusion: Carrie gets telekinetic (TK) powers. Carrie gets mad. Chamberlain gets destroyed.P.S. Sorry if I ruined the story for you :-)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie written by Stephen King is a good book. It has many things to make it fit together. For example at first when she uses her so called telekinetic powers you don&#65533;t really know what it is, not until she goes to the library and checks out a book called \\"Telekinetic Powers\\". Then you kind of get the idea what she does when she either gets mad or just doesn&#65533;t want someone around. Also you can picture what they&#65533;re house looks like. The way you can see this is the good way Stephen King describes it. He describes it saying that they have crosses in every room and a praying room. Also about how her mother hates red, which tells you that she is really religious. Stephen King makes Carrie fit into the book perfect. He makes her have no friends and how he makes everyone hate her and make fun of her all the time. If it wasn't for those it wouldn't make sense for Carrie to have the telekinetic powers. She would not try to use her telekinetic powers to get everyone to leave her alone. She would have no reason to hate anyone because she would have a friend, and thats what would keep her together. Maybe she would use them to hate her mother with because her mother is really religious and while Carrie learns the truth about women stuff, her mother says its a sin. For example, her mother says to have breasts is a sin, but at school her physical education teacher tells her about women things and she learns its natural. Also her mother never told her about her period, but then at school after she thinks she is bleeding to death in the shower her coach tries to explain it is natural."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book was pretty dry, without much color or interior monologue, just leaving me with the creeps and not much understanding.

The novel has SO MUCH plot, and it is SO intriging, but it's not done well at all. The book is a flat, boring thing, from one of the best writers of all time. The book has the largest amount of dull, cardboard-cutout chatecters ever to be stuffed in one book. I mean, Brian De Palma's film version had GREAT charecter developement, (and also featured Halloween's PJ Soles, OH YEAH!!!!) and it was a very touching peice of work, you really felt sorry for Carrie. In the movie, Carrie is a misunderstood but sweet girl who simply needed some freinds, but in the book she was a WIERDO!!!! I will say that I saw the film before I read the book, but it only proves that the movie is one of the few film adaptions that is better than the novel (I read Pet Semetary, and was dissapointed with the film, I read Cujo, and was VERY dissapointed with the film), but Carrie, the movie, is WAY better than the book. I know I sound like one of those people who would rather watch a movie than read, but I love to read, and I love Stephen King's work, but this was one flat out dissipointment.If you enjoyed the novel Carrie, I would recomend the novels The Shining, Salems Lot, Pet Semetary and The Stand.If you found my review helpfull (I hope you did) please vote for me.Brett Michael Roberts"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Ah Carrie Mr. Stephen King's First Book and to tell you the truth a modern Classic (At least in my opinioun)Carrie tells the tale of a girl whos name is well you guessed it Carrie.

Carrie is a girl of Seventeen who goes to a regular high school but Carrie is not all the way normal she gets made fun of and things like that.The Story though really starts out in the shower of the girls locker room in Carries high school. Carrie dosent really like to take the Showers because well she'll get made fun off Carrie takes the shower (despite not wanting to) and something that can go wrong well it dose go wrong Carrie has her first Period of the only thing is that she dosent really know what this is because she has never been told about it Her Mother (well basicaly a Crazy Christan Lady (Something King tends to write about sometimes) has never told her about this or anything related to it. Carrie gets made fun of and worse she gets things like pads and Tampons thrown at her untill the Gym teacher interviens, the Gym teacher later sends her home.Things get a little tricky however when Carrie Finds out that she has. . . Powers, Strange powers that she dosent know what to think off. King has given us a powerful read here that i would highly recomend a good first read for fans and a good first published for Mr. King. 5/5"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Don't get me wrong, I a HUGE King fan. I love most everything he has ever written, he's a phenomenal author, yadda yadda yadda... but this book just didn't seem to do it for me. And it's a shame, ya know, because the basic idea is just so damn good! Zealot mom brainwashes and abuses daughter, daughter wants to break free, has telekinetic powers, made fun of at school, kills them all... that's great! But this book didn't have the character development that I've come to expect from King... maybe I've been spoiled! Also the plot seemed too simple - but that isn't my biggest complaint. Sometimes short and sweet is great. But why waste a wonderful idea on such short sweetness? Oh well, to each his own.

I only wish that Carrie hadn't died in the end"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie White was a weird little girl. When she threw fits...something broke, or moved. One day when she was a small girl, only four, saw her neighbor outside in a white two piece bathing suit. Carrie was curious and she wandered over to the yard, and saw the neighbor's \`dirtypillows'. \\"What are those?\\" \\"Those are my breasts, Carrie\\" Carrie's mother was horrified at what she had seen. Mrs. White screamed and scratched her face, and called Carrie to her closet to pray. Carrie screamed and kicked inside, and suddenly it stopped, and there was banging and clattering above them. People on Carrie White's street were horrified. Stones and ice were falling hard from the sky. From that day, Carrie's mother knew something was wrong...Did she have a special gift? Or was it coincidence? Oh, it couldn't be coincidence...Carrie White had something...Carrie White had Telekinesis...a rare gift of the mind that would enable that person to move things, break things, bend things and even make very unexplainable things happen. Carrie White had that power...and she caused the damnedest things to happen to the people of Carrie's town.I really enjoyed reading this book. I like reading the horror genre, and if you do too, you'll love Stephen King's Carrie. I liked this novel because it was horrifying, interesting and it kept my attention. King is a great writer, and you can almost feel Carrie's anger, sadness, fear, confusion, bewilderment, and embarrassment. The one thing I did not like about the book was: it was fast. King wrote it nicely, yet everything was happening quickly. I like books with a lot of action, but with spaces between each event. King did this, yet the spaces were not long enough. I like to read books that explain each little thing gradually working up to the event. Other than that, King did a wonderful job at making a great, horrifying novel. You should really read it today!..."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"If no one wants you, Carrie, I do! Marry me!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"After seeing the movie I decided to read the novel by Stephen King. Out of all of King's novels, this one has the best story yet. Carrie White is a fantastic character. I love the fact that King had this idea of a shy, scared, and abused girl in highschool unleash her ultimate telekinetic powers to destroy her classmates. It kinda reminds me of the Incredible Hulk. Don't get Carrie angry, or she will kill you. The book does have a couple of drawbacks though. Possibly the greatest drawback is that King says nothing about Carrie's life between 3 and 16 years of age. Stephen King practically left that huge gap in the book. But you have to remember...This was Stephen King's first novel ever published. King also says in the intro that he needed money fast for his family and had to write this novel in a rush. But overall, if you love novels on power and revenge, then this novel is a must read. I gurantee you that after finishing the novel you'll say \\"Good for those [darn] classmates. They derserve it.\\" To me this is the greatest revenge story ever written."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"THis debut by master Stephen King clearly showed that he was destined to stardom. But I'm not particularly his fan; I think he overwrites, he talks too much to get at his point!Also, this stuff of all his plots happening in Maine is getting a little bit repetitive.But, back to CARRIE. THe book is good, altough average and, according to King himself, a little bit outdated, but still a good novel."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I finally got to read this book, and I'm very glad I did.The main strength of 'Carrie' is definitely its story, which is simple, chilling and painful. The plot aches with tension as it unfolds, helped by the articles and books interspersed with the dialogue which foreshadow the violent conclusion. This conclusion is inevitable - things had to play out as they did because of the characters of the people involved - and this is one of the most tragic things about the story.However, this book isn't perfect. I can well believe it was King's first novel because although it's a good read, it is in some ways rather amateur. My main complaint is that I would have appreciated more information about the 'villains' of the piece, that is, Margaret White and Chris Hargensen. Both of them are truly horrible characters, yet there's little or no explanation of why they are like this. Margaret seems to have been a fundamentalist from an early age, but we aren't told why, and considering that her religious beliefs go a long way towards making Carrie what she is, more information would not have been out of place. Chris has even less information, and consequently comes across as pretty two-dimensional.The other main problem was that of Sue Snell. King seems to have been unsure whether she was as important a character as Carrie - although she contributes to the story by asking Tommy to take Carrie to the prom, etc, her own plotline seems a little superfluous. Her pregnancy fears are unexplored and difficult to empathise with simply because of this. I would have liked a little more interaction between her and Carrie simply because this would make Carrie's death scene with her less - unexpected. Sue just doesn't seem to interact with Carrie enough for the story to demand that she be present at Carrie's death.However, I still recommend this book. If nothing else, it's a good read, and it does make you think about high-school politics and bullying and if you have picked on someone like Carrie you'd feel pretty guilty. It's a very dramatic story - the writing is vivid and you can see the scenes play out in your mind - and it lingers in your mind after you've read it. Partly this is due to the fact that you are both very sorry for Carrie and horrified at what she's done - it's very hard to make a decision about her. Also the realistic academic books, newspaper articles and courtroom transcriptions add a nice touch because they root the story firmly in the real world (I feel this is especially valuable when talking about telekinesis, as this has often been written about and is very much identified with ghosts and unreal situations.)Read this book. You'll be left wishing King had said more about various things, but read it anyway..."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is similar to Misery in that it is a very straightforward tale without too many characters (though Misery is the extreme in having few characters). King shows his narrative power here in that the premise is fairly straightforward but he makes the story captivating and invigorating. In a sense it feels a bit like King is showing off his ability to tell a good story by not having any secrets. Via newspaper clippings and interview snippets after the present of the story the reader knows from the beginning that Carrie ends up dying, that the town is destroyed, and that the world has reacted to the events described. This bit of \\"non-fictional\\" aspect to the novel is effective and fun.Overall Carrie is a good choice both for King fans and fans of fine storytelling."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I Think that seeing the movie first kind of ruined the book for me but anyway I love the book because it gives soo much more detail then the movie did.

It was kinda sad how kids were so cruel to Carrie, and how she had such a religious mom who didn't even let her sleep with a pillow. There were some happy moments, like when Carrie was Prom Queen.I gave it 4 stars because of those little paragraphs about telekenisis. They were useless if you know about TK and Carrie's situation. But besides that, the book is really, really good!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie was one of the coolest books that I've read in my life. It is scary, funny, suspenseful, and has an enthralling story to go along with those other things. This book is about Carrie, a high-school girl that is misunderstood and made fun of. She can move things using mind force and she learns that what she has is telekinetic powers. After a boy asks her to the prom it looks like she is having a great time until she is prom queen and while sitting in the chair pig blood falls over her. She has had eough and is fed up. Destruction time!!! Carrie, using her telekinetic powers, destroys the whole city and gets her point across. She murders, sets fires, and has police from all over MAine have to come and fight. I won't give away the overall plot but you must read this book. Whether you are a Stephen King fan or just an avid reader you will really enjoy this book by the King of Horror. Don't wait another second before buying this book. You'll really love this enthralling book that will stand out forever!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The book i read was Carrie by Stephen King. The book was a little difficult to read... It was pretty much about a girl named Carrie was a misfit and school and she always got picked on. Her home life didn't help either, her mom was a jesus freak. Her mother didnt teach her alot so when she got he period in gym class she had no clue what was going on cause no one had told her. So you could probably understand how confused this poor girl was.Some of the popular people thought it would be funny to make a big seen at the prom! So the most popular guy asked her out to the prom . the girl was so excited and on top of everything she won prom queen. But when she went to get the crown the spilled pigs blood all over her.

It's very well written and holds the attention of the reader. I'd recommend it for more advanced or mature readers due to the exclusive material."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This horrifying and gory book called Carrie written by Stephen King is by far one of the best books I've ever read. This fiction book is about a girl who grows up with only one parent, her mom. Her mom teaches her that natural every day occurrences are acts of the devil and that they're sins. When Carrie talks about or commits one of these sins she is punished by being thrown into a closet where religious things are placed and she is forced to pray for hours on end.Throughout the book Carrie is tormented by others just because she is a quiet individual. She is mainly tormented for not knowing what menstruation is. Her peers physically and mentally abuse her. This incident is so big that the school actually is going to court with the family of the ring leader of the ones who did this to Carrie.Carrie finds out that she has these powers when she gets angry. When the menstruation incident occurred a light bulb blew out because she was so angry. Another time she found she had powers was when a little boy was tormenting her while she was walking down the street she mumbled to her that she wished he would fall over. She turned around and saw the little boy on the ground with his little bike on top of him. Towards the end of the book Carrie is finally fed up with her high school bullies. While attending a school dance Carrie uses her powers and starts a fire. Almost all of the students in attendance are trapped in the fire. A boy named Billy who Carrie hates and Sue Snell who feels bad for Carrie talk 2 the cops and the press. They inform them that Carrie did it. They find Carrie a ways away when they take off in their car and she is dripping wet with blood, but its not hers. She is also holding a butcher knife. Carrie later that night dies at 2:00 am of hemorage and shock. They turn her body over to the state of main to investigate TK. I liked this book a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who like thrills."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As a man who lived in a house full of women, and author ofTrue Monsters (The Shepherds Wolf), I know second hand about the social pressures that happen to a high-school girl. Considering this excellent contemporary novel is written by a man who had never gone through high-school as a woman, I found it made teen females a little more understandable.Is it the definitive experience? Of course not. It's a S.E. Hinton novel mixed with Robert Bloch.It is a gripping, and nuanced piece of work written by a man at the start of his career, and his life.Would Stephen King written this kind of novel today, post accident, information-age saturated culture? Maybe. But it would be a very different novel, and as such should become part of English reading curriculum, if only for an example of the lifestyle's of teens living in a different era."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The story is about a teenage girl named Carrie White 17 years old who has a trumatic life.

(Rage and The Long Walk were written before this).I came at this novel after reading many more of his books, and thus was a bit disappointed. It's a fairly slight novel. King has said that he tossed the story into the wastebasket due to his feeling that he was inadequate to the task of getting inside the minds of a young girl, and his wife rescued it and encouraged him to continue his efforts. His editor, Bill Thompson, said that he encouraged King to revise the story to make the characters more sympathetic, something that surprises me, since I always thought King naturally did this with his characters and wouldn't require encouragement to do so. King says he fleshed out the story with many inserted newspaper articles in the various styles of the respective publications, and this was one of the most boring parts of the story, for me. I think I've only read the story once, which is unusual for early King novels. After this first book, he became so much better."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This was a really good book. The reason I only gave it four stars is because I felt King rushed the middle, when things REALLY started to happen. If he had put even more detail into it.....this book would have been the best."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"King's first novel has incredible power, as incredible as the psychic abilities of the title character. It doesn't always work, unfortunately; the outtakes and quotes from fictional studies of the paranormal become a little trite. That's a mere quibble, however. The meat of the book is engaging and intelligent, and the characters are fully realized. While the novel lacks the polish of later novels (The Shining, The Dead Zone, Insomnia), it also lacks the bloat. Recommended."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is wish-fullfillment at its best-take a lonely, withdrawn girl, tormented and ridiculed by her classmates, unable to form relationships, toss in a psychotic mother- whose psychosis manifests itself in religious mania, a long-gone father, and what do get - a recipe for Crazy Salad if ever there was one. In all seriousness, King shows the misery of somene who is cast-off from society in a really big way, and utterly unable to connect with anyone. Carrie finally responds with understandable rage, and her way to get back at all and sundry involves some of the best horror scenes ever, especially in the movie version, with Carries mother ending up crucified. Thats one solution, but people without the ability to blink their tormentors to a fiery end, would be better off saving their pennies, leaving thier dysfuntional families, and yahoo neighbors and moving out of town. Its better than getting caught in Dantes Inferno, and I mean this for Carries sake, not the creeps she knows."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This was my fist Steven King book and I wanted to read this before I see the Brian DePalma movie.

For one of Stephen King's first horror books, it was deeply intense, and satisfying all well serving a good point, the fact that people who are tormented by their peers will become repressed people. It was fun to read, and hopefully instead of scaring people will send a message to them, treat others the way that you would want to be treated."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Having already seen the movie version of &quot;Carrie&quot;, I expected to be bored while reading the book.Not so,and although the book isn\`t technically &quot;scary&quot; it still evokes a feeling of sadness for some of the characters,as they are shown to be ordinary people.The book is fast-moving and you always want to read just that bit more. However,I have a few complaints.Firstly,the book is relatively short and it appears as though it was written specifically to be adapted into a movie.I enjoyed &quot;Carrie&quot; and thus will give it 4 stars,although it\`s not as strong as &quot;Salem\`s Lot&quot; or &quot;The Stand&quot;."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I caught the last half of the 1976 film adaption of \\"Carrie\\" on TV a few years ago. The red prom scene made a lasting impression on me, and I decided to revisit it by reading the book last night. The general plot was as captivating as ever, but its presentation greatly detracted my enjoyment. The frequent interruptions of newspaper article, interview, book, and letter excerpts, all dated after the events of the story, pretty much gave away the entire ending. This was really irritating for me because I was trying my hardest to pretend I didn't know what was coming. The format stilted the flow of the book, especially during the climax, so much that by the ending I was skimming over the excerpts even though at that point they carried much of the plot.I found myself slowly disengaging from the story also because of disbelief. The excerpts seemed to explain too much background and reason behind the events of the story. I don't know the 1970s that well, but I think modern society generally rejects the idea of telekinesis and other paranormal activity. If I were to guess the aftermath, I would say the majority of the world would chalk it up to a freak accident and only a few would believe/know the truth, and fewer would have the guts to publish their beliefs. I found myself scoffing at the articles that explained telekinesis as a recessive trait only dominant in females - that seems like a little too much scientific support. And by the time people started hearing Carrie's thoughts..eh..I wasn't into the story anymore.The characters often seemed way more mature and understood more than was realistic. Even the prom scene didn't make complete sense - why would Carrie use her powers as an afterthought? I thought the premise was that her power exploded out of her control when she was in emotional agony...the movie did Carrie more justice in the end. I'm probably biased because I saw the movie first, but even then, beyond the plot, I wasn't very impressed with the book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As a big fan of Stephen King's earlier work, I found Carrie a bit disappointing (before reading on, note the existence of plot spoilers). The strange, 16-year-old late bloomer's initial surprise at the sight of blood, having started her period (for the first time ever and completely uninformed about the process of menstruation), while standing naked in a communal shower with her classmates, turns from fear to humiliation as her bullying peers pelt her with tampons and sanitary napkins, which they all somehow happen to have conveniently at hand (the logistics behind such a happening seem unlikely). Guilt-ridden, a popular girl gains a conscience and, trying to redeem herself for participating in the pelting (with tampons) incident, tries to redeem herself by conning her handsome boyfriend into taking the telekinetic girl to the prom. Expectedly wary, Carrie agrees, though must first foil her religious-zealot mother's attempts to prevent her from attending. A trip to a farm by a bad guy and his unsuspecting accomplices yields a bucket of pig's blood. If you don't know what happens next, you have not been paying attention. After a surprise (rigged) crowning of Carrie and her date as prom king and queen, blood begins to spill, literally and figuratively. Carrie gets revenge on a colossal scale against those that chose to do her wrong, and others that didn't. The story's format, told through various sources, including interviews, book excerpts, and incident reports is merely a distraction to an already unlikely story. Of the dozen or so SK books I've read, this may be my least favorite. Better: The Dead Zone by Stephen King, Firestarter by Stephen King, Sybil by Flora Rheta Schreiber, The 3 Faces Of Eve by Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey M.

Telling the story of Carrie White, an abused misanthrope of a teenage girl, the novel follows Carrie's life through two stories: one of various news articles about Carrie and the White family, and the story from Carrie's point of view itself.Without going into detail, the novel starts off with Carrie having her first period during her gym period shower, when, all of a sudden, she finds herself bleeding in a place she has never bled before. While her fellow classmates yell 'Plug it up, plug it up!' and throw tampons at her, Carrie is horrified by the fact that she may actually be dying. When the gym teacher finally comes in and breaks it up, managing to calm Carrie down with a slap to the face, even she is surprised to find that Carrie has never known about periods.This is where Margaret White, Carrie's religious psychopath mother, comes into play.An essential part to the storyline, Margaret White shows the danger of having an overbearing. religious parent playing God with a teenager's life. Oftentimes forced into a prayer closet for hours upon a time, Carrie is unable to escape the abuse she goes through. At school, at home, and oftentimes even in her own mind, her anger is slowly building, and her anxiety is slowly bringing about an ability that has been hidden inside her body for years on end.First comes the blood, then comes the boys, looking for that smell, Margaret White says. Then the windows slam shut and Carrie demands that she be given free will.This climax of the novel--when Carrie finally gains the strength to stand up to someone--is what brings the novel to its highest point. What happens next is horrifying, gratifying, and at the same time, relieving.One thing I had trouble while reading with the novel is reading both stories going along with it. As I mentioned above, it is written in two segments: part in news articles and interviews, and part through Carrie herself. While I would have preferred reading about Carrie herself, and though I was distracted by the random intervals during which interview/clipping scenes were placed, I can't blame King for putting them in. The backstory it adds is great story fodder, although it would have been better if it would have been interspersed throughout the novel.Regardless of its age, and though King has matured as a writer since then, Carrie is one of THE King novels you have to read if you ever pick King up. It's a great starting point, and even though it's not appropriate for all ages (especially younger readers,) it's a book any horror fan would enjoy."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"&lt;I> Carrie &lt;/I> is King's first novel not written under his Bachman pseudonym. And thank the good Lord that his wife fished this one out of the trash!It's a thoroughly enjoyable, genuinely spooky story about a characteristically 'normal' town in (where else?) Maine where a certain put-upon little girl is slowly building up something terrible inside her.A testament to how frightening &lt;I> Carrie &lt;/I> is that despite the fact that the ending is telegraphed (you pretty much know who bites the dust before they do), it's still pretty damn frightening.And what scares me more than that telekinesis stuff is Carrie's 'mama'. She's a religious nut who's probably not unlike a lot of evangelical Christians. She's a damn scary character and you could be living right next door to a 'Margaret White'.

Not the case here!!!!!! The destruction Carrie causes in the movie is nothing compared to the destruction she causes in the book! It is far from being exactly the same, and even if you have seen the movie and &quot;think&quot; you know the plot, the ending of this book will surprise you nonetheless.&quot;Carrie&quot; is the story of a lonely, outcast girl with no friends or people to talk to. She is stuck with a religous fanatic, and quite frankly, a madwoman for a mother. Carrie is the butt of every joke, the person you can always make fun of and torment. Finally, after gym class one day, when the girls are in the locker room showering, she is pushed almost to the limit when she gets her period. She doesn't know what is happening (her crazy mother never bothered to tell her because she thinks that having a period is a sin), and thinks she is bleeding to death. The girls all laugh and throw things at her. But that is only the beginning of the story.Carrie soon discovers that she can do strange things with her mind, such as move an object, lock a door, or make a candle fall over. She discovers that she can take control of a situation using her powers, and she also discovers something else...she can get revenge.One night at her prom (someone arranged for her to have a date, otherwise she never would have gotten one), she is humiliated one time too many, and finally snaps, using her powers to cause death, destruction, and mayham!Want to find out how this all ends?

I certainly don't want to be an apologist for Carrie, or for her real-life counterparts, but this novel should be a lesson--whether King meant to teach it or not--that the bullying and teasing and harassing kids can do in school has severe, negative emotional consequences on the victim. So first and foremost, this book is excellent because King is able to make his readers root for a character who exacts revenge on her tormentors in a most spectacular fashion.&quot;Carrie&quot; also is a good read because of the use of &quot;book&quot; and &quot;commission&quot; references King sticks in throughout as a device to move the action along. This allows the reader to get a &quot;distance&quot; perspective of events even as the events are unfolding. It also lends &quot;credibility&quot; to the story, giving the reader the feeling that this story is factual, and as such, far more scary."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is early SK.

The restrictions placed upon us as we grow, sheltering from the truths of life. Stephen King's wife was right when she took this manuscript out of the trash, handed back to him and told him to finish. And &quot;Carrie&quot; shows what can happen when someone cannot take bullying anymore: it's there, but the results are unknown until it's too late. &quot;Carrie&quot; is exceptional and shows that Stepehn King isn't just &quot;one of the basic writers&quot;."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have to say that this an excellent story that i have read.

The book has nothing that is mind-bogglingly new. It is straight-forward and common-sensical. However it obviously comes directly from the author's personal experience and will help you steer through the complexities that might arise should you decide to pursue a polyamorous lifestyle.What is refereshing is that Wendy does not try to proselytizein this book: she does not try to advocate this lifestyle as the only way. The author takes a mature attitude and one does not feel that she has adopted this lifestyle for the sake of rebellion. In other words, the works flows from her center.

The author is a poet who lives the alternate lifestyle. The focus of her book is not limited to polyamorous sexual relationships, but goes beyond that to the many forms in which love and intimacy are shared.

More explanation, more details, more mechanics."},{"Title":"Redefining Our Relationships: Guidelines For Responsible Open Relationships","review":"This is one of the newer texts on polyamory. The author does a good job giving a pragmatic, down-to-earth perspective on the subject and it's an easy read, though she abhors the term for some reason and refuses to use it. This strikes me as especially odd since the term now appears in several dictionaries and is familiar even to mainstream America more than any similar term. Still, as a polyamory skills educator I am happy to endorse this book and welcome it as a good addition to the still meager offerings to be had on polyamory. - Anita Wagner"},{"Title":"Redefining Our Relationships: Guidelines For Responsible Open Relationships","review":"This is one of the lighter-weight polyamory books (although the author dislikes the term \\"polyamory\\" and never uses it in the book), but Wendy-O Matik is good at giving permission to think for oneself, along with general ideas about loving outside the box. She has a very appealing, open definition of non-monogamy that is about intimacy rather than any particular sexual expression, or even equating \\"lover\\" with \\"sexual partner.\\" A chapter by guest essayist Famous is called \\"Some of Us Have Kids,\\" but most of the book is about the (possibly) freer ones amongst us who don't.I also loved the illustrations by Erin Brookey. \\"Erin's medium consists of her own undergarments, lingerie, safety pins, and joural entries, which are then carefully hand-stitched together and sealed in plastic ...\\" She then appears to have sketched her pieces as the book illustrations.Altogether, this is a collaborative effort that normalizes artistic and relationship choices."},{"Title":"Redefining Our Relationships: Guidelines For Responsible Open Relationships","review":"Whether to put more emphasis on one's politics or one's personal life has been a running debate between activists, organizers, and rebels of all sorts for a long time now. Where does your personal life stop and your efforts to change the world begin? Is there something in between? How do you go about living your life that goes along with your principles? These questions sometimes haunt me, because you can never really separate yourself from mainstream consumer society no matter how much you dislike capitalism. However, in this life, while you make compromises so you can exist, at what point do you go too far? I'll usually veer away from these sorts of thoughts since I've seen it cripple many politically-minded people and make their heads spin. The worst part is the questions continually come back.Relationships are a huge part of who we are simply as human beings. Whether it's sex, friendship, love, simple companionship, or something in-between all of these, humans exist as social creatures. In fact, any healthy social movement for change develops strong relationships on individual and mass levels. So what's so radical about that? Well, it may look more radical when you start to think about how many things in our society have been the result of domination, control, and exploitation. Ultimately, much of what we think of as romantic relationships in the West is based on about male control, patriarchy, and jealousy, (which again, we all grew up with in this society). Alternative relationships, or open relationships where no one person has control over another's feelings, is an alternative model. In \\"Redefining Our Relationships: Guidelines for Responsible Open Relationships,\\" Wendy O Matik, explores how an open relationship, based on trust, honesty, and maturity, would actual work.When it comes down to it, I highly recommend this book. I've gone back and forth on the monogamy vs. polyamory issue. (I don't like the term non-monogamy because I don't like defining myself as what I'm against.) Sometimes I won't do it because my partner is against it, and other times we compromise to adopting it. Wendy writes here that the key towards a successful open relationship is to be honest with one another that humans will be attracted to other people, and they can't shut that part of them down just because they're with someone else. Jealousy, much like rage, can shut a part of you down and hate someone you're supposed to love, or when someone cheats on monagomy. Wendy also makes the good point that relationships aren't just a black/white thing where you have lovers and friends, and nothing else. Another excellent point she makes is that open relationships do not mean irresponsible relationships where you don't have to take your partner's feelings into account or can just go marathon bed-hopping without letting your partner know what's going on.If you're even just curious about open relationships or wish to explore exactly what love is, Wendy-O Matik is a great start, since it's a fast, short enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Redefining Our Relationships: Guidelines For Responsible Open Relationships","review":"It's so wonderful to know that I'm not alone in wanting more out of life, but still wanting to remain married.

The second half of the book deals with the Semi-Slav Botvinnik, Moscow, Meran, Anti-Meran at roughly 126 pages and 52 games. I like the way that this book is written explaining the strategic ideas behind each variation. Also another nice thing about the book is the author recommends his favorite lines and the percentage statistics for white and black. This is nice to know but at the 1700-1800 level it is not very important. At the end of the book are a few quizzes where a position from a slav or semi slav is given, from games that were discussed in the book and you are supposed to guess the move. This is a good memory test to see if you remember the position and what to do in it. I wish there were other problems the author added that were originial given with analysis so that it was not just a pure memory test. This book is a must read for any one who plays queen pawn openings as the slav and semi-slav and the positions explained in this book occur in many openings and it is nice to know the strategic ideas. It was a good buy, and I hope to see more books on the subject from the author. The author has also written several other books on the slav, but in this book he has explained it to the masses."},{"Title":"Starting Out: Slav & Semi-Slav (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","review":"If you are a chess player who is looking for a defence to 1 d4, consider the ideas in this book. The book is up-to-date, with plenty of annotated recent games as examples.The book covers the lines resulting from 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6. Quite often, White continues with 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 Nc3. And, in this introductory book, Flear explains how to play either side of the major lines which follow:4...dxc4 is the Slav.4...e6 is the Semi-Slav4...a6 is the Chameleon, a waiting move that is considered part of the SlavIn some cases, White plays 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 e3. Black can now reply 4...g6, the Schlechter, which the author also has a chapter on.But there is a line which I think is a nuisance for Black. White can simply play 3 cxd5, the Exchange Variation. Black has to recapture, and the game becomes relatively easy for White. As the book shows, Black is not in serious trouble in this line, but I certainly would rather have White.There is a way, however, to pretty much avoid the Exchange Variation. As Flear shows, Black can play the Triangle. That's the move order I recommend. Black plays 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6. After 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 Nc3 c6, Black is playing a Semi-Slav and has avoided the Exchange Variation. White can still take the pawn on move 3, but it isn't as good a line.Most likely, White will play 3 Nc3. Now, Black plays 3...c6, blocking her Queen Bishop even more. This is the characteristic position of the Triangle. White's main choices are:4 e3, after which Black has a choice: play 4...Nf6 and get to a Semi-Slav in which White's most dangerous move, Bg5, has been avoided. Or play 4...f5, transposing to a very playable version of the Dutch Stonewall (although White can still play 5 g4).4 Nf3, after which Black can play 4...Nf6 and get into a Semi-Slav in which White does indeed have the option of playing 5 Bg5. Or play dxc4, the Noteboom, which is wild but okay for Black.4 e4, the dangerous Marshall Gambit. This typically goes: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 c6 4 e4 dxe4 5 Nxe4 Bb4 6 Bd2 Qxd4 7 Bxb4 Qxe4+ 8 Be2. White's idea is to allow 8...Qxg2, answering with 9 Qd6 Nd7 10 0-0-0 and an extremely dangerous attack. So Black tends to play 8...Na6. If you are going to play this line in tournaments, I think you'll need to study more than just this introductory book, however.Of course, that is not all Black has to learn. As I said, there is that variation where White plays 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nf3 Nf6 (you do not want to play 3...c6 here, after which White has too many good options) 4 Nc3 e6. This is the Semi-Slav, which the book spends over 100 pages on. White generally plays:5 Bg5. This gives Black the choice of playing what Flear recommends, 5...dxc4 (the Botvinnik variation). Or trying the move I use, 5...h6 (the Moscow variation). Both require some work to learn, and Flear teaches us quite a bit about both moves.5 e3, which leads either to the Meran variation or some Meran-avoiding sideline. The Meran variation the book recommends for Black is 5 e3 Nbd7 6 Bd3 dxc4 7 Bxc4 b5 8 Bd3 Bb7, a popular line which I've used for many years.This book is useful and easy to read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Starting Out: Slav & Semi-Slav (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","review":"Epitomizes the strengths, and weaknesses, of the Starting Out series. It serves as an excellent introduction to one of the most important defences to 1. d4. Players interested in using this system competitively would, of course, have to go deeper with the help of other works, such as Flear's own on the a6 Slav, currently the rage, or Silman and Donaldson's."},{"Title":"Starting Out: Slav & Semi-Slav (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","review":"Like other Starting Out books I have used, this provides a useful introduction to the main lines of the Slav and Semi-Slav. My main complaint is that individual moves are generally well-explained, but the themes of different variations are not. For example, the most basic question of why one would play e6 to enter the Semi-Slav rather than, say, dxc4 is never discussed. I learned more about this from the two paragraph intro to the opening in Sam Collins's Understanding the Chess Openings than I did here. To give another example, in the Semi-Slav Meran, after 8 Bd7, Flear notes that there are three typical responses for black and he indicates which he prefers, but he does not say why he prefers that one to the others.I don't mean to be overly critical. Overall, I found the book quite useful, but not as useful as other Starting Out books I have consulted."},{"Title":"Starting Out: Slav & Semi-Slav (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","review":"The book is practical, clear and full of tips for 1600-2000 player.

I was captivated by her inquisitive mind and vivacious spirit, which clearly came through in her prose.&quot;A Free Black Girl Before the Civil War&quot; is a selection from the journals of the young Charlotte Forten (Grimke was her married name), all written in 1854. These writings offer a fascinating glimpse into the life of an educated free black girl during the era of slavery. We learn about Charlotte's love for nature, her participation in abolitionist activities, her admiration for the pioneering African American poet Phillis Wheatley, and other topics. Editor Christy Steele and company have provided a rich and colorful assortment of study aids: photographs and illustrations from Charlotte's era, a map of the &quot;Underground Railroad,&quot; a timeline, and other resources. At 32 pages, the book is a lot less intimidating than the adult version which I first read!The book also encourages its young readers to start their own diaries, and offers some tips. A list of relevant Internet sites further adds to the interactive nature of the book. This is an outstanding book for younger readers. Adults who also enjoy it would be wise to seek out the Schomburg Library edition of Charlotte's journals, edited by Brenda Stevenson. Both versions of these historic documents are excellent contributions to the field of African American studies."},{"Title":"Amazing Apple Adventure (Alphabats)","review":"We used this in the preschool I taught in.

Unfortunately, this is the first manga I bought that taught me that just because it's yaoi, doesn't mean it's gonna be good. The main premise of this story is that Hikaru, a high school student, rapes Shima, one of his teachers (on the very first page!) and he must then make it up to him by \\"play-acting\\" as his lover, and also by maintaining a high GPA (don't even ask). Will Shima ever decide to become Hikaru's \\"real\\" lover? Before you're through the 1st volume, you'll already have stopped caring.Rape is a common occurance in yaoi manga, and there is usually a lot of deep angst or emotion involved in it, from one or both people involved. There's none of that in \\"Passion\\". Hikaru just raped him because he loves him so much. Really! He even blurts out \\"Will you marry me?\\" right afterwards! Now if that's not true love, then I don't know what is. But it's okay, Shima doesn't seem overly upset. Like any good teacher, he just criticizes Hikaru for doing it wrong and tells him to \\"think about what you should do to make up for what you've done today.\\" Okay, I know yaoi isn't supposed to be realistic, but \\"Passion\\" asked me to suspend my disbelief way too much. It isn't that they act out of character, it's more that they don't have \\"character\\" to begin with. We never find out why Shima or Hikaru act in the bizarre ways they do (volume 2 attempts to offer some belated explanations, but fails). There are some side plots and additional characters that add length, particularly in the 2nd final volume, but they supply nothing in entertainment value.In addition to all that, the English translation is horrible! The language sounds dry at best, but it's often so awkward and unnatural that it made me wince. Not to mention Hikaru throws \\"sir\\" into his speech at the most irrelevent times (\\"I could imagine it was painful, sir\\"). And to top it all off, the sex scenes aren't even very impressive.This is definitely one-star yaoi, but I give it two stars because \\"Passion\\" is still better than a lot of sappy shoujo manga out there that manage to be twice as unbelievable and melodramatic as this is. But unless you've already bought the many better-quality yaoi manga that are now available in the U.S. and you're truly desperate for more, I'd pass on this one."},{"Title":"Passion Volume 1 (Yaoi) (v. 1)","review":"the only reason i gave this book 2 stars is because gay themed manga novels are still hard to find. despite it's recent burst of popularity in the states yaoi is still pretty inaccessible. there's only a handful of titles in circulation. if there was a wider variety to choose from i still would have bought \\"Passion\\" but only because i'm a huge fan of the genre and a closet obsessive compulsive who has to collect everything of a specific genre.the story definitely has a plot but the characters and the reasons they do what they do are never explained. also the choices they make are incomprehensible and uninteresting. at least in gravitation theres a comedic undertone to everything so the story can get by with a little fluffiness here and there. thats also the problem here, with passion your not sure what the story is supposed to be, between the odd way everyone behaves \\"let's pretend to be lovers till the end of term\\" to the ongoing flashbacks of unrequieted romance between the teachers the story tries to be too many things all at once and fails on all counts. also if your looking for good adult material this is NOT the book for you. when i gave up on the plot (by page 10) i thought \\"okay at least i'll see some cute manga boys gettin nakies\\" but the most you see is a couple of torso shots.if you want some good adult material i highly recommend \\"Golden Cain\\" aside from a very good story it's sex scenes are pretty hardcore. and if your more interested in poignant romance that resonates, pick up \\"only the Ring Finger Knows\\". if your after light cute and funny go with gravitation. of course as i i said earlier if your a diehard yaoi fan you wouldn't want your collection to be without this title. if nothing else the art is beautiful as manga usually is."},{"Title":"Passion Volume 1 (Yaoi) (v. 1)","review":"Hi there! I hope this helps you if you are looking for BL manga of the Shonen-Ai or YAOI variety.Storyline: **Artwork: **\\"Steamy\\" scenes: 2 non-explicit, and 2 or 3 kisses.Nudity: Bare minimum - partially dressed or top half onlyDid it keep my interest: BarelyHikaru is a student who has a crush on his teacher, Mr. Shima. This led him to do something stupid, which he then has to make up for to Mr. Shima. The feel of the story is angsty, with Hikaru pining after Mr. Shima. Mr. Shima encourages Hikaru to study dilligently, and encourages Hikaru to approach him, but he still keeps Hikaru at arm's length. Add in an old flame of Mr. Shima's who wants him back...If you're interested in student/teacher relationships and shonen-ai and are not fussy, then I believe this might be of some interest to you. The story seems a little contrived, with only one point of difference to the usual student/teacher romance story, and was not sufficiently original enough to sustain my interest. The artwork is quite plain and has the bare minimum of detail. The content is fairly tame, despite the promising looking statement of \\"Parental Explicit Content Advisory\\" sign on the cover!Having said that, I still want to know how it all ends, but I'm certainly not on the edge of my seat waiting for the next installment."},{"Title":"Passion Volume 1 (Yaoi) (v. 1)","review":"With a name like \\"Passion,\\" I was expecting something more...well, passionate. All I see here is a few power and mind games, sprinkled with not-very-erotic sex scenes.The story opens with Hikaru, who is obsessed with his teacher Shima, raping Shima in an empty classroom. Shima, instead of getting angry or, you know, calling the police or anything, tells Hikaru that he should think about how he's going to make up for what he's done.What follows is a bizarre series of events that I just can't swallow--a teenager with stalker tendencies obsesses over his teacher, while the teacher, fully aware of the obsession, uses it to manipulate his student. Hikaru is allowed to \\"play\\" at being Shima's lover as long as he keeps his grades up, and by the end of the book, Shima seems to be developing some tender feelings for his rapist.The art is sparse and mostly unattractive; plenty of panels don't have backgrounds, and the characters don't look polished enough to carry the story on their own. The translation is awkward and dialogue unnatural, though I have seen worse. Combine it all with the weak and unbelievable plot, and I'm just glad that I won this book in a raffle; if I'd spent money on it, I'd have felt ripped off."},{"Title":"Passion Volume 1 (Yaoi) (v. 1)","review":"A student molests his teacher in a deserted classroom. Okay, that's how this book starts, but if you can get past the opening, the story is strangely bittersweet. The art was very different but the faces of Hikaru and his teacher \\"Sir\\" Shima are gorgeous. Volume 1 has some rough translations work in it, with very archaic dialogue, and it's sometimes confusing pairing up the dialogue bubbles with who is speaking. Volume 2 greatly improves on the translation work, and really hits you in the gut as the story progresses. Hikaru is given the opportunity to play \\"pretend lovers\\" with his Mr. Shima until he graduates. Shima comes off as being very cold and you start to wonder why HIkaru is so obsessed (but then you look at how beautifully Shima is drawn and the question is answered). As far as yaoi goes, this one was very different from the standard dominant/submissive paired couples. While Hikaru is dominant, Shima holds all the power of the relationship, which was a refreshing change. Volume 1 leaves you wondering if Shima's ex-lover, Amayima is going to break them up, and if Shima might not care more for Hikaru than it seems. Stick with it, get Volume 2 and you won't be disappointed in this suprisingly touching tale."},{"Title":"Passion Volume 1 (Yaoi) (v. 1)","review":"I enjoyed this manga, but presently it's strong point seems to be iilicit nature of the tryst, since there's a student making the moves.Not that there are not YAOI with students making the moves, but the teacher maintains emotional control in the situation rather than become a complete WAAH WAAH uke as usually happens. Well, actually, it still might happen.The twist with the lover coming back promises some serious angst, but there is already a lot of angst involved on behalf of the student.It's like every drop of kindness from the teacher is water to a man dying of thirst (yes... cliche). Still, it's cute and I enjoyed the student making the moves, even if the teacher is so nonchalant it hurts.This has like NO funny moments, and is seriously focused on the kid getting him some emotional attachment (he's already getting the sex, yeh). If you like that sort, it's pretty entertaining."},{"Title":"Passion Volume 1 (Yaoi) (v. 1)","review":"I just finished reading this manga and I would definetly reccomend it to any yaoi fan.The art style is beautiful (A little reminiscent of Mars), and the storyline doesn't lack anything either. It's a twist on the normal pattern for stories with a teacher and student.It's got enough sappy parts, but not so much that you'll grow weary of it, and it has enough steamy scenes, but not too much to make one timid. I'd say this is the best manga I've read in a long time, and I can't wait for the second one to come out X3"},{"Title":"Passion Volume 1 (Yaoi) (v. 1)","review":"I'm a bit leery about reviewing a series before I've seen/read the whole thing--especially with manga and anime, as they seldom have the 'happy ending' my little Western heart desires. But I found volume 1 of \\"Passion\\" intriguing enough that I'm tapping my foot and checking my calendar for the release of vol. 2.The illicit nature of the a teacher and student having a sexual affair seemed to be the focus of the story--which, in light of recent real-life events we've seen on the news--makes this a pretty risky release. (I wonder if the American publishers cut some more explicit scenes for that reason?)Other reviewers have given Shima 'bad marks' for his treatment of Hikaru...but I think his behavior warrants a second look and some second thoughts. Compare the opening scene between Shima and Hikaru and the party scene between Shima and Amamiya (don't want to spoil anyone!). There's a *drastic* difference in Shima's reactions. There are a number of understated signs throughout the manga that Shima is more deeply affected by Hikaru than he acts or says. When one compares what Shima went through in his earlier relationship with Amamiya and how *that* ended, his caution becomes much more understandable. (And I'm with all those who are hoping Amamiya gets left on his player butt at the end of vol. 2.)The translation is a bit awkward, the use of honorifics is...clumsy. The art is a bit sketchy, but it's not rough, and the commentary by the manga-ka in the afterword is *priceless*. (But then, I love reading what artists and authors think about their creations.)But \\"Passion\\" is about that which is hidden, what lies under the surface, as opposed to what is openly displayed. A reader needs to keep that in mind. I only hope vol.2 lives up to this promise!"},{"Title":"Passion Volume 1 (Yaoi) (v. 1)","review":"To start with, I've read both volumes, and I'd have to say it is absolutely necessary to read Volume 2 to truly enjoy this manga. (The series is complete with Volume 2.)The artwork can take some getting used to, but the main attraction for me was that the characters do not look like little girls- though Shima has his moments... The sex is on the less explicit side of explicit; that is to say, the artist relies on angles to obscure all the \\"important\\" stuff and subscribes to the \\"vague outline\\" school of drawing when it becomes necessary. As with any truly good yaoi manga, the story is more about the emotional aspect of the relationship than the sex. The translation is awkward at times, but if you take the spirit of what they're saying rather than the exact words it doesn't impede the story. As others have said the translation of honorifics is clumsy. ...There really isn't anything else I can say about that, except that you get used to it.As for the story, something I found particularly enjoyable about it is the way the balance of power is shifted from expectations. For example, Shima, the teacher and elder of the pair, is the uke(bottom) yet he also exerts almost all control in the relationship, limiting how often Hikaru can see him and insisting that Hikaru finish his schoolwork before they do anything romantic. \\"Passion\\" is a very complicated story in which almost all of your first perceptions of the central relationship are eventually challenged. A lot of reviews talk about the illicit nature of the relationship depicted. All I can say is, yeah it's kind of a dark story. It's about a love forbidden on two different levels... what were you expecting? The characters are well portrayed, and that's what makes the story worth reading.For those who enjoyed (or didn't quite) this manga, I also recommend:Loveless (soft-core shonen ai-ish, dark/twisted relationships.)Kizuna - Bonds of Love (hard-core yaoi, difficulties facing an established relationship.)"},{"Title":"Passion Volume 1 (Yaoi) (v. 1)","review":"Another of DMP's Yaoi Manga, it's not like most Yaoi Manga having the teacher as the Uke and the student as the Seme. It wasn't necessarily DMP's fault for my low rating of this Yaoi Manga but it simply the fact was I disliked it. The art didn't catch me and neither did the story. So if you are a true Yaoi Fan get it but if you only collect the good stuff, pass by this one.

The artwork, both of the author's and of Monet's is absolutely exquisite. Becoming familiar with Monet's life and his paintings become a marvelous art history lesson. As an adult, I not enjoyed reading this lovely book but I learned a lot.

Together they decide to visit Paris, and Monet's garden in Giverny, and with the help of this book we can go with them on this journey.The book is first of all a beautiful, everyday story about two friends visiting the house and garden of a beloved painter. But it is also a masterpiece in the way it is built up. The way the story, the information about the impressionist period in art, the pictures and paintings all melt together. I and my 6 years old daughter can never get tired of the book, and after reading it an uncountable number of times we both felt that we knew the garden in Giverny. It was a very special day for us then, last summer when we were able to visit Giverny, the house and the garden. We could walk around seeing the same sights as Linnea had seen, sit on the bench together with both Monet and Linnea, walk over the Japanese bridge, and take pictures of all the flowers Linnea had also photographed.Though this book is first of all a book for children it is a treasure for all ages.

This was my second visit in three years, but my first visit with Isabelle, the curator, as tour guide. While the museum is going through remodeling, the Impressionist paintings of Claude Monet and his colleagues are housed in new exhibit rooms. Of central interest to me were the Monet works, as we were taking the train, later in the week, to Giverny where Claude Monet bought property many years ago, and designed a garden to inspire all gardeners, myself, included.The thrill to see the landscape where Monet was inspired draws many questions: Did his paintings inspire his gardening, or did his gardening inspire his paintings? I believe, both! It is quite an accomplishment to allow your work to interweave with your passions and interests, and looking at his acres of flowers, says it all. Life has a way of weaving itself into a beautiful landscape.So, when it came to telling an eight year old about my visit to Monet's home and gardens, I used the wonderful book, Linnea in Monet's Garden as a prelude to our conversation. I have several books for engaging children in discussions on famous artists and their works; this one rises above many. The co-authors present the story of Monet and his garden and his paintings to an energized child, who when nurtured can relate to the first-person account of a young European child who traveled with an elderly friend, to visit Monet's home and gardens, the green bridge over the lily pond, the single-colored rooms in his house, and the sheer palette of colors in his gardens. (Coincidentally, I, too, named the rooms in my house by lighter shades of colors: rose for \\"spring's beginnings\\"; aqua for \\"summer's calm\\"; yellow sunshine for \\"golden autumn\\"; soft blush for \\"winter's sunset\\", and white of whites, to include every color of the rainbow's spectrum. Each of the rooms depicts a separate season; one represents all.)This book contains full-color reproductions of some of Monet's paintings, ink and water color illustrations, a narrative of the visit to Giverny, Monet's home and gardens by this elderly man and the young lively child who displays enough enthusiasm to bring all the flowers into bloom. So, take the hand of your child, and carefully introduce her to as much of life as possible; someday, she will probably visit Monet's Gardens and Home, and have volumes to share. Draw out the creative spirit in your child! Bring good and truth-filled literature to your child's light!

Parents will absolutely love the mix of history and art with the story of a little girls dream coming true. Linnea loves flowers, gardens and art. When she gets the chance to visit France and see Monet's home as well as his paintings up close she's ecstatic.The trip with her good friend Mr. Bloom becomes the highlight of her young life and she learns an abundance of fascinating facts about her favorite painter. This is a fantastic story, one that is sure to be a family treasure."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"If you haven't read Linnea in Monet's Garden with your children, your family is missing out on a wonderful story about a little girl's journey to the garden of one of history's greatest artists.First written in 1985 by Christina Bjork and illustrated by Lena Anderson, it has been re-released this 25th anniversary year in printed formats, as well as e-reader formats.The story begins with Linnea dreaming of Monet's garden with her retired friend, Mr. Bloom, whom encourages Linnea in her art studies. The pair take a trip to Paris together and visit the little pink house where Monet and his family lived. She takes pictures of the famous Japanese bridge and of the variety of flowers amid the garden. She and Mr. Bloom discuss Monet's style of painting: impressionism, as well as his family's interesting dichotomy.Amid the pages, the reader discovers modern pictures, Monet's art, black and white family photos, sketches, and lively original illustrations. Bjork discusses Monet's failing sight issues and even shows readers comparison views of his drawing as his sight failed.At the end of the story, Bjork supplied the reader with a list of things to do in Paris including museums, gardens, and markets. She also left a timeline of Monet's life and his family tree, as it can be a little confusing.What I found lovely was Bjork's use of reality in her story about Linnea. She spoke with Jean-Marie Toulgouat and Philippe Piguet, Monet's step-great-grandsons, whom shared the family photos shown in the story.An all around wonderful story, but also a very informative biography; I highly recommend Linnea in Monet's Garden as part of this year's top reads.Caution: There is a section in the story regarding Monet's family history. At one point, Monet lived with his second wife before they were married and before she had officially separated from her husband. I wanted to disclose this as it might offend or catch some parents off guard.{Disclosure: This book was provided to me in digital format free of charge by the publishing company Sourcebooks.}[...]"},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"An \\"Amazing\\" children's book with beautiful illustration and stories for Monet's Garden.Another excellent book to share your love of art.

Bringing art to young children is so important, especially when we live in an era where music and art programs are being cut across the nation. Seeing not only Monet's masterpieces, but also his life, through the eyes of who was at the time a peer was an incredible introduction to his work. Beware of your little girl begging you to take her to Paris, because that is what happened with me!

I told her many of them, and then she asked if we had had a picnic in the garden. I had forgotten that part, and told her no, we went to a restaurant.

We found the small hotel with the portrait of Esmeralda dancing. It is across from Notre Dame. The old tree was there. We finally made the journey to Monet's home and Garden in the Normandy region. It was better than I could have imagined. I recommend the trip to anyone. The house, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers with the bridge and pond.

It's written by an astrophysicist turned Anglican pastor, so it has an interesting view of some challenging topics, such as \\"Fact or Opinion\\", \\"Who Are We\\", \\"Can A Scientist Pray\\", \\"What About Miracles\\", and \\"Can A Scientist Believe\\".In the introduction, the author writes, \\"As someone who's both a scientist and an Anglican priest, I've been concerned with trying to understand how the scientific and religious views of the world relate to each other. Do we have to choose between them or are they, instead, complementary understandings that, seen together, give us a fuller picture than either on their own would provide.\\"Polkinghorne's answers aren't completely satisfactory to me, but he does ask some penetrating questions and offers some well considered explainations. The book is well written and will make you stop and think."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"The author is at his best when presenting complex scientific notions to the uninitiated, and when dispelling common misapprehensions on how science and religion proceed in their respective fields of inquiry - pointing out at the same time that both seek rational responses to their questions, a motivated assent to things seen and unseen. Such misapprehensions have led many to consider them - mistakenly - as contradictory and mutually exclusive, rather than as complementary paths to the truth.Half-way the book slides from scientific questions and, in the author's opinion, their compatibility with religious belief, into a more apologetic tone, making more openly a case for Christianity. Mind you, being myself a Roman Catholic priest, I do not have any major objection to this, but it is not what I expected from this book...The author rightly rejects the views of God either as a puppet-master or as an indifferent spectator. He presents creation as a continuous process, and puzzles over the problem of evil. But for some of his explanations, or proposed solutions, he takes a very liberal view of Christian doctrine, advancing notions that contradict what the Christian faith has historically asserted - for example, regarding God's efficiency in the work of creation, or regarding God's will and His knowledge of the future.Although I strongly disagree with much of the author's theology, the book is nonetheless worth reading - it makes many good points, and is thought-provoking. It may not give you acceptable solutions to the problems posed, but it is a good starting point for thinking seriously about them and sheds some light on the path ahead..."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"The language and metaphors are simple, perhaps a little too so for some readers, but Polkinghorne covers most of the arguments against religion from science and outlines his view of the complementarity of religion and science from a position of some authority. Polkinghorne, Anglican Priest cum theoretical physicist, has been doing this for a long time.The most compelling chapters for general readership are the first four in which Polkinghorne shows the wiggle room for divinity apparently built into the universe from the moment of its inception. Meanwhile, he avoids the \\"watchmaker\\" casting of God. I found myself having to do a great deal of tangential reading (e.g. on \\"quantum entanglement\\") since he moves so quickly. This is a very short book at 118 pages.The last chapters are more interesting to a Christian as Polkinghorne argues his particular brand of Christianity (allegorical/mythic use of \\"miracle\\" in much of the biblical literature, \\"animated beings\\" as opposed to \\"spirit-body\\" ontology), and ends up being pretty much a description of his personal faith which isn't entirely orthodox, but has the benefit of being arguable and somewhat defensible.It's certainly worth checking out if the struggle between science and religion is something that interests you, if for no other reason than all of the main lines pro and con are briefly laid out."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"This is a fascinating book written in layman's terms about the creation of the universe (among other things).

I may not be smart enough to understand all of either the science or theology, but what I understood was informative and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"Polkinghorne is usually a puzzling read for me. One admires his expertise in the exotic field of particle physics, and also his zeal in postulating a compatibility between physical science and his version of Christianity, but I usually come away from his efforts rather unconvinced of the merits of the proposed \\"merger\\" he proposes.On the one hand, he wants us to move forward from the ancient conception of God as brutally crashing through natural events to perform miracles, and instead conceive of God as the invisible gently-prodding hand behind all events. Such a model would not necessarily violate standard quantum mechanics. While this theological model might indeed help modernize a believer's conception of God's possible action in the world, it is nonetheless difficult to reconcile with the traditional Judaeo-Christian image of Yahweh's abrupt action on his creation given by the scriptures themselves. If one looks objectively at the stories in the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, one sees an abundance of gross physical violations of natural laws, the kind that Polkinghorne obviously has trouble with when constructing his own \\"gentle guidance\\" theology.And that's the rub. In essence, Polkinghorne wants us to have our cake and eat it too-i.e., somehow remain \\"faithful\\" to the biblical accounts, and yet remain up-to-date on integrating modern physical insights. There might be a fundamental incompatibility problem trying to keep both types of \\"actions\\"; something needs to give. Interestingly, it is Polkinghorne's own faithfulness to the Biblical narratives that gives way; he can't deny the physics, so he in essence re-visions biblical theology into something more scientifically \\"respectable\\". In fact, Polkinghorne has re-visioned divine action into something neither Jesus nor his followers might recognize.It's also fairly obvious here, or should be, that Polkinghorne didn't derive his theology from merely looking at the physics; rather, he came to the physics with his own prior theological presuppositions and uses physics where convenient to explain his theology. One has a right to do so, of course, but readers should realize we are NOT looking at a compelling case for physics pointing to his own theology, but rather, how one can start out with a particular theology and then tweak physics to fit it. I hope readers can grasp this important point in these types of quasi-science theological constructions. Looking at many of these Amazon reviews, however, I think we're in trouble already :-). Hey, hey- don't be like that, where's the love, people?Let's get back to the biblical accounts for a moment. Say we want to buy Jesus and Peter walking on water, for example. It wouldn't be conceivable with Polkinghorne's \\"gentle quantum manipulation\\" theology, since we are really looking at a sudden (massive) macroscopic violation of physics. We can go further; none of the miraculous acts reported of Jesus (or his disciples, or any of the O.T. figures) are adequately explainable by Polkinghorne's (sub-) quantum gentle-action. It's too weak to be of use.Yet Polkinghorne's theology *is* one possible theology away from a fundamentalist view of the world, of course. It is always possible to tweak a particular theology to \\"fit\\" current scientific knowledge, which is what Polkinghorne tries to do in his various writings. This is certainly understandable; some of traditional theology - understood in a literal rather than a metaphorical sense - seems to be at odds with a modern scientific understanding of the world. I would argue some of this conflict could be down-graded if one begins to grasp how the ancients told stories, but unfortunately many moderns, arch-atheists as well as believers, assume this type of literature has the intention of describing empirical factual descriptions, aka \\"scientific\\" data... Unfortunately, this assumption largely misses the nature of this type of religious literature, which properly should be seen as symbolic narrative- i.e., metaphorical images of human religious experience. Many modern biblical scholars recognize this \\"symbolic narrative\\" perspective and even have a term for it- \\"story theology\\". This perspective of \\"telling religious stories\\" may not explain all aspects of the vast biblical literature, of course, but the point is, both believers and nonbelievers seem to miss the boat when they approach religious narratives with a modernized empirical demand. As distinguished N.T. scholar Marcus Borg aptly reminds us, the problem isn't that the ancients missed important scientific facts, the problem is that moderns don't recognize how the ancients told stories!And so, moderns of all stripes tend to interpret this ancient religious literature in a manner the original authors wouldn't even recognize...it's an expectation built into our own age that we project back on older material. Hence, it is fairly ironic BOTH sides in the debate- believers AND skeptics- take sides defending or ridiculing, using the same misguided projection of scientific expectations on the material :-).Think about it, please.But I digress. Be that as it may, the desire to upgrade traditional religious concepts into more modern forms is certainly something one would expect many devotees with some degree of scientific literacy to try. However, there is a price to be paid for \\"modernizing\\" in this manner, for the more one \\"tweaks\\", the further one gets away from traditional biblical accounts. This is unavoidable. I've got my own \\"uncertainty principle\\" here (with apologies to Heisenberg) which seems to be the case: the more precise one tries to focus in on modern science, the fuzzier the traditional concepts become!! You've read it right here, folks- a genuine theological uncertainty relations!And so, not only do the familiar traditional biblical stories become distant, one eventually gets to a point where it makes no sense to label these newer versions with old traditional labels... For example, one might look at Polkinghorne's own contribution as only vaguely representing \\"traditional\\" Christianity (despite some of the reviews on Amazon) and the traditional abrupt divine action; in fact, he has re-engineered traditional biblical concepts into something rather distant from the worldview of Jesus or his fellow Mediterranean inhabitants; let's not kid ourselves.So don't forget the price one pays to \\"tweak\\" :-). One should therefore recognize, mindful of 1st-century Christian origins, just how far somebody like Polkinghorne has moved away from a realistic picture of 1st-century Palestine conditions.For many fairly liberal Christians, Polkinghorne's revisionary theology will be perfectly acceptable, even if in the process they have wandered rather far from the traditional biblical direct-intervention narratives. This crowd is generally open to revisions of traditional themes, and modifying religious content to conform to current scientific ideas poses little problem for them. For some with a more conservative bent, however, Polkinghorne's own revisioning may not be particularly agreeable, since he DOES re-vamp \\"divine action\\" away from embarrassing macroscopic miracles and into a new quasi-quantum-mechanical model. The outcome of his theology, to me, seems to take direct divine action largely out of our macroscopic world (i.e., the realm where God traditionally acts in the biblical stories), and instead \\"hides\\" a sub-quantum Dice-Determiner invisibly behind the quantum world, gently tweaking the probabilities so that outcomes of events are directed and amplified to work in your favor...kind of like a Christian version of the \\"butterfly effect\\" in chaos theory :-). You can see this type of reasoning in a typical comment Polkinghorne gave in one of his many interviews: \\"I think God acts within the open grain of nature. Just as we act within it in small ways, God acts in bigger ways, and that's sort of hidden--because the open grain of nature comes from these intrinsic unpredictabilities, so we can never quite figure out who's doing what in these things.\\" So apparently in Polkinghorne's world God is hiding where nobody can see Him (Her/Them/It) and operates by working invisibly behind the scenes. Which is do-able if your goal is to be quasi-respectable scientifically, but it does seem to be a weak substitute for the Biblical picture.One can't discuss Polkinghorne's rationale for divine action without also mentioning the special problem of trying to weld the supernatural together with the purely \\"natural\\" reference-frame customarily found in ordinary physics. Polkinghorne attempts to by telling us miracles are \\"special cases\\", that \\"happen only rarely\\"...obviously trying to \\"down-grade\\" the problems inherent in such a merger. In a debate with fellow-physicist Steven Weinberg (available on the web) he has this to say, \\"God is not capricious, but God is not condemned equally to dreary uniformity.\\" OK, but how does this answer any questions on how or why supernatural events could be expected to occur in the first place - another physicist might ask - in a world with rather tight physical constraints? There isn't any rationale in place to explain why abrupt miracles could sometimes be the exception. Superseding the laws of physics may not be a huge problem for theologians, necessarily, but it IS one for scientists trying to work the supernatural into a physical picture. Readers should expect a more concrete explanation from this mathematical physicist other than merely pointing out that God \\"is not condemned to dreary uniformity\\"... What does that mean? Is Polkinghorne saying anything insightful here? Theologically speaking, we already realize God isn't \\"condemned\\" to anything, right? But it is another thing altogether to present some kind of plausible scientific model. It seems apparent Polkinghorne wants to avoid the embarrassment of obvious violations of physical laws by making them only special rare events...as he has remarked elsewhere, God only occasionally \\"does something new\\". Polkinghorne tells us miracles only seem to happen on significant theological occasions in history (such as the Resurrection), which may or may not accurately reflect the biblical picture (I think his assessment grossly underestimates the amount of miracles one sees in the scriptures). But at any rate, his theology is an attempt to have one's cake and eat it too- i.e., he hopes he can bend theology around current physics to make it more respectable, yet also leave room for direct macroscopic violations once in awhile as need be.The problem here is, saying God occasionally decides to work from a \\"higher realm\\" and can do whatever He/She wants doesn't solve this (scientifically observable) *consistency*-in-the-real-world dilemma, so what are we supposed to buy? We seem to end up in the Polkinghorne Twilight Zone: God is \\"not capricious\\" and hence can normally be expected to work according to the laws of physics He/She set up, but wait! Sometimes God wants to do something \\"new\\"...(hence acting capriciously?)...! To me, this looks like a haphazard theology. In spite of Polkinghorne's desire to present a plausible picture, it appears we are left with a capricious, whimsical scenario of \\"divine action\\", not much different than the Greek mythological gods intervening into human affairs when it struck their fancy.And from a skeptical standpoint, the skill level of our author's Big Kahuna seems a little suspect regarding setting up the ordinary laws of physics from square one...why create physical laws in a manner in which One knows in advance One will need to violate them from time-to-time? Seems like a classic case of initial bad planning!It does seem to me, at any rate, Polkinghorne runs into trouble trying to have it all. I think he'd avoid many of these problems by simply admiting from the outset that his model of \\"supernatural interventions\\" is based on prior commitments to doctrines of *faith* that are impossible to buttress with appeals to the actual laws of physics themselves. It's an admission that would seem to me to be much more honest. And it's OK to admit one's \\"faith\\" is the ultimate arbitrator here...just be honest about it :-))))[**Additional topic for bonus points**: Why is uniformity \\"dreary\\" in the first place? Many scientists see an inherent beauty in the same physical constants that Polkinghorne sees dreariness in...].Be that as it may, let's put aside some metaphysical assumptions and talk about something authors like Polkinghorne seem guilty of- i.e., when authors attempt to \\"support\\" a particular metaphysical or religious stance using science buzz words, such as \\"chaos theory\\". Now Polk as an outstanding physicist assuredly knows his stuff when talking about the exotic field of chaos mathematics, but this doesn't necessarily translate into a smooth transistion from this field into abstract theological discussions... It appears Polkinghorne would have been more honest had he admitted from square one that his agenda, despite the appearance of scientific jargon, was actually to promote his version of Christianity. In other words, his use of selected aspects of physics is intended not as a \\"scientific\\" argument, per se, but rather as a springboard into obviously religious realms. But do readers come away with this motivation in mind, or do many just assume Polkinghorne has somehow provided a \\"scientific\\" basis for Christian doctrines? (Answer: Just read the Amazon reviews). Hence the discussion in his books is largely theological, not scientific...and what actually occurs in this type of apologetics is that many important theological doctrines must- by necessity- ignore all scientific restraints. Which is OK as a theological exercise, but one should be honest about it, instead of obscuring the taking of huge metaphysical leaps by using a lot of current scientific buzzwords in the discussion. Readers should begin to see some rather dubious support being attempted when an author attempts to persuade readers toward a particular personal theology by using a bucketfull of science jargon. (I mention Buddhists being guilty of the same questionable use of science jargon in some other reviews).As for God working invisibly behind the scenes, there probably isn't much in Polkinghorne's scenario of a \\"hidden variable\\" sub-quantum Gentle-Prodder-of-Events that would be objectionable in itself to conservative religious believers (aside from not being a very vigorous image). It could, for instance, be one explanation of how God could, say, direct events to answer prayers. But an interesting irony occurs here. Polkinghorne has objected to Process philosophy giving too \\"weak\\" a picture of God...of being merely a Cosmic \\"Puppeteer\\". But Polkinghorne's own image of an \\"Invisible-Prodder-of-the-Quantum-Dice\\" doesn't seem to invigorate God's image very much itself... We seem to have moved pretty far away from the biblical image of a robust God who's usual interaction is directly with human beings - but here retreats meekly into hiding behind the quantum realm. That wouldn't make me a happy camper if I wanted any biblical consistency.I personally don't see how Polkinghorne's own contribution improves the image of a mere Puppeteer-behind-the-scenes, even if we throw in some occasional rare \\"miracles\\" just to mix things up. Even if we do, remember, these are \\"rare\\"...so Polkinghorne's God otherwise seems a little weak.I'm just sayin' :-)."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"Chapter 1The first chapter starts out simple enough - gives a brief explanation of what science is, what religion is (in his opinion), and how they relate and differ. The first problem is on page 22: \\"There are some branches of science that are also impossible to test. Cosmology and evolutionary biology are examples.\\" The credibility of this guy as a scientist isn't starting out so well. Evolution is put to the test every time we dig up a new fossil or decode a new genome. Evolution predicts what should be seen - we would not find the fossil of a poodle mixed in with dinosaurs, just as the DNA of Humans would not share as many genetic markers with a butterfly as it would a chimpanzee. To say evolution can't be tested shows this guy to either be ignorant of biological science or just plain dishonest.He goes on to contrast Science with beauty (like music) in an attempt to also lump God in with those things that aren't supposed to be grounded on logic. While it makes sense to say that the CONCEPT of God can resonate with a part of us in the same way music does, music doesn't declare that you love it, nor does it dictate what is right or wrong. Music is subjective, God is not. He would make a fine case if he were merely referring to spirituality - which I have no qualms with - but he makes the unearned leap of attributing this sense of wonder to the Abrahamic God.Chapter 2This chapter starts out with what kind of criteria we should use to determine if God exists. He comes right out and says that the scientific method of using evidence has to be \\"tailored\\" - in other words, must bend to subjective standards. He does this respectfully by acknowledging the serious blow to religion that Darwin dealt, since religion was trying to answer a \\"how?\\" question. The problem he should address but doesn't is how can you get around religion NOT addressing \\"how?\\" questions. The Adam and Eve story certainly does give a \\"how\\" as to how man was created and how man acquired the traits of reason, morality, and sexual enjoyment (all \\"bad things\\" that came after the fall) - as well as pain in child-bearing.He goes on to make a case for spirituality in the sort of \\"seeing the forest through the trees\\" sense, which, again, I'm cool with so long as nothing that makes logical assertions is tied to it (i.e., religious doctrine.) That's contradictory. From page 37 to 42, he uses the very old and very tired analogy of a fine-tuned universe. To religious people, this is compelling. To experienced atheists, we've heard it a million times and it hasn't the slightest effect in persuading us. There are many complex and intriguing theories about why our universe is the way it is. A humorous take on the matter is to look around and realize that the creator of the universe must have been really inefficient to have these hundreds of billions of galaxies and hundreds of trillions of solar systems, yet managed for life to arise on just one little planet out of the whole works. There are other ideas that refute the fine-tuning business, but the bottom line is this: people who use this line of reasoning limit themselves to the idea that this is the one and only universe there is and ever was, and it could have turned out in one of many different ways, but it turned out to be just right, therefore, Yahweh did it. He later goes on to refute his own fine-tuning argument...which makes me wonder why he brought it up in the first place.Chapter 3On complexity. I accept and truly like the idea of an ever-increasingly complex universe having a spiritual connection. It's good to see that this author does too. He starts making some assertions about a loving god, like, \\"the natural gift of the loving God would be an independence granted to creation.\\" This is a false definition, as this independence is no more true than the independence of a people living under a strict Monarchy. Sure, you're free to do whatever you want...but go against what the King says and it's curtains for you (yes, I said \\"curtains.\\") Independence and freedom, more aptly defined, are characteristics that can only exist when no coercion is present.He states that creation is an ongoing process and mentioned earlier that we needn't think of God as someone who merely \\"set things going\\" from the beginning. The question arises: if creation is a process, what is the actual creation that is created? This question is never answered, nor even guessed at.He goes on to explain another tough selling point for religion: evil. He first says that we can't know good without evil - which I completely agree with. He goes on to try to reconcile the problem of cancer and disease: \\"Why couldn't God just eliminate these?\\" He claims that these are just part of the natural process that God created and it would be unbalanced if we didn't have the bad to go along with the good. This is all a fine and dandy argument for some kind of spiritual naturalism, but it completely falls apart when the author claims that for God to annihilate cancerous cells (and the like) would result in us living in a kind of unnatural, magical world. This clashes with the following magical (i.e., totally unnatural) ideas that take place in the bible: water to wine, water to blood, sticks to snakes, talking snakes, witches and warlocks (can you get more magical?), levitation, parting of the red/reed sea, women turning into salt, fiery vortex, giant walls manifesting in the air and falling on tens of thousands of people...need I go on? The Old Testament is rife with magic and God intervening. Why is it that obliterating cancer would be an insult to his natural order, but raising Lazarus from the dead isn't?I was pleasantly surprised on page 60 how he refutes the notion that we are separate from the inanimate earth (very Zen Buddhism.) He goes on to conclude that bad things happening are not the will of God, just the effects of his creation, which I believe leads to 2 problems for believers: 1) You have to equate that notion with the idea that God is not the cause of GOOD events. To say that God can influence good events but not bad is the same as saying that God does good things some of the time and lets bad things happen the rest of the time...which is completely retarded. And 2) this goes against the clearly-intervening God in the Old Testament. So which is it: does God let nature take it's course - good or bad - or does he have some weird non-consistent form of intervening? The evidence would point to the contradicting latter point. He concludes his point by saying, essentially, that God came down as Jesus to live among us and suffer, and because he suffered like one of us, our suffering makes sense. That's not a very good selling point to me, as it's on the same level as a rich man deliberately becoming poor and homeless so that he could...somehow relate to and help the homeless...but then go back to being rich.Chapter 4Here we have some interesting scientific concepts meshed with the well-known notion of the sum of the parts being greater than the individual parts. Nothing majorly controversial here - he tries to throw in God at the end of the chapter, perhaps realizing that nowhere else in that chapter was God needed to explain the phenomena he was describing. Nice save, I suppose.Chapter 5This chapter starts out kind of awkwardly about prayer. The author says, about patients in hospitals, \\"I did not [pray for dying patients] expecting that each would be granted a miracle, but, rather, as a way of sharing in their experience and of seeking God's grace and presence for them in what was happening, which might bring either recovery or the acceptance of death.\\" As unintelligible as this statement is, I'll try to make sense of it: he prays so that he can experience empathy for the patient and to try to sense if God's there, which might cure them or allow them to accept death. Even my translated version doesn't make sense. He makes assertions about free will that he doesn't back up: \\"...the experience of real choice - and, hence, of real responsibility - is basic to being human.\\" I think he would have been more accurate in saying the \\"perception\\" of real choice and perceived responsibility. The author goes on to assert that God can and does intervene - which confirms his earlier attempt to explain away evil as a failed one. He then gets into causality and pleads his case for a sort of meta-causality that is a linked system of events that can be influenced by God, thereby allowing for intervention but keeping the plan the same. It is all hypothesis and I wouldn't bet on any scientific breakthroughs anytime soon that demonstrate this \\"top-down\\" meta-causality.The author goes on to address the problems with prayer. When we pray, he says, we do two things: 1) we offer to align our will with God's (which isn't really free will anyway if your \\"choice\\" to not align your will with God's results in eternal hell-fire), and 2) we ask for what we truly want, but it can only be granted if it's what God wants (I'm barely paraphrasing - the actual statement sounds equally absurd.) Actually, these positions are really the only stances you can take on prayer with minimal contradiction. I say \\"minimal since there is, of course, is the contradiction of Jesus telling his disciples that anything they pray about shall be given to them.Chapter 6Miracles. The author dodges the absurdity of molecules of water turning into molecules of wine by not taking a definite stance and saying, \\"I personally do not think that I have to be certain of the answer to such questions in relation to every claim for miracles found in the Bible.\\" Really? That's it? I can see why: to say water to wine was symbolic (as would make the most sense) leaves him open to say the resurrection was symbolic. He has the choice between magic and no-magic. No-magic equals no resurrection, equals many wasted years in seminary. Magic equals silliness. I see the dilemma. The rest is special pleading that this particular God really does have the power to do extraordinary things. Too bad there's no proof of any of it. I like on page 104 how he says \\"All the Gospels also contain stories of the empty tomb, the discovery that first Easter morning that the body of Jesus was no longer there,\\" as though this is affirmation of the resurrection, yet he neglects to mention how very very dissimilar all four of the gospels are in the telling of the empty tomb story. They are more dissimilar than they are similar, yet Christians agree - it's a divinely inspired story.Chapter 7By now, science has completely left the building and it's on to how special you are and you have a destiny that's mapped out for you and heaven will be awesome.Chapter 8The author ends the book with a chapter that pretty much turns the phrase \\"scientific theory\\" on its head and gives it a swirlie. Three paragraphs start out with, \\"no one has ever seen a quark, but...\\" and \\"I believe in the Big Bang [but I never saw it happen]\\" and \\"I believe in evolution, but [there's stuff we don't know for certain.]\\" All of this, predictably, culminates to God having a similar \\"theoretical\\" trait - one that you don't have to see to believe. Here's what an actual theory is about: we have mechanisms that show us quarks are real. We have equations that prove the Big Bang happened. We have fossils and DNA that demonstrate evolution and have even witnessed speciation (i.e., the evolution of a species) in the lab. But the existence of a god? This book, at best, accomplishes a sense of awe about the unknown and the sort-of known. It gives a sense of appreciation for science and encourages the expansion of knowledge - which are great ideas. But it attempts to lump a deity into the theoretical mix and say, \\"here, THIS is why all of this is so awesome.\\" One could easily go through the book and, in most instances, replace the word \\"God\\" with \\"Zeus\\" and have the exact same logical attributes.Conclusion:I'm not quite sure who this book is for. It's way too scientific to persuade a Creationist, and it's not scientific enough to persuade an atheist. The scientific topics can be better described in a more thorough science book, so this isn't for scientists. I suppose it's for the semi-intelligent, adolescent Christian that feels he needs some evidence, or reason to back-up his beliefs. The problem for him is that the evidence isn't there to begin with."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"I found this book to be confusing and contradictory as if the author doesn't really believe what he's saying. I will say that there are many good points made, especially in the first couple chapter. Then in \\"Whats Been Going On\\" onward the quality dropped sharply. Here are a few problems I saw reoccuring.- He makes the point that \`Chance\\" is how nature gains an independence from the strict \`laws' of nature.However, chance may be just more reliable strict laws that we don't understand.- Having 5 fingers was happenstance, but not being able to worship, consciousness etc. However, he also says that there is no magic ingredient to make life. However when did the worship characteristic come in for humans? He seems to be saying that it is much different than physical attributes which happened by \`chance' but also that God does not enter in one day and give humans consciousness (evolution was a continuous process p. 52).- P. 52, we hope to one day understand the biochemical pathways that got life going, but consciousness is a different story (centuries away from understanding). If we one day understand consciousness too, how is he not being a reductionist?- He uses chaos theory as a stab against reductionism. Just because we can't take into account every variable does not mean it is not a reducible system. \`Clouds' are still mechanical creatures even if we can't predict them. The mechanics is just very complex.- Can Scientists Pray has a plethora of obvious theological problems dealing with God's will and the future.- Things not made clear: Where does are self-awareness come from? Some things are determined by evolutionary chance and others not? How do you differentiate between the two? Why does chance give us metaphysical maneuvering? Just because we don't understand something we're going to bring metaphysics into it? Isn't this God of the gaps?- Overall, this book was not very convincing of any of the points he was trying to make. To the Christian, he seems to want to put God into the box of science. There must be a better approach to the God/science question.I'm sure if I reread it, some of these might be cleared up, but there's many more books of more worth to read first."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"This is a great book for soul-nurturing. If you enjoy reading this book, you might also want to read another book, titled: &quot;Get Real: A Philosohical Adventure in virtual Reality.&quot; It demonstrate how we humans can re-create the whole universe through virtual reality and teleoperation, and thus become co-creators of a new world."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"===================Worship Quarks not dieties what kind of non-sense are we to swallow next.===================I can not get past the complete oddity and utter dull drum of all that is not in this book.The belief that God is a statistician and that through prayer and meditation one or more people can produce a desirable outcome in a random universe thereby inducing a quantum of influence in an otherwise absurd existence. Quantumism rejects the insertion of an active interventionist deity but a subtle quantum statistical cosmic mechanic. The belief that a force set the physical system in motion and does not adjust the system whimsically but allows the system to be manipulated through quantum prayer at the whimsy of the systems own evolutionary dynamics.The belief that any outcome is possible but highly improbable if it does not fall in line with the current state of energy and mass in any particular moment. These tenet makes it a more palatable system in a futile effort to satisfy both a deep inner desire to accommodate the traditional grandiose deity and the modernistic scientific explanations of the natural world.Quantumism's growth remains, for the most part undocumented as it is more of a sub-particle of todays modern religions, and any religion or faction that has tried to measure it has cease to exist almost instantaneously. Leading to the primary paradox that believing in something and practicing it are inherently difficult. Which is believed to be the birth place of the saying \\"Practice what you preach\\", the \\"I told you so\\" retort.Quantumism has a long history and came into existence due to the letters between Bohr and Einstien and the many discussions about the ramifications of new realities, relationships and discoveries in the field of physics and impact on society and religion. The belief system has not been well documented or debated like nihilism or existentialism because of the spin. No one is certain of quantumism exact location on the ism scale due to the lack of instrumentations but though it may have a low profile it could simply be due to its existence not being percieved in this dimensional plane.A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty - it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man. (Albert Einstein)I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it. (Albert Einstein, 1954)I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings. (Albert Einstein)Which brings me to my 2nd great epiphany.....I was hoping to introduce another ism that I am researching.... Quantumism has been linked to another belief system based on massism. Spawned from the theory of relativity. The massism movement is the belief that nothing exists but energy. Time and Mass are simply a result of forms of energy like forms of water. The foundation of the belief is that \\"God is Mass\\" and the more massive something is the more godly. As entropy increases the universe cools, and god will reveal himself. Everyday becoming more and more apparent. (i.e. recent polls showing a religious appetite of Americans becoming more godly at the waist line could result in an alteration of Earths spin. As the planet begins to wobble on its axis creating a warping effect in the julian calendar unless a new adjustment variable is added to the already queer formula. The Earths wobble affect is believed to act as a butterfly effect on the whole solar system creating a ripple, the ripple growing into a wave pushing on the whole galaxy. At current estimates and todays weight growth rate in approximately 33.333 billion years (without calendar adjustments) this solar system will act on the entire milky way galaxy moving it out of the way of another galaxy today on a collision course with the milky way therefore avoiding a cosmic disaster."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"Simplistic and erroneous thinking about &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;science&quot; is rife in our era. John Polkinghorne sets himself the task of accurately describing the relationship between them. He refutes the usual lazy assumption that the two belong to completely unrelated categories, like walruses and carpenters. Polkinghorne is convinced that in fact science and religion (at least Christianity) both require a similiar method of truth-seeking. He believes that the search for truth in science was influenced by the Christian belief in God, and that the logical connection between believing in a Creator and studying the creation still holds. He thinks scientific metaphors shed light on theology, and vice-versa. Thus, not only is there no conflict between being a scientist and a follower of Christ, the two disciplines inform and supplement one another.Polkinghorne's words seem to carry a special gravitus. Part of the reason for this, of course, is that he knows his stuff: he was a first-class scientist, physics prof at Cambridge, before getting into theology. Also, in this book, he writes with the kind of restrained simplicity that is good style for scientists writing for the masses, that strongly suggests great intellectual power, sheathed as it were. But probably what gives his argument greatest force is his honesty. The more I read Polkinghorne, the less believable it seems to me that his argument for Christianity might be given either in ignorance or in defiance of the evidence. He might concede too much at times, and he tends to be cautious, but he does not seem to put more weight on an argument than the evidence can bare.I especially liked what Polkinghorne said about faith and reason. &quot;Many people seem to think that faith involves shutting one's eyes, gritting one's teeth, and believing X impossible things before breakfast . . . Not at all! Faith may involve a leap, but it's a leap into the light, not the dark. THe aim of the religious quest, like that of the scientific quest, is to seek motivated belief about what is the case. . . &quot; While a lot of people (both Christians and skeptics) seem to prefer to define faith as believing something contrary to the evidence, I don't think that is either the Biblical or the historically usual Christian point of view. Polkinghorne's argument on this point stakes out the mainstream of Christian thought, in my opinion.Readers who would like to think through the relationship between faith and reason, and between various faiths, in more detail, might find my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, worth a read as well."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"I'm guessing that Polkinghorne wrote this book around the same time he was preparing and presenting the Gifford Lectures (1994) as this book and the text of those lectures (published as \\"The Faith of a Physicist\\") cover some of the same themes rather closely. While that volume (FP) is broader in scope, this one sets its sights more narrowly. Neither book precludes the value of the other; both are interesting. QC&C; is a rather quick read by comparison, so if theology and physics are not your usual cup of tea, this may be the right choice for you.Sir John Polkinghorne, for those readers who might not be familiar with him, is acclaimed as both a quantum physicist and an Anglican priest/theologian (and he's been knighted [KBE], but isn't everybody on that side of the pond these days?). He has won the Templeton Prize and is a Fellow of the Royal Society. His theological thinking is, for the most part, quite classical, although he conspicuously also holds some process ideas regarding God's relationship to 'time' (this is an area in which many readers -- me, for example -- will respectfully disagree with him). His views are perhaps slightly different from the usual perceptions of the ID school of theistic scientists, which alone might be seen as recommending him as an interesting author.My impression is that the target audience for this book is the Christian reader interested in the science-religion dialog and in questions of freedom and the 'problem of evil.' But I also think this might be a valuable book for agnostic scientists and anyone else interested in these topics. Polkinghorne says, \\"Many people seem to think that faith involves shutting one's eyes, gritting one's teeth, and believing X impossible things before breakfast . . . Not at all! Faith may involve a leap, but it's a leap into the light, not the dark. The aim of the religious quest, like that of the scientific quest, is to seek motivated belief about what is the case . . . \\"Polkinhorne's style is both highly learned and gentle, balancing confidence with cognizance of humanity's unknowing. He is one of several important voices in the science-religion dialog."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"Polkinghorne has written a clear and simple (but not simplistic) account of how you can be a scientist and still accept the central truths of Christianity. It is concise and straight to the point, but written so that even the non-scientific or non-theologically trained can follow the argument. This would be an ideal book for anyone who thinks that science has \`disproved' God. Polkinghorne is one physicist who doesn't think so."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"Polkinghorne writes a book with remarkable ideas though not without weaknesses. He doesn't view religion as our internal response to an external world, but considers science and religion intellectual cousins, each providing answers. He goes some distance, surely to be misunderstood and misused, in showing the malleability of practicing science \\"an act of intellectual daring\\" when viewing fact and interpretation, experiment and theory as independent while they are actually mixed up in perspectives we bring to nature. This is more about scientists as humans than science as flawed. Science invites challenge, inherently policing itself, sometimes scientists do neither. Though bias is present, this is not the end point as open publication, debate and test are always available. Science is refutable. He touches upon absurdities proffered by \\"modern philosophers\\" who state we invent theories of nature, we do not discover them. As Polkinghorne notes, our theories wouldn't work if they didn't represent part of the truth. Nature continues to impose itself as final judge, regardless of fashionable politics.Given that unpictureable electrons provide surprises, Polkinghorne is not surprised to find an unpictureable God to do the same. He accepts the oddness of quantum like he accepts the oddness of Jesus as simultaneously man and God. We're not sure how the oddness of say, astrology, with a longer history, many texts and practitioners may fit this view. To Polkinghorne the issue is not fact vs. opinion but interpreting our experience of the way the world really is, without adding \\"to us\\", which without the verifiability science bears, may have less to do with reality outside our minds while much to do with what it means to be human. He views God as \\"faithful\\". The natural gift of a faithful God being reliability of his creation's operation. Ignoring tribal aspects of the Hebrew God, God is also loving, thus granting independence, which by itself is disarray, so both order and independence in the universe. \\"Chance is a sign of freedom, not blind purposelessness.\\" (Take that, Creationists.) \\"Shuffling explorations of chance lead to deterioration and fruitful novelty.\\"Does a world with concentration camps look like the creation of a powerful, loving God? With this we meet the \\"free will defense\\" the potential for moral evil is price paid for the greater good of human freedom. And what about natural disasters like quake fallen churches killing 50000 in 1755 Lisbon, or cancer? Polkinghorne provides the \\"free process defense\\", God faithfully letting nature follow nature's laws. Perhaps violating his own reasoning by allowing answered prayers through adjustments to chaos theory's great attractors, he notes, through \\"free process\\", the same biochemical rules allowing evolution also enables cancer. It's a package deal. Natural disasters are not gratuitous, but a necessary cost of life, though not alleviating tragedy of either. Disregarding what need an all knowing God would have for experiential suffering, Polkinghorne supplies the relieving Christian view - God is not simply a pitying, compassionate spectator but a fellow participant in the world's suffering, known through the experience of Jesus."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"In this short book, Polkinghorne describes how a scientist can intelligently believe in God by exploring the various ways that science reveals God's interaction with the world. I especially appreciated his exploration into God's interation with the world and the issues surrounding God's knowledge of the world. He carefully explained how science may provide a model (through chaos theory and quantum theory) for the \\"openness of creation,\\" and God's knowledge of such a creation. This is a great book, written relatively non-technically, for those interested in the related subjects of science and theology."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"As one who is searching for a philosophy that is able to reconcile my rational/empirical side with my deep sense that there exists the Divine, the title of this book caught my attention. I was looking for a theology that would enable me to pass through the doors of a church without leaving my intellectual integrity on the doorstep; could this book offer such an insight? Well, there was real promise in the first few chapters.Upon reading the words, \\"Faith may involve a leap, but it's a leap into the light and not the dark,\\" I remembered thinking, \\"Yes, he's onto something here.\\" The author goes on to state that neither religion nor science deals simply with pure fact or opinion, they are both part of the great human endeavor to understand. Again, a resounding \\"Yes\\" was uttered from my lips. I also found favor with his assertion that it is not the vocation of science to make \\"value\\" statements however science does acknowledges that value exists. For example, to science, sound is vibrations in the air, but to the appreciative mind some vibrations may be perceived as beautiful music. Value perceptions are just as much a part of our reality as empirical evidence. This is an important distinction and this point alone could have been the basis of a very coherent argument for the appreciation of each discipline thereby eliminating their fight for a monopoly on Truth.He does present some other worthwhile illustrations, for example his analogy of prayer to laser light (you'll have to read it) but for the most part the remainder of the book gets bogged down with age-old arguments of mind-body dualism, \\"proof\\" of God's existence, the problem of evil, and the literal interpretation of the Resurrection of Jesus. I remembered thinking on occasion, \\"where is he going with this and what was the original intent of this book?\\" He makes some rather obvious contradictions and frequently gets caught in the same \\"God of the Gaps\\" logic that he rejected earlier in his writings. The book struggles to stay coherent but looses the battle in the final 3-4 chapters. I was left with the feeling that the author's theology was somewhat nave and would benefit from a good dose of Alfred North Whitehead. Just my opinion."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"Exploring the world of Christian apologetics is like shopping at Wal-Mart. There is a huge variety of products to choose from, but many of them are of dubious quality. For readers searching for a brief introduction to the better arguments for the existence of God, the veracity of the New Testament writings, plausible answers to the problem of evil, etc., Polkinghorne's book is a valuable guide. On the other hand, those who are more acquainted with the subject will find it dreadfully basic.This book touches on subjects such as evolution, the Strong Anthropic Principle, quantum mechanics, chaos theory, the role of prayer, the free will argument, and the Gospel accounts of Jesus' resurrection. Polkinghorne offers a brief summary of the major issues, then explains why he believes there are credible reasons to believe in God. He explores how the indeterminacy in natural systems allows room for human freedom, as well as subtle influences by a Divine Hand. He also faces challenges to theism, such as the problem of evil, unanswered prayers and the alleged conflict between science and religion. He acknowledges the thorniness of the issues, outlines the points of controversy, then shows why he maintains his faith despite, or in some cases because of, the uncertainties of life.A number of things especially delighted me. First, he openly acknowledges that evolution really did occur, although like me he believes that the question of what drives it is far from settled. He affirms his belief in a Deity who experiences the flow of time, a controversial position which nonetheless has numerous advantages over the traditional conception of God. He also dispenses with the approach to the Bible employed by fundamentalists, by recognizing that the scriptures are comprised of widely varying writing styles. He points out that they contain examples of drama, poetry, hyperbole and other literary devices that often sacrifice \\"literal\\" truth in order to communicate a symbolic or spiritual message. In so doing he sets himself apart from the likes of Norman Geisler and Josh McDowell, who try to turn the Bible into a scientific textbook or a formal historical account.Overall I recommend this book for those new to apologetics. For parties desiring further study, Polkinghorne lists more advanced works in the appendix. The seasoned student would do well to consult those volumes rather than this one, unless they need a review of basic concepts."},{"Title":"Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion","review":"I highly recommend this book for Christians who are seeking to better understand HOW God acts in the world today and/or seeking to better understand the effectiveness of our prayers, which of course is related to the first issue.Polkinghorne's answer is summed up in Chapter 5: \\"Can a Scientist Pray?,\\" which alone is more than worth the price of the book and the time required to read it.

And just imagine that, the game come from Japan. If it came alive, it would be cool. There's a really big accident in the book. Well if you want to find out more, you just have to read SkyMaze. But remember, before you read SkyMaze, read Space Demons first so you know what happened."},{"Title":"SKYMAZE","review":"My name is Richard and I have read the great book 'Skymaze.' Skymaze is a wonderfully written book which would delight anybody who happened to pick it up. It has many twists in the plot which makes it an extremely good book to read. it is best suited to young adults. I think this book is real good because it is modern. Not like Roald Dahl's The Twits. It has many creative and interesting caractures which all are full of different emotions. I know lots of people, like me, who like this book and think it is just great!"},{"Title":"SKYMAZE","review":"A cleverly written book that captivated the interests of the 11 and 12 year olds in my class. We read Space Demons first and then Skymaze and have been impressed by both of them. I personally find that the excitement and danger is nicely tempered by the description of the real life conflicts each of the characters go through - the book allows you the chance to have a breather in between the complexities of the maze. My students have enjoyed getting to know each of the characters and seem to consider them almost as their best friends too. We have spent a great deal of class discussion time analysing each of the characters motivations and feelings. Each of Gillian's books lend themselves to this type of thinking so these books are great for classroom teachers. We all eagerly look forward to reading the next book in the series - Shinkei."},{"Title":"SKYMAZE","review":"This book is wonderful.

Again, Mr. Hill has raised the bar for all contemporary writers.Cry Me a River is the best book I've ever read. Mr. Hill is an excellent story teller with the unique ability to create characters that are unbelievably familiar to his audience.I have read his other books,Satisfied With Nothin'&amp; A Life For a Life,and like Cry Me a River, they both are well written, entertaining novels with powerful messages about the importantance of education, the power of love, the need for strong families and the value of friendship, to name a few.I can't wait to read his next book."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Ernest Hill did a wonderful job writing this story. As soon as I opened the book it was hard for me to put it down! Tyrone just got out prison, he served 10 years for murder. Het gets out and his sister confronts him with some devasting news-his son is in prison for raping and killing a white girl and addition to that he will be executed in 8 days. Tyrone immediately goes down to his son's lawyer's office to talk to him to get an understanding of everything. His lawyer has been on his son's case for FIVE years and came up with nothing. Tyrone smells a rat! He then gets together some witnesses on his own trying to clear his son of this mess.This story is full of colorful characters.Rene'-his sister whom he does get along with.Sarah Ann - the meditator of the familyMamaPauline-his wife who left him after he was sent to prison.Father-in-law- tries his best to keep Tyrone away from his daughter after he is released.Beggar Man -Tyrone's friend that will do any and everything to help him free his son.Captain Jack-the lawyerThe story will keep you on the edge of your seat as Tyrone tries his damnest to help his son. You will shed tears along with him and feel his pain. I recommend this book to all booklovers! It was GOOD! LOVED IT! The ending definitely made me cry a river!"},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Sometimes drama can overcome reality, and too often reality is stranger than fiction - but on some occasions the delivery of a novel is so unlikely that its attempt to warm the soul is forfeited. Such is the fate of this novel.This novel centers around a young black man, Marcus, who is wrongly convicted of raping and murdering a white girl. His father - Tyrone Stokes - stumbles upon this scene when the boy is only days away from execution. Tyrone just got out of jail and no one told him about his son's misfortune. And, I presume it did not make the papers as well. With the impediments of parole, curfews, and lack of credibility - Tyrone searches the streets to find out what really happened. And, he amazingly does.Now the bad news. The author wants you to believe that Tyrone was capable of doing what his lawyer could not: e.g. ask questions of people. Tyrone, in a matter of days, did what his attorney failed to do in weeks, months or years. Tyrone, an amateur, was able to do what the police, the courts and more could not. And how? Much through the incognito friend - Beggarman -- who knows everyone who knows anything about anyone in his town.That is the problem I encounter with a novel like this. The well intentioned plot succumbs to faulty supposition: that a parolee can do more in investigating the murder than the police or the wrongly accused's lawyer. And, the simple things he does make the lawyer look like a fool. Tyrone and Marcus, in the end, have a gripe. Marcus possibly a lawsuit - for pain and suffering while sitting in death row because of his lawyer's incompetence which included the following: not talking to the people who lived across the street from the scene of the kidnapping; failing to find out that the murdered child was dating a boy (a black boy); having the right truck identified; or discovering that the murdered girl was pregnant (how did that happen?) And, what do the people do in the end? Celebrate? Yes, for some. But, Tyrone goes back to prison. Explain that, you may ask.If you want a more poignant novel about young black men being incarcerated and dying well before their formative years -- I recommendA Lesson Before Dying.Now the good news. The conversations between the characters are sharp. Great syntax misuse. And, authentic Americana. This author's greatest strength is real conversation. Unfortunately, his dialogue far surpasses his plot line. If his plot could equal his writing, Hill would compete with some of the best."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"CRY ME A RIVER by Ernest Hill captures the real-life essence of the African American male society in which many of life's choices can result in lost voices. The author speaks for and through the main characters. He paints vivid pictures which help the readers see life as it has been, as it is, and as it can be. Some readers might view this story in a negative light, but I see the positive side of it. Tyrone Stokes might have been the kind of dad that no woman would want as a role model for her sons but he proves to be the kind of man who accepted responsibility for the choices he made. To me, he shows that he is not proud of the direction his life has taken when he has to come to the aid and rescue of his son, Marcus.Read the book with an open mind. With an open heart, develop a relationship with the characters. See the world as it really is and then you might begin to understand the world in which we live. It happens around us every day.Thank you Mr. Ernest Hill!"},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Easy summer read. Coming from the south, I could identify with each character.

Tyrone has a gut wrenching feeling that Marcus is innocent and seeks to avenge him before it is too late.This could have been a really good book but instead it moves along \\"as slow as molasses in the summertime.\\" Not to mention that the ending is extremely predictable and rather unrealistic. I must admit that I was disappointed.KP"},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"This is a must read for men! I really enjoyed this book. When I got started I could not put it down. I finished this book in two days. It took me that long because I actually had to go to work on those days. (almost played sick just so I could finish it) This is my first Ernest Hill book, but not the last. Please keep of the excellent work."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Now I have finished reading three of Ernest Hill's books. I must say this book was a tie with A life for a life. But I did like the way it ended. His characters seemed so real. I could actually see the characters. Something like this really could happen. His books are definitely not a lot of fluff. I would recommend any man that has children to read his books. I'm definitely a fan of his, now. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"This book drew me in from page one... it is engaging, intruiging and reads like a thriller. I have never read anything by Ernest Hill in the past but I have become an instant fan !The characters in this book are realistic and well developed. You immediately develop feelings for these characters.. either you love 'em or just can't stand 'em !The story flows nicely with climatic peaks throughout...With this piece of work, Mr. Hill has raised the bar for all of my future 2003 summer reading."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"This book was excellent. The only thing that I would advise Mr. Hill to do is stop overexplaining emotions (ex: if someone is coming to tears, it's obvious that they're emotional. No need for you to state it). This story was really interesting, very realistic, and a page-turner. The dialogue was fresh and up-to-date and the plot was flawless. I loved it! Thanks for keeping my attention."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"I felt every emotion as I sat on the edge the whole time reading CRY ME A RIVER. The characters were so believable. Tyrone's quest to save his son was heart-wrenching. This is the first book I've read by Ernest Hill, but after reading this one, I am in search of other books by this very talented writer."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Cry Me A River by Ernest Hill was a powerful story of determination and redemption. Tyrone Stokes, recently released from prison and on parole, learns that his son Marcus has been convicted of murder and he will be executed in 8 days. Although Tyrone doesn't even know where to begin and although he is very limited in what he can do, he is determined to prove that his son was falsely accused and save him from death.This story was just absolutely amazing and I cannot remember the last time I was afraid to get to the end of a book. This wasn't really a book of &quot;suspense&quot; but it was suspenseful since you didn't know how it was going to end.This is my first but definitely not last book by Ernest Hill."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Mr. Hill yields an adept pen in writing Cry Me A River, a breathtaking novel. It is a maelstrom of excellent literary writing. The author has the ability to create such believable characters and the foresight to weave a story that integrates love, redemption and forgiveness. This novel is an epicenter of creative thinking and writing. Kudos, Mr. Hill.We are all too familiar with crime, absentee fathers, inadequate representation in the justice system, etc. but this novel goes a step further. It illustrates the power of unconditional love for family and its impact on circumstances and situations,needless to say, it tests one's ability to stay steadfast in difficult situations. If you are looking for love, intrigue, suspense and prose that is written eloquently, I suggest you grab some tea and get read for an excellent read."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Ernest Hill takes a reader on an emotional ride in his newest novel Cry Me A River. In this story, a grown man cries and if you get caught up in this story you will cry with him for the injustices faced by the characters in this novel. The novel is set in a rural town in Louisiana that still has an old southern atmosphere. The black people are still not respected and white reigns supreme.Upon his release from a ten-year stint in the state prison, Tyrone returns home only to find out his son Marcus has been charged with murder and scheduled to be put to death in a matter of days. Tyrone knows his son could not have committed the crime of which he was charged; he is too soft for that kind of violence. Tyrone seeks out the attorney who represented Marcus and has the audacity to question his handling of Marcus's case. Tyrone takes it upon himself to re-investigate the case and finds evidence that were overlooked during the initial trial and investigation. While conducting his investigation, Tyrone also has to contend with his sisters, mother, probation officer, in-laws and an emotionally fragile wife. Some of them are supportive of him and his actions; but others are waiting for him to slip up and return to old habits and eventually prison.I am glad I gave this book a chance as it is one I probably would not have picked up on my own, but read it because it was a book club selection. The book starts off slow, like a hot lazy day in Louisiana, and as the sun goes down and cools things off, the action of the people speeds up just as the action of the book gradually gains momentum. The dialogue was crisp and as a reader I felt as if I was eavesdropping on intimate conversations between the characters. Hill does a wonderful job of building up to and maintaining the suspense to a climax ending.JeanetteAPOOO BookClubMotown Review BookClub"},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Mr. Hill progresses with each novel he writes. He has transitioned from a storyteller to a writer. With Cry Me a River he allows the reader to smell the earth, hear the rustle of the trees, and see the fences surrounding the rundown shacks he describes. You feel Tyrone's angst and the heavy burden he carries for his mistakes. You suffer through the four days until his sons execution with him and you rejoice as he becomes, through this experience, the man that he's always wanted to be-the man you want him to be. I actually had to read the end of the book before I finished because I couldn't stand not knowing what was going to happen. I look forward to Mr. Hill's next novel."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Ernest Hill uses words like a Mississippi Bluesman uses a harmonica, mellifluously. Hill's latest literary offering effectively captures the quintessential relationship between blacks and whites in the post-civil rights era South. The author dramatizes Tyrone's encounters with doubt, despair, and death; racism, classism and sexism; imprisonment, ignorance, and poverty. Yet, like the Blues, Tyrone never allows disaster to have the last word. Even the final note of this sweetly sorrowful tune is a note of hope! Nicely done, Mr. Hill. You will soon take your place along side other P.I.M.P's (Public Intellectual with Moral Principles), like Baldwin, Ellison, Wright, and Morrison."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Ernest Hill has done it again! He REALLY has his finger on the pulse of the 70's and 80's south. Just as with &quot;A Life For A Life&quot; I found myself searching my memory for people who matched these characters. Cry Me A River is another example of art invading reality. Tyrone tried hard to clear his son. In effect, he sacrificed himself for what he believed was true about his son. How many fathers would do no less? As a father, I felt Tyrone's frustration and anger on the road to clearing his son. This book had me wanting to pick up the phone to actually call the characters. They felt so real and familiar. Excellent, excellent writing. I look forward to his next work!"},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Ernest Hill is known for writing timeless tales with strong themes of manhood. In his most recent novel, CRY ME A RIVER, he proves that he is indeed at the top of his game. Tyrone Stokes is home at last after serving a prison term and is full of hope that he can begin to rebuild his life and family. Unfortunately, bad news awaits his homecoming and he soon discovers that his only son, Marcus, has been sentenced to death for rape and murder in a small town in Louisiana. Tyrone is riddled with guilt because his own time in jail separated him from his son's life and he feels that he has served as a poor role model. However, Tyrone feels that he knows enough about his son to be certain that Marcus is incapable of committing the crime for which a jury has found him guilty. Tyrone walks a fine line as he tries to integrate into a life outside of prison and keep his probation officer at bay, yet he is determined to prove his son's innocence and save his life.CRY ME A RIVER is full of timeless themes like love, redemption, and overcoming obstacles, while its characters are forced to deal with real life circumstances. It is indeed the kind of story that is sure to become a classic. The plot is full of tension, the characters have depth, the dialogue is engaging, and as a result it is hard to put this book down. Hill's special knack for drawing the reader into the setting of the story will have you feeling like you are in Louisiana right along with the characters. This remarkable literary work is one that should not be missed.Reviewed by Stacey SeayThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"I read Cry Me A River as a book club reading, and I was very disappointed. I thought the writing was juvenile and found several inconsistencies in the plot. Every character seemed to neatly fit into a stereotype - the angry black sister, the church-going mother, the racist police chief, etc. Also, I felt no sympathy for Tyrone, the main character, as he sets out to prove his son's innocence. I expected better writing, a better plot line, and a more realistic story. Cry Me A River was like reading a made-for-TV movie."},{"Title":"Cry Me a River","review":"Louisianians could perhaps best identify w/ this book partly because though the U.S. incarcerates more of its citizens than any other county in the free world, LA incarcerates more of its citizens than any other state in the nation. You'd be hard pressed to ID an African American family, regardless of economic/social status, that could not identify w/ having a family member who's doing time or having done so & the hardships associated w/ trying to redeem themselves. Without a doubt, I'd dare say, we could easily attach faces to the characters which made for very easy, interesting, & emotional reading."},{"Title":"Day Of The Daemon","review":"Alaric is a young noble-turned-explorer.

By his side is Dietz, his best friend and companion. They return to the city of Middenheim to find it shattered following the great war against Chaos. It is not long until they are accused of being heretics. To prove their innocence they take on the task of hunting down and destroying three statues of Chaos.A representative from each guild goes with them. Thus the group also contains a witch hunter, a trader, a cartographer, a scout, a Count's Guard sergeant, and a full unit of soldiers. But destroying the sculptures will not be easy. They must battle tribes of beastmen, dangerous gypsies, a full warband of orcs, and cult members. If even one statue remains the world is doomed. Blood sacrifices will cause a portal to open and the Blood God's champion will emerge.**** This is the first novel in the Daemon Gates trilogy and definitely not to be missed. Each book also seems to be a stand alone tale, with hints as to what the following story will be about. If this first story is anything to go by, then a trilogy will not be long enough for me to be satisfied. From the action filled beginning to the climactic ending, I found myself enthralled.

In an attempt to clear their names they reluctantly agree to a quest to destroy 3 statues which are really daemon gates.

Dean Koonts does not disappoint. And as only Koontz can do -- even when you reach the end you wonder if you were rooting for the right team all along. Excellent read."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I think I've read most of Dean Koontz' books. A few have slipped my radar and I'm trying to catch up now. I just finished Servants, and I think it's one of his best. I like his books because they are dark and the settings are often described with great detail. However, there tends to be a bit too many supernatural events, and too much back-slapping between characters, with some of his work. This one, I'd classify, as a pulse pounding suspense ride. Nothing too unbelievable, and well developed characters. I hope I can find some more Koontz I have missed as good as this one!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"One of Koontz's early and intriguing works was that of \\"The Servants Of Twilight,\\" which becomes a thrilling ride that convinces you to connect with the protagonists of the story and find fear in the religious fanatical villains that are trying to pursue whom they believe is the anti-Christ... a little boy.A religiously fanatical woman named Grace Spivey meets a little boy named Joey out in a parking lot, Joey being with his mother at the time. After being corrected by him about his birthday (which he was correct about), she deems him to be the anti-Christ and demands that he is killed. It turns out she is a cult leader with psychic powers, and with her cult, called \\"The Servants Of Twilight,\\" goes searching for this alleged anti-Christ in order to kill him and perform an alleged act of justice. They go through everything standing in their way and do all they can to reach the boy and kill him.I was hooked to this book! This was one of these ultimate page turners that was hard to put down. I kept thinking, \\"what going to happen?\\" or \\"what are these cultists going to do?\\" There were some of the patterns that I have previously seen before, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.The original name for this book was \\"Twilight,\\" but it did justice to the definition. This book is worth the purchase and the portion of reading time before you call it a night."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I Love Odd Thomas and you rock Dean Koontz!!Read the other Odd Thomas books before you read the Servants of Twilights.

That's how Dean starts this gripping thriller and never lets up. The old woman might be crazy, but she's the leader of this strange cult, and as the reader learns more about this cult, the followers might as well be more crazier than the old hag.The only problem I have with the book is the chase and climax scenes are too long and seemed to dgar on. And after that, the story takes evening on a weirder path, but you are force to think and wonder, and I think Dean did well with writing the ending the way he did.Nonetheless, it was a great book with an ending that makes the reader actualyl think instead of the book gives you the straight answer. A must have for any Koontz fan."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"As usual, he creates great characters that we fall in love with. He subtly allows us to appreciate that the heroine is always a 7 or an 8 but never a 10. She is attractive and sexy but never overly so. She is smart, and capable but just a little vulnerable. The leading man was either the special forces type or just a good guy with a big heart living next door.In opposition, the bad guys are not just evil, but they seem to have all the luck. In the end, the very end, good prevails.The theme is familiar, but what I enjoy is that the events play out where I live; or in other cases, in a place like where I live. I often wonder if I had just come to the store where some dramatic event occurred yesterday, I might have actually seen it take place. It's that real to me.If I have gripe, is has to be that sometimes too much time is spent describing situations, people and places."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This was the very first Dean Koontz Novel I read over 20 years ago.It was so amazing that I have been hooked ever since and recommend him to everyone!!For some reason the movies of Dean Koontz books are not very good at all especially the movie of this book.

I only have time to read before going to bed at night and I couldn't wait to get back to it every evening. Sometimes I went to bed early just to read more. Hope my next book is this good. Good job Dean Koontz. I gave it 4 stars only because sometimes the narrative was long and seemed \\"off\\" topic of the characters. Obviously this didn't happen enough to bore me much."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This is a great read with a lot of action that keeps you guessing. I highly recommend it, especially if you are a fan of other Dean Koontz books."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I seem to enjoy Koont'z older books alot, because with one or two exceptions, all of them are a minimum of 15 years old. Also for me, when Koontz writes under a pen name (which he did with this one, originally titled \\"Twilight\\"), you can count on the book having some horror elements in it, which suits me just fine.In typical Koontz fashion, this book draws you in immediatley, and i mean that litteraly. Within the first 2-3 pages, the book has you gripped up tight and doesn't let go. I own alot of King/Koontz and other author's books that i all very much want to read(i found a used bookstore a few months ago with VERY cheap prices and i went a little crazy), and sometimes when i decide on a book i'll change my mind. With this boook, if you read two pages into it and you have something you need to do or somewhere you need to go....then good luck putting it back down! I wouldn't of wanted to.When a woman in a parking lot tells a six year old boy he must die, the life of him and his mother, and a guy they hire spins wayyyyy out of control. The main villian was a crazy and very delusional woman, but she was a very good unique antagonist.Overall, just another great story from a great writer."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Impossible to put down. That's how you could define that book if asked to define it in one sentece. But more than this, the book is beyond any other kind of entertainment. I tried reading this book 'cause I was trying to get used to reading books in English. And that was the best book by Dean Koontz I've ever read. You'll never be able to forget the mother and the child, that soon start to get into a sea of deadly problems. The plot comes up as one of the best ever written, and the author just doesn't allows you to do any other thing but read the book, because that's all you want to do when you start page one of THE SERVANTS OF TWILIGHT. Since then, I never read other book by Dean to like as much as I liked that. But that may change from reader to reader. Only one thing is certain: the plot will make you be on the edge of you seat the whole time."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, and I have thoroughly enjoyed most of the books I have read of his, but I thought this one stood out among them. In all of Koontz's books that I have read, I have found myself saying &quot;Yeah right, this is ridiculous and could never happen&quot;. Even in my personal favorite Koontz novel, Lightning, i found many things unbelievable. But in The Servants of Twilight, Dean Koontz crafts a believable AND enjoyable storyline.Christine Scavello has a young son, Joey, who is an exceptional little boy who is very well behaved, and never gets into trouble. That is until one day, after a routine trip to the supermarket, a crazed old woman begins following Joey, believing that he is the Antichrist. At first this sounds insane, but then you realize that religious cults can indeed be as crazy as this particular villain, Grace Spivey. Christine hires a PI, Charlie, to help her escape the looney woman, and as in all other Koontz novels, they fall in love. It's very interesting to see the story unfold from all angles. You see the book from the point of view of the villain and the victims, so it is much more interesting. The book has many twists and turns to bring you to the end, and believe me, it's worth it. I highly recommend this book to any Koontz fan!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Dean Koontz has remarked that he'd rather be known as a suspense writer than as a horror writer. I think he manages that very well.The reason I like Koontz books is because they begin so mysteriously; odd events unexpectedly cropping up in the lives of ordinary people. The author engages the reader, immersing him/her in the world of the characters, unfolding the story with skill.Koontz books are page-turners, certainly, and this one is no exception. But, for my money, a suspense book should end leaving me satisfied that the mystery I was plunged into from page one has now been explained.Disappointingly, this was not the case with The Servants of Twilight. Oh, yes, it has a protagonist, an antagonist, and a climax, as novels do. (I won't spoil the story for you here as some other reviews have done, either.) I read most of it in two days; it was that interesting and gripping. In fact, all through The Servants of Twilight there is an absolutely terrific tension, one that I have rarely encountered in fiction, a tension driving you to keep reading to discover the truth. I was waiting for its resolution up until the final page--and it never came.This novel falls squarely into that genre of story that leave \\"what really happened\\" entirely up to the reader. There is ample evidence throughout so that a number of opposing conclusions could be argued for and supported by the story. This was clearly intended by Koontz, but it left me with a hollow, cheated feeling. Is the glass half full, or half empty? You decide. The author didn't.I have given the book only 2 stars in the rating because I don't like this kind of \\"choose your own interpretation\\" in a suspense book. Your mileage may vary. If you don't mind it, you'll probably rate it higher. But at least you've been forewarned. In every other way, it was a great book.Thanks for reading my review."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Here's the question that is so disturbing in The Servants of Twilight. Can you serve evil without knowing it? Can you be good and strong and pure and yet find your goodness helping evil?Koontz seems to say yes in this novel. To me, that left a bad taste that lasted for days. Yet great literature should be thought provoking, and he succeeds in doing just that. Who says deep philosophical questions cannot be raised by so-called commercial fiction?"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Servants of the Twilight is an action packed story that deals with a fanatical religious cult called the Servants of the Twilight. They are led by a woman named Mother Grace, who claims that she has visions from God. Joey Scavello is the perfect six year old kid, and he is being raised alone by his mother Christine. Mother Grace's newest vision is that Joey is the Antichrist. Mother Grace convinces the Servants of the Twilight that he must be killed. To protect themselves, Joey and Christine hire the resourceful and highly successful private investigator Charlie Harrison. Charlie is determined to find out more about the cult and keep Joey and Christine safe. The only problem is that no matter where they go, the Servants are waiting...I rarely read a book in one sitting. However, I had no problem with doing it for this book. The book captivates you from page one and never lets up. The suspense and horror this book brings is unreal. This book really brings a lot of paranoia and conspiracy into the story, because anyone could be part of the Servants, and they could literally be anywhere waiting to strike. The mystery of the story revolves around whether or not Joey is the Antichrist. Koontz keeps it successfully hidden and drives the reader crazy with constant twists, turns, and close calls!Koontz brings his excellent character development once again. Every major character in the book has something to offer. Joey is a great. Depsite the fact he is only 6 years old, he is portrayed as acting much older. His grown-up attitude and outlook on life are very sweet and endearing. However, his behavior is so strange sometimes, that you begin to wonder if Mother Grace is right. Christine is outstanding. The love that she shows for Joey and the determination she has to keep Joey safe is amazing. Charlie is a great character. As a detective he is fast thinking and resourceful. Koontz also brings a nice romance element to the story between Christine and Charlie as well. My favorite character of the book is Mother Grace. At first she seems crazy, but as the book goes on, you start to wonder if she is telling the truth with her accurate and scary visions from God. However, I can only give this book a 4 star rating because of the very dissapointing ending. It leaves the story open for unanswered questions and the reader's interpretation.Servants of the Twilight is filled with good intentions because of the characters, overall action, and the mystery of what Joey really is. However, the book lacks the follow through when it comes to the end. But overall, Servants of the Twilight is definately worth reading."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I'm a big fan of Dean Koontz, but I thought this novel was just average. This book begins with an interesting concept -- a religious cult believes that a young boy is the anti-christ and is determined to kill him. The novel starts strongly, but eventually turns into a rather long-winded chase story. This novel is rather verbose and drawn out, almost as if Koontz was being paid by the word.This novel is rather unique for Dean Koontz because the villains in this book are not completely evil. The religious cultists in this book are actually somewhat sympathetic. This novel also has a somewhat ambiguous ending, which is rather odd for Koontz.THE SERVANTS OF TWILIGHT was written in 1984 under the pseudonym Leigh Nichols. Koontz wrote better books before this novel (WHISPERS, PHANTOMS, FACE OF FEAR) and much better books afterward (WATCHERS, ODD THOMAS, INTENSITY). My advice is to read those novels instead if you're looking for a great read."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I don't get the reviews of this book. This is by FAR the best work Koontz did, it is the only book I've read of his that when you get to the end you don't feel like he was under the gun to wrap up a happy ending in 3 pagers or less.This book is right up there with King's \\"Salems Lot\\" and \\"The Shining\\" as edge of your seat thrillers and the ending of Servants will just blow you away.Ignore the bad reviews of this book. This is the only Koontz book I've ever re-read and the only one I would recommend."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"The only novels that I have read by Mr. Dean Koontz are Shattered, The Eyes of Darkness, and Phantoms, and I just finished Servants of Twilight, which is easily his best book to date.I wanted to read the book because the movie based on it was available to rent just 5 minutes away, so I decided to give the book a try. Wow, is it great!What surprised me most was that Charlie, Christine, and Joey aren't just one-dimensional characters on the run from religious fanatics, but they're much more important, and I felt myself rooting for them ever so much toward the end. Even the relationship between Charlie and Christine seems somewhat real.The villian Grace Spivey is written with such detail that I had nightmares about what she possibly looked like, just like Charlie!The overall best thing about this book? It could REALLY happen. That's what makes it so frightening.The Servants of Twilight is a masterpiece of horror and suspense, and I can't wait to watch the movie based on the book later today.-Brian"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I've read most of Koontz's stuff, and it always escapes me as to why he's marked as a horror novelist. Most of his books are thrillers, and not in the least bit scary. Not the case with this one, though.To make a long story short, Servants of Twilight tells the story of a mother being menaced by religious fanatics who have pegged her son as the Antichrist. At first, the threats seem empty, nothing more than senile shouting and babble. But then faces start appearing in windows, and things start to get violent.What I found most eerie about this story was simply how plausible the premise is. There are some freaks out there, and to an extent it's not hard to see something like this happening. The antagonists in the book were simply human monsters, and nothing more. Not a ghost, alien, or rampant governmental conspiracy in sight. Just plain old human beings warped by their dedication to their religion. Nice to see a change in Koontz's primary antagonists.Other than that, Servants is in Koontz's usual style. Not necessarily a bad thing, but a bit more characterization would have been nice, and some of the dialogue was a bit cliched. The ending, too, could have used some work. But all in all, this was a pretty good early effort by Koontz, and pretty thought-provoking as well. Definately something I'll be reading again."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This was my first Dean Koontz novel; it was OK. It was a believable story; there are probably religious cults who could do crazy things like what are in this story. It has a lot of suspense and action more than half way through, but the chase scene toward the end lasts way too long. Koontz puts a lot of thoughts in his characters mind that are hard to believe when you think of what they are going through at the time. He uses these thoughts as fillers and many of them are repeated too often."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"When I first read &quot;Servants of Twilight&quot;, I was completely amazed. Dean Koontz really showed his unique style of writing that has put his books above so many others. &quot; Servants&quot; is one of his better books and I honestly enjoyed every minute of reading it. There is a reason that Dean Koontz's name is so much more well known than others and it is because he is so much better and that shows in his writing."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I am new to the novel reading scene.When a friend recommended I give the book a try,I was'nt sure I would even finish the entire book.Boy,was I wrong.This book is like the energizer bunny;when you thought it was time for things to slow down they unexpectedly speed up.I was captivated by the suspense and action of the book.If storys about Good versus Evil,the birth of the son of God or satan,and the eternal struggle between heaven and hell appeal to you,THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I have read many Dean Koontz books and I have loved them all. All of his books have a faced paced tall. The most recent book i have read was The Eyes of Darkness as a matter of fact I just finished it tonight and I thought it was great. I recomend his books to anyone. Watchers was also really good. One of my favorites was Darkfall. Ticktock is also one of his best. Once i start reading his books I cant put it down. You start to get really involved with the characters and before you know it you act like they are someone you really know! He is a very talented author and i cant wait for him to write more books!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Smart book that keeps you hooked from beginning to end. You tend to believe one side out of plain common sense and then you tend to believe the other. Even if you don't like the book, you will want to finish it just to know what to believe. Even though the plot is not believable (SINCE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS GOD!), it is very enjoyable if you just remember it is a book."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"As I stood in the used book section of a local major chain book store; the $1.00 novel section beckoned to me - teasingly - as if to say, \\"Put your time in and who knows what treasures you may find.\\" Plunging forward, I eyed the cracked and damaged spines of the well worn paperbacks searching for the last names of specific authors, one of which was \\"Koontz.\\" I had yet to read one of Dean Koontz's novels and welcomed the possibility of finding a random title of his buried here before me.My grubby paw reached out and eagerly yanked \\"The Servants Of Twilight\\" from the many worn titles. \\"I've never even heard of this one,\\" I thought to myself, and the fact that the cover indicated that it was from a best selling author, but not that this particular title was a best seller, left a little doubt in me. I wondered if this would be worth my time. I almost put it back down.Good thing I didn't.Grace Spivey spoke to me from the pages, as did little Joey Scavello, who this bag lady like crazed woman stalked and attempeted to kill with the parish of blinded followers from her \\"Church Of Twilight.\\" She believed the six year old son of Christine Scavello, a woman who almost became a nun, was the antichrist. Charlie, a private investigator is hired to protect the two of them and develpos a romantic relationship with the mother which makes his job much more personal.Koontz is thorough in explaining situations throughout the story and leads the reader along, lulling him/her into the false sense that it is easy to see where the story is headed. Then it turns and spins off in a different direction. Yet never did I feel that these turns were put there just to throw me off. It appears that Koontz genuinely felt this is where the story should go.The ending was totally unexpected, yet not in the sense of most thrillers where plots and subplots are woven together in level after level that you get a headache trying to remember clues while you attempt to figure things out. The ending here is so simple. Too simple - almost. This may sound strange, but the simpleness of the ending is exactly what makes it complex. I'll explain...It wasn't a way out for the author, nor was it used simply as a means to throw the reader off. The ending helped me become more involved in the novel by the way it had me thinking about the story and what was in store for the characters long after I put the book down.The Servants Of Twilight served as my introduction to a man who appears to be a very gifted storyteller."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"im 17 and just finished reading The Servants of Twilight. Dean R. Koontz is a master at writing... i loved his details and the way he explained the story... he is the best author i have ever read and i love to read some more of his books. Everyday at school i would tell my friends what happened next. Every morning they would ask me \\"So what happened next? Did they get away safe?\\" I recomend this book to ne teens out there looking for something to read. But im warning u. once u start u cant put the book done. Happy reading!!!!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Don't get me wrong, at times I love Koontz. I think Phantoms, Whispers, House of Thunder, and Intensity are among his best. BUT the other extreme are his characters that are super-perfect and overcome such odds that it left me rolling my eyes in exasperation. Also the ending greatly disapointed me. &quot;Was&quot; he or &quot;Wasn't&quot; he? There is no closure. Don't waste your time! Along with 'The Mask' one of Koontz's worst ever."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Kept me gripped from beginning to end! I was a little disappointed with the ending, though. But I still think this is a very good read."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Creo que Dean Koontz es el mejor escritor de libros de terror que he leido nunca, estoy leyendo todos sus libros y cada uno es una aventura diferente, cuesta dejar el libro a medias, espero que escriba muchos muchos libros mas."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Dean Koontz has written some excellent books, &quot;Lightning&quot; being the best he has done. Because I read &quot;Lightning&quot; first, and I know other people who have read other Dean Koontz books, I assumed that &quot;Servants of Twilight&quot; would be at least mediocre. I must say, that this was absolutely the worst book I have ever read. The only reason I read it to the end is because I kept hoping that at leaset the ending would be good. (it wasn't). If you think the book is bad, then see the movie. If it was possible for a book to have B.O., then this would be the book to have it."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This book was filled with suspense, I could hardly put it down. This is a masterpiece to go along with many of this others.Tracy Donovan"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I loved this book from the first few paragraphs. I found myself taking it everywhere I went. I was even reading it at work inbetween customers. I read this book about 2 years ago, and still think about it occasionally. I was so engrosed in it, I couldn't wait to finish it.....sometimes missing a whole nights' sleep. I would reccomend this book to anyone looking for a REAL adventure."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"From the first page I couldn't put it down. The characters are very well defined. You'll love the good guys and detest the bad guys. What's going on on the next page? Dean Koontz will make you gasp out loud. Read it. Read it."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"&quot;The Searvents of Twilight&quot; is exciting from the beginning, engrossing the reader in the story. The characters have realistic backgrounds, and the cult that the story centers around could quite possibly exist. The plot moves fast, and though it occasionally becomes predicatable, there are enough plot twists to keep it interesting.However, towards the end of the book, it somehow loses its glamour. The characters, who had until this point behaved so realistically, start to perform virtually superhumans tasks. Also, the conclusion brings up telepathy and clairvoyance...something that I could have accepted if it had been thrown in in the beginning, but something very unsatisfying as an explanation to the many mysteries of the novel. Finally, the theme of the novel had a few intriguing points, but basically ended up flatly contradicting common sense.All in all, the plot and excitement of the book are good (though not excellent)...probably a 4-star rating. However, the ending brings it down at least one mark. Probably a good bet if you're a fan of Tom Clancy, but not one of Koontz's best."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This book is one of the greatest novels I have read in a long time. It is supenseful and intruiguing. This is a book you would make a movie out of and gross big in the box office. I see Courtney Cox as Christine Scavello and Brad Pitt as the PI. It was a supenseful page turner from the very beginning."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Excellent writing drives this compelling story of a mother, her son and a private investigator who are sought after by religious fanatics. Prepare yourself for an unpredictable read! You're in for an awesome experience!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"A very interesting book from my favorite author. I especially liked the fact that there were no weird, indestructable creatures in it, the characters were actually people. You should write more books along this line. I think the ending could have used a little more work, you left too much unresolved. I enjoyed reading it and look forward to reading more of your works in the future. I read everything you and S. King write!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This book is cool. It gets really great toward the end and it's adequately cool all throughout the book. If it gets kind of boring in the middle, don't worry: it's not very much, and it's essential to the plot anyway. You'll see. Oh, they did make a movie from this, by the way."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I thought this book was very good. There was action in it from the first couple pages to the last couple. It wasn't as much scary as suspenseful. This book is definetly worth the time to read."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"One of his earlier works, and many don't know about it. Actually, the story is similar to what you might see on those cheesy cable channel police dramas. The characters are interesting and unique, and the book's short enough to read during a quiet weekend at home. Recommended, but it's not in Koontz's top 5."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I was trying to download a Kindle version of this book. I was on my Kindle home page on your site. I inadvertantly ordered two paper backs of this book because being on the Kindle search page I thought I was ordering Kindles. Shortly after ordering them I tried to stop the shipment. But I was denied the ability to stop them. I didn't like that...if you are going to have a Kindle search page stick to Kindle!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"The Servants of Twilight are a secret religious cult under the leadership of Grace Spivey- an aged woman who believes she sees visions directly from God. Soon this crazed woman comes to believe that Joey, a 6 year old boy, is the Anti-Christ and if not stopped will unleash terror on earth for a thousand years. And so begins the hunt! Christine, the concerned mother hires Charlie, a Private Detective, and soon he assumes the role of a dedicated bodygaurd. Koontz plays with the reader and there are even hints that Joey indeed may be the &quot;Anti-Christ&quot; and the Religious Fanatics may be doing good to mankind. However, Grace Spivey is such a pathetic and ice-cold character that we don't care for her cause. I would have loved if the ending was more powerful and delivered that ruthless 'play dirty' style action, rather than having Charlie reduced to a bundle of nerves thanks to his wounds. But, nevertheless, it is a fairly decent novel to read, has it's share of action and maintains interest- but tends to drag on at some points."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I absolutely adored this novel. It was the second book I read by Dean R. Koontz and after reading it, I came to think of Dean R. Koontz as my favourite author. Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I took it everywhere with me! Servants of the Twilight has what it takes to be a great novel from chapter one! After I read this book, I didn't even pick up another novel for nearly two months because I knew I wouldn't be able to find one that would even came close to how much I enjoyed reading Servants of the Twilight. It's one of those novels where the pages fly because you can't wait to discover what happens in the end, but when you finally finish the book, you actually feel disappointed at having finished reading such a great book and you immediately want to pick up the novel and read it all over again!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This was my first Koontz book and wasn't sure of the writing style at first, but within 15-20 pages I was hooked until the end. Very suspenseful and very fast-paced, the book leaves several questions in the readers mind at the end, but it works for the better. Read the book, but do NOT see the movie (P.U.) I will be reading more Koontz novels!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"To tell the truth, this was my first read book by Dean Knootz and I have been hooked ever since. This book was sad because of the little boy and his mother trying to fight off evil, along with the man who tryed to help them. In the movie, it was even sadder because when you think the boy and man are going to live, the little boy turns out to be evil anyway and the man ends up dying. This was the saddest I think of all this books. Yet, I will continue to read my favoritate author (amongst other) and enjoy every one."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book...I was reading it at every chance I got! I would recommend it to anybody who likes good stories. The only thing that bugged me is that it seemed like the same thing happened over and over again. They would find a place to hide and the psycho church people who find them and shoot at them...then they would find another place to hide and they would shoot at them again. It didn't seem like the PI Charlie was thinking up the best places for them to hide...like in another state or country. It was frustrating. And then end dragged on forever! Dean could have cut down on it a lot. I still got into the book a lot though. I found myself hating the Cult Leader so much that I just wanted to jump in the book help bring her down! I also think it was great in the end how Dean leaves an element of mystery in your head...was he or wasn't he? I think he did it on purpose to keep you thinking about the book long after you read it! A follow up on this book would be great!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This is a semi disturbing story of a mother and her young son on the run from a crazy cult that wants to kill her son. It is pretty standard Koontz stuff you come to expect from him. I was entertained but it was nothing spectacular"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I haven't got to finish reading it yet, but so far it is good. I am at the part where the old woman is getting her cult members together to go after the little boy. I you have any suggestions about any other good books, please share 'em!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"When I read this book I worked in Bullocks in South Coast Plaza. It was too close to home for me. Of course at that time every book he wrote took place in Orange County.

At the very beginning I thought to myself, 'oh just another stupid story about a cult' (I don't read much...) but as the story progresses I see how beautifully Dean Koontz writes.

Koontz claims that autism can be caused by emotional trauma, a theory that was well disproved 40 years ago...this is a decent idea for a plot that is realized in such a terribly bloated plot as to be painful.Simply more evidence that the Odd Thomas books and everything else by Koontz could not have possibly have been written by the same author...wait for it to hit the .99cent bin..."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I love this book!

I wish he would do a sequel."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"What a joyride this was to read; a first class thriller that was very hard to put down a majority of the book. I read it in 3 days. What made it extra special is that I found this to be one of more realistic possible horror stories; something you'd read in the news.The only part that I found slightly disappointing was the end where the big goon lost his nerve to kill the boy and suddenly gained a conscience. It's the only part where i round unrealistic. All of that momentum, all of the drive to end up into what he deemed as his destiny, and he pooped out. It just didn't fit. I also didn't care that the main character actually went to the pet cemetery because he believed that the dog was actually reincarnated. That was a long drawn out scene.It's December 2012 and its the first time that i read 3 Koontz books basically back to back. I usually read him periodically but it dawned on me that there's a similar theme to almost all of his books. 1. There's always a love story of and it's from an unusual meeting, 2. the two main characters are unusually attractive ad in amazing shape. 3. The couple always have unlimited resources to get out of their predicament, 4, there's almost always a dog.I'd like to read a book with main characters who are averageNonetheless, fantastic novel."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This is a novel first published under a different name, and after reading it I conclude he did so because he or his publisher realized it was not up to the Koontz usual standard. A basic chase story, only there's no real reason why the pure kid was picked out to be chased. I'd pass on this one, and head for Odd Thomas instead, a real Koontz novel."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Koontz put out a number of enjoyable novels back about 6 to 10 yearsago but his later novels are a little weird. At least that is my thinking."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This is a good book but as per all Dean Koontz books, it is weird and creepy. I like it when the ending is worth the wait"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Dean Koontz is in my top ten most loved author's list. This book is another reason for keeping him there. There are plenty of reviews detailing the story, so I'll not try to tell it again. Mr Koontz did a tremendous job the first time, and no one really should be telling it again. I encourage all of his fans to give this book a read. It's well worth the time and investment. I've just finished my second read and the book holds up to my two reads test of literature. I read a book for the first time, looking for a story line and characters that will grab and hold my attention. Then I read the book a second time, checking to see if the book contains enough engaging details to keep me as interested as the first read. I've found that a lot of novels do not live up to this process. But a lot of novels do, and I rate the ones that pass this test as the best. This is definately a must read for fans of Mr Koontz. His wit, writing style and ability to spin a yarn are all very evident in The Servants Of Twilight. I definately recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I must be honest when I say that although Dean Koontz is a talented and versatile writer, I feel that his stories could be better.I read Dean for the vocabulary workout and the intellectual diversity of his ideas.I don't want to spoil the plot so I will just give a few hints about what this book consists of.The Servants of Twilight is a different kind of religious thriller along the same lines as the latter three books of Dan Brown. If you like that, then you'll enjoy this.Okay. What if... a single mother and her son were targeted by a fanatic cult obsessed with the belief that her son was the Antichrist fortold in the Book of Revelation, the last book in the Bible?And there you go.All in all this book was very well written (as all Koontz books are) and tells an engaging story that will leave you on the edge of your seat.The author is a master of psychological suspense and is good at writing ordinary characters with extraordinary problems. This type of story works best when it is believable. Now, because Servants have elements of the supernatural (visions, flashbacks, dreams) it may be difficult to digest for people--like me-- who are into realism and stories that could really happen.On the whole though, Servants of Twilight is a believable thriller that yanks you in for the long haul.Ray Bradbury fans (like me) know that Something Wicked This way Comes plays a role in the story. The Hag, Witch, lady leader of the group of fanatics is compared to the blind Dust Witch from Bradbury's book.Servants of Twilight is both a great suspense story and a thriller (meaning exciting, pulse pounding) and a romance and an adventure. It has a little of everything, as well as that famous Serlingesque \\"Twilight Zone\\" twist. Being a fan of the Zone from day one, I could not resist this title.My favorite Koontz books are Lightning and Watchers. Outside of those you're really gonna have to work to find one of his that matches that intensity.So happy reading, friends, and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This was my first Dean Koontz book and I've been hooked on his books ever since. This is a story of a little boy and those that believe he may be the anti-christ. What makes this boy so special?? Well, besides the fact that his single mother loves him very much. Nothing...Or maybe something. Its Good versus evil. But, who is who??? This is a very fast paced book, with the members of a fanatical church stalking the boy, his mother and a private investigator across the country. The action scenes keep you rolling along at break neck speed. Koontz writes for the common reader. His style is very easy to read and not bogged down with alot of metaphores that you can't understand. The only criticism of koontz is this...He does'nt seem to have a ending very well planned out. But, his books (Especially this one) are so gripping that you'll get over his weak endings. Unlike many books with weak endings, the other 90% of this book will keep you reading to see whats next."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This was the first horror book that I have read in along time. And I must say &quot;It is good to be back.&quot; The novel keeps you going, always wondering what's around the next corner. I love the characters Christine is a very strong character, she is to be much admired. Joey is a typical little boy, but you really wonder, could he be evil? And Detective Harrison is a good hero, he always seems to get Christine and Joey from point A to point B. I found the book very scary, not supernatural wise. But knowing what they felt like, being hunted. I couldn't put the novel down I read it within 3 days. I also watched the movie, which I do not recommend. This is also the first Dean R. Koontz book I have ever read, and I am also very impressed."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Compared to other horror novels, this will hold its own. However, if you are expecting Koontz originality and genius, this comes up short. I felt that there was alot of filler, pages that just went on and on about nothing. A wicked witch believing that she is receiving messages from God insists that she must sacrifice the life of Joey, the only child of widow Christine. I felt that I could predict everything to come and was mostly right. It just felt like a used and abused story."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This book was heart-pounding show-stopping drama. Honestly, it was an amazing book with its scintillating suspense and spell-binding romance,that keeps you guessing 'till the end. It's definitely a can't-put-down kinda book. I give it two very happy thumbs up!!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"When I read this book, at least the first half, I thought of what a great author Dean Koontz really is. His prose and style surpasses any other author, and he really has a knack for plot too.The storyline about a group of religious zealots chasing a young boy, whom they think is the son of Satan, and her mother cross-country is near genius, yet the more I read the more the book dragged. It was as if he had run out of ideas for the Scavello family, but I was still enjoying it.After a 200 page chase scene that could have been condensed half its length, the ending totally dissapointed me. The heroin of the story didnt even give any climactic struggle. Her nemesis was attacked and killed by bats, and after only hinting if the boy was or wasnt the Antichrist, the story ended, without so much as a hint to his origins.This is by far not Koontz's best. Read something better, like The Face or Watchers."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Since recently becoming a serious Dean Koontz fan I've been reading some of his older stuff. This book had a whole lot of action and killing in it. I can't say it is right up there with my other 'favorites' but I would recommend reading it if you are a fan of his writing.I'm not ashamed to admit that what most draws me most to Koontz's writing is his high percentage of happy endings in most of the books I have read so far. I'm just a sucker for happy endings, I guess! What bothered me most about this particular book is that all through the reading I believed that Grace Spivey was a genuinely whacked old woman with mental psychosis and that Joey was just an innocent child.I didn't like the fact that the story took a turn at the end, leaving the reader to ponder as to whether the child actually was the anti-christ that the old woman believed him to be.This development left me feeling deceived and empty at the end. As I said, it is still a definate page turner and worth the time it takes to read it. The ending was the only thing that bothered me. The rest of the book was very good in my opinion!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"\\"It began in sunshine, not on a dark and stormy night.\\"- hereinTHE SERVANTS OF TWILIGHT was first published in somewhat different form as TWILIGHT under the byline \\"Leigh Nichols\\" in 1984. The organization after which the book is named is a well-meaning religious sect who are determined to eliminate the anti-Christ before he does irreparable damage to the world. But \\"the anti-Christ\\", in this case, is a six-year-old boy, a sweet kid being brought up by his single-parent mom. Joey at first seems to be a random selection on the part of the Servants' leader, Grace Spivey.This isn't one of Koontz' more comfortable books, incidentally, with a faceless bad guy. Koontz lets us into Grace's point of view quite a bit, and she isn't somebody who has deliberately chosen an evil path. She's a very troubled person, apparently a schizophrenic, and genuinely believes that Joey is the spawn of evil.When the Servants begin stalking Christine and her son, nearly killing Joey's pet dog, the law can't protect Christine, as there isn't adequate proof that the Servants are responsible (or even that they're stalking her family). At that point, Christine takes action to protect her little boy by hiring a private investigator, Charlie Harrison. (Christine does her share of protecting the boy, but she's sensible enough to hire skilled help. Everyone has to sleep sometime.)Most of the remainder of the book is an extended chase scene, although the object is to get away rather than to catch anyone. Several of Koontz' other books have this kind of structure; SERVANTS falls into the earlier versions' pattern, in which relatively isolated bad guys are chasing the good guys rather than vast conspiracies that require long-term solutions.Charlie and Christine both come from troubled family backgrounds, like many of Koontz' protagonists (and Koontz himself), and have managed to become professionally successful. It's possible to draw a number of parallels between Koontz' own background and those of the main characters. While Koontz grew up with both parents, for instance, his father drank, so in a sense the author came from a single-parent family. In later life, Koontz' father was diagnosed as schizophrenic, like Spivey, but like Spivey had an ability to persuade people to follow his lead (though in his case, it was in matters such as starting new businesses rather than new religions).Charlie's parents were abusive alcoholics, while Christine's demanding mother is herself caught up in religion that is more important to her than relating to her daughter or grandson. The protagonists are rather ambivalent about religion, on the whole, each having been devout at earlier periods in their lives, then having experienced a loss of faith. (Christine as a very young woman was a nun, her brother a priest, and their mother is still disappointed that Christine asked to be released from her vows. Christine's brother has since died.) Both Charlie and Christine are capable of intense loyalty and family feeling, while having parents that neither inspire nor deserve either.The bad guys, on the other hand, are convinced that they're doing the right thing. As the story unfolds, the reader may even begin questioning Joey's situation, as many parallels begin accumulating that suggest that Spivey's random selection of the boy really may have been inspired by *something*, although the boy is still an ordinary (though very appealing) little kid. (He asks awkward questions, for instance, about where his father is, and didn't his father like him, and so on. Actually, his father gives Love At First Sight a bad name.)Content warnings: Like a number of Koontz' books, SERVANTS contains one rather explicit sex scene (though not as explicit as that in WHISPERS), and quite a lot of violence, as the Servants seem to have few objections about killing people who get between them and \\"the anti-Christ\\". Organized religion has pretty much failed the protagonists (even if one discounts the rather large problem of a nominally religious organization coming after them with guns).Still, this is a Koontz book. Bad things happen, some people are rotten, and organizations may fail to protect people properly, but individual good guys can manage to come through horrific episodes without being turned into monsters, even if they may suffer greatly in the process."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"From the very first page to the last, this book was non-stop action.

Most of my class did not enjoy reading but after the teacher got us into the first 20 pages of the book, we were all coming in with it to read between lessons. It is fast paced and gets exciting and suspensful. There is never a time where it lags or gets boring, because another important event emerges. The poor characters in the novel seem to go through a dilemma that never goes their way, until the very end when the story takes a drastic change and everyone turns up happy."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Let's face it, anything Dean Koontz writes is amazing, and this book did not let me down. It satisfies the desire for excitement and good literature. I really enjoy the way He \\"turns a phrase\\" and I can sense what he is saying. I can see what he is describing, feel what he desires one to feel with his words, and even sense the smells because he is so descriptive."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I admit that I haven't read all of Dean Koontz's books, but I read this a few years ago and it is my absolute favorite!The writing is excellent, very nice character development, great plot, lots of excitement.As usual, he describes both sides (good and evil), so we get to understand what makes the old woman 'evil'. And we understand her, and in some way sympathize with her too. It is the same with the big 'monster' Kyle. We fear him, but there is a part of us that feel sorry for him. And then he describes the side of good too, and we understand them as well. It is this battle between good and evil, but Dean Koontz shows us that it is never that black-and-white. I absolutely love that about his books!I highly recommend this book! It has everything to keep a reader satisfied - drama, excitement, tragedy, love, romance, fear, hate, shock, mystique and more."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Koontz wrote this one under a pen name, \\"Leigh Nichols\\", I believe. Nevertheless, his real name or not, Dean-o has the terror and suspense cranked up to eleven in this one. Just when you think a set-piece of action has resolved itself and now it's time to resolve some plot holes for backstory--BLAM!!!--there is even more action going on. The cult members and leader and sufficiently creepy, the male and female main characters are believable and act accordingly, the only thing I found annoying was Christine's kid, but that is a minor quibble. The ending is unsettling, but I won't ruin that for you. Servants of the Twilight is a quick and easy read that is entertaining like all the old Koontz stuff. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This is a republished version that Koontz had published earlier under a pseudonym.It is a pretty fast read, but I thought there were parts where it dragged. I also found the ending to be somewhat contrived. All in all, entertaining, but not his best work."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Thank God this is not the first D. Koontz I have read, because I'd be sort of \\"gun shy\\" to read another. But alas...I love Dean Koontz and will probably read every thing he has ever written. S.O.T. starts out faced paced, which I love about Dean, but it soon becomes predictable and sooooo drawn out. Unfortunatley I always finish reading what I start, but let me tell ya this one was a test of my endurance!The ending gets one star. Corny, syrupy, very predictable, very dissapointing. I could not wait for it's finish! Dean you're still the BEST when it comes creepy [story] writing,this one.....not so much.xoxo James"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I can't tell you how much I love Dean Koontz work! The man is a suspense master and I can never put any of his books down. I gave this book to one of my friends after I read it and she is now a Dean Koontz fan!

I hope he never stops writing mystery novels."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I read this before, so normally would not have bought it. BUT, I wasn't paying attention, and did buy it yet again, but it is such a good book. Koontz is a master story teller.....I haven't read a bad book by him yet, and figure I never will! If you like suspense, you'll love this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This was such a great book, I pre-ordered this book,and realized it had downloaded at about 8:30 in the morning, I was finished with it by 8:30 the next morning. This is so typical Koontz. The mom and the little boy are charactors you immediatly get attached to. This was so scarey, exactly why I love Koontz. I kept waiting for the Golden Retriever to start talking and be related to Einsten. This is a really great read, funny, scarey, and very heart warming somehow all wrapped up in one book."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"First of all I love horror in all forms especially in books and film. The Omen and Rosemary's Baby are two of my favorite fright films. When I discovered that Dean Koontz had a similar themed novel I just had to read it because not only do I enjoy these devilish plots but Koontz has recently become one of my favorite authors and has never let me down. The Servants of Twilight continues Koontz's great storytelling and terror. I was pleasantly (morbidly?) surprised how creepy Koontz made this book. The old witch (and that is exactly how I see her) was truly a creation of pure terror. The very idea that religious zealots can be this lurid is something I have always felt because I live in the Bible belt and have encountered these types of people and they are very frightening indeed! The book provides a tense chase concerning the Antichrist and I can't think of anything more macabre. If the creepy and morose are your cup of tea then read The Servants of Twilight and shiver..."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I listened to this book on tape and enjoyed it until the second half when it rather dragged. Not only that but the ending didn't finish the story. I was angry when I finished it. Although some of Koontz's books are absolutely wonderful, others are stilting and difficult to finish and then as this one was, unsatisfying at the end. Not his best, but still worth the trouble if you're a Koontz fan. Bizarre story line, but of interest."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Right from the beginning, this book had me hooked. Christine Scavello and her young son Joey find themselves confronted in a mall parking lot by a crazy old woman, Grace Spivey, who thinks that six year old Joey is the Antichrist. Spivey is the leader of a the Servants of Twilight, a religious cult whose fanatic members do her everything she requests. Christine hires a PI to investigate Spivey and her followers a bit further. The last 100 pages or so are such a let down. The rest of the book was so fast paced that I didn't want to put it down but near the end I felt myself skimming over a lot. It's still a decent read."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Anyone who liked the 1970s 20th Century Fox \\"Omen\\" movie series will love this book. It's less overtly supernatural, but equally suspenseful and operating on the same subject.A mad religious cult determines one woman's little boy to be the Antichrist. The boy must die! Needless to say, the boy's mother has a few things to say about that - but, since no one's listening and the cops can hardly watch her twenty-four-seven, she takes the little tyke and goes on the lam. The cultists are rather persistent and sneaky, however, and won't exactly leave her or her son alone...Nice, gritty little piece, which works primarily by use of shifting perspective and manipulation of audience expectations. Koontz's religious cultists are not mere cypher villains, but credibly drawn and even often sympathetic characters.You'd think, though, if they were going to reprint this book, they would have given it a better cover.The T.V. movie isn't as good. Read the book."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"A chance encounter with a strange old woman in a mall parkinglot, marks a mother and her little boy for death. The woman is the head of a religious cult and she sees the boy as the antichrist. Mother and child find themselves on the run from a bloodthirsty cult that seems to be everywhere. Not even the police can help them as they run for their lives... This is classic Koontz. It is one of the most suspenseful and harrowing novels he's ever done. Highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This book is definitely one of his best but none of the books after &quot;Cold Fire&quot; seem as good."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This is my second Koontz book and I was dissappointed. I first read TICK TOCK in three days. It was great. But this book, on the other hand, isn't. It started out right to the point and had identafiable characters, but then 250 pages I put it down. It just became to dull and predictable!"},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I have read many of Koontz's books, and I just don't see what the fascination is with this title. One of the things I have always liked about Dean Koontz is his ability to write a supernatural tale that is somewhat possible. There is always that feeling, however much of a reach it may be, that this could feasibly happen.Here you have a tale about the Anti-Christ that starts off intriguing, and just degenerates into one long chase sequence. I think the last 150 pages or so is Koontz's over-winded description of the cultists trying to chase Joey and his Mom through the woods. Koontz never really explored the idea of is this kid really the Anti-Christ? We are supposed to think that because Grace Spivey is so intense in her beliefs that this kid may just be the devil's son? It would have been nice if Koontz had teased us with some unbelieveable or unexplainable manifestations of power from the boy, however slight, to keep us guessing.It's like Koontz had a good idea when he started, but had no idea how to finish it. I was quite bored at the end, and was skimming the last 100 or so pages just to find out what happened in the end, which was pretty much nothing.If you want a good Koontz book, read Intensity, Whispers or Dark Rivers of the Heart."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"The Servants Of Twilight(1984). Novel By Horror/Suspense Author Dean Koontz.After developing quite a taste for Horror/Suspense novels with Stephen King, I naturally started looking for new authors to read, and, of course, Dean Koontz was my next likely pick. Anyways, 'The Servants of Twilight', originally titled 'Twilight', is a very poignant novel, breaching the subject of religious fanaticism and martyrism, something all to common in today's hostile world of religious terrorists. So, was I impressed or turned off by 'The Servants Of Twilight'? Read on to find out!Plot-Grace Spivey leads the Church of the Twilight, a religious cult determined to find and destroy the antichrist before he can rule the world for 1,000 years, called the \\"twilight\\" by Grace Spivey. She leads a cult of over 1,000 people, ranging from Policemen, Doctors, and Burglars. While Grace is looking for the Antichrist, middle-aged single wife Christine Scavello takes her 6-year old son Joey to the mall, where they are confronted by Spivey. She claims Joey \\"has to die\\" and \\"he will be killed\\". Spivey continues to harass them, peeking through their windows, killing their dog, and stalking them, and Christine hires Private Detective Charlie Harrison to find out who Grace Spivey is and protect them. As Grace Spivey amasses her followers and relates to them their new enemy(Joey), Christine is confronted with her worst nightmare: More than 1,000 people trying to kill her son Joey. From machine gun raids to car bombs, Christine must do all she can to save Joey, herself, and Charlie, putting her life on the line for those that she loves.Writing/Opinions/Etc-Dean Koontz has always struck me as a slightly sadistic author, and 'The Servants Of Twilight' is the best possible example of this. Imagine your loved one being hunted by thousands of people hellbent on killing him for fanatical and insane reasons. It doesn't seem likely, yet in today's hostile environment, it reminds us that nothing is impossible. Dean Koontz blends intense suspense with a believeable plot, and his ability to put the readers inside his character's head lets the story move incredibly fast. The subject matter is also very meaningful, and Koontz shows all the flaws in religion and human nature. Grace Spivey is the most unlikely villian, a frail old lady, but to hear her mad ravings and insane, yet powerful message lets the reader see the true horror inside of us all, waiting to be tapped; although the idea of believing her may seem far-fetched, I would imagine many would fall into her hold. The Servants of Twilight is a well-written, powerful novel that will strike a chord with any reader.Overall, 'The Servants Of Twilight' is a classic Dean Koontz novel, capable of putting you on the edge of your seat and giving you nightmares later. The religious undertones, the believeable characters, and the realistic plot only help the novel, giving it a deep sense of suspense and mystery.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF SUSPENSE NOVELS, THRILLERS, MYSTERIES, AND DEAN KOONTZ!

But besides 'Phantoms' this is one of the best books by him (or by anyone) that I've read. A strange cult is after a 6 year old boy that they believe is the future anti-christ. They are led by Grace, an old woman who can speak to God and deliver His message to her group. It's a great chase novel, like 'Darkfall' also by Koontz. The only thing that I would change is that I would like to see a sequel or have the book be about 200 pages longer. **SPOILER ALERT**At the end he kind of leaves the reader hanging as to whether or not Joey actually does have any real powers. It's believed that Grace can actually talk to God when they find the boy in a remote cabin in the mountains. When the bats attacked I thought for sure the kid would reveal his true powers. Great story tho, but I think too short, I need more info or a sequel into the adult life of Joey Scavello."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"This isn't one of my favorites of Koontz books but I did enjoy the pace of the book.

At first I made my usual run to the bookstore, and decided to get something different from my normal dose of Stephen King and V.C. Andrews. I wasn't expecting this book to be so highly addictive, just bought it to do something while I was bored. From page one the book had got my interest, even with King it's not till about page 200. The action started right where the story began, and never ended. I was not able to put the book down once, and would not let sleep take over me, I needed to finish the book. Ibrought it to school, and read it every minute. Of course, I did not read much of it at night, for as much as it was suspensful, it was truly spooky. The ending is maybe what you would call a cliff hanger, but not quite. I highly recommend this book to anyone, the action never stops and leaves you with bewilderment of the genius of Koontz. During the last pages I took my time, not wanting it to end. Now that it's over, I'm going to get another book by Koontz today."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"i think this book was great i really enjoyed reading it. i will certanly read it again."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Very impressed.

At risk of using a cheap metaphore, it really is a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. You never know whats going to happen next, fast paced, and the end has a rather unbelievable twist. If you saw the movie then you must read the book, because the movie di not do this book justice at all.The book is about a small boy who's mother and a certain police officer who the mother falls in love with, have to keep him safe from a woman who's trying to kill him thinking he's the anti-christ.

Out of the eight koontz books that I have read so far this is a top three pick for me."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"It's hard to pick a favorite of Koontz's, I really do like most of them. Here again, is another one I enjoyed. I may have read it years ago, but it sticks out in my mind as a great read.If you're not sure what book of Koontz's to read, almost any one you touch will do, this one will do you well I think."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"I disagree with most of the reviewers. Koontz definitely ends the story well, open only to interpretation of how the world ends, but it does end. The Thousand Year reign of Joey, the Antichrist, is begun in a very realistic way for these modern times. Satan is all about doubting: Good, God, yourself, your morals and values. What was not in doubt for me was Koont's literally brilliant ending. The world ended in sunshine, Joey is the Antichrist, and Lucius had more than a little fun creating the little bastard and unleashing him upon the world. Then again, there is always the possibility that what ended were the lives of the protagonists, though Koontz would have hinted at the presence of an oncoming car or spontaneous combustion. No, the answers are all there, and as usual, the author knew what he was doing every step of the way. Does Joey know he is the devil? Of course he does, of course he does."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"Koontz has one of those dual reputations so often seen among extremely successful, highly prolific genre authors. He's successful precisely because many people love his work, but he also has a reputation for slipshod work. As usual, the truth is somewhere in between. He wouldn't be so successful if he wasn't good at what he does--and what he does is tension. He creates page-turning danger for his characters.However, there's truth to the idea that his writing can be rough. Sometimes the pacing of Cold Fire is rushed. The ending of By the Light of the Moon felt weak, and the prose got fairly purple in places. I was pleased to find that The Servants of Twilight had a strong ending, good pacing, interesting characters with some depth to them, and less purple prose.Koontz's books are never going to be great works of literature. They're never going to bring you to tears, enchant you with stunning descriptions, or shock you with wholly new plot twists. On the other hand, that isn't what people read them for. They're engrossing, tense escapist tales. The Servants of Twilight includes non-stop action, some interesting questions of ends, means, and good versus evil, as well as a touch of sex and a hearty dab of insanity."},{"Title":"The Servants Of Twilight","review":"The Servants Of Twilight,In my opinion this is one of Dean Koontz better novels.This book moves at a very good pace and manages to keep the reader on his or her toes. This is a tale of the coming of the Anti-Christ, or is it? Read the book and you decide.The Servants Of Twilight are a religious group dedicated to destroying the Anti-Christ. Do they have the right person?Christine Scavello and her son Joey are tossed into a nightmare. There seems to be no escape from this fanatical religious group.

To apply the adjective &quot;Grecian&quot; to the men of Hellas is a travesty. At best, they should have used the term &quot;Greeks.&quot; Honestly. &quot;Grecian&quot; is and should ONLY be applied to things manufactured by Greeks, not to Greeks themselves. It's like calling the people of Scotland &quot;Scotch.&quot; Try that one in an Edinburgh pub and see how long you last.

Unlike other classical historians, he doesn't just accept stories about individuals at face value but always mentions conflicting facts in the historical record. He often digresses in mid narrative, but never to the reader's frustration, as it is always with an eye to the social practice's and political environment of the people of whom he writes, analyzing deeply with an anecdote here or an quotation there the merits and demerits of that society, and leaving us with a clearer picture of the classical mind-set as well as we might know it. As for the translation of Dryden which my fellow reviewer below much bemoans, I can only say that as a classic of English prose style it ranks only second to Gibbon and reminds us that Plutarch means not just to educate, but to delight and entertain as well; such an achievement is not easily matched without the advantage of genius."},{"Title":"Plutarch: Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans (Modern Library Series, Vol. 1)","review":"Plutarch's Lives is one of my all time favorite books. I especially enjoy the &quot;gay windows&quot; in Alcibiades life and the description of Archimedes defense of Syracuse. My three star rating has nothing to do with Plutarch and everything to do with the terribly outdated translation \\"update\\" by Sir Clough. Sure, as another reviewer points out, it is vocabulary enhancing, but Plutarch was not a Victorian English gentleman. If you like Victorian prose, read a Victorian novel or something. I would actually prefer to read Dryden and company's undoctored original than wade through Clough's train wreck, as I find 18th century prose an easier read, and Dryden was a better writer.If someone were to do a modern translation of the Lives, more people would be able to enjoy it. Unfortunately, the sad truth is that you can probably count the number of good classical translators on one hand, and how many of them have the time to translate Plutarch?"},{"Title":"Plutarch: Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans (Modern Library Series, Vol. 1)","review":"These writings are 100% essential to have as a basis for understanding Western civilization. The description of Sparta here is the benchmark. Understanding the modern issues of culture and development can be made much richer by reading the laws of Solon (who laid down the groundwork for Democracy) and Lycurgus (Sparta - the ultimate egalitarian state) you can see the seeds of a dichotomy that has lived to this day.This two volume set contains the lives of many of the people that you hear about again and again. If you plan to study the classics and read Plato, the Histories or other of the great books, these books are a perfect companion. Instead of reading them straight through, you can read about people as you come across them.With much soul searching I gave the books 4 stars instead of 5. The reason for this is that the translations are challenging. They are not terrible and they are better than other tranlations I have seen, but they have endless sentences and word choices that are not common in modern American English. If you are into personal growth, this may not be a bad thing, because you can look up the words and expand your vocabulary, but it does make it somewhat more slow going than it could be."},{"Title":"Plutarch: Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans (Modern Library Series, Vol. 1)","review":"I have provided a more indepth review of this edition for the Modern Library paperback, but I thought it might be worth repeating one or two comments from that review here.First, this is called the \\"Dryden Translation\\" -- the quotations marks are intentional, because Dryden is not actually the translator. He may have provided some oversight for the translating activity, but the text of the lives were originally translated by others, primarily academics from Oxford and Cambridge. Dryden's one direct contribution is a life of Plutarch which survives here as a few paragraphs at the end of Clough's introduction. The publisher, Jacob Tonson, appears to have used Dryden's name, Dryden was one of his star writers, to gain extra sales.Secondly, Clough's editiorial work has long been regarded as an improvement on the original, but Clough himself, after having started on the revision, decided he really wanted to start from scratch with a whole new translation. His nineteenth century publishers would not let him do so. As it was, it took him six years to revise the seventeenth century translations of Dryden's academic peers. The result is, nonetheless, quite readable and has been the standard ever since.Today the Loeb translation is generally regarded as superior (I have not made the comparison myself, but I have seen a review in an academic journal that was written at the time that the Loeb translation first appeared; the side-by-side comparisons in that review were pretty compelling). However, the Loeb is much more expensive and the casual reader should, no doubt, be more than satisfied with this translation.I felt I needed to add these comments to counter some of the reviews that suggest that Dryden's writing or Clough's editing were superior or inferior based upon what amounts to a reader's casual critique -- a fine thing in its way, but in this case not at all supported by the facts. Hopefully, with this review we may set aside any notions that this is \\"Clough's trainwreck\\" or an example of Dryden's fine prose. It is neither.None of this changes the quality of the work itself. This is still a readable and very good (if not the best) translation of a piece of writing that has its own inherent interests, details of which one may find in other reviews posted here."},{"Title":"Plutarch: Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans (Modern Library Series, Vol. 1)","review":"It is a shame that such an interesting, and historicaly valuable work such as Plutarch's lives is so difficult for modern readers. Though many others have commented on how difficult this English is for the modern reader, consider the following quote taken at random, from the first two sentences of the life of the Roman Camillus:Among the many remarkable things that are related of Furius Camillus, it seems singular and strange above all, that he, who continually was in the highest commands, and obtained the greatest successes, was five times chosen dictator, triumphed four times, and was styled a second founder of Rome, yet never was so much as once consul. The reason of which was the state and temper of the commonwealth at that time; for the people, being at dissension with the senate, refused to return consuls, but in their stead elected other magistrates, called military tribunes, who acted, indeed, with full consular power, but were thought to exercise a less obnoxious amount of authority, because it was divided among a larger number; for to have the management of affairs entrusted in the hands of six persons rather than two was some satisfaction to the opponents of oligarchy.Ugh. And on it goes. The North translation is even worse, to my ear. The best translation that I've found is the Loeb Classical Library. However, they are spread across eleven volumes, making for a very expensive acquisition."},{"Title":"Plutarch: Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans (Modern Library Series, Vol. 1)","review":"Twain's pejorative definition of \`classic' need not apply. I define classic as that (text) which speaks to the heart over an extended duration - perhaps for several generations, as in \`classic rock', or several millennia, as in Plutarch's \\"Lives\\". I probably never would have read Plutarch, were it not for a glorious discovery of Montaigne in mid-life. Having acquired enough distaste for the copious demands required to master classical languages after five years of Latin in secondary school, I made an arbitrary and direly misguided vow to eschew all Classics courses at the university level. And thus again is revealed the fateful difference between post-modern (post-1945), and the modern (c. 1500 - August 5, 1945) pedagogy, of which I unwittingly, if serendipitously, caught the tail end. The modern cannon required thorough immersion in the classics, and, for many years, Plutarch was required reading in the best schools, and should be even now. The author of the Shakespearian plays came to Plutarch by way of Montaigne (and likely read the Amyot translation, and only later the North, if at all), and the English schools came to Plutarch by way of Shakespeare. We might say that the revival of Plutarch was one of the most far reaching achievements of the Northern Renaissance.At one point in his celebrated chronicle of the self, Montaigne (as a shaper and bona fide member of that cannon, guardian of some of what is best in our cultural inheritance) amusedly reveals that, when his critics believe they are attacking his work, they are actually attacking Plutarch and/or Seneca, so profound is their presence in his writing, and, in his \\"Defense of Plutarch and Seneca\\", he declares that . . . \\"my book [is] built up purely from their spoils\\".And what a book it is! But Plutarch's magnum (see the 14 volumes of the Loeb Classical Library for his other works), is the greater. Montaigne is one of the great students of the self. Plutarch is the first (and may yet still be the definitive) historian of virtue. Montaigne, in scrutiny of his own nature, seeks to recognize the limitations and potentials of the self, and thereby sketch our general spiritual contours. Plutarch, in an unparalleled series of real life, historically and culturally pivotal, examples, shows us what they are.The book records in the most remarkably intimate style (Plutarch has few peers as a master of narrative and an uncanny ability to ferret out of detail the significance of individual actions as a unified whole), the major events in the lives of the most impacting figures of the ancient world. Therefore, like the best novels, the book forms a world in itself, a lost world, the world of our ancestors, through a landscape drawn of actions and consequences. The structure of the book is such that an account of the seminal moments in the life of a noble Greek and then of a noble Roman are brought forth in pairs, followed by a comparison. In some sections of the work these comparisons are absent. They appear at some point in antiquity to have either been lost to or removed from the text, which would seem to explain why, for instance, there is no comparison of Alexander and Caesar. But the comparisons are brilliant, and eminently instructive.Of course, from the details alone, we may draw our own inferences. Alexander, as a mere teen, leading his troops in hand-to-hand combat, won his first battle fighting uphill at night. Caesar, a heavy drinker, was wont to ride horseback at full tilt with his hands clenched behind his back. He had a life-long passion for Cato's sister and it is said that from their relationship, which continued through their respective marriages, Brutus was born. Et tu? Of course, one cannot fail to mention, even in this briefest review of the abundantly rich description in the nearly 1,300 pages which comprise the book, the death of Cato the Younger - one of the most exquisitely drawn figures in the book. Hunted down with the remnants of his troops into the wastelands of Carthage by the army of Octavius Ceasar in an effort to snuff out the last vestiges of republican resistance and opposition to Empire, realizing that the last realistic hope for freedom is lost, Cato attempts ritual suicide (a Stoic custom common to Roman nobility) by disembowelment. As Plutarch describes the scene, \\". . . he did not immediately die of the wound; but struggling, fell off the bed, and throwing down a little mathematical table that stood by, made such a noise that the servants, hearing it, cried out. And immediately his son and all his friends came into the chamber, where, seeing him lie weltering in his own blood, great part of his bowels out of his body, but himself still alive and able to look at them, they all stood in horror. The physician went to him, and would have put in his bowels, which were not pierced, and sewed up the wound; but Cato, recovering himself, and understanding the intention, thrust away the physician, plucked out his own bowels, and tearing open the wound, immediately expired.\\" In Seneca's words: \\"For Cato could not outlive freedom, nor would freedom outlive Cato.\\"However, the life most appropriate for the contemporary reader, I feel (and wish that every member of the shadowy corporate/military junta that seems to be ruling us these days would read and take to heart) is the life of Crassus. Crassus was the most successful businessman in the history of the Roman Empire. Plutarch relates that at one time he owned virtually one-third of the real estate in Rome. However, such mind-boggling success was not enough for him. His yen, and later, obsession, was to be revered as a great military leader, a world conqueror, expand the domain of the already burgeoning Empire, and the object of his fantasies was the area of the world at that time known as Mesopotamia and Persia, today as Iraq and Iran. We follow as he makes extensive preparations, investing his own fortune and a great deal of the nation's wealth into outfitting an army for the venture. And at first, the invasion of Mesopotamia seems to go well. But the centers of population are spread out over great stretches of desert, and the occupation never really succeeds, because a central authority cannot be solidly established. Crassus, however, remains undaunted, even though the troops are becoming mutinous as supplies begin to run thin. Led on by treacherous advisors, he enters Parthia (somewhere in the vicinity of modern day Syria). Plutarch describes the grueling denouement with his usual detachment, aplomb, and gifted eye for pertinent detail. Having lost the greatest fortune in the world, he proceeds to lose his troops, then his sons, and finally his life. These lessons are never too late for the learning, and my apologies to Twain, but a classic is a text which retains its urgency to be read, and read now.I read the Dryden/Clough translation. Dryden was never my favorite writer of his period, the late 17th century - hardly a match for Burton or Milton, in my opinion, but he was poet laureate, and this work I love - his English is fine, and resonates with classic dignity. Clough, the mid-nineteenth century British scholar who revised the translation, befriended Emerson when he traveled to England, and became a sort of mentor to the New England Transcendentalists in general. We can be grateful for such a wonderful rendering for one of the very greatest and most edifying masterpieces."},{"Title":"Plutarch: Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans (Modern Library Series, Vol. 1)","review":"Plutarch's lives has biographies of various people such as Lycurgus, who made laws for Sparta, Caius Marius, a Roman who led his army victoriously against the Teutonish, Cimbrish, and Ambronish invaders. Shakespeare based his play on Julius Caesar from an account of the same person in Plutarch's Lives. This book contains a lot of information and you'll probably like it if your really into Greco-Roman history, but it is a tough read."},{"Title":"Plutarch: Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans (Modern Library Series, Vol. 1)","review":"In response to the review below:&quot;Simple pleasure&quot; is worth something; Dryden's Plutarch, promoted in &quot;yet another&quot; publication, is worth even more.? This translation by this talented poet is rendered &quot;useless&quot; by the absence of &quot;reference numbers&quot;? Plutarch is not about &quot;indexing&quot;, but about morality, courage, and fate.

He wrote what I feel is the first psychological history by way of comparing the lives of almost two dozen men, giants of their time on earth. After the publication of \\"The Lives,\\" he became famous all over the Roman Empire. So little is known about the man himself, but legends grew up around him even while he still lived.Will you profit from reading this? YES. It will change your life much for the better if you pay close attention to his turn of word, of phrase, and take the life lessons learned to heart. What then is noble? What is virtue? What is courage? What is folly? What makes a life worth living? What is the good life? What is the nature of evil, of excessive lust, of the worship of power, of the drooling after riches?Not to go into great detail, but you will meet many characters, all famous to Greek and Roman students of history, and get to know selected, remarkable men that shaped that history, and in a sense the very times we are living now. You will see parallels with these men and our political and military figures today, believe me. You will see parallels: an ancient incarnation of Kennedy or a Bush, a Roosevelt or a Hoover, an Eisenhower and a Hitler, a Warren Buffet and a Larry Ellison.They will seem far larger than life. Some of them you will recognize such as Alexander of Macedon, Julius Caesar or Mark Anthony (Marcus Antonius). Others you may not, such as Alcibiades, Pyrrhus, Themistocles, Cato, Lysander, Marius, Cimon, Pericles, Lucullus, or Galba, or Solon, or Timoleon or Lycergus. The biographies bring to life people that actually lived and breathed on this earth. Plutarch brings makes them real. You hear their very words, breath passing through their teeth, so to speak, just as they were pronounced while their hearts pumped and their minds were alert. In many ways, people's minds remain so much their same, but tempered, of course, by their cultures and the times and circumstances in which they found themselves. One great historical figure after another is counterpoised against another, his similar. A work of great power and vision. I admire this man and his razor sharp insight almost more than any man I have ever encountered in my own life, past or present, living or dead.You will learn by reading their lives, of what honor really is, of nobility of character, what is just, what is good, what is moral, what is valorous, what is worthwhile, in sum, what is admirable and honorable in human beings, as well as what makes men the worst of human beings. The entire book is written in a long forgotten, elegant, highly sophisticated style, so good, so excellent, so perfectly said, that at times it brings tears to your eyes just to have the honor of reading such beautifully put phrases.What a mind Plutarch has! And he generously shares it with you! This book has the power to make you a human being seeing another human being's life played out in dramas so huge in scale, so magnificent, so triumphant or so tragic, that it reads as fiction, if it were not for Plutarch's insistence on accuracy, never swerving from the truth. I say this with all my heart and mind. Plutarch wrote a masterpiece. A Masterpiece!It should be required reading in every high school in this country. If it had been, what a wiser, more noble, more just, open-minded, less provincial and a more intellectual a collection of people Americans would be. Yes, for some, it will be a case of casting pearls before swine, but \\" The Lives\\", with its power and wisdom, will last through the ages to come. Plutarch has that ability to unlock the secrets of what the good life truly is, in all that that means. To read him is to understand the underpinnings of Western Civilization, and therefore, the underpinnings of our culture of today, and the underpinnings of your own life...right now.NOTE: Do not buy \\"Selected Lives\\"--seek out the original, full length edition. The Great Books (Encyclopaedia Brittanica) publishes a good Dryden edition if you can find one.Be well, my fellow souls.

Of course, as a couple of the other comments pointed out, this book is not an in-depth presentation of life in a trappist monastery. But it is not pretending to be such a thing. This book gives a nice taste of life in the monastery for a monk and for a retreatant. You get just enough of the taste of the history of this monastery to whet your appetite for more.If you're interested in more, the author has a large, photo-illustrated history of Gethsemani. There are other books on trappist monasteries as well. If you've ever been to Gethsemani and had the pleasure to hear Fr. Matthew's evening talks, you'll want to look for some of the books of his writings. Matthew Kelty is his name.Also, I have read another book in this same series (A Week Inside) on a Buddhist Monastery. Very very interesting.

I was expecting an in-depth day-by-day look at a monk's week, the perspective being from a lay person (albeit a person with much experience at the Abbey of Gethsemane) looking in on a religious person's life. And that is what I got but, oh, so much more! &quot;A Week Inside&quot; includes a look at the retreatants at the Abbey as well, as their days intertwine with the schedule of prayer and work that is the mainstay of Cistercian life. From her arrival to her departure, I felt as if I was following Aprile around the monastery, talking to monks and retreatants, praying the liturgical hours, keeping silence at the appropriate times, learning more and more about Benedictine spirituality. Her focus on a few brothers in particular was heart-warming, and showed the stuff of which they are made - flesh and blood, heart and soul - like the rest of us.

As such I was excited about getting an indepth look at the Trappist Abbey, Gethsemani. Unfortunately it was a much more simplistic description of abbey life than I had expected. Except for the detailed and good description of lectio divina, the text was pretty superficial. I especially hoped to find explanations of how 25 disparate men could learn to live together peaceably over the long term. The book told me that this was indeed a challenge for folks who have committed to never leaving, but the author never got into the kinds of interactions that moved the monks toward unity and those that disrupted the process.

This is a highly dysfunctional family to say the least.Though the simplicity of the narrator's words rang authentic enough, and it was heartwarming to read of Lou Ann's brief and singular hope, it was a melancholy tale. The story lacked anything even resembling humor to balance out the darkness -- of which there was far too much.

She continues to have goals, dreams and hopes, despite her very dysfunctional family.It is amazing how a 12 year old can overcome the emotionl, mental, and physical abuse of her unstable parents. The mother Loretta is so nuerotic in part stemming from her 5 miscarriages, her poverty, isolation, and slimebag husband. The father is no better, with his drinking, cheating, and verging on sexual abuse of Lou Ann. The more I disliked the parents, the more I cheered for Lou Ann to overcome her circumstances.

It doesn't matter if you are in need of medication or not.

Think about extreme dysfunctional families...Her Mother has lost 6 babies before pregnancy termination and is pissed off with the world and her cheating husband who doesn't care that she is expecting a child and cheats all the same.Lou Ann keeps little dolls in a box, they are her dead brothers and sisters, including the one in the way, he comes out dead and Lou Ann's mother almost dies, she began drinking and denying the reality that she was not going to make it through this time around either.Lou Ann is belittled by her mother, called a whore, a tramp and forced to wear a trampy dress for a while there... this is a heartbreaking and fortifying story because Lou Ann doesn't give up faith, she writes her diary wanting the world to hear her voice, to know what happened, to make her life relevant.I won't go deeper than this outline, you have to feel Lou Ann and hear her voice, it will break your heart and make you stronger, choose life like she did."},{"Title":"The Box Children","review":"I loved this book - it is both humorous and touching, a real page turner!

I am so grateful to Sharon Wyse for sharing this painful and brave story."},{"Title":"The Box Children","review":"This is the only novel I have ever read that accurately depicts life in the the starkly beautiful Texas Panhandle. Sharon Wyse, through the voice of Lou Ann Campbell, has made me remember my childhood and what it was like to have hopes and dreams in a family and environment that did little to encourage them. Any reader who is familiar with this place and time period will be pulled back there, and those who aren't familiar with it will get a true-to-life taste."},{"Title":"The Box Children","review":"The Box Children is a coming of age story about a young Texan farm girl, who, over the course of a 1960 summer experiences the undoing of her mother's sanity. By wonderfully recounting the LouAnn's diary, Sharon Wyse gives us sight into the life of this sensitive adolescent girl.Unlike other reviewers, there is no way I can give this book more than two stars. The book is well written, and LouAnn does capture the heart of readers. However, Wyse gives little if any hope for redemption in the story. The lives of all the prominent grown-ups in the story are so skewed, I was left feeling scared and hopeless. The parents, grandparents and other adults from the church and community were all abusers, whores, gossipers and more. The only adults who had any good sense about them were the hired hands on this Texan farm.Even in fiction, the author must tell the truth. Where was even one adult who would have been in a position to effect good in the life of this child? Where was the one who might be able to help her on the long and slow road back to wholeness? Wyse' readers deserve more, and she is obviously capable of giving it."},{"Title":"The Box Children","review":"Sharon Wyse's literary debut is an impressive one. To write a coming-of-age novel like this, finding an absolutely perfect voice for her 11 year-old narrator, as well as treating her young character with the respect she deserves is quite an achievement. Too many authors attempt this type of novel and wind up being offensively patronizing toward the children they depict. Wyse's insights, sensitivity and skills allow her to avoid such pitfalls.Set on a farm near a (very) small town in the Texas panhandle in the 1960s, the story is narrated by 11 year-old Lou Ann Campbell -- one of the most unforgettable, admirable characters the reader is likely to run across in contemporary fiction. She lives with her parents and her older brother -- and they're packing a lot of baggage. Her mother is decidedly -- and increasingly -- neurotic, taking out her frustrations with her philandering husband, her emotional damage caused by numerous miscarriages, and her feelings of being trapped in poverty out on her children, especially Lou Ann. Lou Ann's brother, with whom she has enjoyed a close sibling relationship, is maturing to the point where he sees his little sister as more of a liability than as asset -- and his sexual curiosity is making her increasingly uncomfortable as well. Lou Ann's father, despite being unfaithful to his wife, is not such an unlikable character. He doesn't understand his wife's emotional problems, and he too is frustrated with the family's economical stagnation, their dependence on his wife's parents (who own the land they farm) for stability.Lou Ann is convinced that the five babies miscarried by her mother are with her -- she has a cardboard box and five tiny dolls to live in it, the 'box children' of the title. She plays with them daily, confides in and talks with them. These conversations, along with the outlet of her secret diary (which makes up the novel) are the outlets that allow her to get through the events of the book, to find some meaning in her life, and to strengthen her determination to be strong and live her life as she sees fit.The novel is moving, well-written and compelling -- I had to pace myself, allowing myself to savor it, rather than rush through it. It's a reading experience I thoroughly enjoyed, and one I will never forget -- and one I can most highly recommend.Other great coming-of-age novels I've read in the past couple of years -- all of which I can recommend just as highly -- include THE ABSENCE OF NECTAR by Kathy Hepinstall, SHADOW BABY by Alison McGhee, and THIS IS GRACEANNE'S BOOK by P.L.WHITNEY.Read on..."},{"Title":"The Box Children","review":"As a voracious reader, and a writer, I am rarely so impressed. Sharon Wyse's heroine speaks with a wholly original, and heartbreakingly true, voice; I simply cannot get it out of my head -- I want to personally, and permanently, rescue this child. On a literary level, the book is pure and brilliantly wrought. On an emotional one, it burrows to the deepest places -- taking the reader inside the mind and heart of an unforgettable young heroine, and what looks like an impossible-to-survive place, but maybe (thrillingly) isn't. Extraordinary."},{"Title":"The Box Children","review":"For such a small novel, the author packs an emotional punch with the character of eleven year old Lou Ann. To say Lou Ann's family is dysfunctional is an understatement; Daddy has a roving eye and Mama's laundry list of neuroses would fill the page. To cope with this intolerable home life, Lou Ann creates an imaginary world with \\"The Box Children\\", the unborn babies from her mother's many failed pregnancies. This novel speaks to the resiliant spirit of children from dysfunctional homes, and offers a somewhat hopeful future for our heroine. If you read this book you will think as I do, that Lou Ann was able to triumph over adversity and make her way in the world. 4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Box Children","review":"I have been a lonely child. I have hungered for a connection to a parent that was too busy, too self- centered, too broken. I have known and loved imaginary playmates that were more real to me than the actual living, breathing world. I have been confused by the ways of grown ups to the point of desperation. Sharon Wyse has created a character that could've been me - or you - or her. Lou Ann's struggle to be seen and heard, to belong, to be cherished - is so utterly profound and immediate - that I still hear her voice in my head. Sharon Wyse lives up to her name - she gives us a little girl with a story that will echo in our hearts forever."},{"Title":"The Box Children","review":"There is not much I can say about this book.....whatever I say will never do this book justice.

It is short, it is sweet, it is a great story.Our story is told in diary form -- love that concept! - by 11 year old Lou Ann. Lou Ann's story takes place in the early 60's in a small half-horse town in Texas.She has a boat load to deal with -- her dad, is a drinking, womanizing, farmer who likes to \\"almost mess around\\" with Lou Ann. He is one NOT to be trusted.Her mom is totally unstable, I figured this was due to the fact she suffered from five miscarriages, dealing with her husband, and working herself practically to death and still living in near poverty.Lou Ann's view of life is more mature than any young girl I know, but she has paid her dues. Her family is a mess. The only person she can really relate to is her slightly older brother and their relationship is changing due to the fact they are growing up. What makes matters worse, is they are pretty isolated out on their wheat farm.Lou Ann's parents make her life crazed. Lou Ann is more mature than her parents. Things happen in their lives and Lou Ann tells it all fact for fact. Her diary is her outlet and she is a good writer. Her writings are smart, insightful, and funny. I especially liked how the author had Lou Ann misspell words which would be true for an 11 year old. Class!One of the funniest passages in Lou Ann's diary regarding her mom reads: \\"I thought of her in hell. She would be running the place in no time.\\" Good stuff, witty for sure!Lou Ann triumphs over her dad's sexual advances towards her, along with his cheating on his wife and drinking and her mom's cruelty and being so unstable. Poor Lou Ann, she is a true hero!!!!This is a short little book, but it is big on excellence. I HIGHLY recommend this book.

I was particularly touched by the way the author used the child's voice to portray adult situations happening to her... the innocent way she explained the adult things going on around her.

Living on a farm in the early 1960s, Lou Ann's family is anything but normal. Her mother is decidedly unhinged, and heaps abuse on Lou Ann and her brother. Her mother has had numerous miscarriages, which figures prominently into Lou Ann's tale. Lou Ann's father is a womanizer whose hands will stray to Lou Ann if he's had too much to drink.The family dysfunction forms Lou Ann's narrative and she grows from a naive little girl into a young woman. Truth and optimism flow from Lou Ann's journal, despite her circumstances.This novel, or perhaps more closely a novella, read extremely fast. It was a very small book that was only 192 pages. Aside from its size, Lou Ann's voice made it nearly impossible to put down. She is trapped in a household of violence and insanity, yet her voice is full of hope.

As this prarie girl yearns to live life to the fullest and see the world, she must deal with problems (and tradgedies) for which family members try to blame her. Lou Ann must learn, the hard way, the truth about her mother.

Under his friend the King, he served in many capacities - Speaker of the House of Commons, Master of Requests, Privy Councillor, etc. - culminating with the trust of the position of Lord Chancellor, a position in those days matching the prominence (if not the definition) of Prime Minister in these days. More's strong integrity and resolute mind caught the attention of scholars, political and church leaders internationally; it was this same integrity that most likely was his undoing, refusing to assent to the King's divorce and severance of ties binding the English Church with the Roman overlordship of the Pope. Indeed, More was, if not the actual ghostwriter, then certainly an inspiration and editorial aide to the document produced by King Henry VIII against the continental protestants, earning for Henry (and his heirs ever after) the title of Defender of the Faith (historical irony is that this title, most likely not intended to be hereditary, now declares the defense of a faith separated from the one for which the title was bestowed).While an Ambassador to Flanders, More spent spare time writing this book, 'Utopia'. The very title is a still a by-word in the English language (as well as others) of a state of bliss and peace; it is often used with the context of being unrealistic. 'Utopia' is More's response to and development from Plato's 'Republic', in that it is a framework for a perfect society, or at least perfect according to More's ideas of the time. Penned originally in Latin, 'Utopia' has been translated widely; one of the better translations is by H.V.S. Ogden, in 1949, still reprinted in various editions to this day. Originally published in Latin in 1516, the first English version appeared in 1551, some 16 years after More's death.-----------Utopia-----------Thomas More writes this as if he were traveling, and meets his friend Peter Giles, who introduces him to Raphael Hythloday, a scholar/traveler with tales to tell.Hythloday made friends with a prince who outfitted him for a journey. He traveled through deserts and fertile lands. He proceeds to give an account to Giles and More. In an ironic twist, given More's own attachment to Henry VIII, Hythloday states that he doesn't give his information in advice of kings or princes, for to be beholden to them is not a wise thing. He quotes Plato, in saying that unless kings were themselves philosophers, they should never appreciate philosophers.More argues for public service, which Hythloday rejects as something that other place-seekers will use to bolster their own positions. Then Hythloday makes the startling pronouncement with regard to how a society should be constituted: 'As long as there is property, and while money is the standard of all things, I cannot think that a nation can be governed either justly or happily; not justly, because the best things will fall to the share of the worst men; nor happily, because all things will be divided among a few (and even these are not in all respects happy), the rest being left to the absolutely miserable.'Hythloday proceeds to give an account of the life of Utopia, where, he says, there are so few laws and so much liberty and equality that virtue is always rewarded, and each person has what he or she needs. He talks about this under the following headings:Of Their Towns, Particularly of AmaurotOf Their MagistratesOf Their Trades, and Manner of LifeOf Their TrafficOf the Travelling of the UtopiansOf Their Slaves, and of Their MarriagesOf Their Military DisciplineOf the Religions of the Utopians'Utopia' is a radical document. It anticipates the modern idea of communism, with private property at a minimum; it is generations ahead in the idea of equality of the sexes and freedom of religion. This may seem a remarkable statement from someone who will go to his death supporting the Roman hierarchy, but in historical irony, had religious freedom been respected in England at the time, More would have had nothing to fear.'Utopia' was a place of education and free inquiry. Again, More's own life models this - travelers from as far away as Constantinople and Venice, visiting More's home in Chelsea, remarked on the incredible sense of knowledge and respect for reason and learning, not just for the men, but also for the women of the household (More's own daughter once impressed Henry VIII with her Latin training so much he was at pains to find something at which he excelled that he could best her at).At different points throughout the text, More (speaking through Hythloday) jabs in witty and insightful manner the habits of the day - that kings are often more concerned to fill their own coffers than increasing the general wealth of the nation; that courts are designed to be self-serving and self-perpetuating; that liberties are curtailed not for just and reasonable causes, but often for petty personal reasons.Some of the ideas, however, are not as modern or enlightened as they might seem at first glance. Utopians' freedom of religion exists only in very narrow bounds of reason - they are all monotheists, and while they might identify this deity with the sun or moon or a good person who died long ago, they are not permitted to speak or attempt to convert others to this idea, without risking bondage or death. Not too Utopian after all...-------More was beatified by Leo XIII in 1886 and canonised by Pius XI in 1935 (it is significant to note that Anglican-Roman relations were at a strained point during these times, and the raising of an English saint who rejected the Anglican construct served at least minor political points, something More would have been able to appreciate, if not approve).

And in Jack McMorrow, he has created a character I care about and relate to. I appreciate the way the tension builds on a slow upward grade to a clash at the end in both this novel and in his first McMorrow effort, 'Deadline.' All the while, Boyle paints a vivid picture of New England that makes me long to live there. Having concocted such a likable protagonist as McMorrow, however, Boyle tends to let him sit in rather the same fashion the owner of an expensive car keeps it off the road for fear of damaging it. Tightening up his plots and giving his characters a little more to do, would to my mind, make Mr. Boyle's fiction worthy of more 5 star, instead of 4 star reviews."},{"Title":"Bloodline (A Jack Mcmorrow Mystery)","review":"At first the wisecracking is cute and often funny but somewhere in the middle of the book it starts to become annoying.

See kwon- inIndo-European Roots.]Such are the real dictionary definitions of the stance which Ambrose Bierce adopted in considering the world. Beginning in 1881 and continuing to 1906, he created a series of sardonic word definitions of his own. Many of these were collected and published as The Cynic's Word Book, which he later protested was \\"a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve.\\" So in 1911, he pulled together a collection that was more to his own liking and called it The Devil's Dictionary. The entries are a tad uneven in quality, but most are amusing and some are great. Each reader will have his own favorites, some of mine are as follows :ACQUAINTANCE, n. A person whom we know well enough to borrow from, but not well enough to lend to. A degree of friendship called slight when its object is poor or obscure, and intimate when he is rich or famous.ALLIANCE, n. In international politics, the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each other's pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third.BIGOT, n. One who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not entertain.BORE, n. A person who talks when you wish him to listen.CONSULT, v.i. To seek another's disapproval of a course alreadydecided on.CYNIC, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision.DICTIONARY, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping thegrowth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. Thisdictionary, however, is a most useful work.DISCRIMINATE, v.i. To note the particulars in which one person or thing is, if possible, more objectionable than another.EDUCATION, n. That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding.FUTURE, n. That period of time in which our affairs prosper, ourfriends are true and our happiness is assured.HISTORY, n. An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools.IDIOT, n. A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling. The Idiot's activity is not confined to any special field of thought or action, but \\"pervades and regulates the whole.\\" He has the last word in everything; his decision is unappealable. He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line.POLITICS, n. A strife of interests masquerading as a contest ofprinciples. The conduct of public affairs for private advantage.And, my choice for the very best among them :CONSERVATIVE, n.

Mark Aldrich, professor at Smith College, offers a fascinating historical perspective on the growth of American railroads as seen through the eyes of safety failures and successes. It is easy to forget that railroads were the key source of transportation in the 19th century and into the 20th century. But safety took a back seat to progress during the early years, and thousands died and were injured in train wrecks and pedestrian/train incidents. Safety evolved over the decades, and railroad safety improvements were often due to a combination of engineering changes, economic pressures, changes in liability law, media pressures, and public perception. Aldrich writes that regulatory efforts to improve safety were often uneven, in part because the technology changed so rapidly as to prevent effective use of prescriptive rules. The most effective safety improvements were those that increased profits. For example, better signaling improved safety, but signal improvements were primarily put in place to allow heavier traffic and hence output. The press played a role in safety improvements; publicity of accidents forced more openness in accident reporting and led to improvements in a number of areas. In addition, technical journals and societies shepherded positive changes by providing a forum for safety information and by critiquing practices and technologies. Liability law was also a key factor in safety improvements; once companies were held liable for pedestrian and worker injuries then efforts such as the Safety First movement took hold. And, as Aldrich states, the effectiveness of new safety equipment was contingent not only on the state of technology, but also on factors such as the quality of parts, maintenance incentives, worker training, company profitability, and management and operating practices. One can easily see that railroad safety improvements provide a mirror for technologies used today. In addition to being a terrific read, Death Rode the Rails shows that many of the current lessons in system safety are often the same lessons learned over 100 years ago."},{"Title":"Death Rode the Rails: American Railroad Accidents and Safety, 1828-1965","review":"A wonderful review of how American railroads became safe from dangerous beginnings.

Has there ever been a novel more pointless, more vague, with less interesting characters and with less redeeming value? I don't think so. Oh, I guess I'm supposed to applaud Pynchon for being so inventive and different from everybody else. Yeah, well that's all well and good, but not enough in itself to make a good novel. Maybe it's because I was born in the late 70's and I'm not a hippie that I don't understand the cosmic significance of the Tristero whatever that is. San Narcisco? That is supposed to be brilliant? It's just a clever little wordplay that any High School student could write in one of their papers. And the writing of the title as the last words of the novel? Please. Why is that such a literary feat?I guess the point of the novel was not to have a point. I'm sorry, but that is just taking the easy way out. At least put some effort into making me feel something and ask questions about myself. Oh, the book was trying to do that? It's making me wonder what it all means and what is the meaning of life? Hello! Who needs to read this book to ask those questions? Everyone asks themselves those questions naturally. There's nothing particularly briliant in that concept.

The plot is convoluted asthere is a much of nonsense thrown around without justificationor regard for its relevance within the story line.Among other things we learn that:1.

My knowledge of \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is infinite and all encompassing. Although Pynchon dismisses this book in his introduction to \\"Slow Learner\\" and critics have said that this book does not compare to either \\"V\\" or \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", it is still a definitive postmodern text and far easier to read than a text like \\"Rainbow\\". Thanks to the short length and linear plot, readers should not have the same problems with \\"Lot 49\\" they may have had with \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\". The apparent readability of this text belies its complex nature, however. Through his use of dense language, intricate symbiotics, and an ambiguity on the plot level, Pynchon articulates a multiplicity of meaning that allows an incredibly diverse array of textual interpretations. When the main character, Oedipa Maas, wonders, \\"Shall I project a world?\\" she speaks for anyone who has attempted to sort through this novel. For any reader looking for a challenging and thought-provoking book who does not want to sort through 760 pages of \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This book, I'm sorry to say, was a waste of time. that's all I have to say"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Horrifically perverse and nihilistic.

If you want to get into Pynchon, this is definitely the place to start. This book has all of the wacky conspiracy theory that you'll get in V and Gravity's Rainbow, but it doesn't require all of the background knowledge that you really need to get anything out of it. Pynchon tends to show off how much research he has done by throwing all sorts of obscure facts and references at you, but he keeps that to a minimum here. In addition, it isn't anywhere near as long as some of this other works, so you can get a good feel for the author without having to commit several months of reading.If you are a fan of conspiracies in general, or you are looking for a great weird book that will challenge your perception of reality without causing you to bang you head against the wall in frustration, you can't beat this book."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"The novel's protagonist, Oedipa Mass, starts out as a housewife in a \\"ticky-tacky\\" little suburb and gradually and seemingly randomly starts noticing things in her daily life that seem to be evidence of a secret society. Its purpose is to conduct a secret alternative mail system. She starts investigating this secret society and becomes engrossed in the belief that it actually exists, though in the end she's not sure whether it's for real or, as a few people she meets claim, an elaborate hoax.As far as I can tell, The Crying of Lot 49 is basically an allegory about the nascent stages in the growth of various subcultures (the New Left, Reaganism, etc.) in Southern California during the early sixties (represented by the secret mail society) and mainstream America's slow realization of their existence and its subsequent fascination with them (represented by Oedipa).Interestingly, this secret society seems to have adherents from both the cold warriors of the libertarian right and The New Left (or rather allegorical equivalents of these movements), suggesting some deeper similarity between these opposites - namely, their dissatisfaction with various (though mostly different) aspects of the anti-individualistic rigidity and staidness of middle-class post-war America.Characters who submit to the shallow satisfactions of conventional society - such as Oedipa's husband, who becomes a sort of middle-aged teeny-bopper - come to look like freakish zombies. Yet the alternative doesn't look so nice either. Feeling pressed upon on all sides, the characters who don't submit want to escape into some sort of freedom but have little idea of what sort of freedom they want or what to do with it.The only thing that unites all the people in this secret society is their unwillingness to participate in a generally accepted institution, the US mail system. Yet they don't have much of a good reason for not participating considering that it's not as if the US mail system was corrupt or broken at the time. In practice, this secret mail system is useless and absurd, so it's almost like they're not participating merely for the sake of not participating, as if they didn't know what to do with their willingness to drop out of conventional society.What's interesting about Pynchon's book is that while we generally remember the more purposeful, driven radical elements of sixties culture (everything from the yippies to Goldwater), Pynchon reminds us how much of that dissatisfaction with Post-War America was just a vague, general ennui or anomie. Of course, the book leaves open the possibility that the secret society doesn't exist at all, in which case it's all an illusion projected out of Oedipa's head, a fantasy generated by Oedipa's own wish for escape.Considering how shallow and conformist America still is, it's easy to see the continuing relevance of this book even though so many things treated in the book have changed since then, such as the ascendancy of the radical right into the mainstream and the utter disappearance of the New Left.Yet I have to admit that the book's critique of bureaucracy rings a little hollow these days, considering how many Americans there are now who wouldn't mind the staid yet secure postwar world so hated by these characters and probably Pynchon too. As a temp worker who can't afford anything better than catastrophic health insurance, I know I wouldn't mind a bit more security, even at the cost of having to be a \\"company man\\" in a gray suit.Regarding the notorious pranksterism of the plotting, the cartoonishness of the characterization, and the manic, elaborate parodies of all sorts of contemporary modes of rhetoric, I do have to admit that Pynchon overdoes it sometimes. There are moments of hard-earned pathos if not sincerity, but as in the films of Godard, it's hard not to wish that they came little more often and with a few less caveats. Still, fans of Nathanial West and Flannery O'Conner (or for that matter, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Harvey Birdman, and Radiohead) should feel right at home here in this cynical, scathing, absurdist brew."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I was told that this book was a very good intellectual read.

People who can spell and read might like the novel, however."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"So much of the \\"Pynchon phenomenon\\" centers around his reclusiveness and his epic novels like Gravy's Rainbow and V, so it seems unfair that shorter, more accessible works like The Crying Of Lot 49 sometimes get overlooked. Pynchon's genius is almost immediately apparent in this seamless blend of the comic and the poignant, the scientific and the human, the universal and the intimate.There's very little I can say here that hasn't already been said by the literary intelligentsia. The critics seem to agree on a few general points: that the novel presents a compelling exploration of the equivocality of human perception, that the Trystero embodies the often-underestimated power of the word, the sign, and codes, and that Pynchon's discussion of entropy runs parallel to the disorder of information overload-a predecessor to the chaotic overabundance of input and information found in DeLillo'sWhite Noise.First, a note on the book's plot, or lack thereof: Pynchon leaves every option open, every thread untied. He leaves every possibility open in order to sustain the agonizing rigidity of an either/or dilemma. Writing in 1964, he is well ahead of his time as he describes the baffling possibilities of a digital world, and its binary all-or-nothing schema. Oedipa is left wandering under a sky blanketed by zeroes and ones, faced with a multitude of decisions, the results of which are irrevocable: She must decide blindly, not knowing whether she has made the &quot;right&quot; choice until after it has been made, and cannot be reversed. Pynchon wants his work to acknowledge this open-ended and infinite series of binaries which confound ordered plots and resolutions. Neither Pynchon nor Oedipa are content to relax and settle for easy answers, surrounded as they are by people who will.Besides Pynchon's enthusiasm for science and Crying's discussion of entropy, the one most recurring theme in the book is that of fantasy versus reality. This is hardly a new theme for a contemporary writer to tackle, but Pynchon seems to put a twist on it, like he does with everything else: he proposes that there really isn't a boundary between the two, and that we shouldn't really care about finding one. Throughout the novel, Oedipa questions whether her experiences-the eerie recurrence of the post horn icon, the chance meetings with acquaintances, operatives, and intellectuals-are innately charged with predestined, synchronous coincidence, or if she is just being too fatalistic, and attaching more significance to these events than necessary. She never really seems to make up her mind on this point, and at the book's closing anti-resolution, we still haven't determined whether all these events have been orchestrated by fate, or simply coincidence; we haven't learned whether this really was a centuries-old underground conspiracy or just an elaborate practical joke Pierce wrote into his will. The reader gets the feeling, as Oedipa's quest continues, that maybe she is only seeing the post horn because she wants to see it; she sees it where it isn't there, so it can affirm the significance and urgency of her mission. We've all been in this position: we will shape events and signals in our environment to fit our agenda, attach meaning and consequence to random elements so we can feel like a part of something important.The promise of hierophany is what drives Oedipa, and nearly any other human being, to attach spiritual, cosmic significance to secular events. By sublimating our secular world in this way, we attempt to order it and block out the horrific chaos threatening to impede on our paradigm. An atheist would say this is precisely what religion does: much as Oedipa strives to shape her experiences so they conform to her expectations, so do most major religions create world orders and belief systems in order to make sense of their experience, often in direct contradiction to non-believers' notions of validity and common sense. The Christian hallucinates the face of the Virgin Mary in everyday objects much as Oedipa probably hallucinates the post horn symbol throughout San Francisco.The Crying of Lot 49 straddles the fine line between the sacred and profane, between the spiritual and the secular. In much the same way, it also conflates the &quot;hard&quot; science of thermodynamics with the personal and the emotional plight of a fictional protagonist. Few authors are smart or brave enough to do this; it probably doesn't even occur to most, and incorporating scientific minutiae into prose fiction is rarely valued as anything more than a means of showing off. But Pynchon manages to put a theoretical phenomenon like Maxwell's demon into pedestrian terms, and a scientifically impaired reader like me doesn't mind that he ends up hitting us over the head with the analogous relationship between Oedipa and the Demon."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I hated this book at the halfway point. Really. Wanted to launch it across the room. But a bit later things get oddly and uniquely interesting, and I got caught up. There are a few points (in particular Oedipa's journey thru san francisco) where it really is as if you are reading a different book from the one you started. This isn't necessarily a good thing, but here is it somehow works (mostly).The book is in some ways an unwieldy mess, and I think you have to not get too hung up on every detail, allusion, pun and riddle. Does help to keep a dictionary and search engine handy, though. It's a novel that sort of teaches you along the way how to read it and what to pay attention to. This means you are likely to be confused for a while, possibly annoyed, but almost certainly surprised and possibly enlightened by the end."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"\\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is a short post-modern novel set in 1960s California. It traces the attempts of its main character, Oedipa Maas, to discern whether a secretive mail distribution company named Trystero actually exists. Aside from this general plot thrust, it is hard to discern what this novel is about, much in the vein of most post-modern fiction. The story takes many twists and turns, contains several story-within-story narrative developments, and is replete with cultural and social references which range from the extremely obscure to the downright in-your-face ones. Among the latter are the names of several characters - Oedipa Maas, \\"Mucho\\" Maas, Genghis Cohen, Dr. Hilarius, Mike Fallopian, etc. This over the top \\"punning\\" in my humble opinion cheapens the novel, and rather than making it profound makes it look puerile. It is hard to take seriously characters with such outrageous names, and almost no attempt has been made to make any of them feel human - the characters are just symbols that engage in dialogue with each other. The same holds for the names of cities and towns, many of which are fictional. The book feels very self-indulgent and pretentious, hard to read and not very literary. It is probably one of the most overrated books that I had ever read."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"\`The Crying of Lot 49' takes us on a winding, convoluted, terrifying roller coaster through a world that seems to be a few steps closer to that of Lewis Carroll's \`Alice in Wonderland' than our own. The work itself refuses to be read at a pace any less than how it intends, and that often crazed pace creates a response within the reader of confusion, urgency, and uncertainty, all driven by a maddening obsession that ultimately leads the reader on a journey to search for the truth.This piece has a tendency to observe the reader, as if it were self-aware. It sits, patiently knowing it will soon be picked up; it waits to be read through from start to finish in a few short days (or sittings); it waits for the reader to set down the recently pristine paperback. Now riddled with creases and slick with the grime of sweaty palms, it begins to grin as the telltale look of consternation and disbelief cross the reader's face, and, with maniacal glee, for their lips to part and the words to escape, giving voice to all the thoughts you will surely be left with after this book is done.'Lot 49' singlehandedly explained a semesters Literary Theory course to me. While I had a lot of trouble specifically defining the purpose of literary criticism most of the course, the amazingly poignant truths that shine through the maddening uncertainty made a very lasting impact on me, and I think they will do so for many people to come."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Because it's so short, *The Crying of Lot 49* is likely the book those coming to Pynchon for the first time are most inclined to sample. It's not, however, anything but a shadow--in this case, a foreshadow--of his really great work. So one shouldn't form a definitive judgment on Pynchon based on what one finds here. Still, it's not a bad intro given the length and complexity of Pynchon's better-known signature novels.The story, stripped to its barest essentials, goes something like this: Oedipa Maas is informed that she's been named co-executor of the will of a former lover--a SoCal real-estate developer, Pierce Inveriarity. A rapid sequence of connected coincidences soon puts her on the trail of a secret postal service with a history stretching back to 15th century Europe.A semi-pornographic Renaissance play, a machine for measuring psychic ability, and a 12-step program to help kick the habit of falling in love--all these disparate elements and others even more disparate have their place in a mystery of an ancient underground organization whose age-old symbol of the muted post horn is turning up all over modern-day California. For it seems that the monopoly that the government has sought over communication is still being challenged in a shadow war for the rights to the free enterprise of privacy and information.Or not.The whole thing may just be a paranoid delusion Oedipa is suffering--or an elaborate practical joke someone is playing on her.If this sort of thing seems a little familiar, it's because it is--and Pynchon, one of the great originators and masters of conspiracy literature, has helped to make it so. I'm not certain I'd go on to read the rest had this been the first Pynchon novel I'd ever read, but I'd encourage the reader to do so if anything at all about *Lot 49* appeals to them. It feels a little dated and a little creaky, but *The Crying of Lot 49* is still a tight, dense, and--at less than 200 pages--occasionally surprising enough book to make it well worth reading."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"...although that's still not very accessible. But this book is worth the trouble of grappling with the author's obscure allusions, open-ended questions, and maddening mixture of the deadly serious and the utterly nonsensical. Still, compared to his massive tomes GRAVITY'S RAINBOW and V., for instance, the general outline of CRYING OF LOT 49 is relatively comprehensible. Oedipa Maas, a confused child of the sixties, stumbles upon what may or may not be a centuries-old conpiracy as a result of being named &quot;executrix&quot; of her wealthy, eccentric former lover's estate. The sinister, fascinating glimpses of the &quot;tristero&quot; that increasingly obsess her may be genuine insights into a real but previously hidden reality, an indication of her descent into paranioa and madness, or a colossal practical joke. She has no way of determining which, and neither do we. On some levels this is frustrating, but Pynchon's hilarious, eccentric, beautiful prose and the original, fascinating plotline keep your interest, and certainly satisfied me, at least. His irreverant takes on the superficiality of both the counterculture and suburban America, the banality of bad Jacobean revenge melodramas, and the illogic of scientists, historians, and almost everyone else continue to delight me on rereadings. It may not be as great an achievement as his longer masterworks, but I would rather read this more enjoyable and accessible (although still profound and troubling) little book anyday."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I haven't felt like this after reading a book in a long time. This is not to say that I dislike difficult books. I typically enjoy a challenging read. It was suggested that I would like this book because I have given books by DeLillo, Ellis, and Danielewski high ratings.What makes this different? Most importantly, I think, is that I felt no great attachment to any of the characters, especially not Oedipa Maas. Therefore, the intrigue is not nearly as compelling as it could be. Who cares about the conspiracy, W.A.S.T.E., Tristero, or Thurn and Taxis? Especially given the final outcome.I do, however, give it three stars because it has some moments of brilliance. The revenge play is fantastic, the word play is often amusing, and it does have a hallucinatory feel.Obviously, some people will like this more than I did. I fully accept that. If you're up for a challenge, enjoy language, and don't put a high premium on characterization or plot, then this is worth the read."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Whether a fact is discovered because it is unsettling, out of place, or merely noticed at random, that fact, when investigated, can sometimes reveal a whole alternative reality. Such was the experience of Oedipa Maas when she found, among obscene bathroom graffiti, a symbol of a muted bugle accompanied with a question, \\"Interested in some sophisticated fun?\\" This begins a bizarre, hallucination-like, Da-Vince-Code-resembling quest to understand this symbol, and the motives of a past lover, whom now she is assigned as co-executor of his will. This quest will reach back through the textual disputes of a Jacobean revenge play, to the renaissance ages in the low lands of Europe, to San Francisco and back again to a mythical suburb of Los Angeles, called San Narciso. Connecting these places and eras is an underground postal service created as an attempt to usurp one of Europe's ancient thrones by controlling its means of communication. Maas herself will ponder this conspiracy, finding it \\"so labyrinthine that it must have meaning beyond just a practical joke\\" Yet she also entertains the possibility that she is \\"fantasying some such plot, in which case [she is] a nut...out of [her] skull.\\" What explains such an outrageous plot?This novel shoots off metaphors in every direction, (or is it all one big metaphor?) and a great deal of the mental energy one spends with it will certainly lay in trying to answer the question \\"So what does it all mean?\\" Surely Pynchon did not sit down merely to write a nice story about an ancient underground postal service that now caters to San Francisco's social misfits and outcasts. So what DOES it all mean? Paradoxically, the themes of disconnectedness and entrapment play heavily. In the first chapter, Oedipa reflects:\\"What did she so desire escape from? Such a captive maiden, having plenty of time to think, soon realizes that her tower, its height and architecture, are like her ego only incidental: that what really keeps her where she is is magic, anonymous and malignant, visited on her from outside and for no reason at all..... If the tower is everywhere and the knight of deliverance no proof against its magic, what else?\\"Pynchon suggests that this tower is particularly modern, and he even hints that it is particularly American. By the end of the novel, she has an idea of the tower, it is \\"a great digital computer, the zeros and ones twinned above, hanging like balanced mobiles right and left, ahead, thick, maybe endless.\\" Her anxiety is an experience of vertigo before the virtual noise and bottomless web of modernity. It is that noise that cuts her off from her husband, and from meaning in general. What should be one line of communication, one postal service, has split into two: an official, government sponsored (and imposed) line and an underground line. We can certainly sense political dimension to Oedipda's predicament, but it is not only political. It reaches through all of experience, it is the foundation of San Narciso and is her tower. She despairs that a nation could \\"allow\\" such a town as San Narsico. Pierce Inverarity, Oedipda's former love, owned San Narciso, and the legacy that he passes to Oedipa, \\"was America.\\"With some thought, some piecing together of his clues, we can come closer to an understanding of this novel, but we can never be quite sure. There are layers of parallel stories (Oedipa, the Couriers tragedy, the Gallipoli film), where people are on a hunt to piece together a cohesive narrative, that may or may not exist. Even as the novel conludes, the extent and nature of this postal service, the Truth, is not revealed. Who is the secret man who bids on Lot 49? Is our pursuit just another layer to the novel's game? Have we involved ourselves in yet another indecipherable web, that web that is called \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\"? Is it a metaphor for modernity or a layer of modernity?Yet, all of this remains a purely intellectual enterprise. Shouldn't the novel (or, The Novel) involve joy as well at the mind? Unless one takes pleasure in a literary rubix cube, I would not call this a satisfying book. Once you delve into the puzzle of this novel, one is rewarded with the stock themes of post-modernism: disconnectedness, entrapment, endless webs of white noise, meaninglessness, anxiety, reflections on The Word, the metaphor, and their respective levels of inadequacy. At some point it has to be interesting for its own sake. If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the proof of a novel in in the reading. Call me sentimental, call me a philistine, but pass me the Dickens!"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"If you've always heard the term postmodern and wondered what it meant this book is for you. But, this book is definately not for everyone, the plot is unique to say the least, and the characters are not what you will find in most novels, but then again, neither is the intellectual stimulation. In only a little over 100 pages, Thomas Pynchon has written an accessibly managable intro. to postmodern literature. Although this book is rather dense, and is filled with obscure facts and information from seemingly every conceivable specialty of knowledge, it is a great introduction to one of the most misunderstood genres of modern literature. Just be sure to keep a dictionary and encyclopedia handy. The plot revolves around the exciting and often bizarre experiences and travels of Oedipa Maas, after she is named executor of an ex-lovers will. In her adventures she uncovers a surrealistic world where everything that she has ever learned seems to fall into question. It is a world where nazi doctors, secret societies, papal misdeeds, anarchist dreams, and deranged outcasts all come out of the shadows to invade the &quot;typical&quot; suburban landscape of an average American housewife. This book is about uncovering the realities, or lack thereof, that most people would want to stay hidden, or at the least forgotton. It is about questioning the assumptions that we all hold dear, even if it means coming to terms with a world that is without meaning, without order, and most of all without a coherent design. This is a book with many questions to be answered, so if you would like an envigorating intellectual challenge this book will not dissappoint."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"After several readings, I can say without hesitation that Lot 49 is my favorite book. Like most, I had a very difficult time with it at first, but I assure anyone that it IS a worthwhile read. Maybe even the most important American book of the late 20th century. We should all be aware of the kinds of plots &quot;they&quot; are hatching against &quot;us&quot; as we enter a new age, and Lot 49 is nothing if not an excellent spur to reflection on the topic.Which is not to say that that's all it is. Pynchon's shortest, most straightforward novel is also a brilliant and devestating critique of the contemporary intellectual landscape (or lack thereof). It has seemingly infinite layers of meaning, and one can find a commentary on or critique of just about any aspect of this modern life in its pages. No offense to anyone, but if all you see in Lot 49 is a conspiracy story or a pretentious literary jumble, you should look again harder.On a purely technical level, Pynchon's writing is intricate and beautiful, and he has a brilliant eye for those things that we tend to pass over blindly in our hurried lives.To those who hated Lot 49, that's perfectly alright, but please make sure your disdain isn't merely due to a want of close reading. I think a complete understanding of the novel is probably impossible, but it CAN be understood. You'll be a richer person for trying, I promise.J. Kerry Grant's companion is an excellent distillation of the enormous body of critical interpretation surrounding Lot 49, and it can offer a perfect handle on the book. It helped me enormously. If you're afraid it'll give away all the &quot;amswers&quot; and obliterate your own reading of the novel, don't be. If there's a lesson to be learned from Lot 49 (and there are many) it's that there are no right answers anyway. You have nothing to lose by reading either the novel or the companion. I couldn't recommend either highly enough.Please, feel free to email me, whether or not you agree. I'd love to hear from anyone with an opinion."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Pynchon is a word painter, that's the only way to describe him. He gives us these wonderful scenes described so well and cinematically, splashes in some bright colorful characters, and then gives us this dark undershading of paranoia; creating in the process great works of art. This book is perhaps one of his easier reads on the reader, not as demanding as Gravity's Rainbow, or as long as Mason &amp; Dixon, but still filled with deep meaning and jaw dropping prose. Oedipa is a great straight character surrounded by the many surreal people she encounters in her journey to find W.A.S.T.E. and the mystery of the muted trumpet. Some of the best scenes come when she has to interact with some of them, like The Paranoias (I swear I laughed out-loud in some of those scenes). The book is quick, but dark; funny, but thought provoking; short, but much more fulfilling than any long popular novel. Pynchon may be the greatest living writer, his words are filled with vivid electricy, don't let this, one of his best, pass you by. I promise, the quality of the prose alone will be enough to make your head spin, the panoramic images will make it explode."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is the best of the best when it comes to the modern detective novel by Thomas Pynchon. I am a long time fan and can say that Pynchon's detective sleuth is coming into high fashion at last. I read Pynchon along with David Lehman's reissue of &quot;The Perfect Murder: A Study in Detection&quot; and found the two books perfect companions for anyone who loves the classic WHODUNIT in a brave new view."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I'd heard that The Crying of Lot 49 was a short and (comparatively) easy introduction to Thomas Pynchon. It certainly is short, but I would still say Pynchon beats most writers at their worst for writing a dense, challenging novel. I'm not going to expound on what the deep significance of this novel is, but rest assured that it'll take all your attention and talent to \\"get it\\" the first time through.However, that is not to say it is a bad novel. The story surrounds Oedipa Maas and the adventure she begins when she is called upon as executrix of the estate of her deceased ex-lover Pierce Invererity. Her quest forces her to confront her beliefs about the workings of society, her own lack of perception in the world around her and ultimately her own sanity. Pynchon writes in a dense, overflowing style where one often has to slow down or reread in order to fully absorb the utter volume of information that is either explicitly or implicitly stated in Pynchon's furious and emotional prose. Character depth is notexistant, but that is evidently Pynchon's plan as they are merely his tools to explore the various issues he raises and are not as vital to the work as his often philosophical pseudo-interpretation of events.If you are into dense, high-intensity literature of the postmodern persuasion, then The Crying of Lot 49 is highly recommended. However, if you are looking to be entertained and don't want to sit around for hours afterward trying to puzzle out the implications of what you have read, Don DeLillo or Jack Kerouac are easier introductions to similar themes."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"The Crying of Lot 49 was Pynchon's response to people who considered his first novel, V, to be too difficult, too complex and just plain old too weird to stomach. It is considerably shorter, clocking it at only 152 pages, but each one is jam packed full of patented Pynchon weirdness, with zany characters, ridiculously implausible scenarios and plots within plots within plots.Speaking of plot, there are two ways to describe it. One is to say that it is about Oedipa Maas wandering California trying to figure out a conspiracy that seems to involve everyone she knows. The other is to read the book. There really isn't any middle ground. The problem with that is that the former doesn't mention Vatican cover-ups, child movie stars, highly lethal cans of hair spray, horn symbols, a band by the name of the Paranoids who aren't, LSD-addicted radio announcers or archaic postal systems trying to destroy American society, while the latter would take up just over 150 pages, far beyond the scope of this review.The writing is typical Pynchon. Some sections meander into ruminations on a character's psyche, or page-long sojourns into plays, conspiracies, wanderings, etc. Other paragraphs are so fast paced that if your mind wanders for a second, you'll miss something important and have no idea what is going on. Often these crucial sentences are buried within a morass of extraneous information, so readers should pay attention at all times.The names are fun and ridiculous. Mike Fallopian, the duchy of Squamuglia, Yoyodyne, Wharfinger, Chiclitz, Dr Hilarious, the list goes on. Settings are predictable only in the way that they will be completely unpredictable, in essence, you never know when or where the story is going to take you next.Does it end satisfactorily? Can Pynchon recover all the myriad threads into a cohesive whole? No. But then, if he did, the story wouldn't make sense. By being about paranoia and conspiracy, an actual concrete resolution would hurt the book more than it would help. The closing sentence is a perfect example of this, and will probably seem frustrating to a casual reader, but if you sit back and think about it, no other ending would suffice. A masterful work, one that is extremely accessible for those people who are (rightly) intimidated by the monster that is Gravity's Rainbow."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"One problem with social satire, even at its most perceptive and subversive, is that it becomes dated almost immediately if the author focuses on current trends and cultural references. This novel by the otherwise masterful Pynchon might still be useful for fans of his experiments with language and his unconventional plot constructions. But for the rest of us, this book's badly outdated references, overwrought prose, incongruous conspiracies, and sheer mid-60s detached irony are tiresome and increasingly pointless. It was surely the fashion of the time, in satirical writing, to construct a shell of a plotline that is then used to explore eccentric characters and their shallow connections to the impersonal anomie of modern life. Fair enough, but the hipsters and literati of 1966 were probably the only parties likely to be wowed by this book's self-obsessed puns and inside-joke allegories. But even if you can stomach the dated references, this novel's laborious dialogue and shallow character interactions all swamp a thin plotline that goes nowhere except for the unenlightening self-knowledge gained by the already very thinly-constructed lead character. This novel is probably still a worthy masterpiece for those readers who find it rewarding to conquer a novel that makes reading a work of labor. But for those looking for enlightenment, or even just a rewarding or fun challenge, you'd surely prefer something more timeless and less self-obsessed.

What kills me about that sentence, apart from its obvious cumulative power, is the way the punctuation holds it all together so effortlessly. Not just regular punctuation either, this is the stuff normally held in reserve or passed over completely--the colon, the dash, parentheses. The entire parade seems to glide right along under the unobtrusive direction of these spare and stately ushers--it's a marvel of elegant stitching is what it is. And another thing, when Oedipa tells Doctor Hilarius she's having a hallucination and the wacky shrink barks at her not to describe it, I spy a nod to Beckett there--Didi barks more or less the same thing at Gogo when Gogo tries to describe a dream he's just had. You see, this is what I love about Mister Pynchon, he's double-rectified moonshine over the whole nine yards."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I suppose this is another book that makes me feel stupid. I simply did not get it as a whole. I recognized the satire of contemporary Amercian culture, and saw Oedipa as an example of an American Every(wo)man caught up in the blaring, glaring expansion of America as a function of industrialism and capitalism. Oedipa did not seem a full on individual to me, and I think it was on purpose. She finds herself ghosting her way through the landscape of California in a manner only slightly more surreal than the way she ghosted her way to the moment in her life when she came home from the Tupperware Party to find out she was the will's executor. That being said, her involvement in the Trystero mystery that may or may not be a worldwide conspiracy rings almost like a post-modern trip into a psychotic break. You would think, all these things considered, the book would be far more compelling than it is.And, for me, it was not compelling at all, except for two passages that never get revisited. When Oedipa reflects on Mucho's horror at working at the car lot and when she wanders the streets finding the lost people of the town, finding the muted horn symbol everywhere she goes. Both scenes are powerful in language, imagery and are ripe with meaning, but they are quickly over and never revisited. Say what you will about a writer using an economy of words to get his point across, but while Pynchon does this in these two passages well, he seems to go on an on about things that are less compelling and, seemingly, less important. As an example, I know there had to be a reason for the whole mess on the island, but for the life of me I just never cared.I am left wondering if the book is a statement about our need to communicate and our need for privacy and freedom being at odds or if I am off the mark. Then there is an existential aspect as Oedipa is left, one by one, by all the men she meets in her life. She is, in the end, left entirely alone to figure it all out for herself. That's really all I took from the book, that an awesome title that is not explained until the end and wonderfully so. I did love the way the book ended, leaving it up to the reader to decide what he or she makes of the whole thing.For such a short book, it took a long time to read. Mainly because I found myself not wanting to read anymore. A few wonderful passages wedged in between a lot of boring weirdness that failed to capture my imagination at all. All that being said, this is simply one uneducated reader's opinion. I am all for literary fiction that gets you thinking, even if you need a companion book to get all the references (oi!)but where TCoL49 failed to me is in the simplest aspect of story telling. The Read. For me, Lot 49 was just not a very good read."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"OK, this is a satire, but I'm not sure of what. Is it America's obsession with Communists under every bed ? Is it of the Sixties---the age itself ? (but it was written in 1965). Could it be a parody of Umberto Eco ? (but he wrote in the \`80s). Or of an obscure episode in a great issue of ZAP Komix ? Hey, whatever's right, man. Some say Pynchon is one of America's greatest writers, but on the basis of this book, I don't. I'd say it's more like a case of the emperor has no clothes. Admittedly, the writing is lush, even lyrical; the humor, especially the choice of names, made me laugh out loud repeatedly, but I like a novel with an understandable plot, some characters who are more than cartoons, and if a satire, then at least a remote sense that (unlike Kafka's intimate circle of friends) I didn't have to know Pynchon personally to understand the \\"real meaning\\".Oedipa Maas' ex-lover dies, leaving her the job of being executor of his will, but as she tries to do her duty, more and more oddities appear. I can't give a straight account, because such a thing is impossible. It's all a vague mass of plots, murders or possible murders, suicides, Nazis, postage stamps, mysterious symbols that turn out to be ubiquitous, 17th century plays, bars, secret organizations with their own postal service, and weird corporations. Pynchon fans are going to hand me a heap of negative votes here. But, read some of the other reviews. If they intrigue you, give it a whirl.

Oedipa Maas, wife of Mucho, sleuths her way to uncertainty. She's cold on the trail of a shadowy organization called the Tristero that competes for the postal trade and uses a muted trumpet as its symbol. Who knew that Miles Davis was part of a worldwide mail delivery feud? A cat with no shortage of curiosity, Oedipa fumbles into some memorable, slightly perverse encounters. She flees the clutches of a randy esoteric, witnesses the breakdown of her psychiatrist, and meets The Paranoids, faux mop tops who write songs about frugging. The more Oedipa learns about the Tristero the less she knows; further, she cannot dismiss the possibility that she's the victim of an elaborate practical joke.In one overly long stretch of this short post-modernist novel Pynchon indulges in some sanguinary Jacobean drama. More satisfying is his description of southern California: several decades before Orange County morphs into a diorama of the body snatched, Pynchon anticipates the dislocating effect of exit ramps, strip malls, and those fathomless planned communities that are everywhere and nowhere. The search for order and meaning, the novel implies, ultimately leads to frustration, to some realization that the universe is chaotic, even random. Pynchon is all head, no heart. His other novels are maddeningly inaccessible, which of course makes them a kind of template for the current crop of young wise-acre American writers who favor clever gimmicks and shun human feeling."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"You know those really-need-to-give-medication-a-try types who constantly scribble in notebooks using tiny, densely packed letters and nodding knowingly at things that barely penetrate your attention?

It follows the odd quest of Oedipa Maas, the wife of a California disc jockey. As the story begins, she is made executor of the will of Pierce Inverarity. This responsibility leads her to seek the truth behind a centuries' old international conspiracy. Along the way, she encounters a number of weird characters and bizarre historical revelations.Part of the fun of \\"Lot\\" is the wild jumble of cultural references that Pynchon throws into the mix: a Tupperware party, Cornell University, Muzak, Fu-Manchu, Perry Mason, LSD -- and those are all from the first chapter! He tosses about such names as Warpe, Wistfull, Kubitschek and McMingus (that's a law firm). His whimsical characters include a former child star-turned-lawyer, a specialist on Jacobean revenge tragedies, and a proselytizer for the Peter Pinguid Society.\\"Lot\\" reflects on such topics as U.S. history, pop culture, religion, politics, and mail delivery. It's strange, inventive, brainy, and fun.

I felt in reading this book that one had to be &quot;hip&quot; to Pynchon's &quot;jive&quot; to have a prayer of enjoying it. He presents us with a labyrinthine plotline filled with hipsters, weirdos and satire descended from the beatniks, all of which, ultimately, does not deliver anything close to a profound conclusion. It's as if Pynchon sets the reader up for a revelation and then, poof, there is no revelation, the revelation is made of feathers and dandelion puffs. Which left me feeling as though Pynchon is simply having fun at the reader's expense, weaving elaborate, dense, and bizarre language with very little substance. And the hijinx, while sometimes funny, aren't entertaining enough to sustain the weight of it all. This book is ultimately Dada-ist, which in my opinion is bad enough, but worse, it doesn't mean to be. It means to be profound and witty and elegantly irreverent. Please. Spare me the self-important novelist's language games. To be fair, I would try reading V or Gravity's Rainbow to see how it compared with this novel, since his use of language and insight are quite brilliant at times. But as for this book, whew. What a let-down."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is my first try at Thomas Pynchon. He did not disappoint. Using a dictionary paid off handsomely. Pay attention to the names of the characters. In a word: LOADED ! Excellent literature. Pynchon is right up there with another favorite of mine: Richard Yates. Sweeping depth and alacrity."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"TCOL49 really fooled me the first time. The story line seemed to be simply about the 60s and conspiracies and I thought it was weird. On re-reading the book I really got more of a feeling of Oed in the real present shifting world of sensuality and craziness and random stuff with shit just happening on top of it all. She gets The Call. Her search for the truth leads her to frustration and yer basic angst with a touch of ennui. My feeling is that this book is about whether we can know or distinguish between conspiracies that are forces of history, gradually becoming obscure and being assimilated into the landscape and those of the present that are more personal and acute. Is there a difference or is all history (and every-day life)the result of treachery, deceit and politics? Does it matter? Oh, yeah, I really got into it alot more after I reread it."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I wrote a paper on this book. In his comments, my TA wrote: &quot;sometimes you eat the bear, well, sometimes the bear eats you...&quot; Ha, Ha. It's simply unbelievable how big that bear is. In fact, it reminds me of those fractals in math: infinitely complex -- whenever you think you've &quot;got it,&quot; take one step back, and &quot;it&quot; turns out to be just one almost negligible part of the infinite complexity of this strange tale of conspiracy, religion, history, love, criticism on literary critics, LSD, Nazi doctors, anarchy, American Dream... the list goes on and on. They are all connected, and very powerful. The style and content are fused with such wonder unlike anything I've ever dreamed of. One point may deserve special notice for historic purpose: Pychon is truly a visionary -- he saw The Information Age, with all of its power and frailty, more than 30 years ago, long before cellphone, internet, pc, and all of those modern technological wonders."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Pynchon hits the nail on the head. The subject matter is fantastic, but that isn't the book's strong point. Pynchon weaves an elaborate tale through the eyes of Oedipa, and allows the reader to trace her development through the course of the novel. It's a strange and wonderful journey."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I've just re-read Pynchon's novel and, once again, I'm impressed. Its density is truly amazing. Like Oedipa, the reader gets lost within worlds of words trying to look beyond their meaning.Pynchon's strategy (just like the strategy of ominous Inverarity) seems to be to keep his victim busy and paranoid. Being the paranoid reader I am (I hopelessly suspect meaning behind every awkward phrase), I really enjoyed The Crying.

And while it may be analyzed on many different levels, what strikes me again and again is the comedy of the novel.

I have read it three times, and each time it feels as if my head becomes foggy and cloudy and I cannot think striaght about the world or what I am reading. I still dont know what T.P. is about, or this novel. But the prose is stellar, and the way Mrs. Maas descends into the nether-world of paranoia and despair is pretty cool. Also, it is quite funny at times."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Pynchon is poetic, razor-sharp, and funny.Lot 49 is an odd trip into the world of a woman who is not quite sure who she is or what all the answers mean. Believe me, after reading this book I know how she feels. I gave this book four stars for the sometimes ethereal prose that comes with it. I didn't give it five stars because of its intrinsic difficulty to get through. However, if you are ready for something strangely wonderful and not just the average mindless fluff, give this book a try. It will make you want to read it more than once."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I first heard about this from the S-T (Read the book--you'll know what it means) mailing list, and decided that I ought to read it. While I do not find it particularly humorous (maybe I don't &quot;get&quot; the jokes; the puns seemed flat), I felt that the characters were well-crafted and the plot was very interesting. A lot of the book is quite weird, but it produces a rich and captivating world.

To believe in something, enough for that belief to have any power at all, is to also put yourself at risk of accidentally creating an illusion of power that didn't exist in the first place. A problem indeed. Anything you want, you will get, even if it's not real. For example, I don't even know if that analogy (Tristero/Jesus) was intentional. But if I believe it is, I'll be able to write an essay about it. I'm not being universalist here, just trying to continue where Oedipa left off. I'm an un-universalist, if you need to know.I don't know if I can find a connection between the potsmasters of Tristero and the disciples of Christ, but the beauty of analogy (the fifth possibility) leaks out between the two Books and falls through this review.Personally, I don't think this was that postmodern. It may have that title, but in many ways it can exist purely on a plot-driven level, and most postmodern novels can't. Thomas Pynchon himself is not present, but talks only through the characters and events of the story the way all those normal non-postmodernists do.And, by the way, Thurn and Taxis reminded me of my choice of banking institutions: Wells Fargo, whom I dislike. Those black marauders that charge me outrageous fees and ridiculous charges, who own the night and sabotage my loved ones!"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"In Crying of Lot 49, we join Oedipa Maas on a journey for the Truth about the Tristero. As Justin Carroll correctly points out in his review, Pynchon sets us (and Oedipa) up to expect a major revelation. However, I felt that the journey towards this Truth is the important and interesting part of the book. Through the central metaphors of entropy and layered, constructed, interpreted works of art, Pynchon explores the possibility for Truth, meaning and reality when it becomes impossible to separate oneself from the system being explored. I found Crying of Lot 49 to be an extremely enjoyable read. It is not an easy read, and it demanding my thought and attention. However, Pynchon's mastery of language makes it an engaging and fun read. Also, I found it to be much more accessible than V., Gravity's Rainbow, and Mason&amp;Dixon- I could actually sit down and read Crying of Lot 49 without feeling I needed help. I strongly encourage any fans of Vonnegut or Catch-22 (I haven't read any other Heller) to check out Crying of Lot 49, as well as anyone who is looking to read a first Pynchon book."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I just finished reading this book about 2 weeks ago. I've started reading it again, and it's so much simpler now, I don't even notice any complexity in the text anymore, and it's much more entertaining and much more funnier. After I finish it again, I am planning on buying the companion to this, and try to get underneath all of the underlying themes, all the symbolism and cubism of this artful book. It's a must-have book for any book lover."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"For all of you who believe your inability to comprehend this book is due to the &quot;flawed writing&quot; and not your inability to take an extra second and appreciate the intentional wordplay and thoughtfulness that went into the crafting of this masterpiece, I give you a quick summary of the novel so you can impress your pseudo-intellectual friends with your interpretational prowess: willing self marginalization. I would go on to mention the exquisite beauty and meaningfulness of the tapestry Oedipa viewed in Mexico, but I fear it would be lost on the Neanderthals and unnecessary for the enlightened. All in all, one of the more important works of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Rarely have I been so profoundly affected by an author's words! I read Lot 49 as part of a literature course this past Spring at Rollins College. I ended up writing two papers about it: &quot;Is Oedipa on a quest for God?&quot; and &quot;Is Oedipa on a quest for her own sexual identity?&quot; The first paper led me to the second in a warp-speed realization that the book is actually about everything! It addresses the holistic nature of the universe. Everything is interconnected; nothing in life happens in a vacuum. I ended up writing my application essay for my masters program on the impact this novel had on my life. Without exaggeration, Lot 49 is now my favorite book. I can hardly wait to read more by Pynchon."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Aside from the zippy names and esoteric references, there is very little about this novel that keeps one interested. While Pynchon demonstrates a keen eye for the So. Cal. culture of the 60's, the narrative goes nowhere and takes the reader with it."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Funny, obscene, puzzling. I was unable to stop reading this silly, profound book. Read it read it Read it"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Immediately interesting and continuously funny,The Crying of Lot 49 ascends into that small Pantheon ofmodern American classics. Full of eccentric charactersand set against the backdrop of an expanding suburban west,Pynchon displays a tremendous affinity for showing us America(at its most mediocre) and making us laugh at what we see.As herione Oedipa Maas travels up and down the Californian coast,attempting to uncover a bizarre conspiracy, she unravelsa new reality that challenges us to question ours. With each re-reading, the books yields new meaning, a testament of Pynchon's deep understanding of language. Driven byhumor but full of thought, The Crying of Lot 49 is truly a sparkling and fresh novel."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Though I admire Pynchon as a monumental writer in postmodern American literature, I must say that reading The Crying of Lot 49 was anything but relaxing. I truly admire Pynchon's clever wit and humor, but the symbolism and references hidden behind every other word made me feel absolutely exhausted. I would still recommend this book, but only to someone who is up for a deep, mind-twisting read - not for a soothing novel for the tub."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Aol users reviewing this book expect us to take them seriously? Bah! Unlike the consumerism and sound-byte mentality that pervades contemporary America and (now the 'Net), Pynchon's novella shows us (and tells us but not as directly as some readers might prefer) the entropic drift of both our world and our languages. The Emperor has no clothes? Bah! If you're looking for the clothes with Pynchon, you are forgetting that there HAS TO BE a wearer of the clothes first. Forget the surfaces! Pynchon goes well beyond them to explore such things as the nature of the use of information, the decline of society and language, and the effects of history and technology. If you're looking for simple, direct &quot;messages&quot; or &quot;enlightenment&quot; from your fiction, stay away from Pynchon. His novels &quot;explore&quot; these ideas rather than preach them, and with that in mind, he demands reader involvement and attention to complete the circuit (once an engineer always an engineer?). Read carefully, open the mind and let the words flow. Lot 49, while being relatively short, is complex and nearly impossible to summarize in a single, cogent sentence. If post-modern complexity, ambiguity, and symbolism scare or confuse you, go back to Grisham and live happily ever after. We'll go forward with creative virtusos like Pynchon who know how to make words and ideas dance in a symphony that points away from simple black/white, yes/no understanding to see the complexity of life and the forces within it."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Subversive? Stupid? Both? The Crying of Lot 49 is a satire of something, perhaps itself. Characters and places have silly names, witty parodies engage in absurdist hijinks, and deep down there might be some sort of meaning about the failure of language. Of course, you're not supposed to care about the meaning if you want to enjoy this book. It's a long and clever joke whose only true target is itself. While the creative or inventive potential of this is high, the result just falls apart as it goes on. (But then again, this is supposed to represent entropy probably. It's clever, see, but not very enjoyable for being so)All this said, the one thing this book left me wanting to do most was read another Thomas Pynchon book. His writing (except for in the beginning few chapters) was solid, and the ideas he does communicate are interesting. He's quoted as saying that The Crying of Lot 49 was a mistake of a book, and agreeing with that and wanting to get an actually representative representation of his work, I move on to Gravity's Rainbow. But later. I'm tired enough of The Crying of Lot 49."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"First, the positives: this book is very short and recognizably Pynchonian. This combination has led it to be assigned in many literature and writing classes.Unfortunately, it shows Pynchon in lazy and aimless mode. None of the stroboscopic brilliance of Gravity's Rainbow or the human mystery of V is available here. If you don't have time to read one of those books, read some fragment of them, and you will still experience more than by reading this ephemera, and enjoy it more as well."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I finally read this because I've never yet managed to complete a Thomas Pynchon story. I managed to finish this novel only because it's short. I'm left confused about many things, but not about this: I enjoy interesting and different books, but books loaded with pretentious intellectualism bore me to death.There's story-telling (which entertains and moves its readers) and there's word play. \`The Crying of Lot 49' clearly falls in the last category and, while it might provide many readers with a satisfying read, I find the weirdness too weird, the \\"cleverness\\" too clever for its own good and the deliberate manipulation of names, references and language constructs silly. Is Pynchon actually laughing at us, the readers, who swoon at his \\"brilliance\\"? Either that or, like Sacha Baron Cohen of the dreadful movie \\"Borat\\" fame, Pynchon is a sad man with a rather warped and gloomy view of the world.As a reader, I want more to a novel than pretentious intellectualism posing as literature. I enjoy reading a wide variety of genres and styles, fiction and non-fiction. I don't care what I read - as long as it's good writing and keeps me engaged.Despite the occasional glimpse of what could attract people to this story (for example, Mucho & Oedipa's obsessions apparently suggesting ordinary folks' obsessive need to believe in some kind of reality and order - I say \\"apparently,\\" because I'm not entirely sure I \\"got it\\"), Pynchon's writing required too much effort to make any sort of sense to me.Perhaps that was the point of the difficult, delirious writing style: that, despite modern technology supposedly assisting mankind in communicating, Mucho & Oedipa (representing the average human) were still unable to communicate with each other. This novel, far from solving this dilemma, exacerbated it!It does have its moments of post-modernist epiphany (modern life is uncertain; there is no guarantee of a happy ending), but I'm a reader who prefers a more traditional (and optimistic!) form of story-telling and will leave Pynchon's existential explorations of an entropic society to those readers who prefer \`high literature.'"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I was vaguely aware of the existence of Thomas Pynchon, and after hearing a brief summary of CoL49 I went to the library and grabbed this and 'V'. I got as far as page seventy before I hung it up and decided to take them both back. It's got that weird wacky 'everything ends up being connected' vibe of my favorite Vonnegut books, but without the humor or the sense that I cared about the characters or what happened next. I never really got a sense of character from anybody except Mucho Maas, and people seemed to behave in whatever manner would propel the chaos engine Pynchon was frantically trying to keep spinning with this book. The writing felt awkward and disjointed, sentences sometimes needing two or three readings to decipher. But it did keep making me think \\"I should read Slaughterhouse Five again\\"."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is one of the four books I would have with me when sent off to some Joseph Conrad nightmare.This book is about paranoia and schizophrenia. I have one, and am probably bordering the other. So this is familiar fodder.Oedipus is an everyman-woman thrown into a world of inrigue, paranoid Beatle wannabes, a plot involving a ritzy suburban tract development in San Narcisco-LA and San Diego city--its lake, and a popular brand of cigarettes that may contain human bones. Meanwhile, there's a weird secret organization that has something to do with &quot;potsage&quot;, not postage, potsage. I can't tell you the name of the organization. Forget I mentioned it.Intriguing, yes? Insane? Definitely. Pynchon creates hilarious characters in an insane world colored by a weird translucent squeaky clean commercial California haze. Oedipus is Dorothy in an evil Oz, only she's losing her mind. Who's the wizard. Who knows?One thing's for sure. After reading Crying of Lot 49, you'll never look at a postage stamp the same way again."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"The first chapter is interesting enough to keep you reading, but it gets tiresome quite rapidly. The characters, funny as they may be - initially - are getting mired in a strange theory of conspiracy.Unfortunately, the plot doesn't stick and the reader looses interest in it. After the VERY long description of the \\"Courier's Tragedy\\" play you are left with the feeling that enough is enough...I understand the pivotal, crucial part the play has in the book but still...devoting such a long chapter to it is an overkill.The only motive to keep on reading is that the book is short, Pynchon is a true master of the English language, funny / interesting situations appear from time to time and one expects Pynchon to deliver.This does not happen and the book ends leaving the reader with the feeling that he/she couldn't care more if the conspiracy detailed really had a base in reality or not."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This book was absolutely insufferable. The plot was convoluted, the characters were unlikable, and the prose was simultaneously confusing and boring. I didn't finish it. I suppose if you like post modernist crap?"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"One day Mrs. Oedipa Maas discovers that she has been made executor of her ex-lover's will. As she proceeds she discovers that the legacy with which she has been entrusted draws her ever deeper into a complex web of conspiracies. Yet what she has discovered may be no more than her own paranoia, and the novel ends ambiguously with the final revelation still impending like a judgement day forever suspended.The book walks a careful line between the comic and the tragic. It is a difficult balance and Pynchon maintains it beautifully. Unlike many literary comic novelists Pynchon is genuinely funny. Yet as Oedipa wanders around San Francisco encountering alienation and loss everywhere she turns a genuine pathos creeps into the humor.I'm sure there are many ways to read the Crying of Lot 49. I think we may approach it as both a social satire of consumerism and as a larger statement about the breakdown of communication in all human communities.On the whole I consider this to be one of my favorite novels."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"A more accessible Pynchon, though this novel lacks none of the metaphorical significance of his other novels, I chose to give it four stars instead of five simply because it was so short. It's not that I did not enjoy the novel, it is one of the funniest books I've ever read in fact, it's just that it does not seem as &quot;epic&quot; as his other works. Whereas &quot;V.&quot; was an ordeal, I finished &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; in a manner of days. It is definitely worth the price though, a hilarious satire on American culture, it almost could have been included in &quot;V.&quot; because the basic plot of the two is similar: someone searching for information about someone close to them who died, their search revealing to them perhaps not quite what they were looking for, but revealing to the reader the major metaphorical themes of both books. If anything, &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; is more focused than &quot;V.&quot; but part of what made &quot;V.&quot; so great were all the obscure characters and situations pre-dating the war that were incorporated in the quest, whereas in &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; the whole of the action takes place in Southern California in the 1960's. On the whole a great novel, just not Pynchon's best."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"OHMYGOD!!! This book is hard to read because of the confusion, which I bet Pynchon intended.

Very symbolic of life in america. What a fun web to tangle with!!! Email me about it!!!"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I read this book on a recommendation. It is very dense and I went through it once and feel like I missed a lot of the book. If you are into deep books, you should consider this one."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I feel like I have to read this book at least twice more before I could write the review I'd like to write. Perhaps I'll read it again and find time to alter these notes at a later date. For now, I'll just focus on the concept of the entire narrative as farcical critique of upper class Americana.Pynchon reveals anti-heroine Oedipa Maas as an adulteress on the novel's first pages, executor of the wealthy estate of a recently deceased ex-lover, Pierce Inverarity (How great are these names, by the way? All of Pynchon's choices for character names in this book are hysterically funny). Her journey from there is hilarious, surprising at every turn, chock full of conspiracy theory and peppered with meaningless sex and sexual advances. Oedipa's obsession with the mystery she believes Inverarity left behind for her to solve, that of an underground mail service called the Trystero, speaks to the boredom Pynchon assumes for the American upper class of his day, the longing for a purpose and constant uncertainty as to whether that purpose really means anything at all.Here are three quotes where I feel Pynchon writes very directly with regard to American life:\\"\`I came,' [Oedipa] said, \`hoping you could talk me out of a fantasy.'\`Cherish it!' cried Hilarius, fiercely. \`What else do any of you have? Hold it tightly by its little tentacle, don't let the Freudians coax it away or the pharmacists poison it out of you. Whatever it is, hold it dear, for when you lose it you go over by that much to the others. You begin to cease to be.'\\" (page 113)\\"You're chicken, she told herself, snapping her seat belt. This is America, you live in it, you let it happen.\\" (page 123)\\". . . maybe even [stumbled] onto a real alternative to the exitlessness, to the absence of surprise to life, that harrows the head of everybody American you know, and you too, sweetie.\\" (page 141)The Hilarius (another fantastic name, of course) quote from page 113 says to me that Pynchon feels we Americans need our fantasies, need an element of craziness in our lives because the easy life here isn't necessarily what people expect it to be. It's set up beautifully by Oedipa's desire at that moment to give up her search.The quote from page 123, Oedipa talking to herself about what she should be able to do, how she should be able to affect outcomes and events, delineates an expectation so many Americans have that's, unfortunately, not always met with success.The most powerful quote of the three, in my opinion, is the one from page 141. Whether Oedipa's mission was real or contrived, worthy or a waste of time, here she describes \\"everybody American\\" she knows as living with \\"exitlessness\\" and an \\"absence of surprise to life,\\" and includes herself in that group. Through Oedipa and her adventure and her own conflicting opinions about it, Pynchon conveys a strong desire to break from quotidian life in the leisure class, a yearning for any sort of struggle but an uncertainty about that very yearning.Part of what Pynchon writes in The Crying of Lot 49, in my opinion, presents random sex and infidelity as one answer attempted by people in Oedipa's shoes, the bored housewives and their working husband counterparts, and this purported solution comes up empty time and time again. Oedipa herself seems to realize this as the novel progresses, succumbing to seduction early on but then rejecting it and feeling disgusted by its perpetrators later. Surely a long essay could be written just about Pynchon's treatment of sex in this book, but this review is getting long, so I'll cut it off here.I loved this book for all of its complexity, this review is just a few thoughts on one theme that stuck with me."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Very good, well worth the price and the short time that it takes to read.

My only problem with GR is that there is no real,solid story, something a lot of people use as a point in it's favor, making the case that not having a story is what makes GR so post-modern and cool, but I felt like GR had a lot of style and not a lot of substance. I was expecting The Crying of Lot 49 to be a less experimental, neatly wrapped Pynchon novel with a slick story, and I was disappointed.All the beautiful prose I'd come to expect from GR was MIA, and all I was left with was a boring, meandering plot about a hundreds-of-years-old conspiracy which never gets explained except through big chunks of boring historical data, all centering around the bland Oedipa Maas.I'm understanding less and less why people consider Pynchon a master writer. He clearly has the ability to write beautifully and clearly and construct a complex story; why can't he just put them together?"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I have never read a book that had single sentences running for two thirds of a page until I read this book. This book had no flow do to writers style of writing.

It appeared 35 years ago (that does date post-modernism: the book was hailed as either an exemplar or a parody of post-modernism) and vividly captures the ethos of the time .But ethos isn't all there is: to enjoy this novel, you have to let yourself slide into Pynchon's very strange world. The plot centers on Oedipa Maas, a California woman who has been named executor of her lover's estate. As she becomes involved in this process, she becomes more and more enmeshed in what may be a massive and long lived conspiracy, or may be her own paranoid delusion, or may be a plot to convince her that she is paranoid. What's fascinating about the book are the side trips, into a mythic Jacobean drama, into the lives and times of a Beatlish band, into Oedipa's personal life.What does it all mean? Who knows: it seems to me that it is something about humanity's efforts to impose meaning, but it could be about drugs, or California, or postal conspiracies. Anyway it's a great trip, though it pushed me to the edge of my toleration for non-linear fiction. And this is generally referred to as his most accessible work ------"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"A great cross-section of society, where a middleclass suburban woman's psyche is cleaved into multiple parts and has to deal with more than what the world is outside of her expertise. Written with a Carrollian whit and humor, \\"Lot\\" exposes the idiosyncratic. No matter what interpretation one chooses, \\"Lot\\" is a hysterical journey, surrounded by the absurd and possibly one of the biggest jokes played on the literary public, where red herrings bound from page to page and reality is weaved by those who are shut out from society.~John J.

Thomas Pynchon does a wonderful job of evoking the sense of an underlying order to society that drives so many conspiracy fanatics in their quest for meaningful patterns. Although this short novel is dense with fascinating ideas and quite humorous, Pynchon's prose style is frequently aggravating. He writes long, convoluted sentences with ambiguous prepositions and pronouns, which can make the reading a pretty hard slog at times."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I read this in college and laughed quite a bit, so it was nice to find that the book remains as funny twenty years later. I read it on an airplane trip from Japan and laughed out loud at several points.What I didn't pick up twenty years ago was the book's generosity of spirit. America is a lonely place and Pynchon illustrates this isolation both through the conceit of the Trystero mail service and the gradual crack-up of his central character. All of his characters try to connect with something lasting but America's rootlessness frustrates them.An aura of 'specialness' surrounds Pynchon's books, as much for the reclusiveness of their author as for their own brilliance. Don't let this aura scare you away from what is, at base, a greathearted book."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is a great book for first time Pynchon fans because it's relatively short, highly interesting throughout, and keeps a rolling sense of humor. The adventures of Mrs. Maas are intriguing enough and the writing style flows enough that you can enjoy the book with or without scrutinizing the hefty dosages of post-modern symbolism that comes along with it. The complex \\"mystery\\" that Oedipa is trying to solve throughout the book is a medium for strange and little known facts about the Pony Express, as well as the postal service. The line between historic fact and author's fiction is sufficiently obscured to both fascinate the reader and to warrant the book's placement in it's respective genre. This attribute together with the bewildered ending makes the book both an anthem of Pynchonality as well as an anthem in post-modernism. if you want to know what post-modernism is, you can do it while having a blast with an entertaining book. This one convey's the meaning of genre perfectly with the wink and laugh of fine storytelling.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Pynchon weaves us through one of his most convoluted tales. Mayhem reigns as we follow the misguided Oedipa Mas into debacles of sex and booze, and booze-induced sex. The names alone are worth this relatively quick read (Mucho Mas, Mike Fallopian), but fortunately this is not all the fun with which Pynchon provides us. We spiral hand-in-hand into madness with Oedipa: is she really uncovering the mysteries of the Muted Postal Horn, or is she being driven to the brink by the demented plot of a deceased former lover? There are no definitive answers, but are there ever?"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Upon completion of this book, I felt sad, dislocated, and yet connected with humanity in a fundamental way. In this book, Pynchon reached out to me and pulled me into his story the way few other writers have. While his penetrating satire is indeed unavoidable, I feel that this book goes beyond mere satire. Oedipa is constantly looking toward the &quot;periphery&quot; but is unable to decipher the message that is waiting for her, just outside of meaning. To any reader who has ever felt that he or she is on the outside of the world looking in, this book will provide answers for all those questions that you can never find the right words to ask."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I loved this book. Thought it was funny, challenging, but not too hard. A great time capsule of the 60's. Book captures the optimistic openness of that period. Perhaps not understandable to people born later. Should not attempt to read other Pynchon books unless you read this one first to test the water."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; slowly unfolds into a conspiracy theory so crazy it just might be true. After reading it, I started looking for signs of its truth, and, either it is true, or fans of the novel have planted the signs themselves. Maybe both.Not just a paranoid lark, though, &quot;49&quot; is a wonderful satire of power structures. Like the best cyberpunk novels (Stephenson, Gibson), the satire is not so broad that it slaps you in the face immediately. But by the time you get to &quot;KCUF&quot; radio, you're pretty sure that not everything is meant to be taken at face value :-)Maybe it's the fact that we're recycling a lot of 70s culture now, but the satire doesn't seem that dated. Like Swift, it ages well.If you've been afraid of Pynchon for his pop-yet-pomo reputation, try this one out."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Crying of Lot 49 is a great indtroduction to the world of Thomas Pynchon. Having read this book first, a person can expand their vocabulary and find a way to understand the turbulent 60s (when one wasn't born then). Pynchon developed his characters with great care and are fully believable. Oedipa Maas is the best main character I have ever enjoyed reading about. Plus the rock band scenes are funny. Give this book a chance. Having picked up other Pynchon classics, all of his books are classics, this novel is way shorter"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Don't be scared away by the obtuse sounding title and the author's reputation of impenetrability, 'The Crying of Lot 49' all makes sense in the end. Unlike most of Pynchon's novel, this one is short, which makes it attainable as well as enjoyable for the average reader. The book is put together like a well built house with construction that can leave you breathless. You read the last sentence with the feeling that every last piece has fallen magnificently into place"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"For people too stupid (myself included) to get through Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, he wrote Crying of Lot 49.

He weaves an intricate web of chaos around Oedipa Maas (our heroine) that almost reveals itself to be anything but chaotic (but not quite). At times, the satire may seem to be a little thickly applied, but it all serves a purpose in this, Pynchon's most concise and enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I read Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 many years ago.A weathered copy was given to me by a new friend, as a test of our compatibility I suppose.I found the intricacy of the story very enjoyable and the characters colorful and interesting.I enjoyed the journey the author took me on - the layers of the story.It is a story that invites discussion which is evident by the many books that have been writtenabout the author and this book in particular.At the time I was reading The Crying of Lot 49 I had no idea that others found it as important.This personal connection I felt when reading the story is what makes Pynchon's writing so specialto me.My copy is still on my bookshelf waiting to be passed along."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"After reading the great reviews, I was really excited to obtain a copy, but was quickly disappointed. The story was dated pretentious nonsense from the sixties and hasn't aged well.

They'll never read it anyway."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"With a mordant pen and an incisive wit Pynchon playfully attacks the epistemological naivetes of the credulous and anthropomorphic philosophy serving as the backbone for many of our conventional beliefs about our universe. His slyly allusive and intricately woven prose serves as the stylistic equivalent of a misleading, chaotic, and jumbled cosmos where the only certainties are interpretative freedom and ceaseless dubeity. It is a testament to Pynchon's genius that he's able pack his narrative with so many hints and glints of profundity that the ordinary reader, disorientated from the sheer speed with which disparate and seemingly irrelevant information is dispensed, never pauses to reflect upon the implications of adopting Pynchon's alternative perspective on knowledge and existence.Characters are typically one of two things: either the particulate projections of the author's personality, or the hoppled slaves of a demanding and unifying idea thought up by a wily and self-absorbed member of the literati. Pychon's character clearly fall into the latter category, with plastic personalities and rigid, affectless actions the norm, and mawkish tenderness strictly verboten. The main character, Oedipa, whose likability depends entirely upon whether or not you automatically like or dislike persons you know nothing significant about, is named by a former paracoitus as the executrix of his will. After some initial fumbling she, with assistance from legal-eagle Metzger, embarks on a quest that involves her in the shady shenaningans of secret societies whose dealings with a deceitful and delusive postal service (Tristero) are never fully uncovered by either the protagonist or the reader. The recurrent clues involving the corniculate emblem of Tristero lead Oedipa on an epic journey through an artfully constructed constellation of ideas that leaves her mystified and nonplussed. As you've probably deduced by now, the arc of the plot is non-existent; concepts and abstractions supply the riverbanks to Pynchon's stream of consciousness rather than story and character development.Recondite tralatitions, regardless of their underlying contents, are exquisitely pleasurable to encounter when they're properly executed, and Pynchon's novella Lot 49 is no exception. I extracted more than a modicum of pleasure ferreting out the solutions to the symbolic puzzles and ciphers he sportively sprinkled throughout his peripatetic text despite their aimless and arbitrary nature. While many readers will be nonplussed and perhaps repulsed by the inky ooze of the text itself, those readers who see not a turbid river but a limpid stream, the bottom of which has been inscribed with the generative principle of all of Pynchon's puzzle books, will find its perusal a thrilling oblectation. A purely cerebral indulgence, bereft, however, of all human tenderness and emotion (the point, of course, but a sorry point it is).One feels compelled to provide a brief antiphon to those who would lump Vladimir Nabokov into the same literary category as Thomas Pynchon. Primo, Nabokov isn't a post-modernist in any way, shape, or form. He was an avowed believer in indivisible monism, and expressed his recognition in more than one of his texts of the logical necessity of their existing an irreducible medium of existence; secundo, Nabokov wished to indict injustice and cruelty, whereas Pynchon simply wishes to convey &quot;existential angst&quot; and a banal form of claustrophobia. T hey both concoct puzzles, sure, and they both mastered prose, but one's a genius and the other a trifling epigone.I am indifferent to whether or not you purchase this book. If you enjoy puzzles and have a large working memory, go nuts; if not, your time would be better spend flipping through Grisham or King."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"When I started reading this book, I was expecting a Victorian crime drama. I couldn't have been more disappointed! I guess I should have bought something by Paglia (pron. Pole-ya) instead."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is the first book I wilfully read twice. The first time I dream-read through the entire thing totally lost in all the names of strange people and corporations and pacts and deals, knowing only that it had something to do with mail and history, knowing only that there was a new twist, a new bit of learned information almost EVERY SINGLE PAGE, so much information crammed into one small book that I thought my head would explode. It wasn't an enjoyable read.But then I read it again (God knows why, because so many people liked it and maybe I missed something?) And the second time, I loved it. In the short space of 150+ pages, Pynchon weaves in an ellaborate plot (that never gets resolved, if you haven't heard from the other reviews already) and poignant characters within the frame of a novel very beautifully written and a lot more lyrical the second time around. Yes, people have accused him of being overwrought, but that is exactly what I love about his prose in this book. I read Gravity's Rainbow and enjoyed the hyper-hallucinatory-reality of that book as well, but in some ways, I think that some of his best prose are in this little book. They're dense but not digressive. They're very consice and he skillfully manages to convey just the right discription of a sunset combined with just the right metaphor for an emotion to evoke a mood with both an eerie somnolent glow, like sitting on the safe-side of mountains whose opposite side is a hellish destination, but you spend your entire time trying to get to there, finding that it's impossible as you gaze at the red horizon. That's how this book feels. It's like coming so close to the truth but finding that it's too deep or too far.This book, along with V, are exellent 1960's Pynchon works, and for those who haven't read him and have only heard about him, yes, while his works DO have typical 'Pynchonian' tags or quirks to them, ultimately, each of his works are incredibly different. Gravity's Rainbow was excellent, but it possessed a very different kind of magic that you will find herin, or in V, or even in his short stories (Slow Learner). I know that some people have a problem with his work, and I don't think it's because those people want answers spoonfed to them, but because they may feel that Pynchon himself didn't know what he was writing about and perhaps that was the case. But if anything, that only adds to the mystic quality for me. He made something with so many layers to it, that he could sit back and allow the reader to gaze upon it, think of it what they will, connect with particular characters or find hidden gems that the author may not have even intended. In the end, this book hangs on the psyche like a howl in the wind, a mourning of a time lost, a time that no one remembers and may not have even existed."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I have only dabbled in reading a little &quot;postmodern&quot; literature, simply because I think most of it is over my head, and although I didn't get everything there was meant to get (not by a long shot), I feel as though I gained access to an interesting story about how ridiculous (or not) many conspiracy theories can be.There are sooooooooo many questions I have, and sooooooo many references I didn't even know where really fact, but in that way, I kind of understand Oedipa's thoughts and feelings throughout the novel. I think that if I were more knowledgable, I wouldn't have been able to read this the way I did. And like all the puns in Joyce's &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; I don't think it's as important to know everything that the author puts forth, I just think if you get the initial joke, it's enough. Maybe I'm wrong, but I read this for the story and not for the history lesson.It took me a bit to get used to Pynchon's writing style, but after a few pages, I liked getting lost in the non-punctuated tangents he went off in in his sentences. The laughs were genuine, and the story almost surreal, as if the heat of San Narciso gets into the brain. I enjoyed this book, and feel as though several rereads will help to bring more into the light."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"While I consider this to be one of the most amazing texts ever written, it also suffers greatly from being taught badly by misguided college instructors and from being misrepresented by others whose exposure to it was under less-than-ideal conditions. To wit: I have used this text in a freshman composition classroom, and by and large these students have enjoyed it, found it both interesting and challenging, and above all something worth discussing. In contrast, nearly every graduate student I know who was &quot;taught&quot; the book in a graduate course unequivocally hates it (or, worse yet, smugly thinks that it can be summed up as an exercise in violating reader expectations). In the wrong academic context, Lot 49 can be an awful experience; however, if read outside such a context, or in some other open frame of reference, it can be a truly incredible and rewarding read. I find that every time I read it, every time I use it in a classroom, something unexpected develops out of that experience, very often, in the latter case, as a result of student insight and discussion. (And, if you have nothing to do with academics, by all means, read Lot 49, and forget (at least for now) that it has ever been the subject of academic discussion!)"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I sat down and read each of the six chapters TWICE in this novel, and I didn't understand hardly anything. I know Pynchon is an outstanding author and I'm sure there's plenty of symbolism I should have picked up on, but guess what? I didn't. I like novels that make you think, but this one is like looking at a piece of art and just drawing a blank. The characters are interesting, but not detailed. No one can deny that... The story itself is engrossing for the first 50 or so pages. Then I just completely lost where Pynchon took the novel. Do you have to be over forty years old and have three degrees in English to understand his concepts? However, if anyone would like to explain any aspect of the novel to me, I would love to hear about it. Just use the address provided above. Thank you."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I first read this novellete as an assignment for my 11th grade english class, and I will admit, most of it flew over my uneducated and naivete-ridden head. Upon reading it a second time as a fully educated and aware 12th grader at my own leisure, and with the benefit of having read about entropy and began the cyclical process of comprehension and discombulation that comes with it, I was, to put it midly, blown away. I finished the book, and once again suprised that number at the bottom of the page was 154 not 451, I had been bum-rushed by humanity. This is life, regardless that the story took place in the 1960's, for this story will still be painfully relevant in the next 60's.Thomas Pynchon has a death grip on human society and proves it in The Crying of Lot 49; however, instead of the squeezing it and picking out the seeds then feeding it to the reader in a glass, he picks it up and throws it at the reader.Such a positive review, but I give this only a 9, because, well, Mr. Pynchon seems to get so involved in his social critism, that he forgets to develop his means: the characters. I just wish that his characters were used less as an avenue for his theme. Instead, I wish that he had considered his characters an indepedent entity, then built his story around them.Nevertheless, Pynchon is able to keep these characters alive via a life-support of drugs and sex, thereby diverting the reader's attention from the comatosity of the characters and towards the ferverency and vivacity of the plot.Very well done. If only I could write so well."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Decades before THE X-FILES made paranoia about conspiracies standard fare for popular culture, there was Thomas Pynchon's THE CRYING OF LOT 49 (it is not a coincident that man X-FILES websites also feature forums discussing Pynchon's books). The notion that there might be a \\"World inside the world\\" (in Don Delillo's memorable phrase) had never before truly been explored in either high or popular culture, in pulp or serious fiction, in movies or TV. Or almost. THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE in both novel and film had presented a haunting image of a government conspiracy, and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS was the great fifties classic of justified paranoia, but no work before had ever envisioned conspiracy on such a grand, international, and all pervasive scale. What is even more distrubing about this book is that the conspiracy it presents is hidden in plain sight. The protagonist of the novel, Oedipa Maas, is utterly unaware of the existence of the Tristero, yet as the book gains force she realizes that its marks can be found in every corner of society.This short novel is the perfect introduction to Thomas Pynchon. Although I thoroughly enjoy his work, I will be the first to admit that he is not for everyone. His writings contain too many obscure references (sometimes of an academic nature; frequently not), his style can at times be dense, his narrative style not always very transparent. I personally find that he repays the effort, but because I had to struggle through the several pages in GRAVITY'S RAINBOW or V. that are less than obvious in their import I can understand what it is like for those who find most of his pages tough going. THE CRYING OF LOT 49 is, however, not merely his most accessible work (largely because of its short length) but arguably his finest book. I would absolutely recommend that anyone considering exploring Pynchon begin with this.What is remarkable is how much content is contained in the novel's less than two hundred pages of text. It is one of those books in which almost nothing seems to happen, and yet seems stuffed to the brim. If one sums up the action of the novel, it seems extraordinarily slim: a woman goes to help as executor of the estate of a former lover of hers, inadvertently discovers an international conspiracy to provide an alternate mail delivery system that seems to function anarchistically to undermine the establish order, and attempts to learn all she can of the identity and existence of the mysterious Tristero. Most of the book consists in the pondering of clues. None of it labors over answers. It is also not a book that delves deeply into character analysis. Apart from Oedipa, there is not a single character that could, in E. M. Forster's famous parlance, be described as a \\"round\\" character. The novel is populated by what he would describe as \\"flat\\" characters (not necessarily a criticism, since as Forster points out all of Dickens's characters are flat). The book doesn't even seem to want to tell a story. What it wants to do is evoke a mood of disassociation, of dislocation. It wants to leave us with a sense of the unreality of our most ingrained assumptions. And it does this brilliantly.THE CRYING OF LOT 49 is a pivotal modern work of literature for another reason: it was one of the first serious works of literature that seems to be on easy terms with popular culture. Indeed, though I have no evidence for this, I would imagine that one of its major influences may have been THE TWILIGHT ZONE. It could be cited as a direct or indirect influence on a number of subsequent cultural products, including the aforementioned THE X-FILES. But the main reason to read this remarkable short work is that it is one of the finest short novels written in the past half century in English."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This book just feels nice, really. While the cover's texture is not the most interesting, it makes up for this by being quite flexible, and the binding is perfect.Like most paperbacks of this sort, the paper it is printed on is anything but mindblowing. Still, it is heavier than most, and the typeface is delightfully clear.While the graphic design of the cover is relevant, I am not sure that it is effective in a buy-for-its-cover kinda way. The design on the spine is awfully nice, though, so it may very well fit on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I have this problem that once I commit to reading a book I can't put it down because I think that if I keep reading, maybe, eventually something worth reading will come up in the later pages.This is why I dislike The Crying of Lot 49. The author goes on and on like a crazy hobo in an unending stream of conscious.This book could easily be a short story. It's not subtle at all where the author spends pages and pages over using metaphors and similes, going on tangents and generally trying desperately to fill out what never should have been an entire book in the first place.It took me weeks to finish this short read that should have taken only a few hours because I kept putting it down and eying it like a disenchanted child staring down a plate of vegetables."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"...or is Aldous Huxley smoking crack a better analogy? Either way, know that this is not your average comedy/drama/mystery.The best things about this book are the acerbic wit, unusual circumstances/story line, stream of consciousness style and quirkily (that a word?) endearing characters. The worst thing about this book is that it's going to require me to read it multiple times and to consult a Crying of Lot 49 primer before I can fully appreciate it - which, on second thought, is not such a bad thing afterall.The base story line details the trials and tribulations of a woman unravelling a mystery found in a dead man's will. The steps she takes to solve it propel her into a number of unusual circumstances where she encounters a variety of curious and extraordinary characters. In fact, the premise of the mystery itself is preposterous (in an anti-utopian sci-fi kind of way) yet fascinating.The story line is by no means straight forward and many scenes seemingly come straight out of left field. It is writing like this either turns you off or on - I happen to fall into the latter category. If you're more comfortable with a standard three act play format where everything is wrapped up nice and tight at the end, then you best look elsewhere. Additionally, there are so many obvious references (names, places, situations) to present and past icons that I wonder how many not-so-obvious references I missed.I admit that I didn't fully understand what I read, but it is the challenge of a greater understanding that compels me to do some research and read it again ...well...that plus it was just plain fun to read. I'll let you know how that turns out...If you enjoy books like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or A Conferacy of Dunces then I'm pretty certain you'll enjoy this as well. Let me know how that turns out..."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is probably Pynchon's best and most accessible novel. It's a masterpiece of 60s paranoia, dragging the reader into a plot that seems improbably but becomes terrifyingly true as the book goes on. It's also really funny. Some of the jokes are specific to the time it was published (1966) but it contains enough oddball characters and situations to keep readers entertained. it's a short book, a novella, that's a good introduction to the reclusive writer. If you liked this book, I'd suggest moving on to V."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I have to admit that I wanted to like this novel more than I actually did. It's been a few weeks since I finished The Crying of Lot 49 (I've fallen behind in my book reviewing) and I have to say, I haven't thought about it much (if at all) since - which is never a good thing. A literary work like this is supposed to get inside your head and make you ponder its themes and contemplate its metaphors and consider its subtle nuances.For the most part, I found the novel entertaining enough (and it is very short) but its major downfall is that I felt no attachment to any of the characters. Even in a short novel like this, Pynchon manages to introduce dozens of characters who play small roles and then disappear without a trace. As a result, the only character we have any hope of engaging with is our protagonist, Oedipa Maas. Unfortunately I couldn't muster up much interest for her or for the mysterious conspiracy she tries to unravel.Still, the Crying of Lot 49 has worthwhile qualities warranting at least 3 stars. The Jacobean revenge play is great, the word play (Pynchon clearly loves his wordplay) is pretty clever, and the novel does have a 1960s hallucinatory vibe going on (& I have a soft spot for hippies). The ending is ambiguous which many readers will find frustrating - but I'm partial to ambiguous endings so it worked for me.The book though is more of a literary puzzle than a bona fide story. It's not about entertaining the reader, character development, or even story-telling. It's about literary cleverness and social commentary. It offers reflections on the disconnectedness and isolation of modern society. It explores the notion of language and communication suggesting that much of what we communicate is pointless. It's a novel about absurdity and cultural chaos. From that perspective, it's interesting to read.But is this a great novel? Is it an engaging story? Does it introduce us to compelling and memorable characters?No, no and not even close."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Thomas Pynchon's novel of postal conspiracies, the dawn of the counter-culture, and the relaxed social norms of 1960's Southern California is considered classic enough to make Time Magazine's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present. This is opposed to the year 1966, when an unnamed critic from this same magazine, in reference to this same book, lamented, \\"What is the meaning of the gibberish literature that is currently being published as fast as it can be gibbered?\\" I mention these things for two reasons: Mainly because I found the snarky commentary by Time's unknown reviewer to be funnier than anything I read in 'The Crying of Lot 49', but also because I suspect that the opinion on this book still ranges between classic and gibberish.Despite its intricate wordplay and oddball narrative - characteristics that certainly have their charms - there are several reasons why I didn't connect with 'Lot 49'. The primary one is that Mr. Pynchon's writing comes across as very self-satisfied. I could probably study 'Lot 49' for a long time, and find something new years from now, but I just couldn't muster much interest in the clues he left during my first reading. I found myself racing to the end of this short book, on past the standard post-modern ambiguous ending, and glad to move on to something else.Oedipa Maas, housewife, is asked to serve as executrix for the estate of her former lover, the mutli-millionaire Pierce Inverarity. As she delves deeper into the labyrinth of Pierce's holdings, she discovers (maybe) a strange conspiracy concerning an ages old postal feud, one that, once noticed, seems to stretch into every facet of life. Aside from some rather dated commentary on the lifestyles of the mid-sixties, the book's main thrust appears to be not so much the mystery that Oedipa uncovers, but the existential effect it has on her.I feel like much of 'The Crying of Lot 49' is cleverness for cleverness' sake (like the names Oedipa Maas and Pierce Inverarity, for example). In this way it reminds me of David Foster Wallace's fiction - original, skillful, but ultimately unsatisfying. (I suppose I should say that Wallace reminds me of Pynchon, since Pynchon came first - but I was already familiar with DFW). Actually, I've come to realize that I feel this way about most post-modern lit, and certainly about 'Lot 49' - that it lacks substance (my disclaimer here is that I often feel like these books would have held a lot more appeal for me when I was a younger man). It's as if the author, highly educated and incredible facile as a writer is at a loss for something pertinent to say, and, in order to avoid churning out a morality play, instead turns to self-absorbed tales of highly educated and incredibly facile characters who are at a loss for something pertinent in their lives. This sort of writing would naturally appeal to highly educated, incredibly facile people - especially those who feel they're still missing something from life. But while they may identify with the situation, I don't think they'll find any balm for their misery except company."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is the first work of Pychon I read and it was many years ago but it is still unforgetable. The author whose picture (if we only had a picture) should be next to the word \\"paranoia\\" in the dictionary in this book documents the sixties as well introduces us to his unusual perspective. Like in many of Pychon's works fact and fiction are blurred. The heroine of the story, Oedipa Maas as executrix of the estate of her late millionaire paramour, goes on journey akin for the quest of the grail. She is searching for the truth but the truth becomes more an more obscure as her journey goes on. Populated by such unforgetable characters as Stanley Kotex and LSD therapist Dr. Hilarius the book is filled with clever puns and word play. Arcane references a peppered through out the book from both science , liturature and history some of which probably originate from Pychon's college years when he double majored at Cornell in English and Engineering. But what makes Oedipa's journey poigniant is that although Oedipa finds herself entangled in various affairs she still maintains the innocence of a child. On her journey she happens upon conspiracy on top of conspiracy such as the W.A.S.T.E. system, an illegal and underground postal system whose symbol is the horn of Tristero. Why does the Tristero horn keep cropping up? From my take it is a symbol of revolution and anarchy (since ony the federal government is authorized to deliver the mail): it is a symbol of the time the book is set in. Like Oedipa the reader finds themselves suddenly being sucked into a paranoic hyper-real state. Her journey is not only a search for truth but a search for America. It is not only a time capsule of the sixties, a time where both the sexual revulution and the height of the cold war co-existed, reading it now one finds it prophetic. In a style some might call deconstructionist the crescendo of the book, at least from my perspective comes somewhere in the middle of the story. I think though like any great work of art much of the meaning comes from a synergy between author and the reader as I believe no one interpretation of the work is definitive. Much like artist works in paint Pychon paints with words."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This book is dated.But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. It references songs, topics, and people who are not necessarily known today. If you are the age of the author or perhaps the age of his children (provided he had them young), then yes, you would be able to get the reference without the aid of Wikipedia and Google. However, I'm much younger (over 30 but under 40), so I had to keep my laptop close at hand while reading. This is not a problem for me. I learn this way, but if you are turned off by that, then perhaps you should give this book a pass.There really isn't a strong plot here. What plot does exist can be described as a gerbil, spending his days running on a wheel, never really getting anywhere but expending a lot of energy.In my opinion, this novel's saving grace was the humor. The more-than-memorable characters and their names give rise to a small and sometimes outlandish chuckle.A sentence can be as long as a paragraph and a paragraph can span an entire page, but if you stick with it (I found reading slowly and sometimes aloud helped me to stay focused and not loose the subject of a page-long sentence) the worst thing that will happen is that you will have had one hell-of an experience."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Funny & confusing, but due to its length, a great introduction to Pynchon. Even though you find it hard to know what's going on, you don't have to wade through hundreds of pages for the finish.The comparison with Ulysses is not, in my opinion, very apt. While Pynchon had obviously read it, he didn't try to write Ulysses Lite.Enjoyably convoluted and worth the effort."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I think of Pynchon as the Robin Williams of recent (undeservedly) widely-bought, (undeservedly) widely-taught, and (deservedly) widely-unread fiction: in small doses, Williams and Pynchon come off as brilliant, artful, and socially insightful. In increasing doses they become appallingly tiresome; their audience (mostly captive, in the case of Pynchon) starts being bored with the same addled antics over and over; then the audience starts wondering if Pynchon/William's apparent talent is in fact some tiresome neurological condition; finally the the audience ends up accepting this hypothesis, and hoping that the condition is either treatable, or quickly terminal.So, read /just/ this short book and have a chance at enjoying Pynchon."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I've heard of Pynchon of course, but had never experienced his work, until now. Now I know the meaning of \\"Pynchonesque\\" and will never have to wonder again what it means.On the surface, the subject matter of this book is serious and bleak. Conspiracies abound. People die mysteriously. Paranoia and hallucinations twist the mundane into knots. Pynchon pulls the reader's leg with his genius, provokes thought processes beyond the superficial. He does it gradually and sneakily -- with prose that varies from beautifully wrought to exasperating, characters named Mucho Maas and Fallopian, a radio station named KCUF, and more outrageous plot twists than mind can comprehend -- until I did not know whether to gasp, laugh, or cry by the last page."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I started to read THE CRYING OF LOT 49 and didn't get very far. I was so irritated that this &quot;quick read&quot; was dense and challenging, not what I had expected. The main character (Oedipa Maas) is faced with a coincidence in every new situation, which made me think, &quot;there is no such thing as a coincidence if everything is a coincidence&quot;....right? Near tearing the book apart, I put it down and sought help in reading reviews on Amazon. I learned that other people had trouble reading this book (validation), and that I would perhaps not &quot;get&quot; everything out of it from just one read. And so, I picked up where I left off. I read it as I had Faulkner, not trying to understand everything, and not expecting linearity. I found that with my new approach I really liked this book. I thought about it when I was not reading it &amp; laughed out loud at a lot of the incidental characters. Surprisingly, I even got used to Pynchon's writing style. Will I read it again for a deeper, additional level of understanding?........a positive maybe."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Whose Conspiracy is it?In The Crying of Lot 49, Pynchon seems to be trying to spoof the conspiracy-theory story, but I believe he fails to write a convincing story because there are no believable characters moving the plot.Ever since I started high school in 1952 I have been aware that individuals have descried and the media have described grand theories of covert conspiracies at all levels of our society. In my earliest recollections it was the \\"dirty pinko commies\\" who had infiltrated Hollywood, the Army, and all levels of the U.S. Government and \\"they\\" were determined to destroy our Judeo-Christian-military-industrial society. When I started college in the early sixties, the hot conspiracy was the work of the rabble rousers trying to subvert the status quo among the minorities and women. After the Kennedys and M. L. King were assassinated, wonderfully chilling, probing novels, TV documentaries, dramas, and fantastic movies promoting a vast array of conspiracy theories were produced. Modern America has been primed to expect a conspiracy in any place or at any time as a part of our partisan political process. We love a good conspiracy-theory story.As an engineer who lived in Southern California in the sixties and worked a few years for a small electronics company that made subassemblies that wound up on the moon, I could identify with the poor slobs who worked for Yoyodyne. As a stamp collector, the name \\"Thurn and Taxis\\" sounded very familiar. As an avid reader of the plays of the Seventeenth Century, I could identify most of the scenes in the Courier's Tragedy. As a fan of David Lodge, I smiled at the allusion to Morris Zapf. All of Pynchon's characters range from oddball to extreme stereotypes, and the plot unfolds driven by an extremely long series of tedious coincidences that drive Oedipa through an improbable quest that ends at an auction.What bothered me was that Pynchon has Oedipa jump to a conclusion that there is a conspiracy early in the plot and then she sets out on a liminal quest and builds a hermeneutic conspiracy theory which the author presents in as realistically detailed a fashion as Dreiser does in An American Tragedy. Granted Pynchon follows the postmodernist formula of introducing a wide ranging pastiche of clues, provided by widely different, mostly unreliable, repressed to paranoid characters, but they all reinforce in Oedipa's mind that there is a rational conspiracy that has existed for almost three hundred years, which has the effect of being a substitute religious experience and post office for the usual outcasts of society.There were many warm smiles along the way, but the relentless sledge hammering of the mindless, paranoid clues Oedipa follows wore me down. Satire needs a believable, nave straight man, or woman, to carry the story line. Ode didn't do it for me.I rate the book two and a half stars."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I've never read Pynchon before, but his style, those winding, iridescent sentences seem like an important reference point for a lot of American authors who come after him, people like Don Delillo, Donald Barthelme, David Foster-Wallace, Johnathan Franzen, Neal Stephenson, William Gibson etc. He's able to synthesize obscurant historical references, pop culture, conspiratorial paranoia and drug use into this funky, swirling melange. It would almost be a kind of metaphysics, if it wasn't so kooky and consistently playful. Reading this, it feels like someone peeling off the surface of postwar American life, showing you this messy, bizarre, occasionally terrifying blend of forces that might have it in for you, or might just be yanking your chain. Or maybe both."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Because her husband is chasing after young girls and because her psychiatrist is tripping on LSD, Oedipa ends up turning to strangers for help in finding the &quot;Tristero.&quot; She does not know what the &quot;Tristero&quot; is, or even if it exists, but since it is connected to her ex-boyfirend, Pierce, and since she feels trapped in her normal life she decides to search all over California for evidence of the &quot;Tristero.&quot;As Oedipa tries to make sense of all the evidence she has she ends up growing more isolated and paranoid. She wonders if it is some grand scheme against her set up by Pierce. She feels more evidence should lead to the truth, whereas the book shows it only makes her increasingly confused. The book leads to the point where Oedipa has two choices: continue looking for the truth of the &quot;Tristero&quot; or give up and go insane.The novel is on the short side being only 152 pages, and some could probably be omitted. Many scenes are there to confuse the reader just as Oedipa becomes increasingly confused. There are different scenes that repeat the same point 4 or 5 times (e.g. more information leads to confusion, there are only 2 choices with no gray area). The novel ends with Oedipa still in her search for the &quot;Tristero.&quot; If you like a novel with complete closure, and if you like to know what happened to all the characters, then this is not the novel for you.I gave this novel 3 stars because there were enjoyable scenes, and I do agree with some of the points and ideas Pynchon brings up in this satire. However, I am not fond of the repetitiveness and lack of closure."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"From the man who once jumped out of a second-story window in a Mexico City hotel in order to avoid being photographed comes a novel that examines whether the notion of political freedom is perhaps a contradiction in terms within a society where the free exchange of ideas is regulated- if not controlled- by government. Along the way he pokes fun at everything from poor trends in music to the arrogance of Northern Californians toward residents of the southern half of the state. A must for anyone who finds the smaller humors in life oftentimes illustrate the larger problems and issues."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"While Pynchon's circular, postmodern storytelling techinques can be misleading and frustrating; the story emerges as a compelling condemnation of everything America stood for at the end of the second world war. After reading this novella, you will never be able to drive through a suburban strip mall again."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I was forced into reading this book as an example of postmodernist literature. As I attempted to read it, I found it impossible to read past the first two pages, losing attention with the unusual stream of consciousness style of Pynchon's writing. Finally I made a breakthrough, and found myself in the most tightly-packed, symbolism-ridden novel I have ever read. It was indeed gripping, and it was only my caffeine-induced stupor that prevented me from reading it at a more deep level. It has proved fruitful to me with its example of adversary culture, fighting against the technocracy and alienation of a postmodernist society, and refresingly it was really funny as well. One of the great American novels of the 20th Century, capturing the spirit of the sixties as well as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; did with the twenties, and as well as &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; captured the spirit of Hunter S. Thompson's paranoid, acid-fried state-of-mind."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Lot 49 is a unique book, and one of my favorites of all time. I read it for the first time years ago in a class which had T.S.Eliot's Wasteland as central theme, and it was in this context that I came to explore its different levels of meaning. The most fascinating quality of Lot 49 comes from its weaving a highly colorful tapestry, where comical anecdote, subcultural jargon, social satire, historical revelations, and philosophical discourse on moral values are all entertwined. The result is a complex, highly entertaining concentrate of food for thought that I'm not about to forget, and a book to which I am in fact deeply attached. (For those who have trouble understanding the underlying themes, try reading Grant's &quot;Companion to Lot 49&quot;, or the York Notes.)"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I first fell in love with this novel as an English major at the Univ of Conn during the late 60's. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald in The Great Gatsby, this is Pynchon at his best. By the way, I think the original cover is the best I've ever seen on this book. I re-read it on average once or twice a decade, and I never fail to be moved by it. One of the great accomplishments is Pynchon's ability to move strongly in the direction of comedy, yet keep an equal tension in the direction of tragedy. Are the skeletons in the lake comedic or tragic? Or does Pynchon manage to draw comedy and tragedy together as two faces of the same coin? The sailor in the burning bed, and the mystical annual resurrection of the dandelions, are just two of the ironic crescendos of this symphony. Oh, and it's a masterpiece of terror, which is most evident in the revelation of the title's meaning, and the slamming door shutting out the light at the end. Ignore the few pompous asses who have derided this great book -- buy the book. Get a glass of Chablis on a quiet night, put on a copy of Steve Miller Band's &quot;Sailor&quot; album (1969?), and kick back for a kick butt read."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Truly splendid writing. He packs more into 150-odd pages than most writers could dream of in an entire career. If you're not yet reading Pynchon because you've heard he's nearly impossible to penetrate, then this is the one. It's accessible, crisply written and (mostly) devoid of the immenseness of structure that marks the bigger works like GR and Mason &amp; Dixon. This is interesting, challenging reading, but doable for anyone who can read on a high school level and who doesn't mind a little active reading for a change. We can't spend all our lives being spoon fed another Grisham &quot;Attractive Southern Lawyer Fights Random Injustices and Gets Shot At&quot; or book with Fabio sweating on the cover."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"A very enjoyable book. I will be forever grateful to it for making me laugh out loud during a particularly nasty flu.How anyone can find this book 'difficult' or 'unreadable' is beyond me. What is so hard about this book? I found it eminently readable. Indeed, it was the book that made me think that I might be able to move on to the bigger books, like 'V' or 'Gravity's Rainbow.'The Crying of Lot 49' is difficult, I suppose, but only if you have spent your life reading only John Grisham or Anne Rice."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This book is sheer genius! I thought the whole &quot;Cashiered&quot; movie sequence was one of the funniest and most black of satires ever written.

Read this book over and over. Then read it again."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I'm actually supposed to be writing a paper on the book right now, but I couldn't help myself from reading the reviews others gave it. At the risk of souding extremely pretentious, I have to say to all of you who didn't understand it, I'm sorry, but you have to read it again. It's actually quite clear. Pynchon cleverly crafted a satiric novel under the guise of an intricate and complex plot. Although confusing at times, it is apparent that Pynchon intended every bit of it.One moment I would find myself laughing out loud, and then next, I was wondering if I had missed a few pages or not. From beginning to end, the book held my interest. I highly, highly, highly recommend it to ANYONE. (and no, you don't need 3 degrees in English to understand it)."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Did I really read that review?I'm actually gobsmacked.

I just wanted to let sdfsdf (whose review graces the first page of this entry) know that he really oughtn't try so hard. So you are (or want to be) a logophile. Congratulations! But you, unlike Pynchon, scarcely warrant the reading of your review, much less looking up your impressive-looking (but lousily contextualized, and oft-misused) words. If the literati were more along the lines of the illuminati, you'd have been cut long ago. (It's nothing personal.

For some, this is what makes writers like Pynchon and Joyce hard to read. The run-on sentences make the middle school grammar teacher in me scream out for order. Despite this, I decided to give Pynchon's writing a chance. While I did enjoy the overall story, the presentation was not to my preference.In a series of conspiracies, Oedipa Mass finds herself executor of the estate of her late boyfriend. Not only does she reveal the sources of his wealth, but she also discovers an underground network of conspiracies. Scattered amid historical references, one door of conspiracy leads to another. Dry humor and wit preceed the doors, yet I thought the attempts at humor did not always deliver a payoff.I can appreciate the talent in Pynchon's writing, but I must admit that it is not my cup of tea. It is apparent that his books have a rather devout following, yet his books are not for everyone."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"You may not like THE CRYING OF LOT 49; you may find it complicated, difficult, or impossible to understand; but all serious readers of modern literature should read Pynchon's masterpiece.The other reviews have summarized the story and certain original facets of the book. But this work needs to be consumed to be experienced. I can't even imagine successful cliff notes.I recently re-read it and found new and exciting aspects during this third reading. I would not recommend it for a pleasure read, or for any entertainment aspect, but nonetheless, it is a must read."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I'm sorry...what?This book reads like a giant riddle. It's entertaining, thought provoking and laugh-out-loud funny in places, but it's also very confusing in other places.while reading this book, I got the feeling that someone had removed every third sentence.

But those that manage to slug through this gleaming example of the nadir of 20th century prose will get the occasional chuckle. I am positive that Pynchon does have something of value to say, and if you can make it through his unintelligible writing style and acid-head syntax, I am sure you can find it."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Let's start with the good stuff: what other author has so respected the intelligence of its reader? &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; offers a staggering plethora of wordplay and discourse drawn from the wide world of cocktail parties, thermal physics, greek drama, and us postal history. Your synapses will explode with color. The charcters are drawn with beautiful quirkiness, from housewives suffering from 20th century ennui to urban cowboys. The anticipation of watching them interact is much like pouring yellow into green in the chem lab, and the results are not in the least dissapointing.Now the bad stuff: behind all the flash, what's left, really? A pale conspiracy book that suffers two major ails: 1. The conspiracy isn't believable, and 2. Though novel, the conspiracy fails to maintain your interest once the novelty has worn off. The book reminds me of Nabokov's &quot;Pale Fire&quot;--interesting from a technical standpoint, but beyond the styling, there is nothing significant. However, just like Nabokov, it's clear that Pynchon is an excellent writer. My suggestion is you try another Pynchon novel (I haven't read any others personally, but everyone seems to think &quot;gravity's rainbow&quot; is where it's at) or a good conspiracy book, like the Illuminatus trilogy."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"The Crying of Lot 49 must have seemed incredibly witty when it first appeared in the mid-60's. This satire, which follows the twists and turns of Oedipa Maas' adventures in being the executor of a dead friend's will is a satire on Southern California culture in the mid-60's.The back of this book compared it to Joyce's Ulysses; while I won't doom Lot 49 with such unfortunate company, it, like Ulysses, is probably more admired by critics than actually enjoyed by readers. The prose is intentionally dense, and the characters and events, which are set just before the rise of the hippie culture in the late 60s, seem almost quaint in comparison to what the 1960s are remembered for forty years later.While the first 30 pages are easily the toughest to get through, the story starts to move along after that following an intereting, if not particularly compelling, conspiracy angle. To Pynchon's credit, I didn't feel that the book was artificially lengthened in order to give the story heft--at 150 pages, Lot 49 is surprisingly brief for a critical darling.Lot 49 reads like a poor-man's Joseph Heller, and it hasn't aged well. But, underneath it all you can pick up some interesting commentary about California just before flower power."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Back in the sixties, I remember carrying a well-worn copy of LOT 49 around with me wherever I went, wherever I hung out in Berkeley. Pynchon was God; He knew. He gave us the California landscape, its craziness, its mindscape as no other author had done before. So what if the book was a put-on? So what if it was really about the \\"selling\\" or \\"crying\\" in real estate terms of the lot that is California, the state created by the 49ers? So what if the characters were straight out of comic books? It was the way he had woven it all so artfully together, a California of one piece, comprehensible for a change, maybe even understandable. I thank Pynchon for doing that. From time to time, I go back to LOT 49, taste the language and descriptions, do a few mental jumps in time back to that bizarre period in American life. Pynchon saw it all so early, so clearly."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"La primera vez que le&iacute; \\"La subasta...\\" me qued&eacute; con la sensaci&oacute;n de que el estilo categorico de Pynchon me hab&iacute;a ahorrado el costo de tener que comprender tambi&eacute;n la trama. Lo digo porque por momentos los materiales de esta construcci&oacute;n mental que es la novela, nos encandila con sus juegos de luces, relegando a la parte la no menos sugerente grandeza del conjunto. Eso fue lo que me pas&oacute; con la primera lectura. Despu&eacute;s le&iacute; a Harold Bloom que comenta \\"La subasta...\\" en \\"C&oacute;mo leer y por qu&eacute;.\\" En su art&iacute;culo, Bloom reconoc&iacute;a el cansancio que le produjo la primera lectura en relaci&oacute;n al deleite que le proporcion&oacute; la segunda. Recomendaba entonces una lectura doble, sin soluci&oacute;n de continuidad. Acabarlo y empezar de nuevo. Y eso fue lo que hice. Pude ver el edificio completo, sin tener que perder de vista los hermosos arreglos de sus mosaicos. Thomas Pynchon es un escritor consumado como Roth o McCarthy. Este libro del a&ntilde;o 1965 se deja leer como un anticipo del \\"C&oacute;digo Da Vinci\\" y, por qu&eacute; no, de Fahrenheit 9/11. Todo lo que le pasa a Edipa Maas (una obsesa de la Verdad, dice Bloom) tiene que ver con la idea de esa conjura que solemos ver en las sombras que proyecta la realidad sobre nosotros. Algo nos acecha. Siempre. O nada, quiz&aacute;. La clave de este entramado, al que sirve de motivo una herencia del fallecido Pierce Inverarity, cuya presencia fantasmal circula de ida y vuelta por toda la novela, es un interrogante con que nos encontramos casi al final del libro. Qu&eacute; es todo eso que ocurre alrededor de la pobre Edipa Maas, &iquest;realidad o paranoia? Como en toda buena novela, el desenlace depender&aacute; no menos del autor que del curioso y desocupado lector."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"But boy, this book just turned me off completely. I take the point of the reader who wrote the review &quot;Great Writers Are Not to Blame for Your Lack of Education&quot;, but I also believe that one should feel free to say, &quot;I just didn't like it&quot; and not have to worry about having your intelligence or lack thereof implicated. Having said that-- the character names; silly. Plot development; nonexistent. Characters; flat flat flat. This is all purely my opinion-- I'm definitely more of a classics reader. But I did get an education, and continue to educate myself, so I don't feel too bad about not liking Pynchon. And I think I may still give Gravity's Rainbow a try, you never know..."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is a relatively easy book to read given the complexities of the Pynchonian oeuvre, but as some people have noticed it is not an easy book to understand. In it, I believe that Thomas Pynchon is challenging both the classical notion of a hidden structure and the modernist notion of a self-created structure. This is the first book in which the author tries to articulate a coordinated human response to being thrown into an apparently indifferent, degenerate Copernican acosmos, a universe without intrinsic values. Because of the book's compact size, nearly linear plot and concentration on a single, central protagonist, 28 year old Oedipa Maas, we are compelled to view her imagined discovery of the dystopian structure, the Tristero, as one way of giving meaning to the entropic disintegration of human life, of finding \\"a reason that mattered to the world,\\" (p. 150).Oedipa Maas becomes trapped between the two idealizations of (i) existential power to create, and (ii) gnostic ability to establish values. Oedipa's existential state is exemplified by a painting in the book (mentioned on p. 11) by Remedios Varo, which inverts the Christian creation and tries to construct an independent self; but this only leads to solipsism and narcissism: with the anthropological fear of non-existence, of there being only \\"the void\\" (p. 141). Through another metaphor, that of a slow \\"whirlwind,\\" (pp. 14, 16) we cannot hear the words of revelation because the wind is rotating too slowly (God spoke to Job out of a whirlwind) and so Oedipa tries to construct an alternative source of gnostic value, \\"the languid, sinister blooming of The Tristero,\\" (pp. 39-40) with its symbol of the muted post horn, to mute the trumpets of the Apocalypse through bureaucratic waste; but this only leads her into deeper gnostic paranoia and the self-construction of projected revelation: with the cosmological fear of becoming a machine, \\"a great digital computer\\" (p. 150).By showing how Oedipa can neither become an independent self, nor can realize her own personal revelation, Thomas Pynchon indirectly re-establishes a route back to reality: \\"the reality principle\\" (p. 111). Oedipa's failure is the failure of her mystical search for charisma, the gift of tongues, \\"the direct, epileptic Word, the cry that might abolish the night,\\" (p. 95) but without the necessary and corresponding rational order of tradition. This one-sidedness provokes Oedipa (and the reader), in the final auction, into an implicated choice between some kind of objective truth and paranoiac self-centering, between the spiritual and the material: thus, the crier, Loren Passerine is \\"the finest auctioneer in the West,\\" (p. 151) but also, maybe \\"a descending angel;\\" (p. 152) an indirect positing of the choice between God and idolatry. However, Oedipa's potential revelation, the \\"high magic to low puns,\\" (p. 105) is a recovery through satire from the stilted, post-romantic pretentiousness of modernism; a passerine is a perching song-bird, \\"Loren Passerine, on his podium, hovered like a puppet-master,\\" (p. 152) about the size of a sparrow."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"The first chapter of this novel is quite good -- brings out some interesting characters with some very funky names (Oedipa? Mucho? A shrink named Dr. Hilarius?) with keen senses of humor. It ends strongly, with the image of Oedipa imagining herself as Rapunzel and that image just running away and picking up steam, doing its own stuff, quite alive as the chapter closes out.Unfortunately, the rest of the five chapters don't come near the intensity of the first chapter. And when Pynchon goes headlong into the Jacobean play (\\"The Courier's Tragedy\\"), he comes out all alone, his readers left behind on the other side, dead cold and wondering just what the heck happened to this novel.When all is said and done, this book just doesn't quite jibe, doesn't quite work. That's not to say that it's a total failure -- in spots, Pynchon's incredible language is still there, like an oasis in the middle of a desert, not to mention some moments of genuine hilarity (like when Oedipa puts on layer after layer of clothing before playing strip poker and the aerosol can zipping around the room like a busted balloon). But for me, these parts just weren't enough. To have to wade through the rest of the gobbledygook just wasn't worth it."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I first ran across this short novel in college, when a close friend was assigned to read it. I picked it up in her dorm room and read the first few chapters, and when I told her I was enjoying its eccentricities, she looked at me strangely (and a little painfully) and said that we must have very different literary tastes.It wasn't until I finally sat down to finish it that I understood what she meant. The novel slowly devolves from a humorous, slapdash account of a suburban housewife forced to face her past into a hallucinatory exploration of paranoia and conspiracy theories.Pynchon does an excellent job of blurring the lines between the characters' realities, actions, and beliefs. He gradually introduces so much confusion to the tale that by the end, I wandered, terrified, through the prose as Oedipa so wandered the streets of San Francisco, desperately hunting for answers.By the end, I had NO idea what the book was about and was relieved to finally close it. Thank God it was short, or I'd really be pissed. Like Oedipa's questions about the shadowy nature of Trystero, my questions about what actually happens in this book will never be answered.For a complete discussion, visit my book review site, Melody & Words!"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"\\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is a short post-modern novel set in 1960s California. It traces the attempts of its main character, Oedipa Maas, to discern whether a secretive mail distribution company named Trystero actually exists. Aside from this general plot thrust, it is hard to discern what this novel is about, much in the vein of most post-modern fiction. The story takes many twists and turns, contains several story-within-story narrative developments, and is replete with cultural and social references which range from the extremely obscure to the downright in-your-face ones. Among the latter are the names of several characters - Oedipa Maas, \\"Mucho\\" Maas, Genghis Cohen, Dr. Hilarius, Mike Fallopian, etc. This over the top \\"punning\\" in my humble opinion cheapens the novel, and rather than making it profound makes it look puerile. It is hard to take seriously characters with such outrageous names, and almost no attempt has been made to make any of them feel human - the characters are just symbols that engage in dialogue with each other. The same holds for the names of cities and towns, many of which are fictional. The book feels very self-indulgent and pretentious, hard to read and not very literary. It is probably one of the most overrated books that I had ever read."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"The Crying of Lot 49 puts me in mind of the classic film, Citizen Kane. Both have an enigmatic \\"great man,\\" deceased, lurking in the shadows of the story -- Pierce Inverarity and Charles Foster Kane. Both have a cardboard cutout of a character pursuing the meaning of the man -- Oedipa Maas and Thompson, the reporter. Both serve up a tantalizing key to that meaning -- Tristero and Rosebud.Pierce Inverarity died a few months prior to the beginning of CL49, leaving his former mistress, Oedipa Maas as his executor. He had amassed great wealth in real estate and Oed thought his lifestyle would provide escape from the gray Eisenhower years of her life. She found he was more absorbed in his stamp collection than with her, but also came to realize that the lifestyle which transported her to exotic locales in Mexico provided only the illusion of escape. She returned to her world of tupperware parties, where we first meet her, recovering from the spiked punch they offer.We see no depth to her character and relate to Oedipa mostly through her role in searching for meaning in one person's life. Ostensibly, that would be Pierce Inverarity's, but it is also potentially her own and, by extension, our own. The key to unlocking the enigma is Tristero and the keyhole is first exposed with the cancelled stamp marked \\"Report All Obscene Mail to Your Potsmaster.\\" This misspelling starts her on a path through the brown conformity of southern California, finding stepping stones of non-conformity amidst the military industrialism of the Yoyodyne corporation, the ticky-tacky housing and resort developments of Pierce Inverarity.Tristero links these pockets of non-conformity through its secret mail system which sprang up in opposition to the monopoly of the European state-endorsed postal system. The downtrodden, those at the edge of society, those with a severe mistrust of the established order use the American incarnation of Tristero to communicate with each other.Pynchon creates a bridge between the engineering and literary worlds by introducing entropy as a motif in his story. Notoriously confusing, entropy is clarified by a recent interpretation as a measure of freedom. Entropy in nature tends to increase, but can be locked in a stasis. An ice crystal remains rigidly frozen until it receives a small amount of melt energy. Entropy decreases temporarily with the addition of this energy, but then increases dramatically when the water molecules are freed to move out of their locked position in the crystal. One can also imagine that, with the right activation energy, the rigid grid of drafting tables of the Yoyodyne engineering department can be freed to form a society for creative invention.Pynchon closes his book with an image of brilliant points of dust dancing in a patch of sunlight outside the door to the auction room. As the door closes on Oedipa, we wonder whether she can use Tristero to free herself from herself, to dance on the light beams of imagination, or that this quest is just another illusion of escape."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Thomas Pynchon's books are always interesting and unpredictable. It is worth the effort of the reader to understand the details of the pages, even when they appear to be random. The reward is an increase in mental \\"entropy\\" that allows for increased connections of ideas as the book progresses. The main character, Oedipa is a \\"Maxwell demon\\" who seeks to control this entropy.The Crying of Lot 49 is relatively low in entropy compared to Pynchon's most recent novel, Against the Day. In fact the author was critical of TCL49 indicating that he had forgotten important lessons learned in earlier writing. The plot is a little too transparent, giving the reader limited insightful information. It is a good introduction to the writing of Pynchon for those readers who are not used to doing research about allusions presented in novels.The plot is like a detective story with unusual characters, a secret organization, and the sneaking suspicion that there is something more to California life in the 1960's than meets the convoluted highway surface. Paranoia is rampant with the feeling of living in a revenge play that may be real or only a narcissistic illusion. This short book is a good gateway to Pynchon's more satisfying longer books."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"It's chemistry, that's all. This is the favorite book of my life. I've read all the classics, have a degree in English, write my own novels -- this is the one book I yearn to emulate. I happen to think, also, it's the only really memorable book Pynchon will ever produce. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby,' it is short, tight, and focused. Its bigger sibling, 'V', is an unfocused meander. Gravity's Rainbow is the one other candidate for lasting fame, I think. Yoyodyne is an underground trope, as I have learned, and that's straight out of TCOL49. So why? I'm not sure, but I know I feel about this book the way I feel about my wife -in love for life. What surprises me most is that nobody has attempted to make a movie of it, and that's probably good since it would most likely be a horrible botch. Maybe Ridley Scott could pull it off (my favorite director, and Blade Runner is my all-time favorite film). And again, it's chemistry. What works for me may not work for you. And that's how the universe is meant to be. I guess maybe if I place my favorite movie, Blade Runner, in the vanguard of Faustian tropes and call it a replay of the Frankenstein theme, I might see Oedipa Maas as a kind of Mesopotamian adventuress in the mold of Gilgamesh, wandering through the terrifying echoic forest of Huwawa, which is the ur-(no pun intended)-adventure of us all. Apres nous, le deluge...anyway, the sailor who transcends the burning bed, or the notional rebirth of dandelions in their wine as the season of their spring flourishes, those are among the many memorable notions from TCOL49. And Oedipa's astonishment at the vast, almost galactic street numbers of California...much to be mined here."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"If you've tried to read Pynchon in the past, but never managed to wade through the sheer bulk of his insanity, this might be the book for you. An excellent introduction to this justly lauded writer, it's not overlong at 160 pages (almost a novella, from Pynchon) and includes a very succinct summing up near the conclusion that safely resolves any doubts about what he's trying to say. In fact, if this book has a major flaw, it could be that it's insufficiently subtle. There may be those among Pynchon's admirers who feel that that they're being hit over the head with this book's philosophical issues, and may prefer those books where it isn't laid out quite so neatly for all to see.But many others will find a lot to like in this wildly comic, but deeply pointed novel. Twenty-eight-year-old Oedipa Maas is appointed executrix of a deceased eccentric entrepreneur's will and suddenly finds herself abandoning her husband to live in a paranoid fantasy-world replete with secret societies, an underground postal service, and the mysterious organization known as Tristero. But is her fantasy reality? Or vice versa? As always in Pynchon's California, there's no shortage of binge drinking, casual sex, or wild parties, and a good time will be had by all readers who enjoy a good dose of chaos now and then. The ending will disappoint some, but since there are no easy answers, surely this conclusion makes more sense than any mere pat ending could."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Having read all of the reviews on the list, I am struck by the fact everyone who read it was moved deeply for better or for worse. I think that this book may make more sense initally for those of us who grew up in the sixties but I think that it transcends even that culture to bring even to the nineties a relevance that transcends those years. He takes a &quot;quest&quot; story to a new level and does not give you the usual Aristotelian resolution in the ending. But that's what makes it so attractive to read. He give a woman the leading role and she learns to speak for herself within a system that is obviously trying to subjugate women (the drug experiment she refuses to participate in). She begins to resist the patriarchal system that is implicit within the books text and exemplified by her ex-boyfriend Pierce Inverarity. Pynchon also speaks out against capitalism and monopolies etc. through the situations he place Oedipa in. His use of sign and language to convey meaning without text is amazing; Oedipa, &quot;Mucho&quot; Maas and Dr. Hilarius are prime examples of names that implicate stereotypes or explode them without further explanation of them. The dead are often more alive in this book than the living are and you begin to question what &quot;truth&quot; really is. It is a hard read if you're doing it &quot;just for fun&quot; but if you want to think about what you are reading enjoy the rollercoaster ride that &quot;Lot 49&quot; is. It is provocative, funny, poignant and full of wonderful symbolism that keeps you thinking and rethinking your place in this universe"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Conspiracy buffs, look no further than &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; -- a book that indulges in paranoia so much, you almost expect to see your own name mentioned somewhere in the text. There is an incredible amount of narrative inventiveness on every page, employing a wild concoction of dry humor, non sequiturs, bizarre characters with puns for names, and an endless barrage of references to a wide variety of pop culture, science, and technology. This is the first novel I've read that has introduced the concept of entropy as a narrative device.The protagonist is a woman named Oedipa Maas who, when the novel begins, learns that her former boyfriend, the wealthy Pierce Inverarity, has died and designated her to be the executor of his enormous estate. Inverarity's assets include vast stretches of property, a significant stamp collection, and many shares in an aerospace corporation called Yoyodyne. As Oedipa goes through her late boyfriend's will, aided by a lawyer named Metzger who works for Inverarity's law firm, she learns about a series of secret societies and strange groups of people involved in a sort of renegade postal system called Tristero. She starts seeing ubiquitous cryptic diagrams of a simple horn, a symbol with a seemingly infinite number of meanings. Every clue she uncovers about Tristero and the horn leads haphazardly to another, like a brainstorm, or a free association of ideas.This is a novel that demands analysis but defies explanation. My initial interpretation was that it's an anarchistic satire of the military-industrial-government complex, but it's deeper than that. Like Vladimir Nabokov's &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; it establishes a very complicated relationship between the author and the reader, where Pynchon seems to be tricking the reader in the same way that Oedipa is unsure if she is witnessing a worldwide conspiracy or if she is merely the victim of an elaborate prank. By presenting Oedipa's investigation to be either circular, aimless, or inconsequential, the novel seems to satirize the efforts of people who try to find order in the universe. Pynchon uses the concept of entropy to illustrate that the more effort (physical and mental) we put into controlling the universe, the more random it becomes."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"For no particular reason, I've avoided reading Pynchon novels but finally decided to take the plunge with this book. I was not disappointed.I thought it was great. Really great, actually. His writing style strikes me as very similar to a number of his contemporaries (Robert Stone, DeLillo, etc.). The central riddle of the book and the mixing of obscure historical fact and fiction reminded me strongly of authors like Borges.With regard to some of the negative reviews below I would say the following:1. I consider myself a pretty typical reader and I did not find this to be a particularly challenging book to read, although Pynchon's style (punctuation-sparse and prone to occasional lapses into heavy factual detail) takes some getting used to.2. This is not a &quot;neat&quot; story in the conventional sense. There isn't a tidy conclusion to the story and there isn't a &quot;typical&quot; character development arc. But so what? I don't think either of those things are a necessary requirement to good fiction.The deliberately silly-sounding character names should be the first clue that Pynchon does not intend this to be a conventional work of fiction. It isn't. But that doesn't mean it's not a great book.The book is clever, well-written, and confounding with its plot twists and turns. That's what made it a fascinating read and that's also what makes it the kind of book that I think I could read over and over again and not get bored. I think I'll always find something new that I didn't see before.Isn't that what makes a book enjoyable to read in the first place?"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Okay it's not his best novel (that'd be Gravity's Rainbow) and it's not his worst novel (that'd be Vineland, which is still darn good, actually) but it is his shortest novel, so if you could say one definite thing about it, that might be it. The length is actually a good thing because is an easy book to hook people on Pynchon by giving them something short and say &quot;Hey look he's great!&quot;. Because this is classic Pynchon, as good as anything he's ever done, a great big step forward from V. In these one hundred and eighty pages he manages to cram more prose and ideas and paranoia (because it wouldn't be a Pynchon book otherwise) than most authors can do in twice the space. Simply put, it's a fun book, and for all the trappings of &quot;post-modernism&quot; you can easily enjoy this book without camping out in your local library near the reference section if you just take everything on faith and read it. The story concerns Ms Oedipa Maas, who is executing the will of her late boyfriend and stumbles upon (she thinks) a conspiracy involving either the US Postal System, the Mob and just about everything else, a conspiracy that might stretch back hundreds of years. Or it might not. Pynchon proceeds then to play with Ms. Maas and the reader for the rest of the novel, throwing out obscure fact after obscure fact, toying with her perception of things (are things just happening randonly or is there a guiding force behind them?) and basically having a crackling good time doing so. His prose still consists of long winding sentences with a bit too much detail (it's a postmodern trademark to describe every single item on a desk at least once during the story) at times but the jokes are still funny thirty years later, the story is still good and frankly if you look past the fact that the story doesn't have a neat and pat ending then you'll probably enjoy this very much. Some folks find Pynchon too silly at times, but I think taking anything too seriously is bad and especially literature, where there's so much potential for humor. This is a good example of how you can write a serious, timeless piece of literature and still have the ability to make folks outloud. Remember, Joyce liked fart jokes. Keep that in mind."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"The Crying of Lot 49 is an amazingly rich and complex work, especially when you consider its slim, novella-like size. Thomas Pynchon is widely recognized as among the most brilliant of postwar writers, and this is the perfect introduction to his work. It has the themes, the multitude of characters, and the diverse interests of Pynchon's more sprawling tomes, but its size makes it more manageable.Which is not to say that it is a breeze--in fact, I'm sure I missed things in my first reading that will become more clear the second or third time around. The plot itself is quite complicated, and when you consider the book's brevity, the cast of characters can seem almost Tolstoyan (they tend to walk on and disappear later in an endless stream). Also, Pynchon makes good use of some richly gothic prose equal to anything by the deadly serious Faulkner or Cormac McCarthy--but we can rarely be sure if we should take Pynchon's prose at face value.The first thing you'll probably notice here is the sheer humor. Just the names of the characters make me laugh: Oedipa and \\"Mucho\\" Maas, Dr. Hilarius, \\"Bloody\\" Chiclitz, Arnold Snarb. And as usual with Pynchon, you can count on a generous helping of hilarous, sometimes awful, songs. Try the corporate ditties from the Yoyodyne Aerospace company. This book had me practically rolling on the floor again and again.The story centers on Oedipa Maas, the very likeable young woman saddled with the unfortunate task of executing the estate of Pierce Inverarity, her former lover. As she attempts to get his affairs in order, she becomes increasingly entangled in what may or may not be a worldwide conspiracy called the Tristero (also spelled Trystero). This conspiracy evidently began as a sort of terrorist group opposed to the mail-carrying family Thurn und Taxis, who really did have a monopoly of postal services in Europe for many decades. Thurn und Taxis are represented by the symbol of a post-horn, so Tristero chose a muted post-horn as its sign.All this is meticulously researched by Pynchon, who's interests and reading experience seems to be endless. We get accurate information here about entropy and the perpetual-motion concept of Maxwell's Demon, the Thurn und Taxis family, Elizabethan Drama--too much to list here. Speaking of Elizabethan drama, Pynchon also includes the best parody of a revenge play ever written.There is much more than knockabout humor here. The dreamlike night scene in San Francisco, when Oedipa keeps seeing the muted post horn again and again, is richly evocative, the scene in which Oedipa comforts the old man in his apartment is surprisingly touching, and near the end Pynchon gives us some eloquent philosophizing, but without interrupting the novel's flow. These scenes stick in the mind as much as the hilarous comedy parts with Metzger, the rock band The Paranoids, and the ex-Nazi psychiatrist Dr. Hilarius.I wouldn't ever give away the ending, but be forewarned that it is enigmatic. If you want Dickensian wrap-up, don't touch this with a 30-foot pole. But it's not just the ending that's open: critics tend to agree that one of the major characteristics of Lot 49 is interpretive openness throughout--almost any event can be read in more than one way. Most salient is the question (raised by Pynchon himself) of whether the Tristero is real, a practical joke, or just in Oedipa's mind. This uncertainty is what fuels the claustrophobic paranoia in the book--a Pynchon trademark.Other things are left unclear as well. For instance, what does Pierce Inverarity have to do with the plot? The Tristero seems inextricably tied in with him, and his last name, as at least one critic has pointed out, seems to suggest untruth. Pynchon leaves open the possiblity that the Tristero is simply the posthumous masterpiece of the jokester Inverarity. Another possiblity, mentioned by Harold Bloom, (though he doesn't agree with it) is that \\"lot 49\\" is related to 49 days after Passover--in other words, Pentecost is just around the corner. Pentecostalism is mentioned by one of the characters in the parodistic play, so we have yet another interpretation on our hands.I'm pretty certain Pynchon intends for us to be mystified by all this, and that he doesn't know himself whether the Tristero is real or \\"what happens\\" after the end of the book. Extrapolating this mystification to the whole universe is an easy step to take, and clearly embodies Postmodern thought-- a system which has essentially given up the search for truth and assumes that, though many hypotheses can be proposed, the universe is ultimately inscrutable. Though I disagree with Pynchon's conclusions, they are very well-written conclusions. I couldn't accept the philosophical secion near the end, but I enjoyed reading it. I also enjoyed the ending very much after I got over its bizarreness, and it's strangely effective, even infuriatingly delightful.I'm annoyed by the fact that books are never reviewed for content the way movies are, so I'll briefly mention that here. This book is pretty much fine for high schoolers, with hardly any language and just a bit of sex--about one page. It's refreshing to see a living writer give us an effective book without the gratuitous vulgarity which characterizes so much modern literature.In short, if you're looking for a piece of fiction a cut above the fluff which comprises 99% of current publications, read The Crying of Lot 49, and don't let the gothic prose daunt you. It'll have you in stitches, and make you think hard about some philosophical questions too."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Thankfully brief, this surreal satire may have been fresh and irreverent some 35 years ago when it was first published, but today it reads as a hyperstylized game of literary three card monte. The book is ostensibly about a woman who has been made executor of a rich former lover's estate, and her attempt to unravel the meaning of an ambiguous set of clues left behind. What this allows is for Pynchon to whisk her into and out of a number of wacky hi-jinks and meetings with post-beatnik weirdoes in an attempt to satirize both humankind's quest for knowledge and meaning, and post 1950s America. This is accomplished with a prose style that is going to either delight or dismay most readers with it's silly wordplay (especially in character names) and grab-bag referencing of physics, Greek tragedies, postal history, drug culture, and much more. I personally found the language tiresome, grating, and insubstantial-like too many Hollywood blockbusters of today, Pynchon is so busy throwing carefully constructed pyrotechnics at the reader that he never provides anything to care about."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Thomas Pynchon - The Crying of Lot 49It says something about Thomas Pynchon that \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\", by all reports a straightforward book, is, by Pynchonian standards, an oddity. For a writer who has built a reputation on constructing labyrinthine tomes that endlessly branch off for pages and pages until the reader wearily abandons any attempt at deciphering a plot, \\"Lot 49\\" is, well, linear. By far the most accessible of Pynchon's works \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is also probably his most concentrated. So short that it is often referred to as novella, \\"Lot 49\\" manages to get at Pynchon's BIG IDEAS and even contain some of his delightfully controlled chaos.It is the story of Oedipa Maas, summoned to California's San Narcisco to fulfill a duty to left her by some shady inheritance, namely to oversee the execution of a rather large estate left by the newly deceased Pierce Inverarity. Immediately Oedipa finds herself overwhelmed by the size and complexity of Inverarity's estate, and hopelessly imagines that she will never get Inverarity's affairs straightneed out. No sooner does she lose hope than Oedipa meets an odd man who seems to have some ideas to help her. As the two look into the estate, coincidence after coincidence piles up until Oedipa finds herself enmeshed in what may or may not be a global conspiracy where almost every person, place and thing she meets up with can, given enough time, be plausibly fit.The central question to this story, does the conspiracy exist or is Oedipa making it all up, is a metaphor which Pynchon pursues over many divergent paths, each leading to a different idea. On one level, Oedipa's quest is a microcosm of each of our own lives: using the available information she (an we) creates a story about the way things really are and continually tests and refines it. That Oedipa finds substantial clues in the oddest and most coincidental places is part of the mystery: is it really that life is so capricious that random encounters can have profound impacts, or is life much more banal, leaving Oedipa to simply imagine connections amidst a sea of information?On another level, Pynchon uses Opedipa's quest to get at the concept of entropy. Pynchon likes to apply terms and ideas from the realm of physics to psychological and sociological phenomena, and his invocation of entropy may be the most famous instance of this. Just as in a closed system individual particles will tend toward greater disorder so in Pynchon's universe do the people and information in our society tend toward entropy. Fighting against this decay is Oedipa, who tries to create some order out of the randomness that she encounters. Again we are met with a similar question, do Oedipa's actions counter entropy and point toward some transcendent truth or is she simply fighting an impossible battle and unable to create order in the world?Once you've accepted that these questions are valid there's nothing to do but follow Pynchon's ideas to their inevitable conclusion: in \\"Lot 49\\" there is no truth other than that which we create. In a sense, all of the characters are like Oedipa; although they aren't questing to ferret out a conspiracy, they are attempting to fit everything they come across into some kind of rational framework. And so do we. Cause and effect only exists insofar as we pick out one certain moment to be the cause and once certain moment to be the effect (even though we could have picked out any two points on the chain of causation), things only become important once we say they are. Each of us is at the center of our own self-ordered universe.But how do we know that the universe is really ours? Every day we are bombarded by thousands of stimuli outside of our control, each of which seeks to order our life for us. Does Oedipa see the conspiracy as she wants to or as the system wants her to? It is here, where Pynchon examines the limits of freedom in modern life that he makes his most substantial points.Clearly, despite \\"Lot 49\\"s brevity, there is a lot at stake, and in its own way this fact makes the book appealing. Lacking the heft of Pynchon's tomes (notably V. and Gravity's Rainbow) \\"Lot 49\\" is pure, distilled Pynchon. This means that if you read \\"Lot 49\\" you don't exactly get the Pynchon experience, but you also don't have to wade through miles and miles of intricate, yet beautiful, prose to see what Pynchon is trying to say. As such, think of \\"Lot 49\\" as an introduction. If you like what you see, then acquire another Pynchon book and read on. If you don't like it, then perhaps Pynchon isn't your flavor."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"For God's sake--- why do so many people write these idiotic reviews, these reviews that are nothing so much as confessions of stupidity? Why do people believe that the primary aim of all art, even that of fictive prose, is absolute simplistic clarity? These are the same chuckleheads who fail to understand impressionism and cubism; they are the people who fail to recognize that distortions of photographic reality (or the use of abstract, metaphor-laden prose with poetic, rather than simple reportorial, qualities) are attempts to reveal a hidden truth or an occult sensation, something intangible lurking beneath the surface of the hubbub that constitutes our everyday lives. &quot;Guernica&quot; strives to convey the absolute chaos and horror of war, something of the mental distortion endured by those unlucky enough to fight; &quot;The Scream&quot; tries to convey the sense of terror that resides the very nature of being, a sense only perceived by the introspective and the sensitive; and &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; dissects the effects of sixties culture, and its cultural precedents, on the bare skeleton of America. It uses metaphor to make sense of the welter of confused action that is American life (read: it does not strive to obfuscate it). None of these masterworks fail simply because they refuse to be obvious. There is a place for the realism of Michelangelo and the journalistic minimalism of Hemingway, but artistic expression should not, is not, and cannot be confined to those styles that lend themselves to easiest comprehension. Some art reaches for wispier, more difficult ideas, and demands that we, the readers and viewers, make the effort required to understand.Reading is like weightlifting. It is a skill. It requires repetition and practice. One must read incessantly and carefully to become a good practitioner of the art.One should not skip anything, not so much as a single ambiguous phrase, not so much as a single word that falls outside one's vernacular. One should strive to ascertain the primary meaning of every word of a given text and as many secondary meanings as possible as well. And one must never expect that educated and erudite and soulful being, that being that John Milton called a &quot;master spirit&quot;--- the writer--- to dumb his prose down for easy consumption by dim-witted orangutans. Thomas Pynchon is not to blame for the fact that you know nothing of history, culture, literature, and so forth. Yet people blame him, and Shakespeare and Dante and Baudrillard and everyone else, rather than themselves and their TV-addled ignorance. For shame! There is more at stake here than the dignity of great writers themselves; there is more at stake here than the possibility that Thomas Pynchon might have to endure reading one of these asinine reviews and wind up asking himself, &quot;Am I just throwing pearls before swine?&quot; No, the matter is graver than that: potential readers are also victims. They read some numbskull's pronunciamento that Pynchon's book is a &quot;great idea&quot; with--- I can barely repeat it--- &quot;flawed prose&quot; (all the while writing in a terrible prose style himself, this astute reader, employing that stilted language of imbecility that everyone can easily understand), and think to themselves, &quot;Humph. I guess it's not so good.&quot; And then these misled readers will buy John Grisham instead, whose work the fans of facile clarity and structural simplicity have awarded numerous five-star reviews. Literacy in America is limping toward death. The confederacy of dunces is on the verge of conquering the last bastions of a proud intellectual tradition. Wake up, America.

Confused but curious, she travels to San Narciso to carry out her duties. She soon begins to suspect she has stumbled upon a conspiracy - a vast, perhaps global-historical conspiracy that involves Inverarity, his lawyers, the employees of the Yoyodyne Corporation, and maybe even her husband and therapist. Haunted by a sense of impending revelation, Oedipa tries to penetrate the enigma, descending into an underworld of broken, lonely souls, cynical playwrights and mysterious booksellers; a shadowy \\"alternate America\\" where coincidences accumulate suspiciously and the postal system takes on a sinister cast. Is it coincidence or conspiracy? Or a giant hoax orchestrated by Inverarity for his posthumous amusement? As the mystery deepens, Oedipa edges perilously close to paranoia... Pynchon's slim volume has the density of a planet. This is the kind of book you will read several times in your life, and still won't exhaust its possibilities. On the most basic level, it can be read as an intellectual thriller. The narrative is consistent, the plot moves along rapidly, and the point of view remains stable. But a reading confined to this surface level does it little justice. Even forty years after publication it's still considered open to interpretation: some critics feel it is ultimately meaningless and impossible to interpret, while others have found it cohesive, and even ethically motivated. (One essay I've read even takes a \\"scientific\\" approach to the plot, finding secret meaning in the novel's probing of entropy, thermodynamics and information theory.) All, however, agree that this is a vital work and a postmodern classic. The book's description of signs that appear everywhere suggests two opposite poles that are equally terrifying: everything happens according to some grand system or conspiracy from which we are tantalizingly excluded, or everything happens out of pure chance. That's the semiotic nightmare Oedipa falls into, and it's the one we live in, too. If you like novels that challenge and stimulate your intellect rather than merely entertain, then this one's for you.

Pynchon's style is dense and you'll find yourself reading sentences two or three times before you can make out the grammar.The story reads like a mystery, but this plot is only a cover for the philosophy Pynchon is proposing. Once you find the philosophy, though, a second and third read will reveal that the story of Oedipa and even the structure of the book are examples of that philosophy.

The story is about a woman who becomes executor of an ex-boyfriend's will and becomes involved in an increasingly malicious/strange exploration into an underground postal service originally from Europe, the use of bones as profit, the mental breakdown of her psychiatrist (a classic sequence), and a Shakespeare parody that may house the secrets to it all. OR: none of it may be real, and it might all be a practical joke on the part of the deceased.The point, then, is not the conclusion but rather the definition.

Was Pynchon poking fun at Americans' obsessive love for all things American in creating the town of San Narcisus? Was he satirising the then budding boom in American's seeking psychotherapy by creating an ex Nazi psychotherapist called Dr Hilarius? Pynchon manages to ask lots of questions but provide few answers and that may be his point but for me I would prefer something more tangible. This book reminded me of a painting which was entirely black apart from in the centre a small white question mark. Clever but not greatly appetising for the viewer. The absurd character names might mean something to Pynchon but Mike Fallopian registers no nuances for me and I would have preferred if he called Oedipa, Electra."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Pynchon is an author you either love or hate. I love him, but I also understand why many people don't: one has to have a taste for absurdist humor and obscure references to really appreciate his work.If you're new to Pynchon, start with The Crying of Lot 49. It's mercifully brief (152 pages), genuinely funny, and has quite a few neat concepts in it.Although it's often unclear what's \\"really\\" going on, this is deliberate -- the main character herself is unsure if she has stumbled upon an a grand, surreal conspiracy, or an elaborate practical joke. The more she (and the reader) learn, the murkier things become, and there are no easy answers here. That alone should tell you if this book is for you.Based on the complaints of the 1-star reviews, it's obvious that some people prefer black and white facts spoon-fed to them. I don't doubt that they found Lot 49 confusing and inaccessible. Like I said, Pynchon isn't for everyone -- and that's fine. However, if you're willing to invest the effort, it's most rewarding.

So let me just say that this work is absolutely wonderful, and is one of those few works that really reaches out and grabs you in the gut -- one thinks, if but for a moment, that despite his apparent absence one has really made contact with Pynchon...or at least with a fellow presence amongst the noise, and that together it might be safe to tempt or, better yet, pursue fate (even if only for 180 pages) .Also, this book is soooo much more than merely a Pynchonesque statement about America in the 50's and early 60's (though it is certainly also that and in the most briliant way imaginable): the book plays with the big themes..too big and amorphous to get right here, right now...but you know, don't you? If you have ever thought that you might just be making out against the sensual din about you the Word, momentarily finding some order amongst the oh-so-entertaining flickering of everything about you, only to feel the butterflies in your stomach signaling and guiding you towards 'safer' ground which may not in fact feel so safe or sensible, then you have already met with the Tristero...or perhaps, they have met with you...or, just maybe, you're nuts!"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is the kind of book I imagine I would write were I inclined to that profession: 1)short; 2) playfully literate (oh, I'm literate, baby!); 3) obscure, as if I'm writing to myself and don't give a toss what you think; and 4) not really about anything, since I have nothing to say!That fourth reason there is why I don't try my hand at writing. You heard me right: I have no wisdom, no insights, nothing coherent to say about life, the human condition, or the human heart. Knowing this, I have the grace to not even attempt to enter the contest.But I guess Pynchon didn't scruple. I mean, Oedipa Mass's chasing down the enigmatic Trystero organization -- what does it amount to? What does it tell us about ourselves? Or the world?When I compare this with even one of Dickens's lesser outings, I conclude that Pynchon is using an abstruse style to smokescreen the fact that, when you get right down to it, he has nothing to say about \\"the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,\\" in the words of another difficult writer -- though one whose problematic narrative style holds rich rewards for those patient enough to negotiate it."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"~ - ~ - ~I'm pretending you know nothing about this book or the author for the sake of this review.~ - ~ - ~.....Firstly, Thomas Pyncheon is clearly a genius, and is a very powerful writer.Too bad it is almost always nearly impossible to figure out what the heck he is saying, or even worse, what the characters in his novels are doing.(And what continent are they on now?).He can make a metaphor that sends shivers down my spine about the \\"dt\\" in an equation describing a rocket's trajectory.

There is a fine line between Gnostic revelation and the leap into insanity. The central issue of this little book---the moment just prior to Gnosis---gets tied up in a morass of puns, satire, smartass language and sophomore humor. A lot of the themes of &quot;49&quot; reappear in &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;, in much greater detail and with much greater emotional impact . Part of my infatuation with this novella comes from living all my life in California, mostly on the coast, in places like South Central and Berkeley. The places he describes, sometimes hidden by pun ridden psudonymns, are all familiar haunts. But most of my attraction to &quot;Lot 49&quot; comes from being haunted as Oedipa Maas was haunted, wondering if those connections she encountered---between a need for an alternate communication network... ...anybody remember &quot;underground&quot; radio?... ...and the need to supress the moment of ultimate revelation... ...anybody remember &quot;Eve of Destruction?... ...well... ...I guess that I've walked in Oedipa's shoes more than once. Pynchon has an altogether remarkable ability to express ulitmate paranoia. &quot;49&quot; is not as well written as &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;, not as fun as &quot;Vineland&quot;, not as &quot;Literary&quot; as &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, but well worth investigating if you are drawn to that territory. &quot;49&quot; is an occult book that stays occult."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"It is very likely that to get the most out of THE CRYING OF LOT 49 one should read it through more than once or twice. This is true of many of the best novels, but Pynchon's 1965 hit would have to be more compelling on the first read to warrant further examination. There's a lot going on in this short novel, but not much to care about, despite the mystery of the \\"Tristero,\\" a band of secret and ancient European marauders that exist to destroy private postal routes (do you think they had anything to do with that UPS strike a couple of years back?). Our heroine is Oedipa Maas, but she betrays no indication of swollen feet or patricidal tendencies. She and her ancient royal namesake do, however, share the same flaw of HAVING to know the truth, however much damage it does to them. Oedipa at least gets to keep her eyes, for all the good they do her. See--just keep peeling back the layers and there might be something grand to this book after all.Oedipa is launched on the Tristero mystero by the last will and testament of her ex-boyfriend (Pierce Inverarity--dust off your old Latin primers) which names her co-executrix. This requires a trip to \\"San Narciso\\"--cute, especially when one of the first things she does there is break a looking glass. And we're off and flying around the room like the aerosol can that shatters the mirror. Pynchon likes to have fun with character names, too (I kept picturing Oedipa's husband Mucho Maas as Roberto Duran--not fair to the author as Sugar Ray Leonard must still have been in high school when this book was written): Dr. Hilarius, Genghis Cohen, Mike Fallopian, all pretty rich. So we know we're dealing with something on a different plane, or, considering the amount of LSD and Jack Daniels in the book, a different trip.I'm all for stylized prose, and Pynchon is certainly no slouch at turning a phrase--but the overall effect seems more obfuscatory than revealing of much insight into human nature or the early-sixties California lifestyle. His characters are acid-paper cut-outs and the plot left me not as interested as I wanted to be by the end. The parts of THE CRYING OF LOT 49 are greater than the whole, but perhaps that's the point."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I don't think anyone can read this book only once and decide whether they like it or not.

I thought, &quot;hey, this won't be so bad, I can talk about female empowerment, some weird underground post that tries to deny America any more power than it already has, and paranoia&quot;, but when I tried, there was no way. If you have time, I would recommend reading this thing twice right away, and then putting it away for a while (while you research all the references Pynchon makes to all manner of things), and THEN reading it again.Someone once asked Pynchon why he didn't write stuff so it was easier to understand, and he replied with something like, &quot;why should I make it easy to understand?

His satire and allusions are less obscure, in my opinion, in The Crying ... than they are in, say, &quot;Vineland.&quot;I would advise, however, that if you are not knowledgeable in grammatical theory, history, social theory, chemical use or agreeing on the exact melancholy state of Modern Man and of the human condition in general with most of the writers from the late nineteenth century (those contemptuous luddites), that you do not read this book, most of the satire in this book will slide over your head; and you will find a novel full of disconnected ravings, comma splices, fragments and a general discombobulated literary sense.However, I'm sure you will find the characters interesting.This book, I would like to add, can serve, as well as Kasey's, as an example of the new consiousness."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I am afraid I finally have to use this cliche statement: This is really the worst book I have ever read. I wonder why I have even finished reading it. Probably because I wanted to find out what all the Pynchon-hype is about, or because I just expected that the book would take a turn for the better.Some say that if something is hyped, then it is probably bad. Reading Pynchon has taught me that there is some truth to that. To compare this book or draw an analogy to Ulysses is not only wrong, but also an insult to one of the greatest writers ever.The book is about a woman who might have or might not have uncovered a conspiracy. In other words, it is about a woman who tries to find meaning in something which probably does not have any. Well, that is certainly reminiscent of Kafka or Beckett. Only that Kafka or Beckett open new doors leading into a different direction on every page, add layer after layer, and truly disturb the reader. In Pynchon, there are no multiple layers. He only scraches the surface without ever adding any depths to his ideas.\\"Crying of Lot 49\\" is for readers who are very amused about names like Fallopian or Genghis Khan, and think that an idea like the \\"Maxwell Devil\\" is incredibly creative. It is for readers who try to seek for qualities in a book which has none. It is fast-food existentialism for the masses and a total waste of paper.There are so many good books out there.

Thomas Pynchon is one of those. If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche. Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature. It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling. I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless. The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it. He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading. My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century. The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.

I did not find it enjoyable because I did not really understand it - and I do not think I was supposed to. There were a couple of funny bits - the characters' names are humourous; Oedipa Mass, Mike Fallopian, Genghis Cohen - and it is well written, but it is a head trip; it is phantasmagorical, like a David Lynch screenplay buffed up and amended by conspiracy theory nutters like Jesse Ventura. But it is literary; I will concede that.The \\"plot\\" revolves around Oedipa Mass, a housewife from the Bay Area who uncovers, or so we think, or maybe, or who knows?, an international conspiracy involving a clandestine underground postal system. The book is characterized by odd characters, esoteric symbols, and eccentric snippets of dialogue, but it is, in my opinion, weird for weird's sake. Not that it needs my stamp of approval. Pynchon is legendary, more so because he does not and has not made public appearances.I enjoy comic novels - I like Kurt Vonnegut, for instance - so I thought I would like this book more. It is certainly interesting; I just did not find it pleasurable. If you are wondering whether you ought to read it, you may as well.

His gutsy and self-reliant heroine, Oedipa Maas (more about Pynchon's fabulously funny names later) is named executor of the far-flung estate of an ex-boyfriend. Pierce Inverarity had his fingers in pies of all sorts, including a possible shadow group fighting the monopoly of the US Mail system over mail delivery. The struggle to control the mail dates back centuries (it really does: Pynchon is not making this part up) and the Trystero conspirators are gearing up for an overthrow, offering clandestine methods of getting mail around. Or are they? That's where the paranoia comes in.As Oedipa finds out more and more about seemingly unrelated (but are they?) subjects such as the history of postal subversion (including the philatelical dimensions of forged stamps bearing small, incongruous details in black), and the bones of GIs left at a the bottom of a lake in Italy during World War II and then brought back to the United States to serve as interest for scuba divers in a lake built and outfitted by Inverarity, and the history and performance of Jacobean revenge plays (including one play considered so pornographic and destabilizing that the Vatican keeps it locked up in its library -- another paranoid conspiracy waiting to be written) and resurgent Nazism in San Francisco (not so paranoid, after all), we are as drawn into the twisted story of Inverarity's schemes as she is, and left with the same question: has he created the whole paranoid conspiracy to punish Oedipa or is it a real conspiracy that he was a part of or are all the concurrent acts and facts just coincidences? And if you cannot understand a thing I wrote in this paragraph, don't blame me: read the book.The book was written over forty-four years ago and yet it not dated. The California he writes about is perhaps a bit more innocent and open-spaced than now, but the groundwork for the future is being laid in spiraling real estate developments, spreading smog, and disconnected persons seeking connection, even if it is only the most paranoid grasping for a connection that does not exist.However, there is a noted difference in The Crying of Lot 49 in the 1965 perspective on the Holocaust and World War II, and in today's. In 1965 many survivors and perpetrators of the holocaust were still alive, and WWII was the war people still talked about as a participatory event. It was not an academic discussion of genocide and war, and Pynchon makes the war and the genocide horrible and immediately relevant to his characters. In a way, the characters are seeking to distance themselves from that history, and aligning themselves with an even older history of the struggle against repression while at the same time flying on the balloon of the sixties, trying to get high and find themselves and get laid.I loved how Pynchon uses the 1960s backdrop for his naming of the characters. Pynchon is a timely and sophomoric (but still funny) version of Dickens with his Oedipa Maas (sometimes called \\"Oed\\" and sometimes just \\"Edna\\"), married to Mucho Maas; we also meet Manni Di Presso, Dr. Hilarius (a Freudian shrink), Stanley Koteks, Mike Fallopian, Genghis Cohen (who calls Oedipa \\"Miz Maas\\"), and so on and so on. Pynchon uses silly humor, slapstick, and sly inversions of reality to hold the readers' attention and it all works. The plot of The Crying of Lot 49 is crazy but Oedipa holds it all together, works out all the kinks and twists for me, and makes me a believer.Our Oedipa is an honest and serious girl (she does have some fun in a very funny scene of undressing layers upon layers); she is also an optimist and as dogged as a pit bull. By the end of the book, she accepts paranoia as a necessary state. And she is right, after all. Better to question and wonder, than to be complacent and therefore, unwittingly compliant in the conspiracy. What conspiracy?

Oedipa runs about attempting to decipher clues in her friend's will - something characterized as hieroglyphics in this novel on numerous occasions. The hieroglyphical messages appear to be more within the text - the reader is required to unveil or decipher the clues Pynchon delivers to the reader as the events in this book are laden with symbolism.This book can be read on many levels. But, its true meaning was to be read at the level which would be best characterized as that of a university English class. You can ignore the symbols, but that would defray from the jewels delivered throughout this novel. Read it slowly. Read it thoroughly.

Just as in life, the answers are not always apparent. Involving the machinations of an underground postal system, W.A.S.T.E., the main character Oedipa Maas, searches for the links between her, the postal system, an industry mogul, among other things.

There are many allusions in this work that you probably weren't aware of (I sure wasn't) that make the mystery of the book all the more intriguing. Though it is Pynchon's shortest novel, &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; packs enough paranoia into its pages to fill a thousand page epic.

Her lover was Pierce Inverarity who ran Yoyodyne Corporation in San Narciso. He psychiatrist is Dr. Hilarious. You get the idea - there are funny names in this story. Oepida is made the executor of Pierce's estate. Diligently, in this romance, satire, antidetective novel, she tries to find out the extent of her duties and the extent of the estate. Along the way, things go from simple to complex, ordered to disordered, concrete to abstract, just the opposite of the usual novel, and she becomes enmeshed in either a worldwide conspiracy called Trystero or enmeshed in her imagining of a worldwide conspiracy called Trystero, and organization, if it exists, dedicated to alternative culture and government derived from the Thurn and Taxis Postal system started in 1577 in Holland. Oepida's quest reminds me of the Faerie Queene charmed from her human virtues while searching for self-knowledge. Her sensitivity to external events and the hidden meanings in the nature of things (are they really there, those meanings?) reminds me of Emily's sensitivity to external things in The Mysteries of Udolpho. But her and Pynchon's language reminds me of nothing I have ever seen: It is an original blend of erudition, and slang with scintillations, multiple meanings, cross references, parody, outlandish puns, pawky black humor -- all of which is steadily and intelligently directed and reflects an extraordinary writing talent. The characters are everywhere plugged in elsewhere, so Oepida can't connect with anyone except perhaps her two lovers and then only tentatively: one leaves her for a teenager; the other kills himself. The plot is driven by concepts in physics including the second law of thermodynamics and Maxwell's demon as well as by the idea that information theory equations reduce to entropy equations. Indeed the theme is that the world's entropic decline is evidences by its capacity for bureaucracy, atomic war, and domestic violence, all of which can be prevented by an increase in meaningful human communications. I like that idea and I like the comic ribbings of California manners and pop culture gone to rock and ruin. This novel stands with The Great Gatsby in concise attempt to capture dangerous exaltations in the closed entropic system known to us as America and in so doing reasserts the wonder that can animate the novel."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"There are two kinds of people who like Thomas Pynchon, the way there are two different kinds of people who like chocolate: those who *like* Thomas Pynchon, and will froth endlessly at the mouth telling you exactly how great a writer he is, how Gravity's Rainbow, V, and the like are THE greatest novels of the post-war era, how reading him simply forces you to think about life, America, and so on, in a whole new way, how vitally important all this is, etc. Other people, as the saying goes, would just as soon have some fruit. I used to fit in the third category: those who simply didn't see the fascination.I can't exactly tell you why I bought Gravity's Rainbow, but I can remember it was one of the biggest literary media blitzes of the early 70's: my copy has the full die-cut, gold-toned treatment of a Major Bantam Release.

Were there similar systems using the same name elsewhere, here and in Europe? Were they all the same organization? Is the Tristero system responsible for murders and assassinations? Is this all just a joke? Who knows? The case can equally be made that Oedipa Maas is a) uncovering a secret organization, b) being led around by friends and employees of her recently deceased (maybe) ex-boyfriend, c) slowly going insane, or d) simply a victim of odd circumstances. In this story, Pynchon's gift for writing songs and poetry help to flesh out the general versimilitude: if you listen closely, you can hear the music the acid punk band plays, the speeches of &quot;The Courier's Tragedy&quot;, and the dramatic soundtrack to &quot;Cashiered&quot;. Written just before &quot;the counterculture&quot; went from being unrelated-except-by-age political activists, rock &amp; rollers, and psychological researchers to a unified coalition of radicals, Oedipa Maas is neither a pawn of the military-industrial complex nor is she a stereotyped hippie-manque. She's simply a nice Californian housewife whose husband works for the local AM radio station and whose old boyfriend wanted her to sell off his stamp collection after he died, and whose subsequent adventures led her into very murky (and skeleton-infested) waters indeed. My belief is that he wrote this book, got a lot of praise for its &quot;literary&quot; qualities, and then decided to concentrate on those instead of on writing good, readable stories.To me, one of the most interesting things about the novel are the very real-seeming glimpses of the transistor era in Silicon Valley -- the egalitarian camraderie, the way that ingenuity and intelligence is rewarded just as much on the loading dock as in the boardroom. In real life, a few years later some people very much like them decided to use computers to set up an alternative means of communication between large military and research facilities that, for a long time, operated very much like Tristero. You're using it now."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I read this book at least 14 years ago, and now seek it as a source for discussing bureacracy reform in an historical manner. I have referred to this text while discussing constructivist learning theory, as well. The remnants I hold onto, in my old age, are that Pynchon humorously demonstrated the human penchant for seeking patterns as explanations. It is post-modern only because it explains one downside of scientific rationalism. I continue to hold onto it, in my small sphere, as a book that brought me some understanding of dynamic cultures interfacing with other dynamic cultures."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Profoundly disturbing, if only for its impenetrability. This strikes me as acid jazz for the literary set--angelically resonant prose that surrounds some &quot;deeper meaning&quot; like a cage. The reader can see, but never grasp, the glittering, captured daemon of meaning beneath. I'd recommend this only to readers willing to wade through much maddening obscurity to claim a higher ground."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"If author Thomas Pynchon lives a guarded life far from media scrutiny, never explaining himself or sharing interviews, then it should come as no surprise that his books do very much the same. The Crying of Lot 49 never tries to explain itself. This makes it, understandably, a frustrating read--until we begin to approach it on its own terms. This is a novel about meaning and how we find it in our world (particularly the radicalized 1960s world where this book originates from). Therefore, the structure of the novel and its anti-denouement tell us much about how this book understands meaning. This is not always comfortable. More on that later.TCoL49 centers around a housewife protagonist, Oedipa Maas, who while acting as an executrix to an ex-boyfriend's estate discovers a potential underground postal system that directly and subversively competes with the official government postal system in what may be a conspiracy of grand proportions happening all around her. Yes, you read that right. This book employs dry humor, ambiguous meaning, chuckling sarcasm, insinuating character names, a play within a play, winding sentences, parody, and rich, dense language.Pynchon does not fit nicely into any mold we have come to expect from a novelist. I am convinced that a great deal of our frustration with Pynchon stems from us uprooting him from that uncomfortable soil where he exists and non-indigenously trying to re-plant him in our own tame gardens. TCoL49 captures a 1960s America that is living in the midst of \\"storm systems of group suffering and need.\\" This is a world that is struggling with meaning amidst assassinations, the Cold War, nihilism, student demonstrations, and the civil rights battle.In the middle of this social, philosophical, and religious turmoil, Oedipa Maas is positioned as a protagonist who searches after meaning. The result of this search is not some cheap, superficial nihilism, a world devoid of meaning. No, what is born from this book is a complicated relationship with meaning in our world, and what lies beneath. A pivotal scene has Oedipa looking into the contents of a transistor radio, and she is mesmorized upon finding the circuit board. \\"Though she knew even less about radios than about southern Californians, there were to both outward patterns a hieroglyphic sense of concealed meaning, of an intent to communicate. There had seemed no limit to what the printed circuit could have told her if she had tried to find out.\\"Pynchon does not want to nullify meaning. He wants us to ponder and consider the circuit board of this world. This world has a \\"concealed meaning, of an intent to communicate.\\" Will we be able to discern its \\"heiroglyphics\\"?This book's greatest achievement is that it has coordinated such density within but 200 pages. Like all great literature, there is a world to be discovered in these pages, and it will tell us much about our own. If most novels wade through knee-deep waters, this book is ocean deep in a world of non-swimmers. Most of all, though, this book is fun!If you choose to read this book, spend time with it. Don't just consume it. Think it over.

It might help to bring this book into focus. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the author was in a similar state when he wrote it.I'm not sure how much I can tell you about the plot. We start off with Oedipa Maas, a young suburban California housewife, who finds out that she's been named executor of her ex-boyfriend's estate. While diligently attending to the estate (not to mention attending to her co-executor), she stumbles upon a symbol scrawled on a bathroom wall with a reference to something called \\"WASTE\\". Oedipa develops an obsession with the symbol which seems to pop up with increasing frequency the more she pursues its meaning. Her adventures lead her from person to person, each character more bizarre than the last, and from unbelievable situation to impossible event.This book is maddeningly impossible to get your head around. Nothing ever quite makes sense, but there's always something tantalizing just around the bend. Maybe if you read a few more pages it will start to make sense. But the further you go on, the less sense it makes, but yet the more we feel we might just get rewarded if we read a little further.We follow Oedipa's descent into conspiracy madness through a long-winded description of a five-act Jacobean revenge play, an encounter with a truly mad scientist, an all-night ramble through the seamy side of San Francisco, the intricacies of stamp collecting, and epic accounts of the obscurest points of the history of mail delivery (although, how much, if at all, that \\"history\\" resembles reality is more than I can say).At one point in her obsession, Oedipa looks at the possibilities. Either she's stumbled into one of the most elaborate conspiracies in the history of the world, or she's been set up by her late ex-boyfriend in some sort of elaborate hoax, or else she's mentally ill. We sense all along that the author is playing with Oedipa, poking fun at her and her frail human ability to grasp and comprehend. But then we realize that he's poking fun at us too. And at life itself and all of our grand and serious searching for The Meaning of Life.The characters are mostly quite unsympathetic and unengaging. Mostly that's because they don't stick around long enough for us to get to know them. But even the main character, Miz Maas, doesn't arouse our sympathy. That's because none of the characters are actual human beings; they are mere symbols in Pynchon's game of life. Our clue is in their corny, punny names: \\"Mucho\\" Maas, Genghis Cohen, you get the picture.The book is not meant to be taken as a literal story any more than \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is. Both are satires. But unlike \\"Gulliver's Travels\\", it is unclear who or what is being satirized in \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\". Some things are obvious, like America's post-war cookie-cutter suburban blight and the empty lives that accompany such blight. But it's more than that, though what the \\"more\\" is, is always just out of reach.Although this is a very slim volume, it's not easy reading. Pynchon's wordy prose can at times go on for pages without completing a single paragraph. It is almost always difficult to follow exactly what's happening and to keep the characters straight. Nonetheless, I recommend this book as an introduction to Thomas Pynchon largely because it is so short. Judging by the reviews, Pynchon has a devoted following and a number of critics. This book is perfect for discovering which you are. For myself, I'm not quite sure yet. I ended up liking the book in spite of myself, but I don't really think it will stick with me. Some ambiguous books leave me puzzling over them for weeks or months to come, but I don't think this will be one of them."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"What does a reader encounter in a Thomas Pynchon novel? Well, there's an offering of mock, but real-sounding, science and history; an assortment of cartoonish characters who, nonetheless, face moving existential questions and emotional issues; wonderful flights of the intellect that are both larky and profound; amazing writing featuring both strange associations and great insight; and a playful voice examining a troubled world of serendipitous connections. In the fast-moving THE CRYING OF LOT 49, a reader encounters all of these Pynchonesque elements, this time used by the Pynch to tell the story of young Oedipa Mass as she tries to determine whether Tristero, an alternate mail system appealing to society's outcasts and Ayn Rand-thinking engineers, is a rich man's hoax or a real service with deadly methods.In TCoL49, Pynchon moves Oedipa through what is basically a fascinating and highly imaginative mystery set in California in the 1960s. This mystery concludes brilliantly in the novel's final chapter, where the crying of lot 49 (they're a selection of stamps at an auction) occurs. But along the way, there are many highpoints, which for me include: a performance of \\"The Courier's Tragedy\\", a hilarious parody of a Jacobean revenge play; the amusing Hollywood-like conjecture of the academic Emory Bortz; Oedipa's wandering and disturbing encounters with the muted horn; and the elusive metaphor of Maxwell's Demon, a perpetual motion machine that operates, in theory, like a philosophical system developed by the Scurvhamites, who have historical connection to Tristero.This is actually my second reading of TCoL49 and my second time through my paperback edition, which has a March 1972 printing date ($.95). Since my copy has yellowed pages and a dry spine, I thought: Why not download a copy to my Kindle? That way, I can have a fresh copy but preserve space on my crowded bookshelves. But nope: TCoL49 is not available on Kindle. Harper (or whoever), please fix.TCoL49 is a truly enjoyable book with a voice that is funny and still completely fresh. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"... did Pynchon deliberately leave out the line, or more precisely, the line segment that connects the circle with the triangle? Taken together, the three geometric elements (or is it four, to lapse into a Pynchonian mindset, or is that progress into...) form a muted horn, and is the symbol for Tristero, the alternate mail system that has been in competition, for centuries, with the establishment systems of Thurn and Taxis, of the Holy Roman Empire, through Wells Fargo, and the U. S. Postal system.This is Thomas Pynchon's second novel, written in 1966. It is a thin work, perhaps a \\"pot-boiler\\" to keep him going, written between his first, and my favorite work, \\"V,\\" in 1963, and his magnum opus, \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" written in 1973. I've read them all, each not that long after publication, and decided it is time to re-visit them. Not even 150 pages, it is immensely rich, in the Pynchon style, combining obscure historical events, unlikely chance happenings, fragments of scientific history/theories, sexual romps, puns and song lyrics, always the more than a hint of \\"the orbiting ecstasy of true paranoia,\\" the fear of the other, the teasing of conspiracy theories, and a character in quest of the truth(s). It is his most \\"accessible work,\\" and therefore recommended to the first-time Pynchon reader.The central character is Oedipa Maas, who had once been a mistress of the immensely rich Pierce Inverarity, and now has been named as executor of his estate. In the process, she repeatedly encounters signs and clues to the Tristero Empire. But is it all an elaborate hoax, she wonders, towards the end of the book? Pynchon is brilliant, and weaves actual historical events, and his complete fabrications, seamlessly. Where does the reality end, and the fantasy begin? For example, he includes the real events of submarines trying to circumvent the steel curtain dropped in the Dardanelles during World War I with the fictional account of a fight between Confederate boats and the Russian navy during the American Civil War, which gave rise to the Peter Pinguid Society, a spoof on the John Birch Society. He weaves \\"Maxwell's Demon\\" into his novel, like perhaps no one else has; the hypothetical intellectual construction of James Clerk Maxwell, the physicist who formulated the laws of Thermodynamics. Caprice and whimsy are a constant in a Pynchon novel, a Plank's constant if you will, consider: \\"If miracles were....intrusions into this world from another, a kiss of cosmic pool balls...\\" Later he draws parallels between the DT's of an alcoholic, and the dt's of calculus. He postulates that the entire French revolution may have been caused by the Tristero, so that it could issue the Proclamation of the 9th Frimaire, An III, ratifying the end of the Thurn and Taxis postal monopoly in France and the Lowlands.Amidst such caprice, he embeds some wonderful zingers. Concerning a possible postal misprint from the US government, Maas's lawyer, Metzger says: \\"So they make misprints...let them. As long as they're careful about not pressing the wrong button, you know?\\" Or on the true need for the Tristero: \\"...onto a network by which X number of Americans are truly communicating whilst reserving their lies, recitations of routine, arid betrayals of spiritual poverty, for the official government delivery system...\\"The second time around, and the years of accumulated knowledge, plus Google, make Pynchon even more enjoyable, though the speculation of how much you \\"get\\" the author is still probably no higher than an 80%. Most readers seem to either love or hate him; I understand the demurs of the later, but I am clearly in the former.Meanwhile, Maas hopes for one more clue as she awaits the crying of lot 49; although not Pynchon's best, it still deserves the full 5-stars."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"For those who want to read Pynchon but don't want to go near V or Gravity's Rainbow this is the one for you... It is very accessable and has a lot of the craziness that is characteristic of Pynchon's other works. His genius is there on every page, and although he substitutes aesthetics from time to time (there will be moments when you will wonder 'where exactly did the setting go?' or 'this character really doesn't need to be here, isn't that obvious?') in order to wow you with the sheer power of his brain, it is still a great book. There are so many humorous scenes in this book, especially with Dr Hilarius, that it is worth it to read it just for them. But beware there is a lot going on beneath the surface here, and even if you're a highly intelligent person, you will still be scratching your head from time to time. I located an online study guide and followed after each chapters and it enhanced my enjoyment of this slim but heavy book."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"At a slim 150 pages, this novella works as a good, and indicative, introduction to Pynchon. Perhaps it is far more impressive, formally, than his other longer novels (Gravity's Rainbow, V., Mason &amp; Dixon, Vineland), all of which are between 500-800 pages, except for the latter, simply because he manages to weave the same intricacy and texture at a fraction of his usual length.Enter the journey of Oedipa Maas, who follows the trail backwards in time of her dead husband. Is somebody following her? Or is she the one who is following? Pieces start fitting together, slowly- the etching of a muted horn on a bathroom stall, old stamps with spelling errors, a man-made lake with an interesting bottom, characters in a play with a little bit too much information- all this and much, much more.Pynchon's novels are about 'information', regardless of how historical, accurate, absurd, erronous, redundant, symbolic, inconsistent, incomprehensible they are, or seem. Most authors create an objective autonomous system of values, characters, and logic within their novels. Pynchon trangresses these conservative formalisms- his writing is so distant and awkward, yet so humane and flesh-like. He is like no other writer. He stuffed an epic into a novella, about a woman who found out what was happening to her all along, in the end."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"For everyone out there who quakes at the thought of starting Gravity's Rainbow, this book is the best jumping off point to enter the Pynchon universe.But more than that, this book is a marvelous tale, compactly told. In it you can see the germs of much of what would become dominant themes in Pynchon's later works (such as an interest in the channels through which information pass and the people who run them). Yes, this isn't his first novel, and it's by far not his most well known -- but in my opinion, it provides the most satisfying read, without the feeling of being overwhelmed by the immensity of Gravity's Rainbow or some of the missteps that seemed to plague V. and Vineland.Find yourself a rainy Sunday, curl up in your favorite chair, and read this. It's an overlooked treasure."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Pynchon seems to rub many readers here the wrong way, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. 'Lot 49' makes us reconsider what a novel is capable of - it helps push some of the limits of a genre that has become banal so often nowadays.Pynchon's book overflows with a mixture of references to science and pop culture, and manages to weave them into all a wonderful fabric that wraps around Oedipa's search for the truth and order in her world. Conspiracy and intimation are central threads in the fabric, and the connection between ideas as disparate as Maxwell's Demon and a gay bar in California lead us to wonder what all the bits and pieces of our lives might add up to (if anything).If you're interested in a standard novel that does not ask you to consider anything more than a few plot turns, then perhaps 'Lot 49' would not be the best book for you. But if you'd like to be taken on a ride to places that other books might not have taken you before, by all means pick up Pynchon's witty and intelligent take on 20th century America - and hold on tight..."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Thomas Pynchon presents an anarchic, exhilerating glimpse into a life opening itself to observation and thus paranoia. Executing an eccentric's will, the main character discovers a secret postal service conducting its own deliveries and possessing its own history.

It's truly brilliant and quite funny!One thing that struck me as I read the reviews is all the Grisham bashing. I'll admit I have never read any Grisham and I've read plenty of Pynchon. But I can assure you that the aims of the two are distinct and they cannot be judged by the same criteria.There are books that are intended to amuse and divert and there are books that are intended to engage and challenge. If you read to be entertained only, Pynchon (or Barth, Delillo, Roth, Barthelme, Gaddis, etc.) are not for you.Not to say that there is no pleasure to be found here. Pynchon's books can be quite entertaining, but that's not what they are written for. Stay away from Pynchon if you aren't prepared to be challenged as a reader. The Crying of Lot 49 is not a book that provides the reader with an obvious &quot;message&quot; or &quot;meaning.&quot; You will get out of it what you are willing to put in. Expect frustration and annoyance. Of course, understanding is an effort, but as most of the reviews here will tell you the effort is worth the reward."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Kind of like &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; was, except goofy somewhat on purpose"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Each word, each sentence, each image was chosen for a reason.

It was torture to read because this book made no sense at all and reminded me of the stuff they publish in the New Yorker or Harpers magazines and call poetry. This book is like the trash television shows they call &quot;hits&quot; and annually give awards. Most folks will go along and pretend this book has something to offer but for me this emperor has no clothes. Long, never ending descriptions of insignificant trivia dominated the text.At the end I felt the real conspiracy might be Pynchon's book itself because people believe this is a good book. When we challenge conventional thought we are isolated and made to feel uncomfortable. A student might risk appearing ignorant if they admitted to the class and their teacher that they did not understand Pynchon's book. That is why everyone goes along and agrees with authorities whatever the issue. Depending on your place in history, the earth is the center of the universe, James Earl Ray shot Martin Luther King, and Pynchon is a great writer because the experts said it is so.No more Pynchon gift books please and I guess that makes me a &quot;conspiracy nut.&quot;"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"COL 49 is a good warmup for V. no doubt, but while touted as being more 'accessible' than either V. or Gravity's Rainbow, is more like a notebook or sketchbook for those books.There are many clever metaphors floating in this Sargasso Sea, but Pynchon will never be a master of character. Not all novels are about human character but those which are not seem to suffer from the problems the aforenamed Sargasso does; still, shallow and crowded with flotsam.Perhaps Pynchon is the greatest American novelist of our time; maybe Jeff Koons is the 'greatest' American artist of our time; maybe our deepest sentiments and hopes have been invested in our cars.

It was a fairly challenging read, yes, and it had a few redeeming ideas.

The types of people who tell me that I don't like this book because I possess not the lofty intellect to appreciate it, are the same types who tell me I am racist for not liking &quot;The Invisible Man,&quot; or I am sexist for not enjoying Sylvia Plath in general. As the &quot;Great Writers Are Not to Blame for Your Lack of Education,&quot; guy stated that he feared complaints that some novels are too challenging would lead to &quot;The Dumbing Down of America,&quot; I fear the uglier problem at hand is the inability of a person to state his/her opinion without being assailed as some sort of saboteur to a school of theory or line of thinking."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"People seem to be responding to other comments, so I have some. I am near ending the book, so far it is interesting, unfortunatley, much of the symbolism has gone over my head. I understand the basic ideas, perhaps I am over thinking the novel, but after reading these other reviews which have been inflated with big words and little content, I am not certain that I am on the same plane of intellect as some of my fellow readers. What I will say, trying to get though the intellectual snottiness exhibited here by readers who dare not insult Pynchon ( a human- flawed as his writing certainly is, too), is that this book is interesting on a surface level even if all of the symbolism is ignored, just follow the thoughts the writing gives about the world, as you read it, you must be aware, but you must follow your own instinctual ideas concerning content. That is where this book is a grand success- it is interesting enough to keep attention focused, well written to allow thought, deep to allow much interpretation. Don't be dissuaded by other reviews; get what you can from the book...there is so much to get, all will be rewarded. For example,I found a theme present in the book to deal with the projecting of worlds and perceptions of worlds ( the tower comparison and the theatre director's speech , as well as Pierce's influence from his own projection). Before I go, a final comment: Though Pynchon's writing is spectacular (such as near page 100 where he describes all those she sees with the mute horn sign), reading Grisham does not mark a degenerating society, rather intellectual ecstasy, found from sniffing too many musty volumes another intellectual ( working in a system that is fed by Grisham readers) told one to read, marks a social degeneration that is based on a reluctance to admit equality, freedom of ideas, and the notion that reading of any type is good... some may not be fortunate enough to only enjoy high literature, but I never heard any Grisham reader claiming to be reading Fitzgerald, they know what they enjoy, and they know its place."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I must disagree with the reviewers that found \\"Crying of Lot 49\\" unreadable. It's as easy to read as the back of a cereal box (and just as edifying - perhaps less so). I can imagine the author giggling as he came up with the silly character names, surely delightful to anyone under the age of twelve - or Pynchon's fans in academe. The professor in whose class I first read this novel made an issue of the names' implications: \\"Oedipa\\" is significant because it is the female form of \\"Oedipus;\\" her nickname, \\"Oed,\\" is pronounced like a man's name (\\"Ed\\"); \\"O.E.D.\\" stands for \\"Oxford English Dictionary,\\" significant in that the O.E.D. has lots of different words in it, I guess. The book provides endless opportunities for this sort of meaningless theorizing. The names are about all the characters have to distinguish them - they are so lacking in depth as to make Cap'n Crunch look like Captain Ahab in comparison. The nonexistent plot consists of nothing more than a string of pointless incidents that could just as well be read in reverse order with no loss of meaning.Pynchon concludes the novel with the unforgiveable sin of failing to write the final chapter. If he meant that the mysterious bidder's identity is both everyone and no one, he succeeded - it doesn't matter who it is. If the author doesn't care, why should we?"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"The ideas contained in this book are as good as you can get. There are symbols and symbols of symbols, metaphors of metaphors. It also contains whacky characters, weird situations, and ancient conspiracies. In all, a fun mix.Too bad the writing is flawed. The problem is twofold. First off, when Pynchon tries to be deep he can become unreadable. Luckily I understood (at least I think I understood) what he was getting at without these verbal misfires. Second, Pynchon can cut a little too close to the bone in his prose. He cuts away vital cues in his dialogues and descriptions in an attempt to sound modern.I still recommend this book. However, be forwarned: This will not be easy reading, and it won't be your fault."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This book makes me think of Warhol's famous painting of soup cans. While it may be cute and clever to be sharing a private joke with your readers by naming characters things like Fallopian or Kotecks, and you may be intelligent and a technically capable writer, this does not mean the story, plot, or characters are involving or worth reading about. Don't get me wrong, I have absolutely nothing against modernity or abstract art or literature. I do however feel that a writer has to do more than just be clever to write a great book. While I actively seek out a wide variety of world literature with a very offbeat slant, the deciding factor always comes down to whether the plot and characters are moving and involving. This is what makes literature the closest thing I have to the sacred in life. I feel like I have been befrauded when someone like Pynchon dresses up some otherwise poorly drawn soup-can characters in funny names and thinks that that is a substitute for good writing. It makes me understand how Christians must feel seeing a cross in a box of urine passed off as art.The Emporor is NOT wearing new clothes, he is just a naked deluded fool walking through town."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Sure, some people like some books and some like others, but anyone who claims that this book is simply unreadable or that you can appreciate it only on some high literary plain has cheese for brains.This book is totally readable and extremely entertaining.

While i will agree with other readers that this isn't Pynchon's best book it is still a great read and takes you places that you will want to re-visit periodically. Although ostensibly revolving around the heroine Oedipa Maas' attempts to probate the will of a former lover, The Crying of Lot 49 sweeps us up and down the west coast of a U.S. that is visibly coming apart at the seams. From a San Francisco where folks are \\"lookin' for a Good Time\\" to a southern California that is caught in a hollow booming suburbia and rising defense industry (Pynchon enthusiasts will immediately recognize Yoyodyne, an organization that also manages to drift into film in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai)we get a rare glimpse back into a time when just about anything seemed not only possible but likely. The Tristero network can be looked at as an odd but wonderful foreshadow of the Internet, and all too much else that at the time seemed Pynchon's fantasy has now come to pass. Unlike some other reviewers I regularly laughed myself sick -although at times it is a sick laughter. Conspiracy enthusiasts will be delighted to find that not only are They out to Get them, but They have been around much longer than you thought. Did it happen? was the whole thing a practical joke? read it & see. In the meantime, We STILL Await Silent Tristero's Empire."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Whether you enjoy this book or hate every last pretentious minute of it, understand it or are puzzled by it's calculated circular logic, whether you lightly skim it or read all the endless sholarly notes on it, this book will make you think.

Its not a jolting weird or an uncomfortable weird, rather a soothing, almost psychedelic weird that places you softly on the couch and let things roll over your brain. At first read thats what it will do, roll over your brain while you try to put the pieces together. For a large portion of it, the oddities of the characters and bizarre humor took me by surprise and in delight of what may happen next. At one point I am on the edge of my seat and other moments I am reclined not sure if want to find out. The few bits which ring out presently are some of the humerous touches that Thomas Pynchon creates. Its like a subtle stylized humor (yet realistice in one manner), and one I have not come across in any other book; a scene that can be so vivid in my mind, yet the writing simultaneously elusive and seemingly vague. I am happy to mention and conclude that the title of the book is well explained in such a way that I found it profound. I picked up this book because of a suggestion by R.A. Wilson, which seemed intriguing, and also the length was more tangible than his milestone Gravity's Rainbow. I figure this might be a good book to start before I embark on such a mission to determine if I even want to tackle it. Nonetheless, the Crying Lot of 49 remains an enigma in my mind that is something that deserves to be read again to clear up the fuzzy spots. Reccomended for those curious about Pynchon without the weight of pages to sweat over. Also reccomended to those who are interested in conspiracy theories and the like."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"If you've always heard the term postmodern and wondered what it meant this book is for you. But, let me warn you, this book is definately not for everyone, the plot is unique to say the least, and the characters are not what you will find in most novels, but then again, neither is the intellectual stimulation. In little over 100 pages, Thomas Pynchon has written an accessibly managable introduction to postmodern literature. Although this book is rather dense, and is filled with obscure facts and information from seemingly every conceivable specialty of knowledge, it is an enjoyable way to aquaint oneself with one of the most misunderstood genres of modern literature. Just be sure to keep a dictionary, encyclopedia and sourcebook to anarchism handy. The plot revolves around the exciting and often bizarre experiences and wanderings of Oedipa Maas, as she embarks upon a surrealistic journey into the unfamiliar techno-industrial pop culture wasteland of San Narcisco and surrounding counties, after being named executor of an ex-lovers will. In her madcap adventures she uncovers a bizzaire world where everything that she has ever learned crumbles in the face of absurdity and falls into question. It is a world where nazi doctors, secret societies, papal misdeeds, anarchist dreamers, narcicistic ex-child stars, and deranged outcasts all come out of the shadows to invade the &quot;typical&quot; suburban landscape of an average American housewife. This book is concerned with uncovering the realities, or lack thereof, that most people would want to stay hidden, or at the least forgotton. It is about questioning the assumptions that we all hold dear, even if it means coming to terms with a world that is without meaning, without order, and most of all without a coherent design. This is a novel with many questions to be answered, so if you welcome intellectual challenge and desire obscure knowledge this book will certainly not dissappoint. And if you don't quite understand it read it again..."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is a short, clever, easy-to-read book. Very clever! Maybe too clever!

It's full of what Pynchon does best, and it's short enough not to be a chore to read.P.S.(...)"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"Thomas Pynchon is perhaps the most complex contemporary American author. He is a complete recluse, and his novels brim with more obscure popular culture, scientific theories, conspiracy theories, and classical allusions that just about anyone else. I recently took another look at my old copy of this novel, after critic Harold Bloom selected it as one of the best novels of the century.This is not a &quot;tight&quot; novel. There are a lot of loose ends, and the conclusion is puropsely vague so as to encourage the reader to devise his own ending. Without giving away too much, the novel concerns Oedipa Mass, a woman whose world is shaken by her discovery that she has been chosen as executor of her ex-boyfriend's will. This sets her on a mini-odysset through California trying to discover the reason why she is at the center of a plot much bigger than her ex-boyfriend's will. It is a fascinating novel.The reason this novel gets four stars and not five is simply because, at the end of the novel, I always feel as if there's something I've missed, as if Chapter five fell out of Pynchon's manuscript before he handed it to his publisher. Perhaps that's just an aspect of his post-modern mysteriousness. Despite this, this is a novel I re-read. That is, perhaps, the best recommendation a person can give a novel . . ."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"It was such a chaotic book that it only produces nonsense.

Good, but not great.I \\"get\\" the book, and I sympathize with those on both sides; read any of the reviews here and you'll see how extremely polarizing this book (and, indeed, Pynchon, in general) is.As another reviewer said: it is interesting but not compelling. Paranoia for paranoia's sake. The ending was fitting, and I don't fault that. It has its moments as well as some genuinely funny passages. But the characters are forgettable. A lot of it is forgettable. It's one of those books where it's more satisfying to describe the plot than it is to actually read the book. In all, there may be about five memorable passages in the whole story.I'm glad I read it and, perhaps, I may read it again to give it another chance. I found that it was a hard book to hate, and easy to like--or, rather, easy to *want* to like.

At least he tried."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"The Crying Of Lot 49 is one of the most strikingly brilliant masterpieces in literary history. Its length (less than 200 pages) and economy of language belie the maze-like complexity of its plot, as well as Pynchon's literary virtuosity. It's a relentless puzzle, an engrossing mixture of comedy, tragedy, mystery, and post-modern fable. It's satirical and ominous, hilarious and menacing, spacious and paranoid, decadent and moralistic, simultaneously as exciting and unpredictable as a well-drawn piece of escapist fiction and strangely philosophical. Its mixture of accessibility and complexity is what makes it such a masterpiece- the novel draws readers in with its quirky opening scenes, developing multiple unique and instantly memorable characters before the first chapter is even over, before hurling its protagonist (and the audience) headlong into a mystery whose implications are both fascinating and nerve-wracking. From there, the story becomes a strange, haunting tale of rebellion, isolation, and paranoia, while simultaneously maintaining its sense of humor, widening its cast of fascinating characters, and hurling a few satirical darts at the ins and outs of modern life. Somehow, the story never loses its focus, as each of its elements feeds off of the others, creating a dense and deliciously cubist tale of insanity and curiosity, ultimately building towards a quietly cathartic climax and a strangely satisfying ending. Genius!"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"To say this book is odd would be an understatement. It almost feels like it induces paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions all at once. I can't say I really enjoyed reading it -- with the exception of the first chapter, which was quite fun -- but I did appreciate it. I found Pynchon's sense of humor very entertaining -- my particular favorite character name being Genghis Cohen -- but the plot became so convoluted that I just kind of gave up trying to figure it out. I think that was sort of the point, though: giving up on \\"reality\\" and just accepting the absurdity and uncertainty. In the 1960s when this was written, I have no doubt his style was novel and groundbreaking. Now, it just seems to be a case of \\"been there, done that.\\" I appreciate the satire, but think its message is still eluding me. Maybe it will come to me down the line, perhaps through that nebulous, conspiratorial entity Pynchon attempts to expose: The Postal Service!"},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; taps directly into the root of &quot;banal&quot; literature that was seemingly omnipresent throughout the '60's.

But read it anyway just to see what the fuss is all about.This is a classic of postmodern disjointedness, brimming with Pynchonian playfulness, recurring themes, jokes-within-a-jokes, literary allusions, the poetry of mathematics, and everything else you could want in a nice quick under-200pg read.The text is pretty dense, but then again, see Gravity's Rainbow if you want to see something really dense. I suggest starting over every time you get really confused -- it certainly took me a few start-overs to truly appreciate this novel.Highly recommended if you like inventiveness, or novels that are more &quot;writerly&quot; than &quot;readerly&quot; -- that give the reader most of the burden of creating meaning."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"This is a good book. While short, it is dense reading, but not in a bad way. You read it close &amp; the words envelope you like a sweet smelling smoke. It pricks &amp; nags @ you beneath your scalp &amp; inside your heart. Some of the prose leaves me behind, but Pynchon has delivered so often w/in this group that you can't help but think that perhaps you missed. Subsequent reading do deepen the appreciation. The Courier's Tragedy portion reads like a lot of those opera summaries on public radio, the scholarly articles seem scholarly...in short, he is definitely depicting our world &amp; our ways of depicting it, but he is also throwing the whole thing off kilter which I suppose makes sense in a work that is supposed to unsettle you &amp; force you from a passive understanding/reading of it."},{"Title":"The crying of lot 49","review":"I find it difficult to believe that people found the prose of this book to be unreadable. This book is fast reading, I finished it the same day I bought it. Of course, my first Pynchon novel was Gravity's Rainbow. I could understand somebody not liking Gravity's Rainbow even though I loved it, because that book is a lot more challenging. But not liking The Crying of Lot 49, which was written straightforwardly with a single plotline, is beyond my comprehension."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"How Children LearnBy John Holt5 starsHolt didn't have children of his own, and his first opinions of children and learning came from being a schoolteacher in an elite private school, where he taught math to 5th graders. He was exposed to younger children and babies who were friends and relatives, and began forming different opinions about learning, which he shares in this book. Holt is fascinated by the notion that children accomplish so much before formal schooling begins and realizes that the way school is set up goes directly in opposition to what is natural and has worked for these children up to the point they are sent off to school.The beginning of the book covers the age ranges from birth up through age 3 to 5, that is, before children go to school. Holt talks about a certain type of important learning that takes place up until the time a child enrolls in school at which point the experience of schooling changes their personality. The book starts off with how children succeed in learning many important things and huge feats such as speaking and with proper grammar and pronunciation and walking without formal schooling and that children accomplish much learning without an adult being the facilitator of it. In general the style of writing is that Holt describes a situation and then gives his opinions of the learning experience. Sometimes Holt does little experiments such as introducing a toy or a non-toy (such as a typewriter) to young children to see how they react to it and what they do with it. Holt observes with delight and amazement, these young children who are friends and relatives (they are not his students or participants in a research projects). It is clear that Holt enjoys these young children and he respects them and relishes the time he spends with them.This revised edition makes clear which text is original then what was added-which is new perspective as he had spent more time around children and his theories matured and changed a bit. Seeing the two perspectives clearly was very interesting and educational.Regarding the discussions about babies and toddlers there are good observations here and I appreciate them. As a stay at home parent, I have already witnessed much of this (and more) and for some of the chapters I felt I wasn't learning anything I hadn't already witnessed with my own two eyes. However, readers who are childless will definitely learn much about how learning happens from infancy and up. I highly recommend that anyone interested in going into the profession of teaching read this book, or any current teacher who is childless. Holt gives the children much-deserved respect for their innate ability to learn and figure out the world around them.Later chapters get more analytical as Holt integrates his own observation of schooled children (about grade 5 and below) and compares and contrasts with other educators, scientists and child psychologists. (It doesn't seem to me that Holt is analyzing preteens or teenagers.) Here is where Holt exercises his ability to write clearly and concisely drive home his point in a convincing manner.Again and again Holt shows how a child to is forced to \\"learn\\" things (such as in public and most private schools) is actually having their personality changed in the process. The act of being forced to do things and to prove oneself over and over via testing and not being trusted by adults changes their personality. Holt feels the schooling procedures have negative consequences on all children; albeit some children are more negatively affected than others. The child can develop anxiety, mistrust, and fear of all adults not to mention self-esteem problems or just killing their curiosity or interest in learning.Great quotes from other books on education and learning are included here with Holt's reactions. A short list of books on school reform is included. The summary alone is almost worth the price of the book.For more specific information about what goes on in school and how children learn to play the school game and how forced teaching is not always effective, read Holt's \\"How Children Fail\\".This would make a great gift for expectant parents, I feel it would point out to them that babies deserve a lot of respect for being able to figure out the world around them. This notion of being in awe of and respectful of children starting at birth is seldom written about...so many of us were under the misguided notion that an adult must be the one to force learning onto babies and children (me included until I birthed my babies and saw firsthand how smart they are)."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"I discovered &quot;How Children Learn&quot; when my own children were already on their way to their teens. I wish I'd had it when they were born, or soon after. John Holt opens our eyes to the absolutely astonishing efficiency with which pre-school children learn so many things. And he does it without any of the language of &quot;educationese,&quot; the gobbledygook that so often clutters books about educational issues and makes them opaque and unpleasant tasks to read. Everything he says is immediate, concrete, and down to earth, drawn from specific observations of particular children, working effectively to learn whatever interests them. This is a book that I regularly now give as a gift to my friends when they become parents for the first time. I know of no other that will fill THEM with wonder over the ensuing five years or so, as their children learn to come to grips with the world."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"The only thing that disappointed about this book was learning that the author is deceased, so I couldn't tell him how moved and inspired I was. I was the converted, already strongly leaning towards homeschooling when the time comes, but this book gave me insights that have changed how I interract with my 10 month old daughter, to my own great joy. How refreshing to read the words of a man unafraid to admit his errors and his regrets. His compassion also moved me, sometimes to tears. This book is be a validation for any one who needs one, of the choice to homeschool. It is an eye-opening inspiration for a parent seeking greater understanding of their toddler. This book, and the &quot;companion volume&quot;, &quot;How Children Fail&quot;, should be required reading for education legislators, and given out with diaper packets in maternity wards. If you have a first edition, get the latest one with Holt's further thoughts and self-critiquing updated commentary."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"There must be a thousand books out in the world for parents right now. How to do this or that with your baby/toddler/child, OR How to get your baby/toddler/child to do this or that. From pregnancy through college there is a guide for every problem, or perceived problem, that you may possibly have.How Children Learn, though, is not a guide. It is simply a demonstration, through the journal of John Holt, that children are smart and know how to learn, from the moment they are born. He shows that by giving children the space and freedom they need to explore things that interest them, we allow them to develop thinking skills. We allow them to figure the world out, learn that things work in certain ways, and that the world is generally a predictable and benevolent place. Holt shows through his experiences that not only do we not need to force children to learn, or to teach them much, but that teaching (and especially coersion) are counterproductive to learning.It would be impossible to explain in a short space the thinking behind How Children Learn. By sharing his experiences, Holt shows us about children, not educational philosophies or theories. Get this book and read it. It will change the way that you think about children and learning forever."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"If I had read this book in college I would have saved myself so much agony in learning about children.After I read this book: I started to learn about children.

Holt's premise is a simple one, that learning is a natural process that needs very little adult guidance or interference to take place. It's certainly time to reconsider how our schools function."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"Anyone who works with children or is interested in education and psychology will enjoy John's interesting ideas. Most of this book is anecdotes about John's experience with different young children and his thoughts about how children learn in different areas that are based on those experiences."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"I love John Holt's books. This one I think I read about 10times. It's full of love for children and intellectualcuriosity. It contains very stimulating thought about learning,about curiosity, andabout what really happens to children in school. Ifnothing else, it gave me unsightful perspective tomy own early years in school."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"John Holt doesn't just write about the shortcoming of school among impoverished children. Through his experiences as a teacher in a prestigious school, teaching children of the well-heeled, he amasses plenty of examples of how even the \\"best\\" schools fall short of meeting every child's natural love of learning. If many regard this book as a classic, it is perhaps because it is one of the first to effectively cut through the haze of studies, programs, theories and other abstractions to focus on the Child, who is after all, a Person; unique and whole. He implores us to see, to listen, to truly get to know that little person in our care.The most thoughtful educators recognize that children are all different, one from the other; that to enumerate a set of conditions, materials, and activities defeats the purpose of celebrating and respecting each child as their own person. So you'll not find detailed lists of \\"dos\\" and \\"don'ts.\\" He asks instead for an open mind; a mind alert to the changing needs and the boundless curiosity of the child. The point is not to stifle, not to suppress, but to foster the child's love of learning by recognizing when it is best to get out of the way.On the whole, \\"How Children Learn\\" is an excellent book that reflects upon one aspect of what should constitute a healthy approach toward education and a child's well-being. Whether one homeschools or sends their children to school, the family life more than life outside it (at school or elsewhere) plays a larger part in raising and shaping a child than most people might realize. This, of course, is beyond the scope of the book, but should be part of one's reading. One place to start is Susan Macaulay's \\"For the Children's Sake.\\""},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"I read this book a few months back. I had heard about this book for years. I think that the version I read was an earlier print from the 70's. Anyway I was somewhat disappointed in the book however Mr. Holt comes across as a very good educator regarding a child's behavior. The disappointment comes from the fact that the majority of the book is behavioral \\"examples\\" (real life - day after day situations in the life of a specific child or children) which I find O.K. had they been limited. The book has very little real analysis of children or peoples behavior. Instead it focuses on putting the reader in the life of a real child on a day to day basis with different tests or situations. Then you the reader can form your own opinion as to why they have acted they way they did. I could have used more analysis with the examples. Having said that - if the book had been titled \\"Examples of Child Behavior\\" or \\"A Day in the Life of a Child\\" then the book would have been appropriately titled. As it is, it is mistitled."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"This book is so true. If you're looking for guidance on how to begin to teach your children this is the place to start.

I would check out his other books as well so you can get a good perspective on his real life philosophy and save our children from a dumbed down world. We need facilitate an environment for our children to think and be who they were created to be. Our family would never go back to any other way!"},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"Many books on psychology or learning become dated very quickly with new advances in knowledge; this book is not one of them. From what I picked up in this book and in &#34;How Children Fail&#34;, the author John Holt was a teacher who took a year to observe children and how they learn, from close observation at home and in school.The key premises. What he found is that the way children learn is wildly different from how we (as adults in charge of their learning) believe it works. He found that children start out keen for knowledge and learning, and learn by constantly sifting through the chaos for threads, and then they test different theories about how things work. They learn through tactile experience, through patient experimentation, they want to know and to understand, and often show far more advanced capabilities than they are given credit for. However, the way schools are set up does not align with how they learn, and often stifles the wonder and joy for learning, in favor of shame, anxiety, pleasing people in authority, and learning how to cheat (on purpose or through interpreting nonverbal clues given by teachers/parents) and game the system.This book focuses much more on the wonder and joy of learning (How Children Fail focuses more on the school part), and is really inspirational, and the reader can gain some really good practical tips about how to deal with children. The book is set up as almost a journal - at first Holt records his observations, without all that much interpretation, and then he starts analyzing. It's a really natural way for us as readers in turn to learn, and his conclusions then have the impact of &#34;yes this is it!&#34; because we walked the path along with him, and &#34;saw&#34; these children and how they act. I have been surprised by how much I have thought about this book since finishing it, and how often his observations float to the surface of my brain, especially when dealing with children, but also when dealing with adults and when observing myself.Note that there are some dated references (like to a typewriter) and some of the adult-child interactions pluck at current sensibilities oddly (like the game that one little child invented and played with him where they &#34;spanked&#34; him and he play-cried). But that was another era with different rules, and the book continues to be powerful and feel relevant today."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"John Holt wrote this book almost in diary-from. It is enjoyable to read and easy to understand his message. I think that every expectant parent should take the time to read this before their child is born. Educators will benefit by seeing another perspective on how their students learn and can apply it to their own classrooms."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"This book is half about how children learn, and the other half is about what not to do as a teacher. I found that every one of my Jr. High teachers do at least one thing that John Holt says you shouldn't do.

Highly recommended![...]"},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time, and I realize that it's considered a \\"classic\\", so I was surprised and disappointed when I finally got around to reading it. Basically, Holt describes various situations where children are playing and learning. If I hadn't already observed the same kinds of things with my own children, maybe this would have been enlightening. If you're someone who's spent time with young children, I don't think you'd get much out of this book. Perhaps if you haven't, then it might be interesting."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"How Children Learn is worth the time it takes to read it cover to cover. I learned a great deal about my son, myself and society as a whole. The book is a collection of countless scenarios where children of varying ages (1-6) are learning during normal play, without having to be sat down and \\"taught\\" anything. Even if you do have small children as I do and you believe you already know all there is to know, take my word for it. You do not. You don't realize that many things you may be doing right now that you believe are helping your child are actually hindering them by damaging their self-esteem and their ability to work through things on their own.I am the type of mother that will try to help my child do everything, even if he doesn't ask for it. It's almost automatic. I see him struggle, so I help him. After reading this book, I had to retrain myself. I forced myself to sit back and watch my son, even when he was struggling. I watched, amazed, seeing that he kept trying without screaming in frustration, until he figured things out for himself. I honestly believed that by helping him I was saving him the stress of not being able to do something himself, but I realized what I'm really doing is denying him the chance to do things for himself and the pride that comes along with that. Children do have the ability to work through these things on their own, and John Holt makes that clear.My only gripe, and this is minor, is that in the revised version of the book, he often contradicts what he originally wrote by saying that he totally disagrees with things he had previously written. His mind seems to change so often that sometimes I felt like I wasted a good amount of time just reading sections in the book that he would later \\"correct\\" and state that his original way of thinking was completely wrong. That was a little frustrating! Aside from that, definitely worth borrowing from your local library at the very least."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"The most pleasant outlook toward children I have ever encountered. Having read this book, I look at children with an entirely different perspective and a lot more love and respect!I would also add that school, at times, frustrated me beyond words. John Holt provides those words for me.To give one of many examples:\\"Now and then a bold teacher will start what they call a \\"discussion.\\" What happens then is usually what Bill Hull calls \\"answer pulling.\\" The teacher asks a series of pointed questions aimed at getting students to give an answer that he has decided beforehand is right. Teachers' manuals are full of this technique-\\"Have a discussion, in which you draw out the following points....\\" This kind of fake, directed conversation is worse than none at all. Small wonder that children soon get bored and disgusted with it.\\"Humility is when you consider that a child is not inferior after all, she is precious and her ideas and approaches to learning deserve careful consideration. Adults are generally not willing to accept this, and teachers are no exception."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"I had a hard time with this one... I think its description needs to be more straight forward: reads like a scientific journal/notes of observations. I was bored a lot, but determined to complete the book.I was glad I did. The last chapter and follow up were the best parts of the book! I loved the last chapter that summed up all of his thoughts and observations into an idea. Very thought provoking.Now someone just starting out on the parenting track might enjoy his notes and observations better than someone who has already been through it like me."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"This is really a great book to have on hand when lost for ideas.

Great book that no one should go with out reading."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"This was a used copy but it was in excellent condition and I am enjoying the book. It has helped me find another perspective to helping my children learn without being too strict about it. The format (journal entries) helps give a lot of real life examples to demonstrate the ideas the author is teaching. Really good read for parents of young children (under 12)."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"It blows me away that this book isn't more widely read. This book forces us to question every choice we, as a society, make regarding education. Instead of standardized tests and extensive teacher training, Holt emphasizes good old common sense and the willingness to let children tell us what they need.As someone who spent over 5 years teaching in the classroom, I wish I had gotten my hands on this book years ago.I can't recommend this book enough. Every parent and teacher should have to read this book."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"Holt was/is a revolutionary thinker who really starts your wheels turning. I love how accessible and natural he makes learning & teaching. Great for someone who is looking for motivational, inspirational material on how it may be possible to home educate their child(ren), and why they may be thinking about it. Underlines the many sad flaws and scars of the educational system in American schools today."},{"Title":"How Children Learn","review":"The book offers a careful look at how young children learn. The book makes a good case for providing the right environment to let children learn at their own pace. Instead of squashing children's natural inclination to learn it is incumbent on educators to provide for the awakening in the young mind the thirst for knowledge. A must read for parents and educators."},{"Title":"Nova and the Charmed Three (Star Sisterz)","review":"Ever since the first moment Nova Darling laid eyes on Joe Tsai last summer while volunteering at the library, she's wanted to do one thing more than anything in the world...play guitar in Joe's band. And now her wish is finally coming true. Nova has finally landed the coveted position in Joe's band, and couldn't be more stoked. And now that they have an upcoming Band Idol competition looming in the horizon, Nova knows that it's her and Roxie's - the name of her guitar - time to shine like superstars, in an attempt to win the competition and the affections of Joe. But suddenly Nova's dreams are being destroyed. For in The Charmed Three, three is turning out to be quite a crowd, when Nova realizes that the third member in the band is a girl named Ivy, who can really tear it up on the drums. Sadly, Ivy is also harboring a crush on Joe, and she will do anything to knock Nova out of the way, and claim the cutie for herself. Now, it's up to Nova to rock her way past the manipulative, nasty, Poison Ivy, in an attempt to win herself a place in Joe's heart, before The Charmed Three turns into The Charmed Two, and leaves Nova out in the cold.I fell in love with Tea Emesse's Nova in NOVA ROCKS! But Nova's star has certainly begun to shine brighter in my heart since completing NOVA AND THE CHARMED THREE. Nova is a girl trying to chase her dreams - and the guy who stars in them - who is easy to relate to, and absolutely adorable in everything she does. Tea Emesse truly captures the sordid affairs that plague the lives of adolescents everyday, from clothing choices to competing with each other over guys. Filled with enjoyable scenarios that mirror true-life problems pre-teens and teens face during every waking moment, NOVA AND THE CHARMED THREE is a fresh, laugh-out-loud funny tale that conveys one very important message: chase your dreams, because no one else will. An enjoyable new tale from the amazing Tea Emesse that proves two very important things: not only does Nova rock, but she's incredibly charming, as well!Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Nova and the Charmed Three (Star Sisterz)","review":"Ever have your dream come true --- only to turn into a nightmare? That's what happens to Nova Darling when she's invited by Joe, her longtime crush, to join his band. Nova's in seventh heaven, until she realizes that she's not the only one after Joe --- and her rival is fellow band mate Ivy.NOVA AND THE CHARMED THREE is the fifth book in the Star Sisterz series and the second about Nova. Nova loves everything about being a member of The Charmed Three: the practices, being near Joe, and especially the music. Everything, that is, except condescending Ivy, who acts as though she and Joe were just made for each other. Nova needs to figure out how to untangle the complex three's-a-crowd relationship and find a way for the band members to get along. She better figure it out fast, because The Charmed Three has a shot at an American Idol-like competition that could send them to the finals in Hawaii --- but not if Nova and Ivy can't appear on stage without snarling at each other.Can Nova reach out to Ivy in a way that will benefit them both? Maybe, if she can solve the mystery of Ivy's sometimes strange behavior. Why does Ivy act so curt and demanding sometimes? And what really happened in the strange little drama that Nova saw play out in Ivy's house, between Ivy, her father and Joe? Only when she sits down and rethinks some of her own assumptions is Nova able to solve the mystery --- and her problem.NOVA AND THE CHARMED THREE contains the requisite paranormal element of the series --- a strange phrase that appears in a weird place that no one else can see, which prompts Nova to do something surprising --- but as usual in these books, that element is kept very much in the background. Instead, the story focuses on Nova's relationships: with her mother, who has taken up the ballet career she once pushed on Nova; with her best friend Yumi; and most importantly, with Joe and Ivy.I continue to enjoy this series, and its strength remains in its characters. While the mystery about Ivy is not very complicated, reading about Nova and her dilemma is a pleasure. While Nova definitely learned things in book #1, NOVA ROCKS, and her actions here reflect that growth, I appreciated the fact that her difficulties this time stem --- at least in part --- from similar problems: most importantly, a difficulty in communication. This seems realistic to me, because these kinds of problems are not what most kids conquer in one swoop --- instead they chip away at them, little by little, as they grow older. This focus also gave Nova a connection to the first book, as well as a strong realistic tinge.--- Reviewed by Paula Jolin"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Loved this book!

I thought it was a good story about a family who helped hide Jewish people during the holocaust. At that time, I considered it in the same category as the 'Diary of Anne Frank' which I had read also. I recently read it again, over 30 years later, and found it to be so much more than a historical story. It truly is an inspiring tale of how one family's faith in God gave them the courage to risk incredible danger to help others. It is filled with real-life examples of how two women in a German concentration camp put the teachings of Jesus into practice. They endured suffering and remained joyful. They showed love and compassion for everyone around them, even the German guards who were cruel to them. The author, Corrie Ten Boom, survived the concentration camps and lived to be over 90. She traveled all over the world spreading the message that \\"no pit is so deep that God's love is not deeper still\\". I have been reading this book with a group of middle-school girls that I mentor. They have found it exciting and full of adventure. I also met with a group of women, most of whom were 20 years older than myself to discuss this book. Many of them expressed that the spiritual lessons in the book touched them as much as the actual story. Based on these two groups and my own opinion of the book I would have to say that it crosses over age barriers and is a great read for everyone."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book could have been 10 times as long as it is, considering the periods of time and the events that it describes; however, Ms. ten Boom focuses on what is the most important to her, which is Jesus Christ and how God's plan was revealed to her during all of these times and events. It is a great book in that respect, and even though it is light on historical detail, I still learned a lot from it. The best book I have ever read? Probably not. Life changing? Definitely."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Being a psychologist, I am always looking for ways to better understand how it is that we can suffer the most horrifying atrocities imaginable and come out the other side with even more faith than before. Corrie ten Boom's story -- her true story -- is proof that the human spirit is capable of growing even under the most painful, frightening circumstances. Anyone who has even a trivial interest in the events of World War II or in the power of faith should read this book. Its credibility speaks for itself; Corrie ten Boom and her sister Betsie lived through the horrifying experience of being held both in German prison and concentration camp, and this story of their experience is priceless. There are lots of accounts of concentration camp life out there, but this one really is special. It tells the reader to look closely at the blessings that are always around even if they are disguised as something else. More importantly, it reminds the reader that no person is eve! r really alone unless they wish to be.

I had a read a book called The Hiding Place for my english class. Its about a girl named Corrie ten Boom. THE TEN BOOM FAMILY dedicated their lives in Christian service to their home was 'an open house'for anyone in need of help. They were most active in doing social work in the town of Haarlem, and their faith inspired them to serve both the Church and society at large. DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR, the B&eacute;j&eacute; became a refuge, a Hiding Place for fugitives and hunted people who were sought by the enemy. By protecting these people, father Casper and his daughters risked their lives. Their nonviolence resistance against the Nazi-oppressor was an act of faith. This faith led them to hide Jews, students who refused to co-operate with the enemy, and members of the Dutch 'underground' resistance movement.ON FEBRUARI 28 1944, the family was betrayed and the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police, raided the house. There they arrested six members of the family. During the next hours about 30 friends, who came to the B&eacute;j&eacute; unaware of the betrayal, were also arrested and taken to prison."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is unbelievable!

The story will move you to tears every time and then have you rejoicing in the greatness of God, all while giving you an insightful look at the Holocaust, Jewish Underground, and concentration camps.Motivating in your Christian walk and thoroughly inspirational - absolutely a must read!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place is a really great book! The setting is in Holland where Corrie Ten Boom and her family makes a 'hiding place' for the persecuted Jews when Holland is being occupied by the Nazi. One day, the family is betrayed and Corrie and her sister Betsie are seperated from their friends, father, and their house as they are brought to the dreaded concentration camps. But they do not ever give up hope or stop praying and believing that God would help them, even though they are treated very cruelly. They pray for their enemies like Jesus said in Matthew 5:44.It's a very inspiring book! God's miracles that are written in this book is really wonderful and this book is a true story. Like in one part, when Corrie's sister Betsey is really sick in the camp and for the medicine, all they have is just a small tiny Davitamon bottle. And everyday, for some reason, the medicine keeps on coming, even though the bottle SHOULD be empty! I was really amazed at this part. I'm sure you would enjoy reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Wow! Is all I can truly think of this book. This book is an inspiring story about the boldness and loyal faith to God in the midst of great trajedy. It was amazing to see the work of God through these people. Corrie reminds me of myself so much, and her sister Betsie is a true example of God here on earth.

There they minister to the spiritual needs of their fellow prisoners. They never regret the choices they made to stand for what is right and just, even in the midst of physical and emotional suffering.The heroism of this family and the strength of their unwavering Christian faith in the most evil environment imaginable, make it the most inspiring book I have ever read.

We are just now finishing reading \\"Anne Frank, Diary of a young girl\\" as a part of our WW2 history studies for school (we are unschooler's, homeschooled with the Lord Jesus). Learning should be a fun time and this study of WW2 and the Holocaust has been exciting, sad, but not boring at all. My daughter throughly enjoying reading the Anne Frank book, it helped her to see a person from the past who as she put it \\"is just like me Mom, a teenage girl\\"... Enjoy The Hiding Place!

Not so with The Hiding Place.Though I knew the basics of Corrie Ten Boom's story, I had never taken the time to read The Hiding Place until last fall. Honestly, I think this book was life-changing. It was encouraging, inspiring, and challenging to see the incredible faith and bravery of Corrie and her family. To see what they went through -- all because they chose to do what was right and good -- reminded me that the things we think of as \\"important\\" are often not so important at all. And the \\"rough times\\" we think we're going through are nothing, compared to the sacrifices many have made.If you haven't read this book -- please, get a copy!

I would definitely recommend you!!!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I would recommend this book to everyone especially in todays' political climiate. This book is a definite keeper for the family library."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Readers know from the outset Corrie Ten Boom survived to help write the book but it's such an intriguing journey to get there. The authors include numerous jewels along the way, stories that stick with the reader long after the book is back on the shelf: the train ticket held by her father until the perfect time, the test of faith by not lying about family hiding under the kitchen table, the fleas having a purpose, the heartbreak of the love of her life marrying someone else, rebuilding the radio while in prison, the astounding respect and love for her father and sister while incarcerated.Each chapter utilizes powerful imagery to flesh out an application of Eternal Truth ready for internalizing.The lessons may be applied to every day life since these were not merely \`characters' but most obviously real people, with extreme trials to maneuver in life and in death. Ordinary becomes extraordinary, utilizing compelling subject matter with a page turning writing style exhibiting firm faith in the Lord. It's one of those classics that affords readers immediate application to their own circumstances since they can identify with her and her family on so many levels.Finally a work like this inspires and uplifts. I found myself continually discovering the answer (Grace) on almost every page to such questions as \\"Why did God let this happen?\\" and \\"How did she do it?\\". The Hiding Place is a classic I enjoy re-reading every few years. I'm amazed at the fresh perspective I have each time. It's timeless.One of my favorite poetic verses from Corrie Ten Boom, who quoted it often (it was by Grant Colfax Tullar), is the following:\\"My life is but a weaving betwixt my God and me;I do not choose the colors He worketh steadily.Oft times He weaveth sorrow, and I in foolish prideForget He sees the upper, and I the underside.Not till the loom is silent and the shuttles cease to flyWill God unfold the pattern and explain the reason why.For the dark threads are as needful in the Weaver's skillful handAs the threads of gold and silver in the pattern He has planned.\\""},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"A few years ago, when I was dealing with Anxiety attacks, I thought my life was bad and it couldn't get any worse. My counselor suggested I read this book to show me that no matter how bad things got, I always had a Hiding Place from suffering... that place was with the Lord Jesus Christ.Corrie Ten Boom writes of going through an ordeal that most people couldn't imagine in their worst nightmares. Yet, through it all, she kept and even gained strength by trusting in the Lord.For anyone who is going through a tough time in their life, this book is for you. After reading this book, I realized my problems were very small and I was comforted knowing at anytime there was someone I could turn to for love, re-assurance and eternal salvation. My Lord Jesus Christ....my &quot;Hiding Place&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I admire people who really take a stand for what they believe in, no matter what the cost, and Corrie Ten Boom is one of those amazing people. The story of her family, pre-concentration camp, is inspiring, because they really are willing to give up everything so that God's children are not harmed. This is truly one of the best books I've ever read...I copied a lot of phrases out of the book and into my personal journal so they could touch me later like they touched me then. There's a lot of love in this woman, mixed with comapssion, honesty, and happiness that made me reconsider my own standards in the midst of the peacetime life I live, and makes me ask the question: Would I truly risk my life for another's? Everyone should read this."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is eminently readable and inspiring! It is the fascinating, heartwarming, heartbreaking story of a Christian family who sheltered Jews during the Nazi occupation in Holland. Because of this, they suffered the worst consequences imaginable ~ incarceration and death in the concentration camps. Corrie ten Boom is my example of extreme courage and extreme forgiveness, because after miraculously surviving, she became even stronger in her faith, faced those who killed her family, and forgave them completely. She traveled the world sharing her faith for many years."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"\\"Tell me now, where are you hiding your Jews?\\" The Hiding Place is a true story about a family of kind and loving watchmakers living in Haarlem, Holland, who got caught up in the really business of hiding several Jews in their home. Because they did this they were hauled off to jail, and were eventually sent to a concentration camp. This book is a real page turner, and I would recommend it to any Young (YA) reader.The writing in this book is very well suited for its recommended age level, and any middle-school student should be able to understand it. The vocabulary is geared toward YA's, but includes a few tough foreign words. For example, \\"A second Gestapo agent in plain clothes was pawing eagerly through a pile of silver rijksdaalders.\\"The Hiding Place is very well organized and does not jump from one character to another. The account is written in the first person, and is told from Corrie Ten Boom's perspective, as illustrated in this quote: \\" \\"Here Jew!\\" I heard him say.\\"This excellent story has many great themes expertly woven into its storyline. One of the key themes is to learn how to love your enemies. Often in the story, Betsy would challenge her younger sister, Corrie, with words like, \\" I pray every day that we will be allowed to do this! To shoe\\\\w them [the Germans] that love is greater!\\"I highly recommend The Hiding Place to any YA or teenage reader who is looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"When I first started reading the Hiding Place, I thought that it seemed drawn out and boring, but I soon realized that it was so exciting, I couldn't put it down. Corrie is a christian woman who helps Jews escape Hitler. She has a life changing story about spreading the gospel in concentration camps.Since Corrie Ten Boom wrote this story about herself, the reader can get a clear picture of her thoughts. She was extremely caring and willing to give all she had for others. I felt that it was easy to relater to her and all of the characters because they were real people facing life's difficulties.The author uses a wonderful style to keep the story interesting. She uses a mixture of dialog and descriptive narration. She uses flashbacks to explain, foreshadow, and teach lessons. The Hiding Place introduces suspenseful situations that make readers laugh, cry, and go hug someone.I believe that the message of this book is to trust in Jesus as your \\"hiding place\\". This book gives so many wonderful examples of trusting God; I definitely agree with it's message. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to take time out of a busy schedule to learn a lesson and go on an exciting journey. Anyone can enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I don't re-read many books, but I come back to this one. It is uplifting and humbling at the same time.

This book teaches the principles of forgiveness, hope, and love in such a beautiful way. Her personal account of coming to peace in unspeakable sorrow is something all of us can learn from."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The story of Corrie Ten Boom was verbally passed on to me by my parents who served overseas during World War II. However, to read the actual account is an experience like few others. &quot;The Hiding Place is a masterpiece and hopefully will remain in print for many years to come.Corrie Ten Boom was the daughter of a Dutch watchmaker. The lessons she learned from her father are likely the very lessons which helped her surivive the horrendous attrocities of Hitler's concentration camp at Ravensbruck. He taught her about love, humanity, courage and forgiveness. Corrie's father also taught her that happiness comes from within and not at the hands of others; a lesson which undoubtedly helped her come to terms with life as a survivor.As a leader of the Dutch Underground, Corrie and her family hid Jews from the Nazis up until the time the entire family was arrested and placed in a concentration camp. Corrie was the only member of her family to survive. The increcible story presented in this book is one of faith, courage, humanity and forgiveness. The book is well-written, emotional, far more deserving of a five-star rating and highly recommended reading. Another excellent account of personal life inside Hitler's concentration camps is &quot;Children of the Flames,&quot; which tells the stories of how twins were treated inside the camps."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I have always found Focus on the Family's Radio Theatre to be well done, and this production was no exception. The voices, direction, sound effects, all were well done. From what I remembered, the story follows the book pretty closely. The one issue I might have is that the voices tend to be soft while the sound effects are somewhat loud, so one minute we are turning up the volume to hear people talking, and the next turning it down so we don't suffer hearing damage. Other than that, our family has a lot of fun listening to this drama in the car. We didn't want to stop listening when we got home! It pulls you in just like the book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is an absolutely extraordinary book. Never have I read a book in which the spiritual beauty of the author so resonated throughout the story. The purity of heart that manifests itself in this inspiring saga of a heroic, Dutch family in Nazi occupied Holland during World War II is stunningly beautiful.This is the true story of the Ten Boom family who, during the Nazi occupation of The Netherlands, upon seeing what was happening to their Jewish neighbors and friends, asked themselves this age old question \\"If not us,...who; if not now,...when?\\" They answered it, ultimately at great cost.The Ten Booms were devoutly Christian and lived a simple life. The patriarch of the family ran a watch shop that had been in his family for a century. Some of the family members, the author among them, worked there, selling and repairing clocks and watches. They also lived in the house in which the shop was located.When the Nazis occupied their country, the reality of what it meant slowly dawned upon them, as they saw the treatment given to their fellow Dutch citizens of the Jewish faith. Moved by their plight, the author at the age of fifty, together with other members of her family, including their father who was nearly eighty, became active in the Dutch underground.When it became clear to the Ten Booms that Jews were being targeted for deportation and death, they had a false wall constructed in the author's bedroom, thereby creating a secret room. There, they would hide the terrified Jews who were staying with them, in the event of a Nazi raid upon their home.Eventually denounced by someone to the Nazis, the Ten Booms were arrested and their home raided and torn apart by the Gestapo, in their search for the Jews they believed to be hiding there.

Never have I read a book in which the spiritual beauty of the author so resonated throughout the story. The purity of heart that manifests itself in this inspiring saga of a heroic, Dutch family in Nazi occupied Holland during World War II is stunningly beautiful.This is the true story of the Ten Boom family who, during the Nazi occupation of The Netherlands, upon seeing what was happening to their jewish neighbors and friends, asked themselves this age old question \\"If not us,...who; if not now, when?\\" They answered it, ultimately, at great cost.The Ten Booms were devoutly Christian and lived a simple life. The patriarch of the family ran a watch shop that had been in his family for a century. Some of the family members, the author among them, worked there, selling and repairing clocks and watches. They also lived in the house in which the shop was located.When the Nazis occupied their country, the reality of what it meant slowly dawned upon them, as they saw the treatment given to their fellow Dutch citizens of the jewish faith. Moved by their plight, the author at the age of fifty, together with other members of her family, including their father who was nearly eighty, became active in the Dutch underground.When it became clear to the Ten Booms that jews were being targeted for deportation and death, they had a false wall constructed in the author's bedroom, thereby creating a secret room. There, they would hide the terrified jews who were staying with them, in the event of a Nazi raid upon their home.Eventually denounced by someone to the Nazis, the Ten Booms were arrested and their home raided and torn apart by the Gestapo, in their search for the jews they believed to be hiding there. At the time of the raid, the Ten Boom home was filled to capacity with jews in hiding. So well concealed was the hidden room that had been created by the erection of the false wall, that these poor, terrified jews managed to escape detection.The Ten Boom family did not fare so well. It was upon their arrest that they learned first hand of man's inhumanity to man, and their faith was put to a test that they had never dreamt possible.

This story tells of the horrible conditions & ruthlessness of the attempt that Hitler brewed up to destroy the Jews. That will never happen, as they are God's chosen people. But it was so inspiring to see how God used such wonderful Christian families as the ten Boom's to accomplish His works. Their faith in God & telling others of the hope in Christ made all the difference in how these people persevered. GOD IS GOOD, ALL THE TIME!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I recently finished reading \\"The Hiding Place.\\" The real life story of Corrie Ten Bloom, the book deals with her imprisonment during World War 2.Bloom, incidentally, became Holland's first licensed female watchmaker, which I found to be very interesting. The reason she and many of her family members and friends were arrested was because they tried to help those of the Jewish faith and others who were being pursued by the Nazis.Although the Bloom family suffers great losses and cruelty for their kindness, one thing rings strong through the entire book and that is their strength in their faith. It has been awhile since I have read a book where faith was so integrated into people and I found it refreshing amidst such a tragic backdrop.For me, \\"The Hiding Place\\" started a bit slow and it took me awhile to get really interested in the story. But I did and one thing I enjoyed was the family timeline in the back of the book. After reading the story it put it back into a perspective I had missed. Some of the traumatic events were fast, furious and short spanned and I suppose because of the severity of the concentration camps, etc, I assumed the time lapse was longer.Out of five stars, I give this a four. However, the courage and faith of those involved in the story, is off the scale."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I will not go into detail on this very public site about what this author, and her book, mean to me. Suffice it to say that I would not be alive today, without having heard Corrie's message of God's infinite love.As a psychiatrist, I have bought, and given away to patients, at least 50 copies of this book over the past two decades. It is more powerful than the strongest of antidepressants.Corrie ten Boom is a saint. She will not be officially recognized as such by the Catholic Church since she was nominally a Protestant. I say nominally, because her heart, like God's, was deep enough and wide enough to encompass and embrace all people, no matter what \\"religion\\" they practiced. Corrie's religion was Love."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place should be read by EVERY Christian.

Later, My husband took me to Haarlem, the Netherlands to see her home,when I was going thru a particularly hard time in my life, as he had heard me speak of her and her brave story so many times! She and her family, her sister, showed the most extraordinary courage and strength of faith in the most horrible circumstances. Her father's explanation of death:...\\"Just like I gave you your tickets, The Lord gives us our ticket when we get on the train\\"....an example of how he always gave his daughters their tickets right before they got on the train to Amsterdam....A must read..

Anyway, \\"The Hiding Place\\" is an extremely powerful book illustrating both the power of forgiveness and the extent of human savegry. Corrie Ten Boom's story is both personal and inspiring. I can't imagine the hardship she endured as she experienced one of the worst crimes in human history (The Holocaust).Sadly, the fall of NAZI Germany wasn't the end of man's inhumanity to man. I would also like to encourage readers to read \\"The Pastor's Wife\\" by Sabina Wurmbrand (and/or some books by her husband Richard). There is also a very nice abridged version of \\"The Gulag Archipelago\\" by Alexander Solzenhitzen for those who want a very chilling glimpse of another totalitarian regiem. That book has some uplifting Christian thought as well (it is mostly concerned with the cruelty and oppression practiced by the government though).Overall, Corrie Ten Boom wrote a very personal and uplifting (despite its darkness) work."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This story is exceptional and deeply moving. This woman and others associated with her took great risk for the benefit of many people during WWII. I highly recommend this book if you're interested in reading about underground smuggling and life during the Holocaust."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This little classic needs to be on the shelf of all Christians. \\"Tante Corrie\\" was raised in a Godly family, which surely sustained her in the worst situations anyone can imagine...I wonder how many of us in this generation would be as brave? There seems to be an attitude in today's churches that Christians who are right with God should not suffer, which is completely unscriptural. The story of this woman's life can give us all something to strive for."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"When I bought this book, I little dreamed that what I held in my hands was a treasure - and one of the greatest stories that I would ever read.The Hiding Place is the story of Corrie Ten Boom, and what an awesome one it is. Set during World War II, the Ten Booms are a Christian family living in Holland. Corrie's writing is very descriptive, and her book is very well-written and moving. It is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat - but make sure you have plenty of tissue nearby! This book will be sure to have you crying, as you are swept away into the nightmare of German occupation. The story begins with the early years of Corrie's life, and then focuses on her middle-aged years during the war.With a heart of love, the Ten Boom family opens their home to Jews, even though it would probably mean danger to them later on. Corrie, drawn to the underground work, is one of the moving leaders in this movement. The first woman watch-maker in Holland, she takes up helping her father in his shop that has been running for 100 years. As more Jews come to their home, they know that sooner or later, they would be discovered for their illegal work. But still, they continue to help. And then, Corrie slips into a trap that was laid for her - and the Gestapo came and took her and her family prisoners. Here, the book gets really exciting and one gets anxious! Corrie and her sister Betsie endure the harsh, horrible prison life, later going to an extermination camp in Ravensbruck, Germany. Corrie and Betsie suffered terribly - more than most can imagine. Starvation, hunger, thirst, sickness, nakedness, and everything else; yet as their earthly bodies perished and grew weaker, their faith in God increased, and miraculous things happened. Their Bible (hidden in Corrie's dress) went past guard after guard, completely unnoticed; a tiny vitamin bottle continually gave drop after drop of precious medicine to sick women and ill Betsie, even though it looked empty. Only did the supply run out when a nurse snuck some pills to Corrie. Corrie and Betsie, through God, witnessed to many women, read the Bible out-loud to hundreds, and strengthened many. Then, Corrie experienced one of the worst trials of her life there in Ravensbruck.A story of forgiveness, love, triumph, and endurance, The Hiding Place is a classic - one that I am sure will not cease to inspire its readers. This book will cause you to trust more in God, as you follow the life of a watchmaker into the horrors of German occupation. \\"We must tell people, Corrie,\\" said Betsie once, \\"We must tell them what we learned.\\" This book is that story - the story of what Corrie Ten Boom learned. And it is Betsie's story too, being with Corrie for many of those years. Betsie was such an inspirational woman. It is amazing how God used these two women in such a very powerful way.Thank God for such a book as this! I recommend this book to all, young and old - everybody can learn something from The Hiding Place.Thank you for reading my review, and I hope it has been helpful to you. May God bless you!-P. Charles"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Great and wonderful timeless true story. Book arrived timely and well packaged and is a thrilling spellbinder; you will never read another book quite like this one!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Amazing book! The book has a beautiful cover, and includes a little epilogue of what Corrie Ten Boom did until her death."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place was written by Corrie Ten Boom. It is a true story about one corageous family who stood up against the Nazi's attempt to capture and kill Jewish people during World War 2 at tremendous cost to their own personal safety. I have read this book several times, and have read it to my children. This book is a masterpiece. The reader is sure to be captivated by the goodness and spiritual beauty contained within its pages.In the face of real horror, do we have what it takes to stand up and put our own well being aside to help others? Can we put our lives on the line, to minister to the hearts and souls of others?The Ten Boom family set aside thier own comfort and went 'all in' to help the Jewish in their community who were being persecuted by the Nazi occupation. They held nothing back and demonstrated the love of Christ to all who needed Him.The thing about this story that is so profound, is that the opportunity to serve the Lord came to them in their own home. They did not go 'out' in order to go into the mission field. This family simply met the needs of those near them. They opened up their home, sacrificed their own safety, and gave all that they had. The Ten Boom family did not fair well after their capture and suffered greatly for their efforts to help the Jews, but remained steadfast in their faith throughout. The relationships and love that this family had with one another is breathtakingly beautiful. Their respect of one another and other people sets an example for us all.Ms. Ten Boom told her story and kept herself transparent. She revealed her heart, the good and the bad, and shared her spiritual growth in a very authentic, humble manner. This book will be inspirational to anyone who loves Jesus and wants to serve Him, as well as anyone who just wants to become a better person. You do not need to be anything but willing.I highly recommend this book. It is well written and very thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I just love reading any of Corrie ten Boom's books. A lot of history that was not known until now and she was such a woman of God. She and her sister touched a lot of people."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is the story of Corrie Ten Boom and her family of watch makers. During WWII Corrie and her family hid Jews throughout Harlem and its vicinity. They were part of the resistance opertions with a large network. Hence, Corrie knew they would eventually be caught, but they continued their life saving activities in spite of the danger. The family was naive and unsophisticated in the ways of the world and they had to learn quickly. Part of their activities included obtaining many forged ration cards for the hidden Jews. When they were caught, they were charged with ration card forgery. Corrie, her sister Betsey and their father were arrested and sent to a horrible prison. The father died after being taken to a hospital, but the sisters were later sent to Ravensbruck concentration camp. Throughout their ordeal they were inspired by their strong Christian faith. Their faith in God and Christ allowed them to endure their privations longer. Betsy died of a lung infection in Ravensbruck, but Corrie survived and was discharged probably because of a clerical error. These two spinsters became unlikely war heroes.While this is a book about the holocaust, it is also about Christian faith. Treatment at these prisons and camps was worse for the Jews interred there than for political prisoners like the Ten Booms. Still this family risked their lives for total strangers because it was the right thing to do. Because their goal was to do God's work, Corrie also ministered and cared for the traumatized German populace after the war. I read some of the other reviews. This was not a hard book to get into. In fact some parts were page turners. This is not an outstanding work of literature. It is an additional story of the holocaust, the story of the righteous gentile. These Christians who saved Jews at very great risk to themselves deserve special praise. Had more Christians followed their faith during this period in history far fewer Jews would have been exterminated. This book is an easy read and an acceptable book for Jr. high and early high school. Still it is an adult read as well. It is also a good Christian sunday school book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This inspirational true story shows how the Dutch reacted and revolted towards their Nazi invaders. Not only through their pride but also through their faith and Christianity. The Dutch have an incredible tolerance and faith in their own country and people. Corrie ten Boom and her family exemplifies it all: commitment to faith and Christian living even when faced with the darkest of times.Corrie's story is of a loving, close-knit family who open the door of their home to hide all who were persecuted by the Nazi's. They were eventually betrayed and imprisoned. Two of the sisters were sent to the Ravensbruck concentration camp. Whilst interned, the sisters endured and witnessed scenes of inhuman degradation, brutality and lack of compassion from the camp guards to collaborators.This story reinforces the power of faith and survival in the most evil of places. The love of the firmly grounded ten Boom family in the teachings of faith and desire to help their fellow man in a time of great need is completely compelling and will have you hooked from the first page. The whole spectrum of human emotions will be experienced throughout the book; it is a testament to the bravery and kindness of remarkable people. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This has been my favorite book for 25 years. I can't count the number of copies I have given away. The Ten Boom's example of love and faith and forgiveness is so uplifting, but it is not a book that pushes religion it is an amazing story that happened through their faith - I think every Christian should read this book at least once."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"\\"The Hiding Place\\" by Corrie Ten Boom has to be one of the most moving, faith strengthening, profound books I have ever read!!! Corrie and the Ten Boom family decide to take a stand and hide and help their Jewish friends and neighbors in Nazi occupied Holland. The Ten Boom's build a hiding place within their home and assist in helping hundreds of others in finding safe shelter from the Nazi's, all the while putting them in constant peril. The true story that ensues describes horrors beyond belief. Even when faced with extreme adversity, the Ten Boom's push on insisting on relying upon their incredible faith in their savior, Jesus Christ. The Ten Boom's lived a life of faith that we all wish we had the guts to live! This book was incredible and life changing! Christian or not, this is a book that teaches us beyond just our faith that whatever we face, we must love one another regardless of the person or situation you are faced with, including the people who in the Ten Boom's case, where actually persecuting them!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book was lent to me by a friend who really liked it and said that I would also. After reading the first chapter, I could not put it down. I could not believe the way Corrie Ten Boom 's sister Betsie gave thanks to God for *everything*. It made me rethink the things that I am blessed with and neglect to thank Him for. This book was a real eye-opener for me and I'm thankful I read it!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I read this book very early in my walk with the Lord, and it had a greater impact on my fledgling faith than any sermon or pastor ever could. The faith that both she and her sister demonstrated in the worst possible circumstances, is something to aspire to. Throughout I cried tears of awe at the Lords mercy, tears for her tremendous loss, and tears of thansgiving that this experience did not shake her faith in any way."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is a heart-breaking story yet one that is filled with hope. Miss Ten Boom's story is of course just one out of millions who suffered and were tortured yet it is so thoughtfully recounted that one can't help but be touched by it. The autobiographical accounts of the Holocaust are a gift to our society. Even if you don't share Miss Ten Boom's religious beliefs you will not be able to forget her story."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The simplicity of The Hiding Place by Corrie ten Boom belies the penetrating spirituality that pervades her story. It is not only a story of courage in facing the injustice and persecution of the Nazis, but also deeply spiritual book. Ms. Boom describes her sister's, Betsie's, attitude through imprisonment and her long fatal illness. When Betsie wants to praise God for lice, Corrie is dumbfounded. However, the lice keep the soldiers out of the barracks, thereby allowing them to have their prayer meetings. At another time Betsie tells Corrie that after the war they will have to have a home for the victims of the war. Corrie assumes she means the Jews and others who were imprisoned. But Betsie meant the soldiers. Betsie knew instinctively that having participated in the evil of the camps, these soliders would need redemption. Corrie was humbled by these responses of her sister.The beauty of this book is that it demonstrates faith in the midst of horror. And this faith is the kind of faith Jesus expressed on the cross when he asked his Father to forgive those who killed him. In that sense this simple book is quiet challenging. One feels such anger at the evil portrayed here. And the book is not vindictive. Corrie's own spiritual growth comes in stages. One can appreciate how she moves from anger and hatred to love."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This story is emotionally hard to read sometimes and I'm sure you'll find a tear or two somewhere in this classic novel about a courageous family dedicated to saving all the Jews they can from Hitler's Nazis. This story teaches us that miracles do happen today and how great God is to us- even in the barracks of an unfriendly German concentration camp."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book was so interesting that I would recomend it to just about everyone I knew.

A person with that much love for God, can take all of our hearts away. It makes you stop and think, &quot;Would I do that for other people or would I just help myself?&quot; Even when she was in solitaire imprisonment she fed the ants crumbs of her own food. She and Betsie led each person that they were grouped with in a cell to believe that God was watching out for each one of them and that he loved them. Instead of the women fighting in their cell, they spoke with manners and learned to love each other. She didn't think of her family passing away as something horrible, she thought of it as uplifting and that they were lucky that they got to go home to the Father. She is a hero to me because she thought of the good in the worst situations. Even when the going got tough, she would pray to God to let her think of the best for each situation."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"A book so touching that it leaves a clear and concise message that we are all innocent of the life and circumstances that we are born into.

Great book"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Corrie ten Boom never knew that one day, her life would be dramatically different of that of a single woman who lived quietly with her sister and father in a Dutch town above their watch shop. In the start of the this book, Corrie affectionately chronicles her growing up and early adulthood years, showing us her loving family and introducing us the solid foundation of faith that made the next part possible. For soon enough, Germany invades Holland, and the country is plunged into the Second World War. And this is when the life of Corrie, her sister Betsie and their father undergoes a transformation. The ten Boom family has always lived out their beliefs, and now that means defying German laws by hiding Jews and stealing ration cards to feed the Jews. For a while, they stay safe, because of God's protection and their surprisingly large network of fellow \\"resistance\\" workers. Yet finally, the ultimate test comes, and Corrie and her family are sent to a depresing Dutch prison, and ultimately, a concentration camp. \\"The Hiding Place\\" is more than an account of Nazi terror, it is the inspiring story of Corrie's faith. It clearly shows how her faith grew as adversity did. She recalls with seeming fondness God's provision for \\"just the right person\\" to help with the resistance work, and lets us in on her constant prayer life. When prison experiences are described we are inspired by Corrie's love for the Bible and thankfulness in any situation. And at the concentration camp? Once again, Corrie and Betsie band together to minister to the women around them, and still giving thanks in every experience. It is a remarkable memoir, filled with real-life stories of faith and giving an example of how even existence in a concentration camp can be almost joyful. After reading this, I thought, \\"What I wouldn't do to meet Corrie and Betsie.\\""},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place is the true story of ordinary people who became heroes and heroines simply by maintaining the courage of their convictions. They did not let fear of the Nazis prevent them from doing what they knew to be the right thing - helping other human beings.This book also paints a lifelike picture of Haarlem, Holland, before, during, and after the invasion by Germany during World War II. I enjoyed reading about this wonderful family as they lived before the invasion. &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; is very well written, with vivid characters that come alive for the reader.I wish this book was required reading in schools, to show young people that true heroism is about more than shooting baskets or becoming a movie star. I hope the courage of the ten Boom family will remind us all in the future that we are not helpless to resist evil."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I think this book was a very boring book.

I was not aware of the journey it would take me on. Many may look at this book and wonder why only 1/3 or so of the book is about the actual hiding place in Haarlem and the other portion in the concentration camps: it's called a double-entendre. Although the book highlights the physical hiding place for those on the run, unbeknownst to Corrie a spiritual Hiding Place is discovered in the midst of a horrific time.

Very easy read; perfect for those who need help learning about forgiveness or questioning \\"why?\\""},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Ten Boom is unflinchingly honest, whether telling of her loving father protecting her from the sin engulfing her native Holland, her disappointment in love, time in a concentration camp for hiding Jews, loss of her sister and father to the camps, her unforgiveness and eventual mercy toward those responsible, her brother's slow descent toward death after the war ended, and her ministry based on the prophetic words of her sister as she lay dying.Reads like a modern saint reminiscent of those listed in Hebrews 11."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"There are many great lessons to learn from this book. Perseverance and faithfulness are the two obvious and most prominent. The story of Corrie Ten Boom's family and their efforts to hide Jews from the Nazis is simply amazing, and it's a story that everyone should read.While Corrie's courage is admirable, I was more moved by the actions of her sister Betsie. Even while they suffered the most horrific conditions, Betsie prayed not only for their fellow prisoners, but for their guard and tormentors as well. While this is an example that is set for us in the Bible to follow, it is a monumental task and to have the faith that she had under these conditions is unbelievable. And to find out the end of the story for some of the guards they prayed for reminds us to keep an eternal perspective.The true stories told in this book are better than any I've seen in fiction, and the fact that they are true stories makes them all the more fascinating. Particularly amazing were the results of the absolute honesty of Nollie and Cocky.The impact of Corrie Ten Boom before, during, and after her ordeal is remarkable. This is a well written book that conveys not only her story, but the spiritual lessons that can be learned from it as well."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book can add great things to your life, even if you are a non-believer. The ten Booms are an inspiration for all due to their indiscriminant acts of love and kindness. Very much worth reading and sharing!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place is an outstanding account of the wartime experiences of Corrie ten Boom and her family. Her family was from Holland. Life changed for her when the Nazis quickly conquered the nation. Corrie had a close family. Her father repaired watches and he was a Christian gentleman. Corrie had a close bond with her sister Betsie.The ten Boom family helped Jewish refugees the best they could. Unfortunately, the Nazis raided her place and took Corrie and her family members into custody. Corrie and her family were put into concentration camps. Corrie gives a richly detailed description of the humiliation of being stripped naked and having a shaved head. She suffered incredible loss as her father and sister died.One of the most interesting parts of her account was the fact that her faith in God sustained her and survived in tact during the most trying of times. She was forever touched by the way that her sister Betsie handled the grave adversity. Betsie reminded Corrie that God was present in the most dire circumstances. Betsie was thankful for the presence of lice because the soldiers did not want to get near the prisoners to disrupt their Bible studies.Corrie was able to find healing in the presence of God. She ministered to other victims of the atrocities of the Holocaust. There is a big contrast between her attitude and that of Elie Wiesel. Wiesel lost his faith in the midst of the horror and had a negative view in blaming God for allowing the tragedy. ten Boom's attitude is refreshing. She does not blame God for the atrocities. She realizes that people have free will and they chose to participate in the unspeakable horrors. God is not to blame in any of this.This is an excellent book from a literary standpoint. The text is well-written and the narratives flow easily. Corrie is a good story teller. She presents the lessons she learned spiritually throught the book. She gained wisdom and the empathetic ability to connect with those who are suffering. She reminds people that God is fundamentally good and he will help people through the worst tragedies. Corrie emerges as a triumphant overcomer rather than a perpetual victim."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book has been very impactful in many lives, including my family's. It is a truly inspiring story of one woman's faith, courage, and love for God. Corrie ten Boom went through extremely difficult circumstances, but relied on the Lord's help throughout her entire life. As the book alternates between different times in her life, it tells the story of how she grew up in Holland, and was taken into a Nazi concentration camp along with her sister. It is amazing how God protected her and carried her through the fear and pain that she and her family had to endure. Ultimately, she never lost sight of who God is, and how much He had done and continued to do. She brought to mind Paul in the jail cell, worshipping God even in the midst of trials.I was moved by Corrie's extreme devotion to God and her love for others, including her enemies. This book is a great example of how Christians can live godly lives that serve others and honor our Heavenly Father. Anyone should read this book and no doubt will enjoy it and be impacted by it."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place is the remarkable story of a woman's walk with God while going through the horrors of World War II. After her home country of Holland was invaded by Germany, Corrie Ten Boom took on the dangerous task of helping Jews. Even after she was arrested and placed in concentration camps, her faith in God still remained. This book shows us how she battled loving those who persecuted her. Her love for God through all her experiences is what makes her story inspiring and extraordinary. Corrie Ten Boom's faith is what true Christian faith should look like. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I had been hearing about this title for years and finally decided to give it a try. After visiting Amsterdam and the home of Anne Frank some time ago, I'd decided Nazi oppression wasn't something I would enjoy learning more about and much less enjoy reading about...hence my hesitation in reading this book. But, Corrie Ten Boom's name kept appearing on my radar too much for me to ignore, so I finally surrendered and read The Hiding Place.I had the preconceived notion that this would be one of those preach-y books that in the end made me feel inadequate in my relationship with God. But I discovered something far different. The details of Ten Boom's early family life were so enjoyable to read, kept my attention and had me thinking about the story even when I wasn't reading it. It was far from preach-y.The story unfolds beautifully as a narrative of Ten Boom's experiences. I love the raw honesty and that she was far from perfect in her responses to people. Much can be learned from this rich, historical approach to her experience.This book would appeal to anyone with an interest in history, families, trust and faith. But even if you aren't a Christian, this book is worth your time (and wouldn't be time spent resisting the feeling that the author would like to convert you!).Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book was compelling read. I was drawn in to Corrie Ten Boom's world and was inspired by her faith, courage, love for others, and the sacrifices she made. I believe every Christian should read this book to see faith in action - played out in a very real way. The humility of her person was obvious through the words and it was clear that she didn't believe it was her acting, but Christ acting through her to want to do right and to love others - and even to forgive those who hurt her. Definitely worth the time to read!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Even putting this book on a rating system seems an injustice. This is a side of the Holocaust you may not have read before, the inexhaustible faith of two women who offered up all that they had to give (including life) in order to save God's chosen \\"ancient people\\" as she calls them. She had a reverence and respect for Jews from whom Christ came that endeared me to her instantly. I truly believe that every last person on the face of the earth should read this book. But know that just as someone can hold out a gift for you but you must reach out and receive it for it to be yours - so to is the truth and light and hope and strength this book offers. If this story does not move your very soul, you still have some growing to do. Leave it alone and come back to it in a few years.It might help to know: With a hundred things on my daily to do list, and this book being over 250 pages long, I still read it in two days. I could not put it down. I was reading every time I had two minutes put together throughout the day.10/27/12 - I just received the hard cover version (maroon cover). Just FYI, this has the words \\"Christian Library\\" printed in gold on the front of the book. I didn't see this in the photos. Of course, this isn't a terrible thing, but there's a reason I wish they had not printed it. When ministering to people (loving them where they are)and you offer them a good & encouraging story such as this, they can feel something is being pushed on them if it's stamped Christian Library."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is inspirational, not just an interesting read, though it is that, too. I read many books on the Holocaust years ago, and this one has a message of faith that has remained with me."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Story is a little slow at first but once it gets going..... Wow! What the Nazi's did to people is beyond inhumane. The real important part of the story is the woman writing it and her sister. Their love and devotion to Jesus in the most hideous circumstances proves Jesus overcomes all. What a miracle!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Readers know from the outset Corrie Ten Boom survived to help write the book but it's such an intriguing journey to get there. The authors include numerous jewels along the way, stories that stick with the reader long after the book is back on the shelf: the train ticket held by her father until the perfect time, the test of faith by not lying about family hiding under the kitchen table, the fleas having a purpose, the heartbreak of the love of her life marrying someone else, rebuilding the radio while in prison, the astounding respect and love for her father and sister while incarcerated.Each chapter utilizes powerful imagery to flesh out an application of Eternal Truth ready for internalizing.The lessons may be applied to every day life since these were not merely \`characters' but most obviously real people, with extreme trials to maneuver in life and in death. Ordinary becomes extraordinary, utilizing compelling subject matter with a page turning writing style exhibiting firm faith in the Lord. It's one of those classics that affords readers immediate application to their own circumstances since they can identify with her and her family on so many levels.Finally a work like this inspires and uplifts. I found myself continually discovering the answer (Grace) on almost every page to such questions as \\"Why did God let this happen?\\" and \\"How did she do it?\\". The Hiding Place is a classic I enjoy re-reading every few years. I'm amazed at the fresh perspective I have each time. It's timeless.One of my favorite poetic verses from Corrie Ten Boom, who quoted it often (it was by Grant Colfax Tullar), is the following:\\"My life is but a weaving betwixt my God and me;I do not choose the colors He worketh steadily.Oft times He weaveth sorrow, and I in foolish prideForget He sees the upper, and I the underside.Not till the loom is silent and the shuttles cease to flyWill God unfold the pattern and explain the reason why.For the dark threads are as needful in the Weaver's skillful handAs the threads of gold and silver in the pattern He has planned.\\""},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"For a commuter who is too tired to read once finally home, this was an excellent way to \\"read\\" this book.

Loved it."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Let me start out by saying that this is a very powerful book. There is such an awesome message of hope, courage, and faith. If you love God, family, and believe that God can do powerful things then this is the book for you. Corrie Ten Boom is living with her family during the time when Nazi soldiers are taking Jews to concretion camps. Her family wants to help the Jews and keep them safe, by hiding them in their home. Corrie is working for a secret organization that helps protect the Jewish people. She and her family soon find that they are in the same situation as the Jews. Corrie stays strong in her faith and good things start to happen in the concretion camp that she and her family are put into.

The Hiding Place By: Corrie Ten Book is a very well written book and has two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Review by K. Inman\\"The Hiding Place\\" by Corrie ten Boom is a wonderful book. It is an empowering novel and a true story about the ten Boom family- a family of watchmakers that have solid Christian beliefs. The family becomes involved with a group known as the Dutch Underground, which is an organization in Holland that helped the Jews escape from Nazi persecution.The story is action-packed as the family goes from one situation to the next, narrowly avoiding capture. As the ten Boom sisters Corrie and Betsie are shuffled from prison camp to prison camp after finally being caught for helping the Jews, you come to realize that God can help you through anything if you let Him.This book is a slightly challenging read, and is heavily religious, but it is a very enriching experience to learn about a time when life was so hard for so many people- it really makes you thankful for the way life is today.If you want to experience a part of history while thoroughly enjoying it- and trust me- you won't be able to put this book down! - then this is definitely the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is one of my all time favorite Christian biographies.

Do they make it out alive?I personally enjoy hearing about stories like this. It was very exciting, entertaining, and had me on the edge of my seat. The only thing I had a problem with was that the Concentration Camps were very realistic and intense. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like intense movies, stories, or audio books. I'd give it four stars."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is a 1971 autobiography on the life of Corrie ten Boom. The title refers to both the physical hiding place where the ten Boom family hid Jews during the Nazi occupation of Holland, and also to the biblical message found in Psalm 119:114 which states, \\"Thou art my hiding place and my shield\\".The book tells the story the ten Boom family and their efforts to hide Jews and aide the resistance after the Nazis invaded the Netherlands during WWII. The ten Booms were a devout Christian family active in the Dutch Reformed Church. The family ran a watch repair shop out of the first floor of their home and refused to stand by idly as Jewish residents of their town lost privileges and were eventually gathered up by the Nazis. The ten Booms, guided by Corrie and her sister Betsie, became heavily involved in the Dutch resistance and even hid Jews in secret compartments in their own home.This tale of Christian courage begins with the moral dilemma that was faced when the ten Booms were forced to lie and steal in order to protect the Jews they helped. The devout Christian family viewed it as their duty to protect human life. The witness of God's mercy and love they demonstrated to the community was astonishing. Their acts of Christian charity saved many lives.The ten Booms seldom waivered from their dedication to sharing the gospel. They preached and served and organized worship services in prisons and work camps. Corrie and Betsie witnessed to Nazi soldier, prison guards, and prisoners of all religions and ethnic groups. They shared Christ even when the act of doing so put their lives at risk.Corrie ten Boom and her family were not particularly talented or political. But, God used them mightily to exhibit his compassion and love. Decades later actions and faith of the ten Boom family stand as a model for all."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book was an amazing! Corrie Ten Boom was an incredible person. I can't imagine being in her situation and remaining as positive as she did.

God is so good!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is a great book. Hard to believe that all this went on during the holocaust. Wonder how they could get through all of this? GOD..got them through.."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Triumphant True Story of Corrie ten Boom.The biography of Corrie ten Boom's life during World War II is amazing. So much is packed into this profound book! From the very first chapter---no, the very first page!---I immediately connected with the story. It begins in the normal, happy days of Corrie's life, before the German invasion. I was actually surprised at how cheerful everything could be, and all the joy in the ten Boom household. This is the true story of her life.Who was Corrie ten Boom?She was the daughter of a watchmaker, and in fact, she was quite a skilled watchmaker herself. With her family being Dutch Christians, the Nazis did not come after the ten Booms---that is, not until later as Corrie and her family, gradually, secretly, became leaders in the Underground. They only did what was best for the forlorn Jews that entered into the ten Boom's house, even though it cost them everything.When you first \\"meet\\" Corrie in the book, she is already a 45-year-old woman. She was at that time filled with such energy and sprightliness, and I believe it is that very outlook she had on life that helped her through the trials of Scheveningen Prison and Ravensbruck Concentration Camp. In the part of Corrie's life that this book talks about, she lives in the Beje (the name of the family's house) with her older sister, Betsie, and their elderly father. It was in their house that I recall a specific section in chapter one that forewarned of the terrors ahead:....\\"It was a day for memories. A day for calling up the past. How could we have guessed as we sat there---two middle-aged spinsters and an old man---that in place of memories were about to be given adventures such as we have never dreamed of? Adventure and anguish, horror and heaven were just around the corner, and we did not know.\\"....\\"Oh Father! Betsie! If I had known would I have gone ahead? Could I have done the things I did?\\"Through everything the ten Boom family endured, they found some way to honor God and actually be thankful for the awful predicaments they were put in. To think that sleeping in damp, flea-infested beds could open an obscure opportunity! As I read chapter after chapter, it seemed that wherever Corrie and Betsie were, strange and wonderful surprises happened. There were so many blessings in the midst of fright and violence, that I simply lost count of them all. I know the reason why these gifts were showered on them; it was their steadfast faith.Imagine with me, could you have had the courage and wisdom to stand up to a Nazi and tell him:....\\"The truth, sir, is that God's viewpoint is sometimes different than ours---so different that we could not even guess at it unless he had given us a Book which tells us such things.\\"Corrie's story really astounded me. And just as much, or even more so, Betsie's part of the story left me shocked by her selfless thoughts---I wish I could read more from Betsie's point of view.Yes, there are gruesome parts in this book. Horrific deaths, torturing, fighting, and war. It's a lot to take in and think about. But you'll learn the meaning of The Hiding Place... and if Corrie ten Boom could find such a place in the midst of World War II... then so can we.The Hiding Place now ranks as one of my favorite books, and I will always treasure it. It's not for young readers, but makes a great read for high school students or adults."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is such a great, uplifting book.

They use top notch voice actors, sound effects and music. But of them all, The Hiding Place is the best I have heard so far, because besides being all of the above it is also a powerful, real life story. This is a story about courage in the face of evil, and I felt truly convicted at my own self-centeredness and selfishness compared to Betsie Ten Boom's selfless attitude of generosity, forgiveness and love. At one point the story had me literally in tears.There were times when the story was a bit confusing -- there were sequences that seemed disconnected from what was happening and seemed to be either nightmares or flashbacks (since I haven't yet read the original book I'm not sure what these sequences were supposed to be). Even so, this is an incredibly good story.I highly recommend this story for listeners of all ages. It is suitable even for young children (although parents may have to do a little explaining to give context to the story). No matter what our age, we can benefit from hearing the lives of the Ten Booms and the true spirit of Christian love, forgiveness, and generosity that they exemplified by their courageous acts."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Very inspiring book.

When we think of the devastating and inspiring stories that have come from World War II, we typically think of those told by the Jews that were in hiding or suffering in the concentration camps. However, in her book The Hiding Place, Corrie ten Boom shows us the life of one in the resistance.The book starts a few years before the invasion of Holland. It then flashes back to her childhood. She recounts the significant events in her life, including the deaths of family members and important lessons she learned from her wise father.When the occupation of Holland occurs, Corrie and her family open their home to those trying to escape persecution. Corrie quickly becomes a vital part of the \\"underground,\\" the system that helps Jews. The Ten Boom home, known as \\"The Beje,\\" becomes headquarters for the operation. Eventually they are caught and taken to jail.They are first sent to the federal prison for their crimes. After several months, they are transferred to a work camp, before their final destination at a brutal camp in Germany. Corrie goes through many unimaginable trials, some with her sister Betsie, and others completely alone.Through this book, I was completely amazed at how strong Corrie and Betsie stayed. They had their Bible and nothing else. I do not belong to the same church that this family did, but I still felt the belief in my own religion growing tremendously stronger. Their pure and simple faith in God is absolutely incredible. As they go through a living hell, in the German camp especially, their quest is to teach others about God. Members of various faiths come together for nightly religious meetings. \\"Side by side, in the sanctuary of God's fleas, Betsie and I ministered the Word of God to all in the room...we prayed beyond the concrete walls for the healing of Germany, of Europe, of the world.\\" It is easy to see the pure goodness, light and love that radiates from the characters in this book as they pray even for those who persecute them.Though there are many profound religious messages, this book can be appreciated and thoroughly enjoyed by audiences of all faiths. It is a book that all can relate to, no matter your cultural background. It inspires hope and joy when there seems to be only despair. It teaches to love, even when surrounded by hate. Everyone should read this book; it would inspire a greater humanity."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I expected a good book. It is extraordinary.

In the beginning, they were just a happy family who worked at a watchmakers store. Soon after Corrie was a little kid, war began in Holland. This book is a bibliography and a book that really describes her life and the life of a typical person that is around Germany.I liked this book because this story had a lot of action. This book took place mostly in Germany in the campgrounds where all the hostages were kept and forced into labor. This book really helped learn that forgiving is a key virtue to a successful future. Betsie, Corrie's sister always would say, \\"I pray that God truly forgives them\\". She would say this to the Nazi soldiers after they beat her. If I was Betsie I would never do that.Corrie on the other hand was like all the others. \\"I swear if she ever lays another hand on you...\\". I think I would say something like that if I was in the campgrounds and if a Nazi soldier started to beat my brother down. This book has many lessons and I have truly learned from it.My favorite part of the book was when most of the hostages got freed including Corrie Ten Boom and all of her family. Also my favorite part was when the Ten Booms were all called up to the captains room and they all got to see each other. That made me peaceful.

A very good lesson of what it means to be a Christian."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"After visiting my mother's birthplace of Haarlem, the Netherlands, in the summer of 2011, I decided it was time to revisit this book that I first read decades ago. My grandparents knew the Ten Boom family, and my family lived in Amsterdam during the horrible years of the Nazi occupation.I was fortunate to find this audiobook at our local library, and listened to it on my commute. Bernadette Dunne does an amazing job of bringing Corrie's story to life, even if she occasionally mispronounces some of the Dutch words.I remembered very few of the details of the story, but I was left with a strong impression of the power of forgiveness. That is still the underlying message of the whole book. Corrie starts the book out telling about her idyllic life in a very devout Christian family, where she is spurned by the one man she loves, so she devotes her adult life to becoming the first licensed woman watch repair person in the Netherlands. This life is shattered when the Germans invade Holland in 1940, and Corrie gradually becomes involved in the Dutch Underground, because of her compassion for all humans, but especially her Jewish friends and neighbors who begin disappearing around her.She is eventually rounded up by the Germans, and spends a long time in a Dutch concentration camp before being transferred to Ravensbruck in Germany. It is there, through her beloved sister, that she begins to learn the lesson of forgiveness, as well as gratitude, in horrendous conditions. After the war, she spreads her message of healing to those around her.My father has written about the war in his memoirs, and I recently rereadThe Diary of a Young Girl (Everyman's Library (Cloth)), and I was moved by how much these documents support each other in both details of the war, and how people in Holland dealt with it. Furthermore, since I recently walked the streets of Haarlem, I could visualize many of the events that took place in Corrie's book. Don't let anyone ever tell you this never happened.Some readers may be put off by Corrie's evangelistic zeal when she's in the concentration camps, but that is how she was able to survive the ordeal, and apparently help many others.I have survived many things in this life, nothing like the horrible war that my parents, and Corrie's family faced, but I can attest that it is the power of gratitude and forgiveness that enables you to get through them and heal from them. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is one of my top 5 favorite books! I loved it when I read it in High School, loved it when I read it in college. Now, years later, I have used this book in summer reading classes for high school kids. We read it and compared it with NIGHT. It was an excellent contrast! The Hiding Place is so uplifting and hopeful!! Beautiful story about a horrific event!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"One of the best books ever. It reads like a story and is captivating, while at the same time not only teaches about forgiveness, but inspires us to forgive. If anyone is suffering from bitterness about something that happened to them in the past (probably everyone), they should read this book. It is also historical... teaches about the love of God... Among others, every new Christian should read this as well as Through Gates of Splendor by Elizabeth Elliott and many other Christian and missionary biographies such as Hudson Taylor, etc."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"As a lover of literature, I consider myself to be a voracious reader with a lot of books under my belt. Also, I'm a rather fickle person who rarely has a favorite of anything. However, this book is by far the best book I have ever read and I absolutely love it and recommend it. The story is incredible and offers a unique perspective into what it felt like to live under the harsh rule of Hitler during the Holocaust. Apart from the storyline, there is so much to be learned from its characters that I found myself challenged and exhorted. I've already read this book 6 times and here I am, buying it online, ensuring its residence upon my shelves. Buy it, read it."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is a must read! The faith of a family during some of the most horrible conditions imaginable and the ability to forgive, and desire the good of their enemy's even when their life was at risk is a calling we as Christians need to understand and allow to penetrate our hearts. I am so thankful to have read this book and hope that it impacts my life in ways that will impact others."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"A truly inspirational story about a family risking everything to hide and protect others in their Dutch town during the Nazi occupation of WWII. The teller of the story and her older sister ultimately ended up in a German concentration camp. But the beauty of the story is how they managed to shine a light during a terribly dark time by conveying the words God's love to all who would listen."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I just finished The Hiding Place last night. What a memorable book. It will give the reader courage to see past what is going on in their life, to have hope that things will get better. It will make you believe that God does have every step of your life in his hands, and that He has a plan.This book does not focus on the horror of the war. Of course, the entire book revolves around the war, hiding Jews, living in constant fear of being found and ultimately, prison camp. But, please read it and see if you agree with me; it doesn't dwell (for lack of a better word) on the war or bitter life of concentration camps, the way most Holocaust books do. No, it fills you with hope, shows you how to see the good, the very good, in the worst of situations.For me, I didn't have very good parents, which is evident in my novels. I admit I've been seeking something all my life, and it's the love of a good, strong family. Parents. Sisters, brothers, cousins. But The Hiding Place definitely takes you to a home and a life where you feel you have all of that. You feel the intense bond of family, the love of a special, wonderful sister, the warmth of a town that is connected by fear and hope, trust and the unknown.This is no Anne Frank, either. In just about any way other than the obvious, this is not even a love story, as in a romance. It's unique, and stands on it's own, yet it's familiar and cozy, even with the war raging.I would say to do yourself a favor, at the risk of sounding cliche, and read The Hiding Place. It's full of advice you wish your family could give you, and hope that you may need one day. Find it here. I'd even go so far as to say, keep a copy around, for reading it over and over."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book has stood the test of time, and it's just as powerful now, as it was when it first came out. It is a horrifying and gripping story that had to be told, and every one of us should read it."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I've read this book many times. The heroism and faith it recounts are always moving, and it's also a story with a lot of action and excitement. For those unfamiliar with the story, it tells how a middle-aged watchmaker and her family conspire to hide Jews from the Nazis in World War II Netherlands, and how their faith triumphed even after they were caught and sent to Ravensbruck. Nadia May's narration is superb."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Book was delivered very timely and in great condition. No library is complete without this incredible book - a must read!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Every person should read this book. The book tells the story of two sisters who are arrested for hiding Jewish people during WWII. It is one of the most inspirational stories I have ever read. Would make a wonderful gift for someone."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is a must read!! I couldn't put it down.What an inspiring true story of a woman-Corrie, her sister-Betsy and their Father. It's a book that shakes us to the core of who we really are and what God-given capabilities are in all of us if pressed into a hard place. The Ten Boom family had an incredible love for people and the God they served. This love was evident in the way they lived their lives not thinking of themselves but putting others first at any cost. A true testimony of the love of Jesus Christ within the heart of believers.Friend this book will challenge you to walk in new realms in God."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I bought the book The Hiding Place because I had the lost the one I had. I greatly enjoyed the book. It is well written, and Historical. Her story is one that should never be forgotten. The book was in great shape when I got it."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is the first book you should read to get to know Corrie Ten Boom, a woman whose life took a dramatic turn when her family was caught up in a turbulent and tragic time when the Nazi's occupied Holland. Corrie, her father and sister were morally convicted to harbor and hide Jews who were facing arrest and deportation. After being betrayed, they were sent to jail, and eventually Corrie and Betsie were sent to Ravensbruck, a German concentration/death camp. Throughout her life, Corrie held onto her Saviour Jesus Christ, and found out that there is no pit too deep that God is not there to pull you out.Corrie is completed honest and transparent in describing her life. She does not sugarcoat her own mistakes, and the bitterness and hatred she harbored in her heart. She does not make herself out to be a saint. But as a real human being experiencing the depravity of human sin, she in her own power could not forgive or love her enemies. She was incredulous upon hearing her sister Betsie pray for the Nazi's, and as Betsie got physically weaker and weaker, she was strengthened spiritually, encouraging Corrie to let go her hatred, and to spread the word of God's love through the most horrible circumstances. Betsie, before she was set free (passed away), also inspired Corrie to open a home for displaced people after the war. Miraculously Corrie was set free and able to make her way home. She fulfills Betsie's dreams of opening a rest home, and ministering to people who had suffered so much at the hands of evil.The book ends in 1946. To find out about Corrie's return to Germany and her ministering to former prison guards, make sure to read \\"Tramp for the Lord.\\""},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Corrie Ten Boom and her family exhibited true Christian love. They did not shrink from their duty to hide the persecuted Jews, nor did they lack courage as they were arrested and placed in concentration camps. Several family members died, with only Corrie surviving due to miraculous intervention. Did she harbor bitterness? Yes. But her faith in the Lord God Jehovah sustained her through this difficult time. She came to the place in her spiritual life where God changed her heart, enabling to forgive her captors. This is truly a story that will warm your heart and point you to a personal Savior, Jesus Christ, who loves and cares for His children. Read how God directs their paths, even when imprisoned, and blesses them mightily despite their circumstances."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. It is full of hope and joy in the midst of a desperately horrible situation. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place is a great book for any Christian to read. It is an amazing first hand account of a citizen during WWII. Reading the difficulties that Corrie and her family went through and the brave decisions that they made is inspiring. I don't know that I would have the courage to do what they did."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"One of the greatest Christian stories of all time. A few flaws in \\"theology,\\" but they are insignificant in the shadow of a real story about real people in a real crisis in history. In dark times, true Christians shine like stars in the night. What more can I say? Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place is a powerful story of courage, strength, faith and human kindness. It is an incredible true story of finding the best in people and truly loving your neighbor. A quick read that is worth every moment. You'll want to keep it to read again."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is the best book I have ever read in my life! It touches your heart and soul. For anyone who wants to know what true faith and hope is. A real story that should not be missed out on."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place, an excellent written true story. It is a great story of concentration camps with Nazi guards during World WarII. The extreme horror of people involved. Corrie Ten Boom, lives a simple life, and with her family habor Jewish refuges in their home. Her belief in God brings hope to others."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Well documented life of a very special person. It shows up the tragedy of war and racism. It shows that Faith is so important in situations that Corrie finds herself in."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Love this book. It is a great read for your kids and really describes the events in WWII. My son had to read this book for school. He really enjoyed the contents. It is well written."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place describes in detail the simplicity of this spiritual family until Nazis begin to takeover Holland and they are leaders in finding safe places for Haarlem's Jews to hide until they are caught and Corrie and her family are taken to prison and later a concentration camp but through everything she is able to find that, no matter what, God is with her.My favorite part of the book is that it is not preachy but Corrie shares her searching, her fears, her doubt and because of that the story feels more real. You can feel how much her and her sister are going through and, for me, it felt very close to any story of life with suffering in it. The part of her story before the Nazis tells HOW her family became so spiritual and had the strength to find God in times of unbelievable suffering.I'm not a Christian and yet I found this story really close to my own faith. I liked how accepting they were of the Jewish people passing in and out of their house without any attempt to convert. That seemed to be a big part of the way their family lived, to love God, serve others and learn from their scriptures."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is absolutely fascinating and well worth the time. I purchased several copies for the book table at church."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book will inspire others for decades to come. I though the title simply was literal - hiding Jews, their arrest, and experience in the camps. Although that is what happened, by the end of the book, it took on another meaning. The Lord's Will should be our \\"hiding place.\\" We should not live in the \\"What if's\\" of life. God already knows what is going to happen, we just have to trust Him through the process. Corrie and her sister did just that. What an inspiring story!!!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Even the \\"forwards\\" we're amazing!I can't even find the words to describe Corrie's story ...I am so thankful she wrote it."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is a wonderful book-sad, alarming, raw. If you find the Holocaust an important piece of world history, this is a must read. If you think it never happened, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I recently listened to an audio dramatization of The Hiding Place that made me want to read the original book. All I can say is, what a wonderful story. Some other reviewers have complained that the book starts slow, but for me that was not the case at all. I found the story engrossing from the first page to the last.Corrie Ten Boom was an amazing person who came from a family of amazing people. Their compassion was truly remarkable in any age, but especially stood out during the time and place in which they lived. In The Hiding Place she recounts in fascinating detail how one act of kindness led her to eventually become the ringleader of a huge underground network to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied Holland. Then, after her home is raided and she and her family are arrested, she recounts in equally fascinating detail the horrors of life in concentration camps.What sets this story apart from that of all other concentration camp survivors is that it is not just about survival; it is an amazing story of a person's character growing and faith flourishing despite the horrific conditions. Corrie's sister Betsie is, from the start, a unique person whose compassion is especially directed at the perpetrators even more than the victims (even including the man who informed on them), and who sees every horrible situation as an opportunity for ministry. As close as they are, even Corrie herself is continually amazed at her sister's selfless way of looking at every circumstance and person. However, as time goes on Corrie herself is transformed by life in the concentration camp until she, too, is determined to minister and share Christ's love with everyone she can, not just during her incarceration but also after the war when so many who were so emotionally damaged must try to resume some sort of normal life. Amazingly, Corrie emerged from her ordeal a better person than she was before (as one example, she talks about struggling to overcome the self-centered absorption that is one of the effects of life in a concentration camp).Such faith and love was both convicting (could I be so unselfish in those circumstances?) and inspiring. This is a fast read, not only because it's not all that long but because the story is so captivating. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"As a home school parent, I believe this book is a must read for everyone. We tend to take our religious freedom for granted, but his book will make us stop & think what it would be like if our freedom to read our Bible, pray, or serve God in any way was taken from us. Our family reads this book aloud about once a year. It is a great reminder to thank God for freedom!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is inspiring. It showed a history of our world many have forgotten about but it did it in a way that encouraged hope and dedication to making a change in our world. The faith of those who suffered these atrocities caused me to examine mine more deeply."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is an amazing story. I read it years ago and have just read it again. I got so much more from it this time! Everyone shouldjust sit down and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"What a refreshing re-read (after 40 odd years). Corrie ten Boom's story, as told in 'The Hiding Place', remains one of the most influential and inspirational books in all ways. In her words - \\"our only safety is to remain in God's will\\". Her entire book is testimony to this. Her survival through WW2, and the ten Boom helping hand in over 800 lives (and countless more since) remains one of the most remarkable stories of all time. A great read for young and old. Difficult to put down (excuse the cliche!)."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"What an outstanding book. So glad I got to read it. Many years have passed since it was written. I am just glad my aunt told me about it. It is absolutely one of my top five books."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"What an amazing story about the human spirit. I laughed, cried and just spend time in meditation after this book. I don't know why I didn't read this book sooner!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I enjoyed this story and it inspired my faith in the Lord. A wonderful testament to Gods work in such tragic circumstances and how the power of God is stronger than anything we face here on earth. From this story I realized that if we believe then anything is possible. I now need to read her other books. A Great Read and I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Wonderful reminder of how blessed we are as Christians in America.

Corrie managed to stay positive throughout her ordeal - an inspiration for all of us. The story was told well, easy to read, without ever being boring. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I had never heard of this woman before a friend mentioned this book. It's sad to think that a remarkable story like this might disappear in the annals of history. What stood out for me was the spiritual journey of this woman who was a believer, read her Bible every day, did good works, but that her relationship with the Lord was going to get so much deeper and the journey is breathtaking. And that it is at a time when most people would think that not much more can happen in the winter of their lives (after 40). Cannot wait to read more of her books. You will not regret taking the time to absorb this story. Be blessed!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"My first introduction to the The Hiding Place was over 30 years ago. I was greatly impacted then and have been ever since. This is a book I choose to read again and again. The lessons of faith are major - the honesty, integrity and vulnerability of the Ten Boom family, maintained through the worst of times, is a standard for us all to reach towards. It is the depicting of lives like these that demonstrate to me how relevant The Bible really is. While the experiences of the Ten Boom family were horrific, the writers have managed to convey these times without recourse to extreme description - we are given a clear understanding without being subjected to the deep ugliness of the times, and the grace and glory of God are given a higher priority than the evil in which these dear people lived. May those times never happen again would be my prayer - but..."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"An excellent read about Holland during WWII, but so much more! Intrigue, suspense, and a first hand description of Nazi concentration camps."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Such an inspirational story! Should be on everyone's must read list! Only comment was wish there was more detail, but was wrote so long after it happened; but that also could make it more appealing to more people."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This was a great biography and I can only wish that I had courage like the Ten Boom family. A need to read book in this day and age."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This story of Corrie Ten Boom's life is so inspiring. It is one of my favorite books. And I do not read a lot of biography's. I feel in love with her and her strong faith."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The fascinating true story of a Dutch family that hid Jews during the Holocaust/German occupation of Holland.As soon as I read the last page I quickly ordered several copies for Christmas presents. I've always loved stories of Holocaust survivors...but this one was extra special because of the extreme faith that enabled the protagonists to endure - making it not only a story of unspeakable brutality and torture but a powerful love story of the intimacy between these two women and God, and what that faith enabled them to accomplish; it was incredible! There was nothing sappy or churchy about this story..very well written, absorbing, touching, and so very inspiring. Before I take it back to the library I'm going to copy many of the things Corrie's sister Betsy says during their imprisonment at the camp...there are certain things you never want to forget!One of those books that changes you...I highly recommend. One of my favorites, along with Elie Weisel's \\"Night\\"."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"It took a few minutes to &#34;get into&#34; this format, but once that happened, I thoroughly enjoyed the radio theatre performance."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I read this years ago and now am passing it on to another generation. Ms. Ten Boom suffers for her protection of Jews, loses her family, yet God frees her to do a wonderful work for Him. This book is a lesson about how God carries us through problems and crisis; it is also a stern look at what happened to innocent people and makes us think about the world in which we currently live."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is an essential account of the brave Dutch ten Booms who risked their lives for Jews. So moving and haunting. A wonderful addition to writing about the Holocaust. Gives a beautiful Christian perspective."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book touched my heart and my spirit. It opened my eyes to growing my relationship with my Lord and SaviourJesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Have you ever wondered how it was like in Harlem during World War II when the Germans start to take control of Europe? The Hiding Place by Corrie Ten Boom is a great book to read.I highly recommend this book because it tells what Harlem was like and how hard it was to live. The Hiding Place also has pictures of what the camps were like. The book is also a great source of information not because it has facts, but the person who wrote it was actually in a camp in 1942. This book is a true-life experience of Corrie Ten Boom&#65533;s life before, during, and after the war.In the book the author is trying to tell you that prejudice is wrong no mater what color, customs, or beliefs someone has. She also says to be nice and help people when they are in need. The author is also very religious. She believes that if you are nice to people they will be nice back. She believes that the reason she survived the concentration camp is because she never gave up on believing that she would get out alive.One of my favorite scenes in The Hiding Place is when they start building the hiding place behind the wall with bricks so the Germans can&#65533;t find it that easily. The family makes the hiding place in the highest place in the house. The family hides lots of Jewish families from the Germans, but one day German solders show up and raid the Boom&#65533;s house. Find out what the German soldiers find, and take the family to a concentration camp.Another one of my favorite scenes is when Peter steals ration cards for the Jews and people who need them. He steals the ration cards because during the war the people got less food and supplies then they did before the war. Ration cards are like food stamps but on cards. You can trade in ration cards for food and supplies. Even though Peter knew what would happen if he got caught, he did it because it was the right thing to do besides letting people die.The Hiding Place is not only a great book because of the excitement but because of the forgiving of one woman to many men who put her and her family down."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Our opinion of the book The Hiding Place was well written because it came from the heart. Corrie Ten Boom talks about her life during the Holocaust and having the experience of being in a concentration camp. We thought the book was very informational because it gave details about how others besides the Jewish people were treated and how they felt. We did not care for the beginning of the book because it was confusing and very boring. They kept going back and fourth from her childhood to the present. The best part about the book was how Corrie and her family cared more about the Jewish people then themselves. For example, in the book when Corrie's family is going through the registration process Corrie's dad is told that he can leave the concentration camp as long as he doesn't help anymore Jews. But his response to that is, &quot;if I go home and people come to my door a knocking I will let them in.&quot;The Hiding Place is different from other Holocaust books because it's about people that aren't Jewish and how they get put in concentration camps. Once you get into the book it really keeps your attention and it's hard to put down. It's very interesting when Corrie explains how they put in the &quot;secret room&quot; so that no matter how hard the Nazis try they won't be able to find it. In other words, we highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a heart warming true story about courage and the helping of others."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Ten Boom story will hopefully be read for eternity, as it constantly reminds us what happens when prejudices overcome common decency. The minority populations of Jews, gypsies, and disabled suffered greatly under the Nazi regime. This is how one family decided to respond to the crisis. They could have closed their door to the Jews, as many others did. In our society today, prejudices remain towards many who are different. As this book tells us, HOW we respond is the ultimate victory over evil."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The novel &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; is an exciting stimulating book.

How Corrie lived through the things she did just amazes me but even more, I'm her age now in life and to think of doing even a fraction of what she had accomplished is just incredible. Wish my faith was as strong and my life was a help to others as her's has been to thousands."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is breathtaking. The story of Corrie Ten Boom and her family and there dealings with the Nazis is so inspiring that I doubt that it will ever become passe. This is the one to read."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I read the book in 8th grade and now am listening to the drama for the first time. Amazing story of forgiveness. Would make a perfect gift for those who love Focus on the Family Radio Theater (check out the Chronicles of Narnia :-)"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I was delighted when I saw that this book was available for Kindle. I like to read good books/stories over and over. This book is about a time we all need to remember. Remember how blessed we are to have the freedom we now have. Corrie and her family are symbols of Christian love and selflessness. Corrie Ten Boom and her family were imprisioned for one crime only- helping Jews during WWII. They hid Jews and helped some to freedom and safety. For this Corrie and family were imprisioned (her father died a short time after his arrest- he was in his 80's!). Corrie and her sister Betsie were then taken and put in a concentration camp. They were not Jews but they believed in their Bible and assisted God's chosen people however they could. They paid dearly. This story is one that everyone should read. History has a distressing way of repeating itself. Could this happen again? Corrie survived her ordeal and spent the rest of her life helping others and spreading God's word. What an incredible story about an incredible family."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Love this book. I have given it as a git many times.

I have read the reviews and they are my sentiments as well. I first read Corrie's book when I was a new Christian in the 4th grade. I read it over and over. Many times during my straying years after highschool excerpts from the book would come back to me and would put me back into perspective and remind me that God still loves me."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I saw the movie &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; in 5th grade. I didn't pay much attention to it at the time, being so young. Now, I am in 11th grade and have read the book at least four times through, and I am now searching the Internet for further information. This book was a great inspiration to me. I very much admire Corrie ten Boom for her bravery and her trust in God to take care of her and her family. She broke all the rules of the German government to obey her Heavenly Authority, and that's something you don't see much of anymore. I am so awed over this woman and her story that I am now planning a trip to Haarlem some time after college. God bless all the men and women involved in spreading Corrie's story across the world!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"While this is disturbing, it's also uplifting because the book is written form her perspective as a Christian and it portrays that God is in control even under the most difficult circumstances."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"With the recent events in Kosovo, I have devoloped an interest in the tradgedy of the Holocaust. Being a very busy 14-year-old, I don't normally have time to sit down and read, but I made an exception for this book. After reading of all of the horrible events that took place, I have a new perspective on life. I now use every waking moment to enjoy everything I have, especially freedom. I also have learned that God knows best, and He will provide. No matter how terrible things get, He is always watching over us. We should always be thankful for everything He gives us, whether it's a nuisance, such as a flea, or just the chance to enjoy another day, alive and well."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I highly recomend this book to all those who are ready to open their hearts to what man must do to be more Christ like.The effort to save their fellow jews from the terrible masacre of the Holocaust find the Ten Boom's in a situation that allow them to save lives.

We enjoyed the book because it explained the struggles through the Holocaust. The point of view is from an underground family, risking their lives to hide the Jews (they were not Jewish themselves.) Be ready for a suspenseful and touching autobiography, as you live your life through Corrie ten Boom's eyes. She goes through many hardships during this horrid time, keeping both her and her family's faith. We hope you decide to pick up this book and read, read, read!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I watched the movie of The Hiding Place in seventh grade. I didn't pay thta much attention because we watched so many movies in that class. Obviously something caught my eye becasue when as a ninth grader I was to do a biography I chose this book. There were parts were I was laughing and others where I was crying. I have heard about the Holocaust many times but never, NEVER has it touched my heart like this book. Between Corrie helping those who she had no particular reason to but she did anyway, and then when she was in the camp and she taught the women with her that God was there for them if they just asked. I am very glad that I chose to read this book because it can teach the world how to be a better plce if we just listen."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This classic work touches on so many feelings and thoughts. For me, the most interesting part was the one where she came across the SS man who had been at Ravensbruck (p. 238). Hatred and revenge came to Corrie's heart. She could not bring herself to shake his hand. She realized that she could not forgive him in her own power, and so she prayerfully asked for the Lord's forgiveness to flow through her. At once, her hatred melted away and was replaced by overwhelming love. She realized that the Lord, who commands us to love our enemies, also gives us the means to do this."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"In Corrie Ten Boom's book \\"The Hiding Place\\", she gives an exciting account of how during the terrifying years of the Holocaust and World War 11 her entire family strove to hide as many Jews as they could from Nazi forces.This is a life filled with bravery, courage, and most of all COMPASSION. As I flipped the pages, I was increasingly amazed by Corrie and her family's unshakeable belief in God and how this very belief gave them the incredible courage to hide Jewish individuals in their home/watch repair business in Holland during the most hellish years of the war.As their world and country around them transformed with the evil the Nazi invaders wrought, Corrie and the Ten Booms stayed on the path they felt God meant for them to be on. The penalty of hiding Jews during World War 11 was great for them such as imprisonment and death in the concentration camps. Amazingly enough, they persevered under the worst of circumstances to provide a safe haven for the Jews in their home referred to simply as the \\"Beje\\".Unfortunately, their daring rescue missions were discovered by the Nazis and the Ten Booms were all imprisoned in the worst of jails and later, the two sisters in the infamous Ravensbruck concentration camp. However, amidst the cold, hunger, and despair these two strong women endured, their faith in God and belief in what they were doing ever constant.One of the strongest impressions I got from this powerful account is the resistance the Ten Boom sisters had from becoming embittered during their imprisonment. Their compassion while experiencing such intense evil is very awe-inspiring, one of my favorite parts being the story Corrie Ten Boom writes of her sister Betsie sharing her tiny bottle of desperately needed medicine with fellow sick prisoners.Bottom line, if you want to read a book about the breadth of human compassion, love, and resistance in the face of unspeakable evil, I highly recommend Corrie Ten Boom's beautiful memoir \\"The Hiding Place\\". Corrie Ten Boom will always be remembered as one of the bravest heroines in modern history."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"As I began to read this book, for a school project, I immediatly liked it; The story of a dutch family who took care of Jews during World War II. The main character, Corrie Ten Boom, also the author of this wonderful novel, lived with her father, and sister at a place called the Beje, connected to her father's watchmaking shop. They began to take Jews in and care for them. As time goes on they begin, with Corrie Ten Boom as the ring leader, to grow deeper into this underground project. A secret room is built, ration cards are stolen, homes are found, drills are run for the six jews who began to permantly stay at the Beje. They are finally found out and are arrested and taken to several prison camps, although the jews hiding werer never found by the gestapo. I must have read four-fifths through this book before I realized that it wasn't just a deep story of a caring dutch family who went through so much suffering just to help others, but that it was also proof that God does work miracles and that he does watch over us, no matter what we believe. Being a Christian myself, I was touched by this book, and when I realized how God was working in Corrie Ten Boom and her sister, Betsie Ten Boom's, lives I was touched deeply and immediatly started ranting to my mother about the miracles that had happened in the book. There are at least four instances in 'The Hiding Place' where acts of God are shown in miracles. I deeply suggest this book to anyone and everyone who has ever understood what it's like to suffer for others, and for everyone who hasn't."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Corrie Ten Boom said it best in the beginning of the book when she points out that every person, place, and thing you encounter in your life is God preparing you for the plans He has for you. I believe God meant for millions be to touched by Corrie's life story. The over all message in this book is forgiveness, and how it is possible, under impossible circumstances. Not only does the Lord desire us to forgive, but He made it possible to do so by providing the love to do it. Corrie and her family lived sacrificial lives, but more importantly they were obedient to God, whom they knew loved them very much. Time and time again, Corrie's life was saved by her obedience and tenacious way of looking to the Lord for guidance and help. These people KNEW and lived God's love and it infected others around them. This story was just as much about Betsie, Corrie's sister, as it was Corrie. Betsie was a resilient woman who loved the Lord so much that she even thanked Him for fleas! Corrie's entire family had a respectful fear of the Lord that is lacking in today's world. This story helps us to realize how very comfortable we are in this material world of ours. Previous to reading this book, I read \\"Survival in Auschwitz\\" by Primo Levi, who was an Italian Jewish survivor of Auschwitz (hence the name). It was nice to read both books in order to get a view from both the Christian and Jewish perspective. This great evil during WWII was not just against one race, it was the enemy of the human race. While some humans were inprisoned and/or killed, others were alive yet dead inside as they gave into hate and bitterness. Corrie and her family saw this great evil and clinged to the hope that if these people were capable of so much hate, then they were equally capable of so much love. They compassionately prayed for the ones they suffered along with, as well as for the ones causing the suffering. \\"The Hiding Place\\" is a wonderful book in which we can learn to forgive those that have hurt us, and love others the way God loves us. Get it! Read it! Tell a friend!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Stop what you are doing this very moment and buy or borrow &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; I have just turned the final page of this book and my eyes are still wet with tears. &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; is the incredible true story of the ten Boom family whose strong faith in God led them to save many people during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The central theme of this book is that God has a plan for all of us and when we truely listen to that plan and follow it wonderful things will happen in our lives. Even when you feel that you are in the deepest pit of dispair, Jesus is there waiting to take your pain upon his shoulders. This book is too important not to read. Buy it, borrow it, either way your life will be enriched by reading this book. It won't take you long to read this short book, but its message will stay with you forever!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Corrie Ten Boom and her sister Betsie showed absolute compassion for everyone. Even though her family was thrown into prison, and later the 'camps', she was able to forgive the man who turned her in to the Nazis. She and her sister were the only members of her family to enter the concentration camps, everyone else was freed shortly after their imprisonment. Betsie died, but Corrie never lost hope. She knew inside that Betsie was in Heaven waiting for their reunion sfter death. Their faith was astounding, and surprising. They shared their faith with others, including Nazi guards, and the Jews in Ravensbruck. As you read through the book you begin to wonder, 'do I do help others enough.' Corrie's life was dedicated to the service of her Father in Heaven, even though tragedy and anguish struck her at every turn in her life"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"One of my friends came to Christ after reading this book. For myself, I never read it without being deeply moved at both the ten Booms' firm faith in Jesus and Jesus' tender care of them through \\"many hardships, toils, and snares.\\" The story makes clear both the spiritual peace that can be found in our Hiding Place, and the historical and daily reality of His miraculous presence and power. This account is at times whimsical, at others tearful, but always down to earth. Here is one excerpt:\\"Fridays--the recurrent humiliation of medical inspection. The hospital corridor in which we waited was unheated, and a fall chill had settled into the walls. Still we were forbidden even to wrap ourselves in our own arms, but had to maintain our erect, hands-at-sides position as we filed slowly past a phalanx of grinning guards. How there could have been any pleasure in the sight of these stick-thin legs and hunger-bloated stomachs I could not imagine. Surely there is no more wretched sight than the human body unloved and uncared for. Nor could I see the necessity for the complete undressing: when we finally reached the examing room a doctor looked down each throat, another--a dentist presumably--at our teeth, a third in between each finger. And that was all. We trooped again down the long, cold corridor and picked up our X-marked dresses at the door.But it was one of these mornings while we were waiting, shivering, in the corridor, that yet another page in the Bible leapt into life for me.He hung naked on the cross.I had not known--I had not thought. . . . The paintings, the carved crucifixes showed at the least a scrap of cloth. But this, I suddenly knew, was the respect and reverence of the artist. But oh--at the time itself, on that other Friday morning--there had been no reverence. No more than I saw in the faces around us now.I leaned toward Betsie, ahead of me in line. Her shoulder blades stood out sharp and thin beneath her blue-mottled skin.'Betsie, they took His clothes too.'Ahead of me I heard a little gasp. \\"Oh, Corrie. And I never thanked Him...\\""},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I've known some things about Corrie Ten Boom's story for years. I've even shared with other people the story about getting the ticket before you get on the train (and not before - in other words, we don't get ready for things way beforehand - God will give us the strength to deal with what we need to exactly when we need it). Then I watched the movie - but I hadn't read the book. Til now!When I read, I use those Post-It arrows to mark favorite passages in books I'm reading. This book has tons of markers sticking out of this book! This story of Corrie and her family during World War II has impacted me greatly. I've been talking about this book to anyone who will listen!Here are some of my favorite life lessons from The Hiding Place:Some knowledge is &quot;too heavy&quot; for us to carry. When Corrie was a child, she and her father were on a train ride. She asked a question that had an adult theme, and Corrie's father then asked her to carry his heavy suitcase. When Corrie tried and said it was too heavy, her father said that some knowledge is too heavy for children and that he would carry it for Corrie until she was older and ready to hear it. In the same way, God carries our &quot;too heavy&quot; burdens.Happiness isn't something that depends on our surroundings, but it's something we make inside ourselves. This is one of Corrie's sister Betsie's statements. Betsie was a real example to Corrie - she always prayed for her enemies and put the best construction on things. Betsie died in the concentration camp at Ravensbruck.Betsie said, &quot;There are no &quot;ifs&quot; in God's world. And no places that are safer than other places. The center of His will is our only safety. Oh, Corrie, let us pray that we will always know it.&quot;The bottle of vitamins which did not run out until there was a fresh supply is an amazing story of God's provision. Compare this situation to 1 Kings 17:7-24 when Elijah was staying with the widow of Zarephath. She had a small amount of flour and oil, but the supplies did not run out. After Corrie received a new source of vitamins, the bottle which had supplied sustaining drops for so long was suddenly totally empty!When in prison in Holland, Corrie had received 4 gospels, but not a whole Bible. She read these and then later she passed them out page by page. How we take our Bibles for granted! Later, her sister Nollie sent her a complete Bible and Corrie didn't know how she could get it into the concentration camp when they were transported to Germany. As it turned out, all the other women were &quot;patted down&quot; and searched, but no one touched Corrie (she was hiding her Bible under her dress) and no one even seemed to see her!When Corrie and Betsie read the Bible in the concentration camp in Ravensbruck, people gathered around. The words would be translated into many languages and they could hear so many women hearing the Gospel in their own language. Quoting from the book, &quot;The blacker the night around us grew, the brighter and truer and more beautiful burned the Word of God.&quot;Corrie and Betsie gave thanks to God for the lice that infested their barracks because the guards stayed away from that area. This enabled the sisters to conduct Bible Studies without being found out!I hope that these examples have piqued your interest in this marvelous book! Be sure to see the movie too, but be sure to read the book!Please see my reviews of other Christian books!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is a true story of Great Faith during one of the most devastating times of our world"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I just finished reading this book.

Raised a middleclass Dutch Christian she helps Jews escape the depredations of the occupying army, and discovers and deepens her faith at the same time. How Corrie and her sister helped others was touching. How she manages to keep her faith and for it to deepen was a miracle.I do think she may have over emphasized the importance of telling the truth to the 'enemy' in regards with her sister Nallie, who refuses to lie and thus other are arrested or brought to the attention of the Germans. To me that seems a selfish and prideful act. I believe what Dietrich Boenhoeffer states that under certain circumstances such as war, lying is a moral obligation to help people survive, and lying to the enemy is a duty.Overall this was a gripping read/listen. I was moved to tears on several occasions."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Title: The Hiding PlaceAuthor: Corrie ten BoomPaperback: 272 pagesPublisher: Chosen Books; 35th Anniversary EditionISBN: 0-8007-9405-2January 2006, $12.99Genre: Christian/Memoir\\"Corrie ten Boom was a Dutch watchmaker who became a heroine of the Resistance, a survivor of Hitler's concentration camps, and one of the most remarkable evangelists of the twentieth century. In World War II she and her family risked their lives to help Jews and underground workers escape from the Nazis, and for their work they were tested in the infamous Nazi death camps. Only Corrie among her family survived to tell the story of how faith ultimately triumphs over evil.\\"~from the back cover of the 35th anniversary edition----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In today's modern culture, where selfishness is touted as righteousness and the mere mention of suffering elicits uncomfortable squirms; where youth have lost any pretense of respect for the elderly and democracy is unraveling at the seams, the life of the ten Boom family stands out in sharp contrast to the ideals of our morally corrupt society. The ten Boom's unshakable faith and courage in the face of the cruelest world power in history is a testament to the absolute power of God's sovereignty and love in a world of hate.This is a book that this hurting world so desperately needs. Travel with Corrie back into the heart of the darkness of Ravensbruck, one of the most infamous women's death camps in Nazi Germany, and discover how bright God's light can shine amidst the horror of Satan's most heinous machinery. In this book you will meet Betsie, Corrie's sister who traveled along side her with indomitable spirit through the hell of Ravensbruck, Nollie, another of the sisters who refused to tell a lie, and Casper ten Boom, Corrie's father of priceless wisdom who counted it an honor to die for the sake of God's people. These, and many more in the ten Boom family, have become examples of how we should live - totally dependent on God and thankful in all circumstances, looking to Him for strength and courage.The story of The Hiding Place is as relevant today as it was during World War II. This book should be on every Christian's shelf, not gathering dust, to serve as a reminder that \\"there is no pit so deep that He is not deeper still.\\" It is the single most important message that can be delivered to the broken soul of humanity, and I can say that I have never read anything short of the Gospel that conveys this as poignantly as The Hiding Place.Note: Book statistics are for the 35th anniversary edition of The Hiding Place. I highly recommend this newest edition because of some new features that have been added, such as a newly designed cover, forward by Joni Eareckson Tada, afterward by John and Elizabeth Sherrill, a ten Boom family tree, and a complete timeline of Corrie's life.Part of: Stand Alone"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I ordered this book for my daughter for school.

It impacted me then as a young teen (\\"how could people let this happen\\"). To read it again as an adult is just as compelling and inspirational but with much more awareness of current attrocities and human suffering being glossed over by media and governments today. To realize not only were those that were (and are)suffering were ordinary people simply living their lives but that those who tortured and killed them had started out as Doctor's, scientists, farmers, teachers...just ordinary people like you or your neighbor, indoctrinated in a single generation to become a corporate tool of obscene cruelty.

Their home was always open to whoever was hungry or in need. Therefore, it was a natural transition to take in Jews during the German occupation of Holland.Corrie ten Boom, a spinster in her fifties, was a key contact whose home - indeed, within the wall of her very bedroom! was a safe haven for Jews. Devoutly Christian, she, along with her father and sister Betsie, simply believed in doing the right thing, as God's work. They, along with perhaps thousands of others in Holland, were captured and spent time in concentration camps.Betsie, perhaps a saint? found good in everything: every blessing and every inconvenience. Her faith kept Corrie going throughout the worst of everything.This book is incredibly well-written. It's only the second book on the Holocaust that I've read that's written in the point of view of a non-Jew (the first being Miep Gies's \\"Anne Frank Remembered\\"). While the author is very religious, and cites her faith as the spirit that kept her going, this book does not force religion down the reader's throat - rather, it simply tries to show that faith, and the act of doing good, can help us overcome the most horrible of circumstances.This book belongs in the library of every reader interested in survivors of the most horrific events of modern time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This true story of faith provides a first-hand view of the horrors of WWII.

I learned so much about Holland being overtaken, the underground system of Jews, and the hardships of the innocent people. Corrie ten Boom's outlook is so positive that it really sparks you to read more about the whole ordeal. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is an amazing book. I truly feel bad for people who did not understand it's depth. Many said it was boring until it came to the killing. There is so much wrong with that statement, I don't know where to begin! This was a TRUE story, about a REAL person, who suffered tremendous amounts of pain, that we could not even imagine. She did not complain like i KNOW most of us would. She kept her tremendous faith in God and NEVER EVER gave up, no matter what the situation was. One can only imagine the pain she went through recapping the story, let alone living it. The amazing faith displayed in the book makes you wonder, Could I keep such a faith during such an awful time? I highly recomend this book to everyone. It makes you think about your life and whether you are living it for the right reason."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is phenomenal! I saw the movie as a young child with my parents. I still always wanted to read the book. When I finally sat down with it, I was moved to tears.

I only liked fantasy and the only reason I read was because my crush suggested it. When I fished the book I read all the books my teacher had on the holocaust and am curently reading one now. Briar Rose. Which is alos great. But Corrie ten boon tell an absalutely Wonderful entry of what happened to her durring WW2. As soon as you start to read it, you are sucked into the book and you can't put it down. You will absalutely love this book! READ IT TODAY!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"My English class was assigned to read this book, and I wasn't too excited about it. I thought it would be a boring non-fiction book about somebody's problems in some war. Well, was I wrong! I read the first chapter, and I was hooked. I couldn't put it down!This book is mainly about Corrie TenBoom, who lives in a strong Christian family that illegally helps hide Jews right on the break of World War 2. It's about how she goes through all types of trials, and how she depends on Jesus Christ to help her get through them, even though they seem impossible to get through(raids, jail, and even death).Corrie is a person of many flaws, as all humans are, and she freely tells the reader of them as her story continues. But, even though some things seem hopeless, she still has determination and relies on God to help her get through all of her problems. A lesson we can learn from her very down-to-earth character is that even though we seem endlessly flawed, there's still hope to improve.I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read books that are exciting, and you don't mind sitting on the edge of your seat the whole way through the book. But, I wouldn't recommend it to people who get very emotional about those poor people being mistreated and unfairly.This exciting book is not a boring old school novel, it's a book that you can learn from, so don't turn it down, if you are ever made to read it."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is a MUST read for those wanting to be closer to God and to know how other people have found a way to God despite their adversity in life, even the worst of the worst and still come through the dark side to the light with faith.

Over all it's ok,but not great."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"this book is a good book it is live with a lot of love I thought that this book was a sad book this book is a great book to read I would rate this book 3 starts because I thought the dairy of Anne Frank was better than this book but this book was better"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is definatly not a book I would chose to read.

It was in good condition though."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I am not sure whether half of the stories narrated are really true. The transformation from a frustrated small-town religious bigot to an \\"underground\\" heroine seems rather far-fetched. Too good to be true and please stop proselytizing; Jesus can be loved without being a Christian and those who don't beleive that are the biggest fools on earth!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The only reason that I chose to give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was slow to take off. In fact, the real story begins around page 77 in the chapter entitled \\"Invasion\\".\\"Whatever in our life is hardest to bear, love can transform into beauty.\\" This is the message that I took from this book; that one can have nothing -- including poor health -- and that hope can turn loss into glory, and that there really is a silver lining around each cloud."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"his is an inspiring , uplifting and beautiful story of a woman named Cornelia Ten Boom who was born in a small home in Holland. She was raised a dutch christian, her father a God fearing wonderful man. Who raised not only his 4 children but dozens of foster children. All while doing this, the Ten Boom's home became a safe house and spiritual place of worship for the Jewish (God's chosen people) that they were hiding in the walls of the home. The Ten Boom's home became the main house of the resistance efforts in Holland from the early beginning of the war till 1944 when the Ten Boom family was taken to prison. There Corrie and sister Bestie were taken to a concentration camp. Corrie tells a wonderful story that will make you weep but also make you in ahh of the daughter of Heavenly Father that she is and was. She lived into the 80's and still today her home is a museum in Holland. This book is great for people who love a good read, it spares horrid details and is not your typical holocaust story with blood, etc... I give this book 5 out of 5 stars on the mom meter for must reads. Corrie's life is remarkable. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This was such a very moving book. It took me a while to get into it, but it turned out to be a great book. Corrie ten Boom was such a wonderful example of what just one person can do in the face of insurmountable odds. She also did everything with such love, just as the others in her family did. She eventually worked in Germany in various ways after the war and was able to forgive the Germans, everyones bitter enemy. That isn't easy, to forgive somebody. Forgiveness isn't something you can just summon up at will, it takes time. So glad I got to read this book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I saw the movie for this book years ago when I was younger. I am so glad that I read the book; the talent of the author really puts you into the ten Boom household. Corrie's experiences during this time was more trying than most can imagine or tolerate and yet her faith continued as strong as ever. Truly a vidid and inspiring story."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I picked up the Hiding Place through a promotion as it looked like an interesting story. It was slow to start but stick with it as it picks up, and I found myself desperate to find out more about Corrie and Betsie. I felt like Corrie had taken me to the prison and given me a first hand account. The story was sad - hard to believe human beings would treat others like that - but really got me interested.It was quite religious - and even though I'm not - I found this wasn't a turn off as in some books. It was such a big part of Corrie and Betsie's lives that it actually made me think."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The reason I chose this book is because I have read one of her books and I really enjoyed it, so I decided to read her biography. The other reason why I picked this book is because I have seen the movie about the book, and I really like the movie so I decided to read it. This book is really interesting if you like to read about the Jews and how they were persecuted in concentration camps.This book is about the woman named Corrie Ten Boom who was imprisoned in the Holocaust for helping Jews escape the Nazis; she truly served the Lord but was treated likethose she tried to help. The theme of the book that I saw was \\"Christian faith is to be lived;\\" for example in the book it said \\"...Corrie, we can ask God to open up another route for that love to travel\\"(48). This quote demonstrates the theme because Corrie's father is telling her what to do and how to talk to God. In conclusion the Christians' faith is to be lived and the quote shows what ancestors told our parents , and our parents told to us, and we will tell our children about God and how to serve Him. While reading I was confused on the word \\"Solemn\\" which means grave: \\"It was that the solemn mother-daughter talk promised over the years for this night...\\" (51); I think the author put this word in because she wanted to explain the deep feelings of the promise.While reading the reviews I really disagree with one of the reviews; It said \\"What can be said in 2 sentences is said in 4 paragraphs and I'm not kidding.\\" I disagreed with this because the author wanted the reader to understand the feeling and she wanted the reader to experience it by reading it.I really recommend this book to everyone because this book tells how the Holocaust looked like. And the most important thing is that this book shows how the faith of Christians was passed on even though they didn't think about the obstacles that they had to pass.TJHS 11th grade student"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"My daughter needed the book for her English class.

I received this book as a gift and I didn't touch it for a year. But, I'm glad I finally read it! While this book absolutely exposes human behavior at its worst, it also shows it at its best. The Ten Boom family is an inspiration to me and an example of faith and gratitude. Throughout the story, the family relies on their Christian beliefs as they struggle to choose whether to help others and risk punishment and then later as they are imprisoned in a concentration camp. I loved this family and the fact that it was based on actual events saddens me but also motivates me to be a better person. A favorite part is when the father has been arrested and is told they will let him go if he promises not to help anymore Jews. The father answers, \\"If I go home today, tomorrow I will open my door again to any man in need who knocks.\\" Another favorite part is when the sisters find reason to be thankful for fleas.

I read it from cover to cover in one evening, then read it again in the next two days. &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; is not only a thrilling tale, set in the midst of war torn, Nazi occupied Holland, it is a spiritual journey of one woman and one family. You will feel as if you know Corrie, as if you are visiting with her in your own home. You'll feel every indignity she suffered and rejoice with every triumph. Your heart will break for her and her sister Betsie and your spirit will sing with them also. If you want to read a book that will change your life forever then you must read &quot;The Hiding Place&quot;. If I was able to choose only three books to cherish for the remainder of my life on earth I would choose the Bible, &quot;Hinds Feet on High Places&quot; by Hannah Hurnard and Corrie Ten Boom's &quot;The Hiding Place&quot;.

He is there to help us through and to grown from the experience. In the middle of a concentration camp, with life the gruelest of existances, He help the ten Booms through emotionally and helped Corrie to emerge a stronger Christian. Amazingly, but because of God she came out of the camp full of a new Christlike love for those around her, even those who have held in captivity and beaten her.

I highly reccomend this item for anyone, whether believe or non-believer. It holds a very important message for all of us."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place by Corrie ten Boom is a wonderful book. It is full of suspense, and will keep you on the edge of your seat at every moment. Corrie ten Boom was arrested for hiding Jews in her home during World War II.

Along with everything that happened to her, she prayed and trusted in God and never gave up hope."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book was fantastic! It was sad, heartwarming, exciting, joyous, and ultimately satisfying to read. Corrie was so honest about everything, even about her struggles with God and her faith. I felt so grateful and close to her by the time I was finished reading it. It also made me think about the way i live as a Christian today, and the way i long to live as a Christian: unselfish, full of love, and close to God, the way Corrie and the entire Ten Boom family chose to live. This book was so inspiring, and it really showed me the way God works miracles in ordinary people."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The TenBooms lived in Haarlem, Holland in 1940. It is during this period of time that the Nazi's began taking over. Corrie TenBoom and her family, although not Jewish, are very religious and help the Jews seek refuge. Corrie becomes the ringleader of a Dutch underground for the persecuted Jews. She is discovered by the Gestapo and she and her family are moved to a concentration camp. With her undying faith and hope, Corrie and her sister Betsie make the most of their harsh circumstances by teaching others in prison of Christ. Corrie is strengthened through Christ when she relates \\" Of course it was not my wholeness, but Christ's that made the difference.\\" By serving and helping others, they forget their own needs and wants. After many long years of suffering, Corrie is liberated and sets up care centers for those also suffering from the holocaust.I liked and appreciated \`The Hiding Place' not only for the wonderful story it presented, but for the lesson it taught me of pure love and selflessness. This book helped me to realize who each of us are and who we can become through the trials in our lives. When Corrie TenBoom forgave her enemies, it touched me and brought me to realize that all of us are equal. That we shouldn't go judging others by our positions or races but look past that into our individual worth and divine potential. This book has helped me in my life to overcome difficult obstacles that in my mind I thought impossible. I also enjoyed learning about the holocaust. It amazed me how so much horror can go on when there is such a smooth cover of peace over harsh reality."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I bought &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; for my son. It is on his required summer reading list. After reading a few pages myself, I could put it down. A very compelling account of the hatred and hardship that spread though Europe during WWII. But though all of the suffering, the ten Boom family strengthen their faith and showed love for both the persecuted and the persecutors. I hope my son also finds this story to be inspiring."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Once you step into Corrie's world and start reading this book, you can not stop.I picked up the book and began to read it one day and then I could hardly set it down when it was time to go to work!

When we were there he really didnt understand what was so special about it. Now I am reading it to him aloud, and he is finally able to understand why the Ten Booms took in so many Jews and how they were able to forgive the Nazis. For a child who basically only likes to play video games, that is saying a lot. He even added Corrie to his list of people he admired on Facebook."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"What a wonderful history of two sisters and their family who lovingly provided &#34;The Hiding Place&#34; for Jews.Jews were hated and slaughtered by the thousands by the Nazis (National Socialist German Workers Party). My older brother, Wendell Hall, personally saw dead Jewish bodies stacked up like cord wood at seven Nazi death camps. His Army unit was the first to liberate six of them. Then, he was transferred to the unit that liberated Dachau. He was especially grieved at what he saw because his best buddies in the first unit were Jewish Americans.Fortunately, the Ten Boom sisters were Dutch, not Jews. If they were Jews, they would have suffered the same slaughter. Because they helped the Jews, they were traitors. They were imprisoned in a flea-infested women's prison. During prison processing, a kindly nurse surreptitiously handed the author, Corrie (Cornilia) Ten Boom, a miniature bible. All the women gathered together each evening after work at the one dim light. Corrie read the German Bible aloud while other bilingual women took turns translating it into other languages. Fleas were the reason they could do it. The guards never entered the flea infested building.Betsie, Corrie's sister, when they first became flea bitten, told Corrie to be grateful for the fleas. First, they were grateful because of their faith. Second, they were grateful when they knew fleas protected them in their perilous pursuit of truth. Truly AWESOME!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"One of the best books written about a families part in helping save Jews in the holocaust. Truly inspirational! It would be wise to read this book, not only to see in action, God's grace, but in the world we live in to remember that it can happen again."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"As a young adult, this book had an impact on my life second only to the Bible. As a teacher, I wanted to give the same opportunity to several young people of whom I an exceptionally fond. With that in mind, I recently purchased five copies to give to high school graduating seniors. The selfless love and forgiving spirits in the face of intense pain and suffering of the ten Boom family can be an inspiration and guide to all who read this gripping true story. Amyone who doubts what happened during the Holocaust should read this book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The first time I ever read this story I was in high school, and it became one of my favorite books. I've read it since then, but it's probably been about 10 years since I've read the book. I had forgotten how amazing this story is. \\"The Hiding Place\\" is the autobiographical story of how Corrie Ten Boom helped the Jews in Holland during WWII.What I liked most about reading along while listening to the audiobook was how much more the story came to life. Corrie Ten Boom wasn't the narrator, but Bernadette Dunne did an excellent job. I enjoy hearing names and words spoken in their native tongue. It was nice hearing the correct pronunciation of \\"Beje\\" and other names. Bernadette Dunne was warm, animated, and full of emotion. I must admit, though, that I had to speed the audiobook up because the narration was a bit slower than I read.I love the characters of \\"The Hiding Place\\". The reader/listener is drawn into the world of the Ten Boom family. The glimpses into their lives makes you feel like you're a part of them.Even though I've read this book several times, I'm still amazed by how Providence worked through the Ten Boom family and in the lives of the people around them. I admire the unwavering faith and courage that the family and the \\"contacts\\" had and how they risked their own lives (and sometimes even their loved ones' lives) to protect God's chosen people. More than anything though, \\"The Hiding Place\\" teaches the reader about the true forgiveness that only Christ can give.This review was written as part of the christianaudio Reviewers Program."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I have read this book many times before. However, the excellent narration by BernadetteDunne made the book fresh, insightful and captivating. Corrie Ten Boom's classic workis a masterpiece and should be read and re-read by our modern myopic generation. It is inconceivable to Americans that any civilized nation could descend to the depths of depravity that man can descend. But the lessons in her book are far deeper than mere politics or war. The Sovereignty of God drips from every page. Corrie understood God was in control and good in all he did. She believed this before WWII ever happened, however, she still held strong to this belief through oppression, abuse and imprisonment. To those who doubt that God's faithfulness in hard times, I recommend this book. It does not answer all the why questions, but it does answer the who question. Corrie knew who was able to answer all her questions someday. And she held firm to the belief that God was able to right all the wrongs in eternity. She rested in Him, even when it was hard. Corrie's work is needed now more than ever. And it is my prayer that future readers can come to rest in the God that satisfied Corrie's soul. I pray that they would find God to be their hiding place."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is my favorite book. I read it in 7th grade for English class and have re-read at least once a year, every year since. Believe me, that's a lot of times. It is the true story of Corrie ten Boom, a young woman during World War II. Her father was a watch repairman who owned the 100-year-old, family-run shop in the Netherlands. As devout Christians, they spent their lives living peacefully and simply.When they saw the grave injustices being enacted upon their neighbors and friends, some Jewish and some not, the ten Boom family banded together to help as many as they could. In a way they lived by the premise of the poem, \\"And then they came for me...\\" Fighting for those who could not fight for themselves, the ten Boom family helped shelter as many as they could, until they were caught.Being confined in the concentration camp only fortified Corrie and her sister Betsie's faith. They prayed all the time and fought off the desperation that tried so strongly to capture them. While not everyone made it out, some of the family did. You'll have to read the book to find out who though.Needless to say, I have loved this book very well. Anything having to do with the Holocaust has always fascinated me and this book was no exception. Corrie ten Boom speaks plainly so as not to make anything sound better or worse than it really was. Her story is just one among thousands, but it stands out because of the way she tells the story. A truly inspiring read that I cannot compare to any other Holocaust memoir."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I'm really glad my book club picked this one to read, because otherwise I probably would never have read something shelved in the Christian Inspiration section. Unlike some of the other books I've read in that genre, this one actually was inspiring. I didn't feel like I was being preached at or pressured to think or act a certain way. The story Corrie ten Boom tells about her captivity during World War II was truly moving and well-told."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Before I read THE HIDING PLACE, I did not know much about Corrie ten Boom. I knew that she helped to rescue Jews during the Holocaust and that was about it. After I read this book, I knew her so well that I felt we were friends. More than that, this book is a HUGE faith-builder for Believers - Jew and Gentile. Her story gives us the awareness of our fragility before the evil of man, and our strength in God when times get rough.I recommend this book not only to adult Believers, but to kids too. In these Last Days, as the Scripture calls them, it is important to realize that we may be challenged one day like Corrie was. And will we stand?Ellen C Maze, author"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Once you read THE HIDING PLACE, by Corrie ten Boom, you will never be the same again! Talk about getting your personal faith recharged, this World II account of the ten Boom's efforts to hide Jews from the Nazis, will certainly do it!Death to Corrie as a child, puzzled her. What was death like? Her father's answer remains one that I cherish, \\"When you and I go to Amsterdam, when do I give you your ticket?\\" \\"Just before we get on the train.\\" Her father used that illustration to show her that God would give her just what she needed when she needed it most. Like a talisman, that memory carried her through the horrors of Ravensbruck.One cold, damp, gray morning at roll-call in prison, a woman, who was ill, fell dead from a guard's bullet. At that moment, when Corrie felt she could endure no more, she heard the clear song of a bird. A small thing in so great a tragedy, yet it contained a spark of hope.Another highlight in this book: Corrie's sister Betsie thanked God for the fleas in their barracks! I'll tell no more. Read to find out!Probably, Corrie's darkest hour came while kneeling beside her beloved sister Betsie's emaciated form. Betsie told her with great enthusiasm of a vision she'd experienced the night before. The details of it seemed to Corrie too far-fetched to ever come true. However, it did come true, because Corrie carried Betsie's vision with her after the war.It proved very difficult for Corrie to forgive the cruelty of the Nazis to her family, but God gave her the \\"ticket\\" to do so. What an incredible story of faith lived out in one individual's life!I enjoyed this book so much that I saw the movie, and it's as good as the book!

Not counting the Bible, The Hiding Place probably made more impact on my life than any other book.Mary ConnellyAustin,TX"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is a Christian classic, but for some reason I never picked it up until recently. It is the story of one family as they are simply obedient to the Lord's leading in the impossible situation they find themselves facing. John and Elizabeth Sherrill do a wonderful job of tuning you in to Corrie and the ten Boom family, both through peaceful times and wartime. The style is simple yet profound, and I guarantee that you will be moved by this powerful story!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"In The Hiding Place, Corrie ten Boom gives us a wonderful true story about faith, hardship, and strength as the German Nazis swept her country--This book will leave you awe-stricken.The start of the book gives us a glimpse into the life of the ten Booms before German occupation. Corrie moves on to tell us about her childhood and gradually she progresses through a time line of events in her life until Nazi invasion.At this point in the book, Corrie begins, little by little, to move into the world of the underground. It starts with just a hand full of Jews when she gives them a safe place to stay. But that becomes ration cards for the Jews, and that becomes work with the official underground network, and that goes even further to make the Beje the center of much underground activity.And then there was the camp. When someone within the underground leaked information to the wrong source, Corrie, her family and many other people who were at the Beje, even innocent ones, were taken to the Scheveningen concentration camp. There she would spend an undeserving two years and two months, relying on Jesus Christ through it all.The Hiding Place is a remarkable work of art and should be read by all. It is a moving and heart rending book that anyone would love."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Because it is a well written, first-hand account of what Jews and non-Jews went through in the Nazi prisons and concentration camps of WWII, it has great historical value, thus every middle or high school should make this required reading for their students. It gives insight into the evil that humans are capable of doing and what faith can do to help one overcome this evil. You find yourself wondering if you could survive the experiences that they suffered through. I look forward to the other books by Corrie ten Boom."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"What I have learned in this book has directly and indirectly been used throughout many years. No other story has affected me like The Hiding Place. It has been such an encouragement; and how blessed I am to know about the ten Boom family and Corrie's testimony! Her books and videos have had a profound impact on me, and countless others."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"There are stories, fortunately not a few, of brave families in France, Holland, Norway, Poland, and even in Germany hiding Jews from the SS and SA. Most were Christians, although some were not, but in this case there was no doubt. The story of faith in action that costs, and costs the ultimate price of suffering, torture and death reminds us that a true walk with God may not always take one where one had in mind. Yet even with all this contrast to life in most of the West, and contrast with the Nazi cloud of the day, the silver lining shines through this story with the compassion, love and forgives of Corrie's sister, Betsy, and with the humanity that triumphs only by God's grace through Corrie ten Boom. If you haven't read it you'll probably be surprised at how inspiring a story about life in World War II can be."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I have read this book several times and it always awes and inspires me. This ordinary Dutch family--an elderly watchmaker and his two \\"spinster\\" daughters who are middle aged--risk everything to do all they can to help Jews during the Holocaust. Along with the help of friends and family members, they are Resistance warriors for quite some time until finally betrayed and sent to prison and then concentration camp. The story is moving and gripping, but mostly what is amazing is the faith and courage of each family member. Corrie discounts her own behavior and courage in favor of idolizing the response of her sister Betsie (creating a portrait of Betsie as a perfect, never bitter woman which is just about impossible to believe), but she herself learns and teaches true lessons about valor, perseverance and forgiveness. The book is well written, creating first the vignette of the simple happy family as the girls and their brother and sister grew up, then their decision to help the Jews and the ramifications of trying to learn how to do that with scant resources and knowledge. Then comes the betrayal and suffering, and she spares no details in her descriptions of the camp's horrors and the Nazis' cruelty (It never fails to shock and bewilder me that people could have believed as the Nazis believed and acted as the Nazis acted.) I am challenged in my Christian walk and my faith every time I read this book: could I have risen to the occasion in similar circumstances?"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Clearly Corrie Ten Boom was used by The Lord to teach us all. As hard a life as Corrie had there were human lessons in faith in the days before, and the days after her imprisonment, as she shares in this amazing book. Lessons that can be applied to us in our daily life here in America and abroad where we can still walk around freely and speak what is on our mind. Corrie and her sister couldn't do this. They were both subjected to unimaginable atrocities. What would you do if you saw a Nazi standing in front of you beating a man or woman to death? Her sister was a guiding light and teacher to her during and after her death. The next time you think you have something to complain about go online and order this book, if you don't already own it, or go to your local bookstore and pick up a copy. After you read it I think maybe you'll realize you really have nothing to complain about."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is an absolutely extraordinary book. Never have I read a book in which the spiritual beauty of the author so resonated throughout the story. The purity of heart that manifests itself in this inspiring saga of a heroic, Dutch family in Nazi occupied Holland during World War II is stunningly beautiful.This is the true story of the Ten Boom family who, during the Nazi occupation of The Netherlands, upon seeing what was happening to their Jewish neighbors and friends, asked themselves this age old question \\"If not us,...who; if not now,...when?\\" They answered it, ultimately at great cost.The Ten Booms were devoutly Christian and lived a simple life. The patriarch of the family ran a watch shop that had been in his family for a century. Some of the family members, the author among them, worked there, selling and repairing clocks and watches. They also lived in the house in which the shop was located.When the Nazis occupied their country, the reality of what it meant slowly dawned upon them, as they saw the treatment given to their fellow Dutch citizens of the Jewish faith. Moved by their plight, the author at the age of fifty, together with other members of her family, including their father who was nearly eighty, became active in the Dutch underground.When it became clear to the Ten Booms that Jews were being targeted for deportation and death, they had a false wall constructed in the author's bedroom, thereby creating a secret room. There, they would hide the terrified Jews who were staying with them, in the event of a Nazi raid upon their home.Eventually denounced by someone to the Nazis, the Ten Booms were arrested and their home raided and torn apart by the Gestapo, in their search for the Jews they believed to be hiding there. At the time of the raid, the Ten Boom home was filled to capacity with Jews in hiding. So well concealed was the hidden room that had been created by the erection of the false wall, that these poor, terrified Jews managed to escape detection.The Ten Boom family did not fare so well. It was upon their arrest that they learned first hand of man's inhumanity to man, and their faith was put to a test that they had never dreamt possible. It was faith, however, that sustained the author in what was to be her darkest hour of deepest despair. To find out what happened to the Ten Booms, read this book. It is the story of an incredible family, who had the courage to put their convictions to the test.This book is a masterpiece.

I do not know or care if this book is \\"well written\\" because it is what she has to tell you that matters.

Now, after reading it, I'm encouraging everyone to do the same.The story begins in 1937 when a Dutch family is preparing for the 100th birthday of the family shop, Ten Boom: Watches. Flowers are being delivered and friends are calling to help celebrate the day. The conversation centers around Germany and the Jews who are coming to Holland for asylum. The Ten Boom's and their guests could not have foreseen what was to come. Their world had changed.This is the autobiographical story of Corrie Ten Boom and how she and her family worked for the Dutch underground movement during World War II. The family were Christians and took a very strong stand against the Nazi persecution of the Jews. Corrie's father, a kindly, religious man, summed up his thoughts on the Nazis by saying, \\"I pity them Corrie. They have touched the apple of God's eye.\\"Corrie and her sister, Betsie were two ladies aged 45 and 52 years of age, respectively. They are the unlikely heroines of this story. Never married and rather innocent of the world, they proved the old saying that \\"you can't tell a book by its cover.\\" Both sisters risked everything they had including their lives to save people they didn't even know.In today's world of \\"me first\\", it's so encouraging to read a story of a family that truly lived their faith and practiced the Golden Rule."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I don't typically read books of faith and that is what I perceived The Hiding Place to be. So, in beginning The Hiding Place, I had preconceived notions of what the book had to offer. I was very wrong. Boy, was I wrong.This book doesn't preach. Plain and simple. It doesn't tell you what you should or shouldn't do. In its style, this book embraces objectivism and humanism. But all that is beside the point.From the liner notes, I knew that the main character and her family had helped the Jews during WWII and were caught and imprisoned, so the book was not about the destination, but the journey - and what a beautiful journey it was. Similar to other reviews - I was inspired (not converted yet, but inspired). I can recognize and appreciate the fact that the ten Boom family were exceptional in their courage and their faith - and I cannot deny that it was their faith that gave them the strength to overcome all they encountered. Never at any time, however, did I feel like I was being preached to. Quite the contrary, I felt like I had the opportunity to look through a window into something quite wonderful that left in me a feeling of awe. These people were quite amazing.I would compare the book to The Good Earth in its simple, straight forward view of a simple life turned outrageous. The message was one of human (and spiritual) strength. If you like to read, you'll probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The ultimate \\"Hiding Place\\" is within God. Such a short and simple statement, that holds great power. This simple fact was divinely revealed during the Holocaust for Corrie Ten Boom and her family, and in this book, HIDING PLACE, she shares what happened.Corrie, a native of Holland in her early 50's, became involved in the underground movement to hide Jews and others persecuted by the Germans. Holland was invaded by the Germans which made it very difficult to hide the refugees, as well as hide Corrie's role in their protection. While hiding several refugees in a false room in her bedroom, Corrie and her sister Betsy, as well as their aged father are taken prisoner by the Germans.Corrie is ill, while Betsy has suffered from an ailment since childhood and has always been frail. They are separated and do not see each other for quite some time.While being moved to another prison, the sisters are reunited and Betsy, by example only, helps Corrie cement her faith in God as well as learn to rely on him and trust solely in him.Again and again, Corrie is able to hide her small bible that a kindly nurse was able to slip to her. She hid it through numerous, supervised showers and naked inspections. God's Hiding Place was in action.Fleas that disgusted the guards became another thing to thank God for, as they created a \\"Hiding Place\\" for Corrie and Betsy as they revealed God's word to other captives and were able to give new life and hope in God.The sisters endure many humiliations and hardships that no human being should ever have to even dream about. Throughout all, their faith in God is strengthened and the book gives example after example of how this faith is met by God.I wept while reading this book, and I was ashamed that I complain about small things: Whether or not my neck hurts today, or I'm put out because my favorite TV show isn't on. I fear that I would have died a very bitter person if I were in that circumstance. If I am faced with tribulation, I hope that I would not, but that I would instead remember and be inspired by Corrie's story.RecommendedYesProsHonestly and humbly, reveals God's power in the worst of circumstances.ConsNoneThe Bottom LineGet this book and read it. Buy multiple copies and give them to everyone. We should all be so humble and take refuge in the Hiding Place."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is an absolutely extraordinary book.

They were Christian wonen and loved God with all their hearts. At this particular time, Hitleer was persecuting the Jews because he thought they were a pest to the human race.During World War 2, Corrie took Jews into her house and let them stay there. She had many ways of hiding them from the Nazi guards. She would hide the Jews in the walls whenever the guards came near the house. jAt the risk of her life and her family's lives, would hide them because they felt it was the right thing to do. As the story goes on, she gets caught hiding some Jewish people in her house, and both she and her sister are shipped to a concentration camp. While she was there, she saw many horrors. It was amazing what the guards would do to the jewish people. The Nazis were very cruel to Corrie and her sister, and put them through many hardships.

Her books and videos have had a profound impact on me and countless others."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place is an incredible book about Corrie ten Boom and her sister, Betsie ten Boom's lives in World War II. Through all her struggles, her faith in God and Jesus was never lost.The beginning of this book is about the Pre-war years in the Beje, their old, lovely house in Haarlem, Holland. When the Germans invaded Holland, many Jews were scared and worried about their future. Many ventured into the Beje to speak to Corrie ten Boom's father who was a great figure in their community who believed deeply in religion. Corrie decided that is was only right to help these &quot;orphans&quot; and found &quot;safe&quot; houses for them. Soon Jews steadily made their way to the Beje for guidance.In this way the ten Booms got involved in the Holland underground at the risk of their lives. Soon her family's house became the underground headquarters in their sector of Holland.Corrie provided for these guests through her many connections in the underground, whether it be a retired meterman or a policeman. Through another friend they built a fake wall to conceal the Jews in an emergency. Yet, the web of contacts had become so huge that it was inevitable they would be caught.And so it happened that Corrie, her three siblings, her father, and other people that were in the Beje were caught late in February 1944. From then on Corrie and Betsie discovered jail, death, punishment, hunger, cruelty, and, most importantly, their faith in God.I have almost nothing bad to say about this book. The beginning left a little bit to be desired but all in all this was an incredible book that was impossible to put down. You MUST read this book if you are interested in WWII or the Resistance.

It was faith, however, that sustained the author in what was to be her hour of darkest despair. To find out what happened to the Ten Booms, read this book. It is the story of an incredible family, who had the courage to put their convictions to the test.The reader is sure to be captivated by the goodness and spiritual beauty contained within its pages. The book was also made into a stirring, very moving film of the same name that is well worth watching."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I just finished reading this book today...and I'm so glad i took the time. When reading this book, you'll be going along, following the story, and a grat concept or an awsome quote will jump out at you in the midst of evrything. THe Ten Booms' hearts for the Lord were so remarkable. I grew truely found of Corrie's sweet father who read to them from the Bible every night, and forgot to send the bill after fixing a watch. And I grew to admire beutiful Betsie Ten Boom, who felt for the cruel and ruthless and wanted to show them that love was stronger; she was such a Christ -like person! I would not mind one bit being like her. I agree with anothre reviewer who talked about copying quotes out of this book to read latter; I was thinking of doing that myself.Another great thing about this book, is the way we get to see the hand of God move, like the change that came over the prison room when Betsie prayed, or the medicen contaner. (If you read it you'll know what I mean, it was awsome!) I would recommend this to anyone-Especialy a Christian. I hope you try it-I'll bet you won't be sorry. I hope you'll be blessed by this grate story."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"i loved this book! it is probably my new favorite! i would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the holocaust and concentration camps. i could not put it down! overall, a completely awesome book!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"It is the story of joy in the midst of inconcievable circumstances. Worth getting in hardback.Forgiveness, prayer, love, sacrifice.At one point they have lice in their quarters and they're thanking god because the guards don't want to go back there, so they're left alone to have forbidden Bible studies. Anytime you feel like complaning, this is the one to read.It's like Schindler's list, but not quite as intense."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"What an inspiring story. This family was not perfect but they loved Jesus and did everything they could during very difficult times to serve Him by caring for others. I love it when Corrie admitted her internal struggles but worked through them to become obedient to Him again.They would not have been persecuted yet they could not stand by and watch Hitler persecute and kill the Jews. And for this, they experienced many hardships. And yet because they kept their focus squarely on God.... and not their circumstances.... they experienced \\"peace which passes all understanding\\". How I love to see others' faith at work."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Bought for myself. Loved it! Loved it! A great read! Recommend read for everyone. We take so much for granted. Enlighten yourself!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The book was sad in the fact that doing good led them to be put into prison camps in Germany for trying to save lives of their friends and others they did not know. On the other hand, it taught you a lot about faith, how strong their faith was even when they were being ill treated. It was a wonderful book and they were wonderful people who did not seem to know strangers, certainly followed the good book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Because of my love for learning about World War II, I was instantly drawn to this book. I loved it!This being a true story of one lady and her family and how they worked to help many Jewish families and how it affected them directly, will surely tug at your heart strings.My heart ached as I read situations they and others were put in, but my heart swelled when they talked of their faith in God and how much trust they put in Him.This is a fantastic read for anyone!The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star is because it wasn't a book that i just couldn't put down. I love reading every drop of it, but it didn't keep me on my tippy toes as some do. Trust me though when I say this was a fantastic read!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The Hiding Place is a timeless, true memorial of a woman of faith in a concentration camp. I read it in my 20's, my children read it, and now I'm giving it to my grandchildren."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book takes place primarily in a Concentration camp during the war. It is about faith, perserverence and love. It is a must for those searching for enlightenment. A really good reading experience."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"A fantastic story about a family caught up in a terrible time in history,Once you have started the book you cannot put it down until finished."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Reading through some of these reviews and I can see I'm not alone in my love for this book. I read it several years ago. I was so impressed with it, I bought and read all books authored by Corrie Ten Boom.The Ten Boom family is one of the most inspirational Christian families in print. Her sister Betsie, was an absolute angel, not of this earth. I couldn't believe the faith of that woman. Her father was an oak of a man himself. Too kind on occasion to demand payment for fixing watches, his livelihood. Some people has commented this book should be required reading, I agree.With the outbreak of World War Two all of Europe was thrust into dire circumstances. But in the hand of God, these ordinary unknown at the time Christians, did the impossible. We all need examples like this to see for ourselves what self sacrifice really looks like. This book helped me to understand the light true Christianity is capable of shining when darkness closes in. In my opinion one of the greatest stories ever told. The impression it left on me was pivotal in helping to humble me, right to the foot of the cross where Jesus Christ died for me.Several miracles happen along the way, utterly astonishing! A \\"must read\\" for sure if any book deserves that title."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Without question, one of the best books I have ever read, The Hiding Place should be required reading for any Christian. This gripping account of the life of Corrie Ten Boom is full of stories of the great power and glory of God, experienced by those who were going through the darkest times of World War II.One of my fears in picking up this book was that it, like other World War II memoirs of those who were brutalized by the Nazis, would be full of gruesome tales and vivid descriptions. While the reader certainly understands that horrible things took place in the camps, Ten Boom and her coauthors simply do not focus on using horrible events to shock their readers. Instead, in an amazingly Christlike way, Corrie and Betsy looked through the horror of the circumstances to the ways in which God was with them.Christians who read this book will learn more vividly some of the glorious truths of the Bible. Readers learn how to give thanks to God in all circumstances as they watch Corrie learn to be thankful for fleas and an ant. Christians will learn of the power of God's word to truly sustain those who rely on it through hardships. Believers will learn of the great hope of heaven which allows us to walk through the hardships of this life. Christians will see self-sacrifice, familial love, and even how to love their enemies in a way that is seldom taught in our world today.If you are a believer who has not read this text, which looks a little like Little House on the Prairie meets World War II Germany, I cannot urge you strongly enough to set aside a few hours and allow your heart to be touched by this gripping, true tale."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"\\"The Hiding Place,\\" by Corie Ten Boom, is the true account of a courageous family who risked their very lives hiding Jews and others in need during the Nazi occupation. Corie was a spinster who, along with her sister, Betsy, found herself swept up in a struggle against evil as she worked with many other faithful individuals to preserve lives. Not only does this true story recount daring undercover operations and secret rooms, it also illustrates how even a pot of coffee, cream puffs, and a kind prayer can make a difference. Even if sacrifices must be made, God uses Satan's schemes against him, and courageous warriors who rely upon Christ's strength can vanquish the foe.Focus On the Family has dramatized this compelling story in a vibrant and unforgettable fashion. All the actors/actresses do exceptional jobs, particularly the actor portraying Corie's wise, devout father. I'd definitely recommend this magnificent drama to anyone who loves listening to true accounts of God's sovereignty and divine protection: \\"For I am convinced that neither heights nor depths, neither angels or demons, ... nor anything can separate us from the love of Christ\\" (Romans 8), \\"The Lord is my fortress and my Rock, a very present help in times of trouble\\" (Psalms 46).Please give this unforgettable drama a chance. God bless you."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is based upon the true account of Corrie Ten Boom who suffered under the Nazi Regime and was placed in a concentration camp for helping the Jews during this dark period in world history. The story is told from a Christian perspective and provides a detailed account of the horrors and injustices committed during Hitler's reign. This book is encouraging in that it proves that even in the most dreadful of circumstances, humans are capable of acting in a noble manner as did Ten Boom. It also serves as a stark reminder of what can happen when people are not vigilant and shows the danger of using the media to control the \\"masses\\" as Hitler and his minions did during his short reign in Germany. Indeed, this danger is now greater than ever due to the nature of modern technology and the potential that exists for abuse on the part of depraved individuals. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Corrie Ten Boom's autobiography is a very well written story of family life and the help and hope Corrie and her family brought to different people, of different religions, and of different nationalities. It is a beautiful and very descriptive story about seeing the light at the end of the tunnel!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is an amaizing story of the Ten Boom family's participation in helping Jewish refugees during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Corrie wrote many books after this one, but this is by far the most famous. Billy Graham's organization made a movie out of this story during the 1970's with the same title. This is the story of a family of devout Christians who did all they could to help those in need when they were facing the terrible occupation of their country during World War Two. There are many memorable parts of the book, but one of my favorites is when a prison Lieutenant is discussing with Corrie the value of mentally retarded children. Corrie and her sister had done work with retarded children as part of their church work. The Lieutenant told her that surely God did not value a \\"half-wit as much as a normal person.\\" The response by Corrie was, \\"How would I know if God does not value a half-wit more than he does a watchmaker (Corrie's profession). Or, even a Lieutenant.\\" That response by Corrie ended their conversation. That is one of the passages that has stuck with me, along with many others. This book brings to mind that there are many people right now, that are suffering, or imprisoned, for their religious beliefs, and makes that fact more real."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This classic work touches on so many feelings and thoughts. For me, the most interesting part was the one where she came across the SS man who had been at Ravensbruck (p. 238). Hatred and revenge came to Corrie's heart. She could not bring herself to shake his hand. She realized that she could not forgive him in her own power, and so she prayerfully asked for the Lord's forgiveness to flow through her. At once, her hatred melted away and was replaced by overwhelming love. She realized that the Lord, who commands us to love our enemies, also gives us the means to do this."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This story is heartbreaking - I cry every time I read it. But what makes it so wonderful is how much hope and joy and encouragement it holds as well. This story is told through the eyes of Corrie Ten Boom, who, with her father, sister, and a network of underground Dutch patriots, hide Jews in her home during the Nazi occupation in WWII. Corrie suffers tremendously for her actions, and it is within the confines of a concentration camp that some incredibly profound lessons are learned. One of the beautiful things about this book is how honest Ms. Ten Boom is about her faults and failings in herself and her faith. This is contrasted with the absolutely amazing faith of her father, and her sister Betsie. They trust God completely, and their reactions to the pain and suffering they experience are amazing, almost unbelievable. The Hiding Place is beautifully written, and has become a classic in Christian literature."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This powerful book has added another demension in my life that one can only owe to God Himself. As it states, &quot;only when you have turned the LAST page will you realize that you have read more than a spellbinding adventure. You [have read] a book which will change your life forever!&quot; I was unable to put it down as the story engulfed me in the very lives of Corrie ten Boom and her family. As she and Betsie endured the horrific nightmares of one &quot;concentrarion camp&quot; after another, my heart and soul tried to understand how it was possible to surrive on such STRONG faith as these two sisters had. It has brought me to realize as they have, that with God all IS possible, and that through faith in Christ, we can find refuge, -- our own &quot;Hiding Place&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Corrie's time in prison, a concentration camp, and Ravensbruck would have made most people welcome death, but Corrie gained the understanding that God's plan is made perfect through His son, Jesus. No matter how bad things got, she still was able to praise God in all circumstances. Corrie's autobiography shows us &quot;that Jesus can turn loss into victory.&quot; I see now that God's plan is bigger and better than mine."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"After reading this WWII memoir by Corrie Ten Boom, which gives an incomparable lesson on the nature of forgiveness, you may be looking for another great book. Get Amy George's &quot;Goodbye is not for ever&quot; - a very different but equally powerful and moving WWII autobiographical memoir. God bless Corrie Ten Boom."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"One of the things that makes this book so different from other books is that it is a real story. The story takes place in Haailem, Holland in 1942, the time in which Adolf Hitler was in rule. The Holocaust was a dramatic time for the Jews, as well as for the people involved in helping them, people like Corrie ten Boom, the author of this book, and her family. The ten Boom's were Christian and were not in agreeement with Hitler's rule.They did not neglect Jews when they came to them for help. &quot;If I stand behind, I will opn my door to anyone that knocks for help,&quot; Mr. Ten Boom once said. This watchmaker's family was motivated by the growth of discrimination in Europe to become involved. Corrie was forty-five at the time and had an older sister, Betsie. The family business was &quot;Ten Boom Watches,&quot; which her father's father had created some one hundred years ago. The two sisters were attached to their father. Later in the story they were all separated and locked up in a prison for helping the Jews in scaping from the Nazis. The ten Boom's took this people into their home and hid them in a secret room. The courrageous family put their lives at risk by doing what they thought was correct. However, their faith toward God was too big to fade away, and that kept them from giving up. Corrie and her sister were together most of the way, but after this immence battle, Corri wrote her amazing story in this book.The Hiding Place is a fabulous book. Especially for people who love to read real stories. This is a topic which most of us know enough to recognize what sort of things go on in a concentration camp. This gives the book an even stronger impact. Corrie ten Boomis a woman that I admire tremendously after reading this book. I firmly belive this is a great book which, hopefully, everyone can get their hands on and read!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Could you imagine watching people die before your very eyes or seeing your loved ones brutally beaten? I could not. Corrie ten Boom, on the other hand, had to endure months of this pain.When young, Corrie lived a carefree life with her family in Holland. Though there were trials, she maintained her lighthearted attitude living and working in her Father's watch shop. The ten Boom family took in many foster children over the years.The Germans invaded Holland in the spring of 1940. Four years later, while the ten Boom family was hiding Jews in a secret room in their house the Nazi police came to search and question with suspicion of the ten Boom's work in the underground refuge. The Gestapo took Corrie, along with her family to a prison. In June of that year Corrie and her sister, Betsie, were taken to a concentration camp. The two women spread the love of God throughout the camp. When released, Corrie started a relief home for other people from concentration camps.Corrie trusted God through everything. She was always preaching, even through her trials. I only wish that I could be half the woman she was."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I highly recommend it.

Should be on any readers \\"bucket list\\".Heartbreaking & yet inspiring true book. God's hands were all over their lives. The heroism, courage and faith in this book was very touching.

We are going to need them!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Corrie ten Boom' s account of her family's efforts to help and protect Jewish neighbors and the ensuing imprisonment that she and her sister suffered is an amazing testament to the power of their religious faith and commitment. This writing puts the misery of those who endured the prison camps on a very personal level, and I couldn't help but envision myself and my family under those circumstances as I read. Corrie credited her sister with stronger faith than her own, and wrote almost apologetically of what she felt were lapses in her own, yet she continued her selfless work once released from imprisonment, far into old age. I believe it's important that we never forget that era of history, lest we allow history to repeat itself, and Corrie ten Boom' s words pave a road toward remembering."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I've read this book several times and am always humbled by it.

Finally a book that does not push people in a religious direction; you follow the believe of Corrie and her family automatically.

It also made me think about the way i live as a Christian today, and the way i long to live as a Christian: unselfish, full of love, and close to God, the way Corrie and the entire Ten Boom family chose to live.

When you are older and strong you can bear it. For now you must trust me to carry it for you.\\" Some of the most beautiful advice by Patriarch Boom are related in the following quotes, \\"When the time comes that some of us will have to die, you look into your heart and find strength you need-just in time\\"; \\"whenever we can not love in the old, human way, Corrie, God can give us the perfect way\\"; and \\"God loves Karel-even more than you do - and if you ask him, he will give you his love for this man, a love nothing can prevent, nothing destroy.\\"Corrie Ten Boom provided food rations and save haven in Holland. The Beje house became the central nervous system of the underground relocation and food distribution system for the Jews in Holland. Countless unnamed experts with the last name \\"smit\\" provided the means for survival for approximately four years. The Jewish group outsmarted the Germany Nazi gespo, gained sympathy among the Dutch police, installed an early warning system, and a hiding room in Corries room. The hiding room was high up in the house, the paint was masterfully applied so that even the water stains seemed real, brick was used to create the appearance of a solid wall. Jewish historical books were stored in the Beje home, Jewish relocation coordination was arranged by code on the phone with an elaborate network of local supporters, and the community provided the intelligence to protect the home.Corrie, Bestie, Nollie, Tine, Peter, Willem, Casper, Kik were imprisoned in both Dutch and German prisons. Nollie, Tine, Willem were eventually released. Casper within ten days of his release died. Corrie endured terrible starvation. Nollie managed to get her the four gospels, a needle, and a blanket; these items helped Corrie survive incredible isolation. Bestie would die in the German prison. Corrie would see Bestie as a glorious spirit personage standing next to her shriveled body. Bestie had prophesied that Corrie would be released and she would return to tell the world her story. Corrie was released to return by train to her home to Holland. Corrie did tour Germany and talked about her experiences in the underground network, prison, and her family and during one of these talks a former SS prison guard approached her. He said, \\"Its it great that I can be wash clean through the blood of Jesus\\" and reach out his hand towards Corrie but Corrie could not bring herself to shake his hand thinking about the terrible humiliation imposed upon them as they were paraded naked infront of the Germany SS soldiers. Asserting all her effort Corrie prayed that she could love this man as God loved him and almost as soon as the prayer was given, she reached out her hand. Corrie describes feeling a wave of electricity from her shoulder extending down to her fingers as she reached out her hand. A miracle of forgiveness, an understanding of love thy enemy, and a realization God had used her for his purposes."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I read this book for the first time in the late 1970s. I was afraid of God at the time and a friend gave the book to me to read (along with several others). I read this book in one sitting (reading late into the night, but I wasn't doing much sleeping at that time anyway). This book was the beginning of changing my spiritual path. I know it's not that for everyone, but it is that for me. I have purchased this book since for individuals that I know are searching, to some it's just a nice story about a couple of old women . . . . but to others, it has given them a different perspective of a personal higher power.I'm not concerned about the writing style, I read and re-read this book for the story and the message that Ms. ten Boom carries through her writings. Although I am not old enough to have been around for World War II, my grand parents lost family members in the camps. This story of heroism in the darkest bleakest hours continues to inspire me."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Corrie ten Boom is an unbelievable author; she does a great job of making the reader feel like they are in the book with her. The book tells the story of her life which took place in Europe during World War II. Her family was Dutch and yet they could not turn their back on the Jews who saught refuge from the German soldiers. It was incredible to read about her life from the beginning when she was an infant through her old age. I am a fourteen year old high school freshman, and this interesting book made an impact on how I view life. Corrie ten Boom's story shows that miracles really do happen. I have always known my Christian faith was strong, but to see these characters being literally saved by their faith numerous times, makes my faith in the Lord even stronger.I also enjoyed the way she described each of the characters with great detail. Miss ten Boom had a very large family for the majority of her life. She lived in a three story house with her mother, father, two sisters, one brother, and three aunts. Their house was located above their watch shop. Miss ten Boom had a very close relationship with one of her older sisters, Betsie. After her older brother, Willem, and her other older sister, Nollie, got married her mother and all three aunts passed away. Miss ten Boom then lived in the large house with only her sister, Betsie, and her father, Casper ten Boom. She and Betsie never did get married. What a colorful family she had.She described the German soldiers as flat characters. All she saw in them was evil that could have been turned into love if they could have known God. She and Betsie were very strong Christians and they prayed for the soldiers so that they would be forgiven for their hatred. Miss ten Boom was a very loving person, and in the book every time a Jewish person would come to the door she would let them in and give them a place to stay. She also had many round characters and described them perfectly with everything that she knew about them. This book has an interesting mix of happiness, sadness, suspense, and mostly hope. It made me not want to put the book down for a second. I recommend this book to any age person."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"It is strange how things work out... \\"this true story of the heroic Ten Boom family proves that unspeakable evil can yield unimaginable goodness.\\" The value of such a remark seems greatly magnified in wake of the despicable attacks on America. For once again, the world is bearing witness as catastrophic turpitude brings forth the very best of humanity.Other similarities exist between the narrative of a Christian family who hid many Jews during the holocaust and the terroristic murder of thousands of Americans by the modern forces of hell.\\"The Hiding Place\\" refutes a current canard that will not please revisionists. As the invaders demanded the whereabouts of the Jews be revealed, one of the nazi goons was slugging then 50ish Corrie. When the pain of his fist pounding her face became unbearable, she cried out to Jesus for help. The tormentor warned her that if she used that name again he would kill her. To those who have rewritten history to say that Nazism was somehow a debased outgrowth of Christianity, here is another case where the facts prove otherwise. Hitler and his retinue despised Christianity as fervently as they hated Judaism. Such sentiments are alive and well among the Islamic extremists; however, true Islam with its message of peace is also a target of the terrorists' ire.In yet another prescient instance Corrie speaks of a monograph her minister-brother wrote while still in divinity school, \\"way back in 1927, Willem had written in his doctoral thesis, done in Germany, that a terrible evil was taking root in that land. Right at the university, he said, seeds were being planted of contempt for human life such as the world had never seen.\\" Thankfully nazism has been condemned to the ash heap of history, but the disregard for humanity is obviously alive and well.Those whose hearts are still broken over the attack on our nation will find comfort in \\"the Hiding Place.\\" It provides inspiring proof that evil will score a few victories, but, in the end, rectitude and integrity always triumph over hate. God Bless America!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The 268 posted book reviews, reflect the Corrie ten Boom's life story. Readers of THE HIDING PLACE express appreciation for a courageous family who risked their very lives hiding Jews and others in need during the Nazi occupation. It is heartening to know that despite the German propaganda and the rampant anti-Semitism in Europe, there were people who were willing to help the persecuted.The memoir \\"In My Hands\\" illustrates Irene Gut Opdyke's compassion and integrity. She was a Christian who had risked her life, multiple times, to rescue Jews. There were some individuals in Holland, Germany, Poland and other countries who had risked their life to save Jewish lives. In my autobiography From A Name to A Number, I describe how a German woman had given me a sandwich every day, for thirty days. If caught she would have been executed; she risked her life for a sixteen year old Jewish boy, not once but thirty times. Her noble act led me to believe that there is no justification to hate each and every German for murdering hundreds of close and distant relatives of mine, as well as millions of others. It would be unjust to slap a noxious label on the entire German nation. Not all Germans had a common moral depravity embedded in their culture. The sharp contrast between the conduct of a nefarious guard who knocked out my teeth, several weeks earlier, and the righteous woman who gave me the sandwiches, both German nationals, is a compelling affirmation that righteous people may be found among the wicked ones. That German lady was the antidote of the venal and incurably violent side of Nazi Germany. She tickled my imagination, my dream of a caring world. She prevents me from stereotyping thinking. The Bible tells us in Genesis 18.23, \\"Will you sweep away the righteous and the wicked, the innocent and the guilty?\\" If there is one righteous person in a village where everybody else is wicked, the entire village must not be destroyed!Corrie asked a pastor to hide a Jewish baby. The pastor's response was \\"No, definitely not. We could lose our lives for that Jewish child!\\" Then, Corrie's father, Casper, took that baby into his arms and said to the pastor;\\" You say we could lose our lives for this child. I would consider that the greatest honor that could come to my family (p.113).\\" When Corrie's father , and all the others, were arrested, the Gestapo chief said to the, 82 years old father I would like to send you home, old fellow, I shall take your word that you won't cause any more trouble.\\" The father's response was (p.146): \\"If I go home I will open the door again to any man in need who knocks.\\" In 1937, when German Jews sought refuge in Holland, Willem provided shelter for them. In some cases, Willem and his family had given up their own living quarters and were sleeping in a corridor.\\" Compassion and tolerance manifested by Corrie's older brother was a guiding rod for Corrie and her siblings. The family could not afford a radio, a novelty in those days, but managed to foster children in need at ten Boom's home.\\"True heroism is not dramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost.\\" (Arthur Ashe). Corrie ten Boom's family falls in that category\\" That anonymous lady from Germany that put away sandwiches for me is my heroine till my last day. So are Corrie ten Boom and members of her family. They saved many lives by hiding them and ask others to hide victim of the Nazi occupiers.The gripping stories narrated in THE HIDING PLACE wil inspire every reader,young and old. Skeptics or ignoramuses about the Holocaust should read this book.Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the current President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, whotold the UN Assembly that the \\"Holocaust is a myth\\" will be enlightened by readingTHE HIDING PLACE.The papers or TV do not bring good news. Violence, corruption, prejudice are on the top of the news. I am saddened and frustrated and feel like reading something uplifting. I had been inspired reading The Hiding Place twenty years ago. The book came to my mind now when I am eager to find a source of light in the darkness. While reading it, for the second time, I gained a respite from exposure to the disparaging current events. Being riveted to THE HIDING PLACE, I am hiding ephemerally from the ominous world. In today's modern culture selfishness prevails, youth show no respect for the elderly. The ten Boom family's moral conduct is the antidote to the corrupted people in today's society."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is a great story about an amazing woman and her family. After hearing many people quote Corrie Ten Boom I decided I had to learn more about this woman. At first I was a little bored in the first couple of chapters but decided I should keep reading. I am so glad I did. After I got over that initial \\"hump\\" I could not put this book down. Her faith is an inspiration to all who read this book. In the midst of such horrible circumstances her family remained steadfast in their faith in Christ and changed lives in the process."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I really tried not to read this book right before bed b/c of the tough content, but I just couldn't put it down!The voice is delightful--warm, genuine, matter-of-fact--appealing neither to sentiment or false piety. Corrie shares her story honestly and so pleasantly that you feel you are sitting with her over a cup of tea. She makes no pretense about her own bravery, but humbly shares her own struggles and how the Lord faithfully sustained her. The lessons on forgiveness are timeless and unforgettable. Be careful; you're likely to feel conviction to apply these truths to your own life! =)I would not recommend this book for small children; anyone under the age of 10 might be too upset by some of the content (her sister's death, their cruel treatment in prison)--but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to anyone who has ever wondered:--would they have courage to stand up for their faith if put to the ultimate test?--why does God allow bad things to happen to \\"good\\" people?--when should one fight back and when should one humbly submit--is it safe to trust God in absolute surrender?May God bless you as He blessed me in reading this book!CM"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"When the topic of this book comes up among friends and acquaintances, the response is usually that someone read the book when they were a teen, and that they appreciated the story. It is great that young people are reading the book, but this piece deserves to be read by every thinking adult. In fact, I would argue that the older a soul is, the greater the appreciation will be for the content of the Ten Boom's story.Oftentimes people reference this book in light of the ethical dilemmas raised concerning devout Christians lying to protect Jews. But the contributions this book makes to an outlook on religion, society, and life run much deeper than that interesting question. In a world where many are confused about the distinction between good and evil, that line is clear in the book. When we struggle to commit ourselves to causes greater than our own luxury and amusement, we read of a simple family that literally gave their lives for what was right and true. In a culture that is fairly fuzzy about its religious commitments, we know that the Ten Booms did amazing things out of love for their God.This is a well-written book that has a lot to say, and deserves to be read no matter our age."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The story of Corrie ten Boom and her family and their work in the Dutch underground during World War II has been around 35 years but this is the first time I've sat down to read this amazing story. I am so glad I did! Built on the premise that love will conquer all, the story shows what relatively normal people can accomplish in extraordinary times.Miss ten Boom begins her story with the family's background as the owners of an humble watch repair shop. Beginning this way allows us to understand how little the ten Booms expected their lives to change, and how drastically things did change once their decision to help the local Jews was made. Becoming a part of the Dutch underground might sound glamorous, but the reality of it was that it was dangerous and frightening when people's lives were held in the hands of everyday people. The ten Booms actually had several Jews who lived with them, as well as countless others who they helped find safe places. Miss ten Boom and her family were very religious and this is a primary theme of the story; they constantly show the power of God's love in their lives through the decisions they made and the stand they took in order to save strangers from death.This is an inspiring book on so many levels. The relationship the ten Booms had with God is phenomenal, especially in the face of so much tragedy, yet they never wavered in their faith. The \\"miracles\\" that took place show God's guidance in their lives as well as providing concrete proof of His plans for them. The fact that the family constantly thought of others and sacrificed so much reverberates throughout. It is impossible to read this story and not be moved. While it is Christian in theme, this book does not feel overly preachy; Miss ten Boom gives the facts and allows the reader to feel the love and belief in a higher power. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is a beautiful, beautiful book. I could read it over and over, and feel touched, inspired, and renewed again. I first tried to read it when I was about twelve years old, but it was two heavy for me. Then I read it a few months ago, and it came alive. This is one book I would definately want to add to my library soon. I love the Ten Boom family - especially Betsy. I am looking forward to meeting them all in heaven someday."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is the type of book that you almost hate to read more than a page or two at a time, because it's so thick with wisdom and meaning.I'm in the middle of it and I dread the day I finish it.

More importantly, you'll see Jesus in a more beautiful way, if that were possible!This should be one of the first book any new Christian reads."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"In a small, little town in Holland lived a simple watchmaker and his family who loved God above all else. In The Hiding Place by Corrie Ten Boom, she takes us on a magnificent journey of faith, love, and hope. Corrie was a simple person who took after her father in the business. Her mind clicked when it came to restoring watches, but when the Nazi regime started snatching the Jews, she became part of the underground for hiding Jews.This book chronicles her journey from the home where her family lived (along with her father & sister) through her imprisonment in some of the worst concentration camps. Corrie shares of her strong faith, and her lack of faith at times. She begs God for safe passage of people and Bibles. She begs God for divine appointments. And God grants her these things at times.As I listened to this book, my heart became overwhelmed by the faith needed to do the things that Corrie did. To hide Jews. Could I do such a thing today? I would like to say \\"yes\\", but I don't know that for sure. I had started and stopped this book many times in my life, but this was the first time I had finished it - I guess my heart wasn't ready to hear the message.This book shares the story of faith, hope and love during one of the most troublesome times in the history of our modern life. I encourage you to listen to this story."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is truly inspirational. It shows the love of the Christian heart in all circumstances.

I immediately thought of \\"The Hiding Place\\".Corrie's story is so moving partly because of the events that took place, but more by Corrie's humility. Her mannerism is almost matter of fact as she describes the remarkable things that happened to her and her family. She never once shows any attempt to be anything than other herself as she works to save the lives of others. She takes no recognition on herself but shines it on everyone else, most especially on her saintly sister.This is simply a great book about an amazing person!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is one of my favorite books and, having recently reread it, I can assure you it is one of the best books out there about Holocaust rescuers. It is also a very fast read and suitable for children who are in middle-school and older. Finally, the author has a very spiritual perspective on her experiences, one that, in my opinion, transcends the Christian framework in which it is presented. Young people and adults alike will be moved by her capacity to forgive--in the end-- those who nearly killed her, and who did kill her friends. Plus this book is very gripping....there's a reason it was made into a feature film. In short: don't miss it! It is one of the most moving books you are likely to read ever. If you want more suggestions about Holocaust rescuer books see my Listmania list. There are some other good ones out there such asThe Heart Has Reasons: Holocaust Rescuers and Their Stories of Couragewhich profiles other people like Corrie ten Boom who did similar things in Holland. There is alsoIn My Hands: Memories of a Holocaust Rescuerwhich tells the story of a lady in Poland who did something similar to what Corrie did in Holland."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Having lived and survived the Holocaust, I can relate tothe author and find that the book was very well written. If I were the editor, I would not change a word."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Point: God's love in Jesus Christ can be found even in the darkest events and can change even the darkest of souls.Path: Following the path of Corrie Ten Boom through WW2, this story clearly demonstrates the faithful promise - \\"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\\" The story begins with Corrie's part in hiding Jews in her home, continues with her desperate situation in the prison camps, and finishes with her post war work among the hurting of the land. During this difficult time of her life, the losing of her father, sister, and other family members, Corrie seeks peace and joy in Christ amidst the horrific conditions of the War.Agreement: Peace and joy may only be found in Christ.Disagreement: Because of the purpose of this book, it is tough to disagree with it. Although at times it felt as though physical and mental healing were the focus rather than a personal relationship with Christ, the author clearly has realized the importance of a personal faith in Christ.Personal App: I only hope that as I and my family begin to experience persecution, that the Gospel will be at the front of our minds. I pray that God will give us the peace as he did for Corrie. I pray that our faith will be strengthened in the same way as she experienced.I greatly appreciated this book and plan on listening to it again. I wish all Christians who are in the same position of freedom that I am enjoying would take it seriously to consider the stories of those persecuted and pray that God would give peace and strength."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"How to Forgive - if there's anything that would be unforgivable, it's got to be what the Nazis did during the Holocaust. Enough other reviewers have given detailed synopses, so I won't.Forgiveness is a tough spiritual lesson, one that spans all faiths. If you can forgive, you can set yourself free to live a good life in spite of what's been done to you. This book shows how the author and her family (all devout Christians who were hiding Jews) were able to practice forgiveness, and takes you inside to the gritty landscape of their emotions as they struggled to do so. Real, inspiring, and practical. I thought it would be too overly preachy but it wasn't, and I could really vicariously live through Corrie Ten Boom as she relates her struggles and triumphs (though I suppose triumph is too strong a word to describe her successes in dealing with many situations and rising to an attitude of love, gratitude and forgiveness). She didn't just talk her faith, but lived it and it was how she related her life experiences that spoke the loudest.I'm so glad to have found this book.(Watched the movie too - got it from the library - a bit slow but the message came through well.)"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Did you ever wonder how you could possible forgive your neighbor for letting his dandelion seeds blow into your yard?

I had never heard of it. It's called the hiding place and its supposed to be about a dutch family sheltering jews during the war. I am not disappointed that I read this book at all. So, I would not want to turn anyone away from reading it. However, I felt it was very unfocused in its approach. It wanted to be three different books. Really, the 'hiding place' has such a small appearance in this book that I was surprised they gave it this title. This book lacks direction. It is a glowing family book in the beginning, then the meat of it is the sheltering of jews and working with the dutch underground. The concentration camp part is intriguing, but it goes overboard preachy on the religious front. For anyone who has read it, the part with the eye dropper was a bit overboard. Nothing is wrong with any of those storylines, but crammed altogether in one book doesn't work. There is way too much author intrusion and preaching. That being said, I am not disappointed I read it. There are a lot of great nuggets to this book, and it IS an astonishing story. It is not a 5 star story though and I really don't feel guilty saying that.

She, in fact, was considered a political prisoner because of the ration cards, and defiance of laws regarding the Jews. But in fact, there were hundreds of women in Ravensbruck, known as Bibelforscher, (which in German means \\"Bible students,\\") who had been there far longer. This fact was testified to by Genevieve deGaulle, neice of Charles deGaulle, who was also in Ravenbruck for French undergound activity. It is proper to recognize those few members of the churches who defied Hitler, but about ten thousand Bibelforscher were imprisoned throughout the war, while thousands more remained largely underground, though their numbers doubled during the war years. Hitler had banned the Bibelforscher in 1934 because of their forthright and vocally public opposition to the Nazi party, and by 1938 they composed about 15% of the concentration camp population. Perhaps the reason they are ignored is because they are today known as Jehovah's Witnesses."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Imagine a world where you know you'll likely never see your dearest love ones again; where you don't recall the last time you haven't been hungry; where sleeping on lice-infested straw is normal; where standing for hours at a time in frigid weather is part of your everyday routine. Meet Corrie ten Boom.Corrie was a Christian living in Holland during the Holocaust. She, her father, and older sister Betsy sheltered Jews in their home above the watch repair shop they'd owned and operated for years. It was dangerous business, and one day, they were finally caught and arrested by the Gestapo. Thus began Corrie's painful months in prison and a concentration camp. Separated from their father and everyone else they held dear, Corrie and Betsy endured brutal conditions, humiliation, and mistreatment at the hands of the Germans.Throughout these severe trials, Corrie battled attitudes of bitterness and selfishness. She was often filled with hatred for the people who committed atrocities daily. Sometimes, she questioned God's hand in the terrible happenings. Over and over, she cried out to Him for forgiveness and the heart of love and kindness that she knew He wanted for her.Meanwhile, Betsy prayed for the very hands that mistreated prisoners and withheld rations. When she observed a fellow prisoner suffering an undeserved beating, she cried out in anguish not for the victim but for the soul of the officer committing the crime. She refused to see before her an intolerable, hateful German; instead she saw a lost individual in bondage to sin and in great need of a Savior. Rather than surging with anger, she overflowed with compassion toward her enemies. Betsy personified Matthew 5:44 in which Jesus says, \\"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\\" It was the rule she lived by every day.The Hiding Place is told from Corrie's perspective. Her story is a beautiful, painful, emotional journey toward forgiveness and love. It paints a striking picture of what God's children achieve when they refuse to yield to bitterness and anger. It's an account that clearly showcases the mighty hand of God and what He can bring about through us when we surrender our hearts to His will. The Hiding Place is full of practical application for every believer today. A true-life book, it will also be enjoyed by history buffs and those seeking to learn more about what life was like under German occupation and in concentration camps.Recommended read-aloud age: all agesRecommended read-alone age: 12 and upIf you'd like to read more of my book reviews, please visit larsenreviews.org."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Amazing woman with an outlook on life that is sorely needed in today's world.

My grandparents knew the Ten Boom family, and my family lived in Amsterdam during the horrible years of the Nazi occupation.I was fortunate to find the audiobook at our local library, and listened to it on my commute.I remembered very few of the details of the story, but I was left with a strong impression of the power of forgiveness. That is still the underlying message of the whole book. Corrie starts the book out telling about her idyllic life in a very devout Christian family, where she is spurned by the one man she loves, so she devotes her adult life to becoming the first licensed woman watch repair person in the Netherlands. This life is shattered when the Germans invade Holland in 1940, and Corrie gradually becomes involved in the Dutch Underground, because of her compassion for all humans, but especially her Jewish friends and neighbors who begin disappearing around her.She is eventually rounded up by the Germans, and spends a long time in a Dutch concentration camp before being transferred to Ravensbruck in Germany. It is there, through her beloved sister, that she begins to learn the lesson of forgiveness, as well as gratitude, in horrendous conditions. After the war, she spreads her message of healing to those around her.My father has written about the war in his memoirs, and I recently rereadThe Diary of a Young Girl: Anne Frank (The Definitive Edition) by Anne Frank, Mirjam Pressler (Editor), Otto M. Frank (Editor), Susan Massotty (Translator), and I was moved by how much these documents support each other in both details of the war, and how people in Holland dealt with it. Furthermore, since I recently walked the streets of Haarlem, I could visualize many of the events that took place in Corrie's book. Don't let anyone ever tell you this never happened.Some readers may be put off by Corrie's evangelistic zeal when she's in the concentration camps, but that is how she was able to survive the ordeal, and apparently help many others.I have survived many things in this life, nothing like the horrible war that my parents, and Corrie's family faced, but I can attest that it is the power of gratitude and forgiveness that enables you to get through them and heal from them. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I read \\"THE HIDING PLACE\\" in 1974, quite soon after it was published. I was in high school and while I do not remember every detail of the book, I have never forgotten the Ten Boom sisters and their exquisite faith in God. Betsie with her shining delight and unquestioning gratitude; Corrie with her strength of character and moral determination. Of course, they had family and friends: Father, so wise and kind; Willem, their minister brother, working with the underground movement; Nollie, the exasperatingly honest sister.I REMEMBER the wisdom of the father:When Corrie was a child she asked her father to tell her about sex. He asked her to try to pick up a heavy suitcase that he had with him. When she was unable to do it, he said that the same was true with knowledge in life: there are some things to heavy for us to know until we are old enough to bear the burden.I REMEMBER the wisdom of THE FATHER:The Ten Boom sisters recognized the \\"governance of God in all things\\". While Betsie was able to thank God for \\"all circumstances\\", Corrie declared that she simply could NOT be grateful for the FLEAS in the bunk rooms in Ravensbruck concentration camp. Nothing Betsie says can change her mind, and the sisters enjoy a bit of humor at Corrie's obstinacy. There is even more ironic humor when the sisters later find that it is disinclination of being infested with these very FLEAS that keeps the guards out of the sleeping quarters, thus allowing the sisters to conduct forbidden Bible study meetings.ONE DISTURBING MEMORY:This is a quote Corrie used to relate the fear that was building as far back as 1927 about the Hitler war machine:\\"A full ten years ago, way back in 1927, Willem had written in his doctoral thesis, done in Germany, that a terrible evil was taking root in the land. Right at the university, he said, seeds were being planted of a contempt for human life such as the world had never seen. The few who had read his paper had laughed.And so the shadow fell across us that winter afternoon in 1937, but it rested lightly. Nobody dreamed that this tiny clould would grow until it blocked out the sky.\\"MY RECALL of this quote is disturbing because I see that same \\"contempt for human life\\" taking root not in one land, but globally. We have all become desensitized to the brutality that we commit against one another. I see the television offerings that are considered amusement, I read reports of atrocities that are taken as a matter of course, authority figures have carte blanche against unarmed citizens... something is very wrong and I fear the shadow that will fall across us will not be content to block out the sky, it will seek to engulf the entire world with darkness."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"A very moving book.This woman and many others went thru incredible hardship....but God got her (and others) through.God is Good!!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book was recommended to me by my 30 year old son.

I find it very interesting and will certainly recommend it to all others."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"\\"The Hiding Place\\" by Corrie Ten Boom illustrates the life of a Christian family who risks their lives to help others and the importance of giving your burdens to God. A simple Christian household of the Ten Booms soon becomes a Hiding place for Jews during the time of the Nazis in World War Two. The family is unfortunately caught and sent to prison, separated and all alone. How could this be Gods will? The lord uses Corrie and her sister Betsie to teach other prisoners about his love. Then God gave the girls three visions, the story triumphantly changes as the discouraged and tired Corrie brings those visions to life. This story is a must read for any Christian or discouraged heart. The Hiding Place will have you counting your blessings and strengthening your walk with God."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"'The Hiding Place' primarily covers the wartime period of Corrie's life ('In My Father's House' covers the pre-war years,whilst 'Tramp for the Lord' covers the post-war years - all three books are wonderful).I am hard-pressed to adequately convey how powerful and moving 'The Hiding Place' is - it would take a heart of stone not to be thoroughly impacted and melted by this incredible combination of beauty,tragedy and victory.Right from the getgo Corrie draws you into her world.By the time you have been taken from the warmth of her childhood,through her family's courageous wartime efforts,and onto the horror of her and sister Betsie's experience at Ravensbruck you will have been on an overwhelmingly emotional rollercoaster : a certain point in the book had the tears running down my cheeks,and by the end i gave a repeat performance !!!!I think this book goes hand in hand with 'The heavenly man' by Paul Hattaway,in being two of the most beautiful,powerful and life-changing biographys available."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"THE POWER OF DARKNESS-Luke 22:52-53Christ's words at His arrest in the garden of Gethsemane: \\"Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: BUT THIS IS YOUR HOUR, AND THE POWER OF DARKNESS.\\"Corrie Ten Boom has a tree planted in her name along the avenue of the Righteous of the Nations at Yad Vashem, Israel's Shoah Memorial. The avenue and trees are all dedicated to non-jews who saved jewish lives during the Nazi regime.Holland was invaded by Hitler's troops on May 10, 1940. The Ten Boom family lived in Haarlem and spent several years hiding jews, working to get them safely out of Hitler's occupied territory. Her sister Betsie urged her sister before dying at Ravensbruke \\"...must tell people what we have learned here...They will listen to us because we have been here.\\"Let's hope that those who still refuse to listen, will reconsider the testimonies of these silent trees."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I just finished reading &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; and was (and still am!) deeply inspired by Corrie's unfaltering faith in God and the Bible which, without question, helped her survive the horrific ordeal. The overall mood of the book is upbeat considering the emotional episodes throughout. I don't believe the lightness of the way in which Corrie tells her story undermines the seriousness of it but rather, the mood reflects Corrie's contagious personality as a good-doer, always finding the good in everything, even her enemies which Betsie taught her to do.Corrie's book taught me many valuable lessons about the human spirit and how much a person can endure in order to survive but the lesson that I struggle with the most is to love and forgive your enemies. The most powerful passage in the book is when the former S.S. man from Ravensbruck thrusts his hand out towards Corrie and she thinks to herself, \\"And I, who had preached so often to the people of Bloemendaal the need to forgive, kept my hand at my side.\\" She later asks, \\"Jesus, I cannot forgive him. Give me Your forgiveness.\\" Corrie eventually shakes hands with the man but makes sure the reader knows that it is the hardest lesson of all to accept, even for her. This passage doesn't diminish the importance of the message which is to learn from Corrie's mistakes as well as her achievements. I highly recommend this book to anyone, young and old, especially the young."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I read this book to do a book report for my Chruch Confirmation class. I can easily and truthfully say that this is one of the best books I have ever read. I could hardly put it down, and it certainly brought me closer to God. And it's so iteresting- right in the middle of her life, Corrie starts to help protect Jews in her home, and later gets caught. When she's in prision, (and later in a concentration camp) she and her sister don't give up faith. They continue to spread God's will to all of the prisioners, and even some of the prision guards. The cozy family in the beggining is fun to read about, and the close sister relationship later brought me to tears. It also showed me how far God's love can reach, and how anything can happen with faith. In my opionion, this book is right up there with Anne Frank in the catagory of WW2 classics, and it is a must read for any Christion."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The ten Boom family was a remarkable family, they chose to endanger themselves to help others. It was Holland, during WWII and people started showing up on their doorstep asking for help. Would they turn God's own people away? The ten Boom family was the center of the underground ring in Holland, hiding and finding homes for terrified jews who were fleeing from the Nazis. This is their biographical story. They accepted the ones that could find no other place to stay and they did it joyfully. In everything they trusted God and God was always with them. This is a sad story, but also a story of hope. Father ten Boom when referring to the Nazis said, \\"I pity the poor Germans, for they have touched the apple of God's eye.\\" Psalm 119:114 \\"Thou art my Hiding Place and my shield... I hope in thy word, hold thou me up and I shall be safe.\\""},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Corrie Ten Boom said it best in the beginning of the book when she points out that every person, place, and thing you encounter in your life is God preparing you for the plans He has for you. I believe God meant for millions be to touched by Corrie's life story. The over all message in this book is forgiveness, and how it is possible, under impossible circumstances. Not only does the Lord desire us to forgive, but He made it possible to do so by providing the love to do it. Corrie and her family lived sacrificial lives, but more importantly they were obedient to God, whom they knew loved them very much. Time and time again, Corrie's life was saved by her obedience and tenacious way of looking to the Lord for guidance and help. These people KNEW and lived God's love and it infected others around them. This story was just as much about Betsie, Corrie's sister, as it was Corrie. Betsie was a resilient woman who loved the Lord so much that she even thanked Him for fleas! Corrie's entire family had a respectful fear of the Lord that is lacking in today's world. This story helps us to realize how very comfortable we are in this material world of ours. Previous to reading this book, I read \\"Survival in Auschwitz\\" by Primo Levi, who was an Italian Jewish survivor of Auschwitz (hence the name). It was nice to read both books in order to get a view from both the Christian and Jewish perspective. This great evil during WWII was not just against one race, it was the enemy of the human race. While some humans were inprisoned and/or killed, others were alive yet dead inside as they gave into hate and bitterness. Corrie and her family saw this great evil and clinged to the hope that if these people were capable of so much hate, then they were equally capable of so much love. They compassionately prayed for the ones they suffered along with, as well as for the ones causing the suffering. \\"The Hiding Place\\" is a wonderful book in which we can learn to forgive those that have hurt us, and love others the way God loves us. Get it! Read it! Tell a friend!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I loved this book. My wife and I read this book together while we were dating and it really brought us close together. This book really brings life into perspective. I will never forget reading this."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book truly teaches that it is not important where you find yourself, but how you react to your circumstances. It is well written and thought provoking. I believe that it is one of the greatest books ever written, because it widens the narrow view of life's challenges and troubles by lifting the mind. It teaches that it is better to serve, no matter how meager your offering, than to be selfish. Everyone, especially early teens should read this. I recommended it to some younger friends and saw changes in their outlook and approach to their problems. The problems didn't go away, but they were better able to bear them."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I've owned The Hiding Place for 15 years and once a year I get it out and read it again. Why, because it's a story that's worth reading once a year. There is no family that had so little yet gave so much. Corrie Ten Boom is one of the most humble and beautiful ladies who ever walked this earth and so was the rest of her family, except they were all killed serving others. Buy this book and you'll be changed forever - for the good, the for good you'll strive for like you've never striven for in your whole life because if this simple little family could do it, than any of us can. It's not just about the Holocaust, it's about how we can make a difference in today and in the lives of everyone around us. Corrie wrote other great books, but this is the crowning piece since it's simplicity and honestly of both strengths and weaknesses were put out there for us all to see up close and in person. I have it within 2 feet of the computer I sit at right now. Hopefully you will too."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This is one of the most remarkable stories I've ever read. The courage, the strength, and the amount of faith in God this woman possessed is truly inspiring.Corrie ten Boom and her family were prisoners of war during the German Occupation. Her father owned a watch shop and Corrie learned the intricacies of the watch repair from her father. When the occupation first began, Corrie became part of the underground in Holland and was hiding Jews in an upstairs room which was concealed behind a false wall. Eventually the Germans raided Corrie's home and she, along with her father, sister Betsie and other family members were carted off to destinations unknown at the time. Eventually they ended up at Scheveningen and then after awhile to Ravensbruck where her father and Betsie died.Living in deplorable conditions with infestations of lice and fleas they also suffered horrendous over-crowding and smells that would upset even the strongest of stomachs. Through it all Corrie and Betsie never lost their faith in God and preached His teachings to the other woman prisoners as the truth and to provide hope in this crazy nightmare they were all suffering through.Corrie was eventually released on a \\"clerical error\\" and later found out the week after her release, the women of her barracks were taken to their deaths in the gas chambers.Upon Corrie's return to Holland she opened a place of \\"renewal\\" in Darmstadt in 1946 for people to come too. Another home in Bloemendaal served ex-prisoners and other war victims exclusively until 1950 when it began to receive people in need of care from the population at large.In 1959 Corrie was part of a group that visited Ravensbruck which was then in East Germany, to honour Betsie and the 96,000 other women who died there. This is where Corrie learned that her own release had been a clerical error and that one week later all women her age were taken to the gas chamber.In 1968, Corrie ten Boom was 76-years-old and traveling non-stop in obedience to Betsie's certainty that they must \\"tell people.\\" She traveled to 61 countries, including many \\"unreachable\\" ones on the other side of the iron curtain. In her mid 80's, poor health forced an end to Corrie's missionary journeys and she retired to a \\"retirement house\\" in Orange County, California provided by friends. She was bedridden and unable to speak during the last 5 years of her life and finally passed away at 11:00p.m. on her 91st birthday, April 15, 1983.What a legacy Corrie ten Boom has left behind. One of Corrie's favourite quotes was: \\"Every experience God gives us, every person He puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for a future that only He can see.\\" This was one remarkable woman who led a remarkable life and is no doubt living a remarkable life in Heaven!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book was both inspiring and frightening, to think of man's crulity to man was painful, but it also deepened my love for Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I have read this book over 7 times in the past 40 years.

Not only did I get it $10 cheaper than the sticker price, the quality is excellent. The woman who narrates does all the voices for all the characters and she does an excellent job!

It is unabridged and I didn't know for certain when I purchased it. I am so glad it is, I can follow it word for word in the book. It comes on 8 CD's. Corrie's story is an encouraging one. I recommend this particular recording very highly!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book was not written to entertain, but to uplift and inform.I saw the movie first with my friend and her family in my early teenage years. I remember how I started to sweat and fear for those people who were victims of the holocaust and how sick at heart and soul I became over the atrocities that occured. They paid a shocking price for choosing to do what was right, not easy.The book is much better than the movie (though it was okay) and you get a good taste of what being a true Christian is, if you have no idea beforehand what a good example of charity (the true love of Christ) is outside of the scriptures. But you don't have to be a Christian to read it. The book is good for everyone who wants to know more about history from someone who survived it.If you are very young or forced to read this as 'required' by a teacher, you may not care for it based on the idea you are not given a choice. Neither was Corrie. Yet, she made the best of what she was given because in those camps, according to everything I've read, you only had control over one thing: your attitude. Real life is the same. Corrie and those who survived took persistent, consistent faith in a power greater than themselves to a new level."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I loved this book. It tells of the courageous life of Corrie TenBoom. It is very uplifting and yet sad. She was such a wonderful Christian lady!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"The very beginning of the novel didn't take too well with me. It was slow-moving and no particular words or phrases jumped out and caught my attention. However, after reading twenty five pages, I realized that this was the reason the novel was such a great story: it is perfect in all its simplicity.The Ten Boom family served as the owners of a watch shop in Holland. They were a good Christian family who regularly prayed and went to church. Their family was extremely close-knit, and each member was somehow involved in the life of another. The main character, and narrator, Corrie Ten Boom, tells her story.Holland was unoccupied territory in the first years of World War II, and every citizen thought they were safe. However, when the Germans invaded the country, everything changed. The Ten Boom family quickly realized how closely-linked their lives were with the Jewish families of Holland, and secretly opened their home to help. Corrie and the rest of the Ten Boom family risked everything, including their lives, in order to see that these Jewish families were safe from being transported to concentration camps where, undoubtedly, they would see their final days.Their secret underground workings were discovered and reported to German police. Corrie's family was taken to prison, and then to the concentration camp, Ravensbruck. While her father had died, and her sister, Nollie, had been freed, Corrie and her other sister, Betsie, were still imprisoned. Corrie had her doubts about their situation, but Betsie was her rock and a constant source of inspiration. Even though times were troubling, and the two sisters were starving more often than not, they managed to spread the word of God to everyone they met.The author does not use any flamboyant language, and oftentimes, her mechanics could use some work. However, when the story is thoroughly examined and manicured to the point of exhaustion, mechanics don't seem to matter. The message is all that really comes through. Throughout my readings one particular phrase came to me: \\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\\" Corrie Ten Boom obviously lived her life by this verse, and managed to write a whole account of her war experience around it.Intense Holocaust readers will find this novel a simple, but refreshing change of pace. It is certainly not the typical war story."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I've read quite a few books based on the Holocaust, fiction and nonfiction, but this one is different from any one of them, and any other book I've ever read. It is an amazing journey to following, unique, and one can learn lessons in love, faith, hope, etc from this book. It is truly inspirational and I would recommend it to anyone. Not your typical Holocaust book at all."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I love reading biographies and have always loved to learn about WWII and so I am surprised that I have never read this book until now. It was absolutely amazing to read about God's provision and the Ten Boom family's faith during one of the most difficult times in the last century.If anyone wants to learn about God's character, they should read this book. Corrie shares about her struggles of faith and how God always came through for them, even when they had to live amongst fleas in the concentration camp!I changed my mind... EVERYONE should read this book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Inspiring true story of a simple Christian family who placed their trust in God and changed the world as a result. They not only protected Jews during WWII, they worked for reconciliation of Jews and Nazis after the war, even to their own abusers. Only God make that sort of thing happen, and for the many years since, Corrie Ten Boom has been preaching that God. Read only if you want your faith in God deepened."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"First written in 1971, The Hiding Place has, through both critical acclaim and word of mouth of the masses, achieved both certifiable classic status and a revered place in the hearts of its readers. And, I might add, for good reason. Although written in 1st person novel form from the perspective of the selflessly valiant Cornelia ten Boom, it is, of course, the true story of one family's almost unfathomable degree of limitless giving and unwavering altruism that saved many of lives during the nihilistic hate-filled Nazi regime in Holland, where the Gestapo as well as Dutch collaborators were pervasively ubiquitous and inexorably replete with hate and ineluctably devoid of both reason and love.While reading, I felt a veritable melange of emotions running the gamut from sadness, anger, despair, and hope. Thanks to the wonderful writing, you feel like you're reading a novel -- although one that is all too harrowing and real. As Betsie quotes the Bible and says, \\"Give thanks in all circumstances,\\" she subsequently says \\"Thanks for the fleas\\" -- a moment that demonstrated that God DOES work in mysterious ways. Without giving away anything that happens, I strongly exhort you to read The Hiding Place -- a book that stays with you long after you have turned the last page.\\"No pit is so deep that He is not deeper still.\\"- Betsie ten Boom"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book was excellent, I thought, in giving a great insight to those that tried to help out their neighbors in escaping from the Germans. This family continued even thought there was great risk. They paid with their lives and still held strong that they were doing the right thing. It gave a different feel for what happened to all people involved in the Holocaust. It helped me to understand a different side to all the hatred and gore that happened then."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"My Mother made me read this book several years back. It was excellent!!! It helped me realize that if an old lady can spend time in a German jail under the worst of conditions, I can certainly have faith that my life will work out.

We should all thank the Lord for the fleas!Enjoy!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"This book is so powerful it will literally, change your life for the better. This true story takes us back to the days of the holocaust with a woman named, Corrie Ten Boom, (the author and main character of, 'The Hiding Place,') and her sister and father.This Dutch family live a quiet life running a clock repair shop. Through this artfully written novel you will be witness to the life of a family of faith and love beyond all reasonOn a mission from God, they hide Jews from the nazis in a secret room they have built in their home. But sadly, they find themselves locked in a Nazi camp for doing so. This is when the true test of faith begins.'The Hiding Place' is full of valuable life lessons on faith, strength, hope and love. This novel doesn't just *tell* us to thank God in all things, but illustrates why we should do so.One of the most powerful and touching parts of the novel, for me, is when Corrie is upset about the fleas that has infested them in the camp. Her sister tells her she should 'thank God for everything.' But Corrie insists that there is no good reason to be thankful for fleas! (can you think of one?) If not, you should read the story and find out how Corrie becomes thankful for even the fleas.Through this experience, I learned to, 'thank God for the fleas,' in my own life. I made a note and pinned it to my fridge...'Thank God for the fleas!' just to remind me, should ever forget to be thankful in *all* things.It is just so overwhelming! This book is pure horror, yet, it is pure beauty too. Its griping and oh, so powerful! I can not say enough good things about it. So, I'll just tell you that, 'The Hiding Place,' is beyond anything I have ever read. I'm only sorry that I have but five stars to give it! It deserves so much more!The life, love, faith and strength of this woman and her family will amaze and humble you.I have never read a book that has touched me as much as this one has. This novel will literally change you life for the better as it teaches us to praise God in *all* things and in all circumstances."},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I love true stories of courage and committment. That is what makes this book great.Corrie Ten Boom was committed to God and doing good. She risked her own life to help Jews in hiding during WWII. Then SHE became the victim of Nazi persecution in a concentration camp. Through it all she recalled her sister's advice that we should be thankful for ALL that God has given us, even the things we don't like.She wondered how anybody could be grateful for the lice that infested the camp barracks that they slept in. Until she realized that the German guards AVOIDED the barracks because of the lice. The lice actually provided some protection from additional abuse.Gratitude to God is one of the lessons I learned from this book.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"The Hiding Place","review":"Although this book is a slow starter, it only gets better as it goes on. I learned so much about Holland being overtaken, the underground system of Jews, and the hardships of the innocent people.

I would definitely recommend this book to my friends."},{"Title":"The Chrome Suite","review":"I first read &quot;The Chrome Suite&quot; a year ago, but have reread it since. Each time, I find something new within it. It is an excellent novel with gripping characters, complex situations and beautiful prose. The only quibble I had with it was the sometimes confusing narration, though given attention it quickly remedies itself. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo","review":"This book is not an action-packed thriller or nail-bitingly exciting/ it is not meant to be. Shange's unique way with words paints previously un-painted pictures. A work of beauty and love from beginning to end, Shange covers each girls mode of self-expression, and by the end of the book you feel a special bond with and understanding of each character in the book. At times it may seem overdone, and it may very well be sometimes (I'm still not sure), and at times it may move a little slow, but my soul would tell me to give Shange the benefit of the doubt and take the message instead of the medium (which is, as I have said, in its own right fabulous.) I would recommend this book to any patient person looking for a soul-searching endeavor that will leave you feeling more whole as a person and wanting more. Bravo Ntozake!!!"},{"Title":"Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo","review":"A gift from Mama, one from their dead Father, and one from Santa, each found through a kind of scavenger hunt by clues left for each child under the Christmas tree, and each savored by the individual Child privately, free of &quot;rivalries, jokes, and Christmas confusions.&quot;What a marvellous, inventive Christmas tradition. If I had family, I would initiate this idea. The Christmas chapter is my favorite in this whole book. I also enjoy the recipes scattered throughout the book! I've tried a few and they're great!I'm not going to analyze this book and try to guess at what the author was trying to do. Seems to me only the author could do that, anyway. All I can do is review this book based on what I got out of it. Besides a new Christmas ritual and some great recipes, what I got out of it was, a beautiful story about a mother and her three daughters, each with their own unique gifts: Sassafrass the weaver, Cypress the dancer, and Indigo the voodoo priestess/midwife. Their mother, Hilda Effania, wants the best for her girls, but she knows they each have to make their own way in the world; and when at the end of the story her three grown girls are reunited in the celebration of the newest member of the family, she lets them know that no matter what, they can always come home. I think this is a beautiful message, and I'm surprised this book hasn't become a movie by now. Not that being on video would improve the story, far be it; in fact, most movies based on books are so intent on sensationalism that it ends up being nothing like the book (think Waiting to Exhale). It's just that, if done right, it could become the type of touchy-feely message film that Touchstone films or even Hallmark should have jumped on long ago.This is my favorite book, and I don't own/enjoy a lot of fiction. I've had this book about ten years now, my book has a better cover, and I enjoy pulling it down every Christmas just to read the Christmas day story again and again.I'm seeing some references to this book as reading for grade schoolers. I think that may be a mistake. I wouldn't recommend this book for a young (prepubescent) child; the drug scenes and the passages involving sexuality are a little intense, I think, even though today's children are a lot more worldly about such things thanks to cable!"},{"Title":"Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. From the first page I was drawn into this world completely and never looked back. One of those rare books that I was devastated to have end, and moped around for months afterward with nothing to read because I knew nothing would be able to equal it. Miz Shange's lyrical prose is incomparable, beautiful and devastating in it's ability to make an intimate connection with the reader. I consider it a 'Must' read.If you ever have a chance to see Ntozake Shange read in person, which I have, don't miss the opportunity. She is as rare and wonderful as her writing."},{"Title":"Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo","review":"This is more than a book to me, Sassafras, Cypress and Indigo opened doors in thought and creativity in me that I wasn't aware existed.

This book is your Mama's cooking, Christmas morning, sprituality outside your door, and the man you've been looking for, all in one place. I have cried with this book, written poetry with this book, loved with this book.

Well done."},{"Title":"The Mixed Blessing","review":"I first read this book in the mid 1970s when I was a teenager. I enjoyed it then and decided to read it again last week. WOW. This book is so dated! I think it was dated back when it was written! The tragic mulatto is a thing of the past! Toni Jenkins is advised by her father in the late 1960s (!) to pass for white. He was not proud of his Blackness and therefore gave his daughter no Black pride. As a biracial woman, I know that it is important to be proud of all facets of your heritage. Poor Toni Jenkins, as she is torn from marrying her (White) FIRST COUSIN, who knows that she is Black and is OK with it or marrying a White advertising exec. When the exec finds out that Toni has a Black father, his true colors, no pun intended, appear. Toni herself is quite shallow and unlikeable. She flits around from school to school, from the cousin to the advertising exec and then back to the cousin. She turns herself inside out to conceal her Blackness from her husband. When she finally gets to meet her Black family, she sees them as stereotypes - because she really doesn't know any Black people. Helen Van Slyke can write - it's an entertaining, fast moving story, if you like soap operas. Yet it is unsettling to read a tragic mulatto story in 1999."},{"Title":"The Mixed Blessing","review":"Not a single character is likeable because we see their weakness and prejudice.

Every man, therefore, being created for these ends, we say he is predestined either for life or death.' 'God preordained, for His own glory, and the display of His attributes of mercy and justice, a part of the human race, without any merit of their own, to eternal salvation.'GOD HAS A PLAN: Chapter 3'Since the finite creation through its whole range exists as a medium through which God manifests His glory, and since it is absolutely dependent on Him, it of itself could originate no conditions which would limit or defeat the manifestation of that glory.' p 14'It is unthinkable that a God of infinite wisdom and power would create a world without a definite plan for that world. We cannot conceive of God bringing into existence a universe without a plan which would extend to all that would be done in that universe. If God...waited until some undetermined condition was or was not fulfilled, His decrees could be neither eternal nor immutable. We know, however, that He is incapable of mistake.' pp. 20-21 abridgedTHE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD: Chapter 4'God has lost none of His power, and it is highly dishonoring to Him to suppose that He is struggling along with the human race doing the best He can, but unable to accomplish His purposes. Nothing can come to pass apart from His sovereign will; and far sooner the sun be stopped in its course than God be hindered in His will. By virtue of the fact that God has created every thing which exists, He is the absolute Owner and final Disposer of all that He has made. Amid all the apparent defeats and inconsistencies of life God actually moves on in undisturbed majesty. His omnipotence is as sure a guarantee that the course of the world will conform to His plan as is His holiness a guarantee that all His works will be right.' abridgedTHE PROVIDENCE OF GOD: Chapter 5'All things without exception, indeed, are disposed by Him, and His will is the ultimate account of all that occurs. Heaven and earth and all that is in them are the instruments through which He works His ends. Dr Warfield says, 'The writers rarely use such expressions as it rains; they instinctively speak of God sending rain.' p 31'But while the Bible repeatedly teaches that this providential control is universal, powerful, wise, and holy, it nowhere attempts to inform us how it is to be reconciled with man's free agency. All that we need to know is that God does govern His creatures and that His control over them is such that no violence is done to their natures.' p 38'The Scriptures represent Election as occurring in the past time, irrespective of merit, and altogether sovereign. Rom 9: 11,12. Arminian theology teaches that though a person does accept salvation, he may fall away again. They identify the time of salvation with the death of the believer, as if only then his salvation became certain. But it is always to the love of God that the Scriptures never weary of raising our eyes, and the biblical writers take special pains to give each believer assurance that from all eternity he has been the peculiar object of the divine choice.' pp. 95-6'Calvinists therefore hold that election precedes, and is not based upon any good works which the person does. Foreordination alone cannot rest on foreknowledge.' p 99"},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Some people avoid labels for their beliefs and this includes Christians. They will particularly avoid labels for various understandings of Christian theology. But without labels, every time you want to explain your theological framework you need to launch into a lengthy discussion. But if you use terms (e.g. orthodox, liberal, reformed and evangelical) much can be conveyed immediately.The Reformed label for a particular understanding of Christian theology has seen a resurgence in recent decades. But exactly what is Reformed theology? Basically it is the understanding that God is sovereign in the salvation of man (i.e. every Christian was predestined to be a Christian long before they lived). And it is called Reformed because it was a key teaching of the Reformation. Of course the Reformers taught much more than predestination, but believing in God's complete sovereignty in salvation is essential if one wishes to call themselves Reformed.So what is entailed in the Reformed doctrine of predestination? Boettner's book is an old but helpful defense of the Reformed doctrine of Predestination. Initially in the book Boettner asserts key doctrines concerning God's planning, sovereignty, providence and foreknowledge. Then he moves on to teach the five points of Calvinism:(i) Total inability/depravity;(ii) Unconditional election;(iii) Limited atonement;(iv) Efficacious/Irresistible grace;(v) Perseverance of the saints.Then Boettner answers common objections against Reformed doctrine:(i) it is fatalism;(ii) it is illogical;(iii) it makes God the author of sin;(iv) it discourages motivation to exertion;(v) it represents God as unjustly partial;(vi) it is unfavourable to good morality;(vii) it precedes a sincere offer of the gospel;(viii) it contradicts the universalistic Scripture passages.Next Boettner teaches about other relevant issues including the harmony of Reformed doctrine with science and Islam. The book then closes with a quick review of Calvinism in church history.My only problem with the book is that it briefly promotes post-millennial eschatology and seems to be ignorant of Reformed Baptists.Nevertheless, if you are trying to understand what exactly is Reformed theology, Boettner's book is an excellent and convincing treatment of the subject."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"This is one of the best and most scholarly works on the Reformed faith one can read. Boettner is truly one of the modern Church's top theologians. This work should be in the library of every student of theology.

Not only does Boettner cover predestination in particular, but he also deals with reformed theology in general; specifically he has a detailed discussion of the 5 points of Calvinism.If I were to criticize this book, I would have liked to have seen a fuller treatment of reformed theology. While the 5 points of the Calvinistic system are foundational, they do not cover the entire breadth of reformed theology.With all that said, I would like to list the topics that Boettner covers in this book:1) God's plan; sovereignty; providence; foreknowledge; authority of the scripture2) Five points of Calvinism : total inability; unconditional election; limited atonement; efficacious grace; perseverance of the saints3) Objections : fatalism; God the author of sin; discourages good works; God as respecter of persons; unfavorable to morality; precludes a sincere offer of the gospel; contradicts universalistic passages4) Salvation by grace; personal assurance; predestination for the physical world; comparison with Islam5) Practical importance of predestination6) Calvinism in historyAs you can see, a lot of ground is covered in this book.

Moreover, this edition for some reason lacks the section divisions and headings that are in the original.

This book is appoximately 400 pages and slightly less than half the book covers the biblical explanation of what the Five Points of Calvinism, while another significant portion of the book devotes an apologetic defense of this doctrine and debunks a lot of myths and misconceptions typically presented by opponents of this doctrine. Boettner also devotes the final portion of the book revealing the history of Calvinism from the time of the reformation up to the 20th century.The only thing that's slightly bothersome about this book is that it was written over 70 years ago, so some of the language used is a bit dated and the Bible verses given are presented in the old American Standard Version, which reads very similar to the King James Version. I used my own NIV Bible as a cross reference while reading this book.Overall, it's a classic and a must-have for anyone who desires to understand the truth of God's Sovereignty and Grace and man's total inability to come to God on his own for salvation."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"This book is a phenomenal work.

I'm glad he didnt make a straw man out of Arminian doctrine, I think he gives a fair and honest representation of what Arminianism is.I'd give in 4.5 stars if I could.The only problem I had with the book is that it goes too far in saying or implyhing that God is the author of Sin.....not sure if I was just reading it wrong, but a couple of passages made me sit up and go back over what I'd just read. This has been a reaction of a lot of Calvinists who overstate the position of Calvin, but clearly he can't mean this as he quotes from the Westminster confession on Election.The grammar and style of writing can be a bit old, my edition is from the 1950's so thats gotta say something about it.Its still a great read after all these years, and a worthy addition to your Theology collection."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"This Book, I believe, is a great work concerning what Calvinism is and is not.

At the time this was revealed to me, I was unaware that I was among His elect. It never ocurred to me to feel outrage, though I observed and still observe this emotion in people, particularly in people who claim to love God. The mere thought of shaking a fist in God's face frightened me beyond words to tell, so I couldn't imagine how anyone could not fall prostrate when confronted with the true attributes of the Creator? Now, years later, I understand that this outrage in people comes from a misunderstanding of who God really is. Boettner does an outstanding job of illuminating and explaining God's sovereignty. If you've ever been impressed with the divine importance of sharing God's incomparable ways with a friend who is searching, or if you yourself are serious about knowing God for who He truly is, pick up the Holy Bible, then pick up a copy of \\"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination.\\" While God's Word needs no accompaniment, Boettner's book is certainly something to be studied, if for no other reason than its important and biblically urgent reminder that there is no room for compromise when it comes to sharing Truth with those who would hear."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"As this work shows, Boettner was greatly influenced by the great Princeton theologians such as Warfield and Hodge. Both of these men were deep advocates of the system of theology known as Calvinism. Warfield believed that evangelicalism stands or falls with Calvinism, and Hodge wrote one of the great systematic treatments of Calvinism ever produced. To these efforts, Boettner adds this work which expounds on Calvinism generally, and the reformed doctrine of predestination specifically.The book is broken up into 5 sections - establishing the reality of predestination in Scripture, expounding on the 5 points of Calvinism, answering Arminian objections to Calvinism, and then looking at Calvinism in history and its meaning to the Christian life. Each section is good, with some being better than others. The section which responds to the Arminian objections to the doctrines of grace is the best section, and in particular, decimates objections against exertion and evangelism.Boettner's treatment of Calvinism in history is a bit dated, but still informative when taken up to the time when he wrote this book. In particular, Boettner eloquently demonstrates that Calvinism is a theology that while centered on the sovereignty and holiness of God, produces a level of human action that is unparalleled. This says a great deal not only about the viability of Calvinism, but also of the problematic nature of man-centered theologies like Arminianism which have actually failed to inspire the level of human action and world change that Calvinism can rightly lay claim to.The one weakness of the book is that while Boettner extensively quotes Scripture to establish his views, his exegesis is not as strong as it should be, and this is a disappointment. It was clear that Boettner was attempting to demonstrate that the clear, plain and repeated teachings of Scripture plainly support Calvinism in such a way that to take issue with these teachings requires rather elaborate and exotic (not to mention mostly erroneous) reinterpretations in order to get around them. While this is certainly true, it would nonetheless have been helpful had Boettner made a greater investment in Biblical exegesis.So while it's not perfect, it is nonetheless a mostly persuasive apology for Calvinism that continued the great tradition of old Princeton to demand a coherent theology that is faithful to Scripture and can refute the best arguments made against it."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"I was reading John Owen's book on limited atonement and this book at the same time. I finished this one in a few weeks. I'm still working on Owen's book. In other words, Boettner's book is a much easier read. Boettner's book does a good job of introducing the reformed doctrines. He starts with the biblical foundation of different aspects of the sovereignty of God, namely, providence and foreknowledge. In the next section he uses God's sovereignty as a springboard to explain each of the five points of Calvinism. He then addresses objections in the next section. Section IV is unnamed, but basically tries to balance out the distorted view of Calvinism that focusing of the five points gives. He then goes on to explain the practical importance of Calvinism and then gives a brief historical overview.The reason I didn't give the book five stars is many. The book is unabashedly supportive of Calvinism and the Presbyterian church in particular. He is not a thorough exegete like John Owen, so he gives more a general overview and does not get into the details of the arguments. I don't think he addresses the objections as thoroughly as he should. Another point, since I don't believe in Amillennialism so some of his arguments fall flat. The book paints Calvinism in history in broad strokes. He writes a nice, short summary of Calvin's life. He even has a short defense of Calvin for his part in the Servetus trial. However, his history of Calvinism makes Calvinism the driving force of the American Revolution and all that is good in the world. It may be so, but I don't think he proves his thesis and it may be impossible to prove it in a one small volume.In summary, the book is an excellent introduction to the Reformed faith. The writing is easy to read and the arguments are pretty easy to follow. He tries to be fair to his enemies and it is a very positive book. The history is the weakest part of the book, but even that has some good sections in it. This book may not convince a true Arminian, but it does present the doctrines in a clear manner. He helped me understand limited atonement better than anyone else, and I think he does a very good job with the other 4 points."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Whether you agree or not with reformed theology, this book is the Gold Standard for understanding the Five Points of Calvinism. Boettner is thorough, scholarly but very readable and never boring. He not only explains the Five Points but goes into the history of them and the effects that they have had on the world at large. This was the book that moved me from being a convinced Calvinist to a convicted one. There is plenty of Scripture to back up each and every one of his statements and arguments.Excellent book and a great reference tool."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Loraine Boettner's 1932 book, \\"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination\\" is one of the finest pieces of Reformed literature that I have encountered. It is considered to be one of the books that speaks very clearly about the Reformed faith. Although not light reading, it is a book that is well worth spending time with. I highly recommend its reading for those who are new to the faith and to long-time followers."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"This book has a lot of interesting ideas. I believe that Calvinism is true because this book backs up all of its ideas with Scripture references,and if bible is true so is this book."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Before anyone gives me a hard time for that title I didn't invent it Charles Spurgeon said it in his book \\"In defense of Calvinism\\". This is a very good book on the subject of Reform theology and predestination. Though I am not a Calvinist because of it, but because of my own studies in the scriptures. My daughter came home from colledge and told me she was a Calvinist. I decided I would do a thourgh study and show her why she was wrong, of course first I had to find out exactly what Calvinism was. I did that then I started in Genesis and worked my way through the bible, I found not only could I not disprove the doctrine of Calvinism but must embrace it. This book is a very well presented explanation of this doctrine. I highly recomend it. I also highly recomend R. C. Sproul's book \\"What is Reform Theology?\\". Oh and to the contrary of one of the one star reviewers R. C. Sproul does not say God is the author of sin but he says the opposite. This book presents a true understanding of the scriptures. When I aproached this subject I did it with a disire to find the truth, if you do the same I believe you will come to the same conclusion I did."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Perhaps the most comprehensive modern work on one of the bible's most contoversial subjects. I read this book as a staunch anti Calvinist, anti predestinarian but I read it very prayerfully as I do all serious doctrinal books. And I came away a staunch believer in this BIBLICAL doctrine. And I became a bit appalled at myself and most of the modern church for misrepresenting it, failing to consider it, and understand it - what a disservice to truth.Since I read this i've read all Boettner's books - the millennium is his other greatest book. I now buy this book 4 or 5 at a time and give it to Christian friends. And have come away knowing that those who disregard and disbelieve this doctrine have gone to great strides to isogete, twist and ignore scripture's teaching and they do so at their own peril. The historical misrepresentation of this doctrine should be considered an affront to the church."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Armininism is the theology god of today. According to Gallup,less that 5% of the public think they will end up in hell. The vast majority,sooner or later,are going to have a very bad day. At least Calvinism tells the truth of what is coming for them."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"This book is great, rich on history and Biblical proof of the Doctrine of Calvinism, only Religious people with poor education and ignorance can say that this is an apostasy, most of our Calvinist Churches have being field by Doctors, Judges, Lawyers all kind of professionals and even better, One of our Best Hero's George Washington, who set the salves free. And two leaders who sing the The Declaration of Independence in 1776 were Calvinist.But all the documents, history of Calvinism, and theological (Biblical) proof are true and well written it's logical and totally Biblical. The book state about the failure of John Arminius on his points about Salvation and a proven biblically Research that state that his doctrine is not Biblical and was rejected by Synod of Dort, \\"We are save not for our own strength nor for our cooperation with God if only by God Grace that we are save\\"."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"If the Doctrine of Predestination is true,and I believe it is,then human beings are nothing but mere preprogramed robots. Mankind has no free will. We were created to entertain an evil creator.We are nothing but toys to be used and abused and tossed into the trash,ie: Hell, much like a temper tantrum ridden two year would do. The fact that God has a right to do with us or to us what he pleases because he is God makes him no less evil.If God created ALL then that includes evil. God predestined some to salvation and the rest of humanity to damnation. Oh,but he loves us. For God so loved the world he arbitrarily chose to damn the majority of it. John 3:16 in reality."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Boettner's book presents to the world some of the sloppiest scholarship on record. The cited references to scripture do not in many cases actually support the author's claims. Citations to those passages from scripture which do not supportive the predestinationst polemic are absent, leaving the reader with no informed way to decide."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"I have read a number of books that outline Calvinism--in its various shades--and musts admit that the logic of their arguments are very tight and usually the books make for an enjoyable read. However, when I go back to the scripture, the whole system seems to fall apart. The whole theme of Hebrews and much of 2 Peter deal with the apostasy of a believer(s)--not 'apparent apostasy or a scenario that could never really happen to a real believer'--but true bonifide apostasy!I could go on and on but I no longer see the point. For the Arminian view has truly won out in the arena of ideas. I have come to realize that 1) True Calvinist are rare and hard to find within Christendom and 2) they have become the theological Amish of the protestant world-fun to look at but never really seriously considered by the thinking world of the protestant faith."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"I was an Arminian who didn't understand Calvinism. After reading The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination I was convinced that the Reformed position is the most Biblical. It lays the case for Calvinism before the reader in such clear language that he can not misunderstand what the Refomed position really teaches. It is very persuasive in refuting the arguments against predestination while laying a solid biblical foundation for it's teachings. Boettner is very thorough in his use of Scripture to support his arguments. Anyone wishing to understand Calvinism must read this book. Boettner's arguments are so powerful that they demand your assent. This book was life changing."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Anyone interested in the Reformed faith (or Calvinism) should start here. It is easy to read and suited for the layperson. The book is divided into six sections: In the first section he deals with terms and concepts related to predestination (e.g., the sovereignty of God, the providence of God, the foreknowledge of God, etc.). The first section is an excellent start-off point for the reader. The second section deals with the five points (or TULIP). Boettner does an excellent job explaining what each of the five points mean (and what it does NOT mean). The third section deals with common objections presented by non-Calvinists against the Calvinistic understanding of predestination. Boettner, again, does a fine job refuting the typical arguments of non-Calvinists. The fourth section deals with issues of salvation by grace, personal assurance, predestination in the physical world, etc. The fifth chapter deals with the practical importance of the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination. Finally, the sixth chapter deals with the history of Calvinism. The chapters are well written and makes a good case for the Calvinistic system. Boettner presents his arguments well and anticipants and responds to possible objections in each chapter. The only problem I have with this book is its postmillennial bias (this is especially evident in his final chapter on the history of Calvinism). This is the only downfall of the book. In order for Boettner to relieve the \\"harsher\\" aspects of predestination, he advocates the idea that in the end more people will be in heaven than in hell. Of course, we should let the Bible speak for itself and not try to sugar-coat it with hypotheses to \\"soften\\" difficult truths taught in the Bible. Another downfall of the book is its age. Many contemporary readers will find that some of the issues that Boettner brings up are obsolete. Overall, though, a good introductory level book on the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Loraine Boettner's book explains clearly that God is 100% sovereign and accomplishes what He purposed BEFORE the world was made. People will allow God to be sovereign in everything but the affairs of man, especially in salvation. This book refutes point by point the arguments against the absolute sovereignty of God. This book clears up one of the main arguments of Arminians--that if God is the ultimate means by which ALL things happen, even bad things--this makes God the author of evil. This Arminian argument is swept away by Boettner's clear explanation concerning the absolute RIGHT that God has with HIS creatures to do as He decides. This leaves us totally in awe of God's holiness. We are reduced to humility and thankfulness for the grace that God exercised in our individuaL lives. EVERY christian should be required to read this book before entering any debate concerning God's dealings with sinful mankind. Boettner sets out explaining the doctrine and then in section III he takes on the obvious objections to the doctrine. Read this book first."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"After reading this book you will have a better understanding of what Calvinism is and what it is not. The book goes into not only a defense for it but also the practical aspects of Calvinism. From explaining each point of this doctrine to answering questions about predestination in it relationship to this doctrine. It goes to the subject of man's \\"Freewill\\" and God's foreknowledge. Everything you every wanted to know about Calvinism is in this book. It could very well be known as a systematic theology of Calvinism.Great study on the doctrines of Grace.\\"To God Alone Be The Glory\\" because of his amazing Grace"},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"I read this book many years ago and have since re-read it several times. Each time I pick it up I discover new truths. This is simply because much of what Boettner writes is so concise that you tend to underappreciate the depths of his explanations on the first reading - he is that good! Boettner packs more into one paragraph than many authors are able to do with an entire chapter! Make no mistake, a second reading will be required to \\"get\\" many of these concepts, perhaps the most difficult in all of theology. I am certain that I still have not gotten everything to be gotten out of this fantastic book. Also of note are the sections that offer counter arguments to the typical Arminianistic or \\"free-will\\" objections. These are pretty good answers on the whole and I have used them successfully with the opposing campers -- very useful counterpoints. Here's a tip for you, if you think of this book as a good \\"college level\\" course in Calvinism, then consider picking up \\"Still Sovereign\\" edited by Schreiner and Ware, which would be at a \\"graduate\\" level. Both books are highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"This is the book that convinced me of the &quot;predestinatory&quot; claims of reformed doctrine. It is set out in a most logical way with an abundance of corresponding Scripture passages. If you are not convinced about the claims of Calvinism regarding predestination and the sovereignty of God, then this is the book to read."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"This is the book that has helped many to see that the Bible clearly teaches that God is good AND sovereign.Boettner graciously answers many questions about the Biblical doctrine of predestination. He shows that those who object to the doctrine cannot escape from its implications if they believe the Bible to be authoritative.He also shows that denying the Bible's teaching that God is sovereign greatly devalues the God of the Bible, and leaves us in a much worse position.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"Dr. Boettner's book is one of the best works I have ever read on the doctrine of predestination from a Reformed perspective. The book is not a book that debates and ignores the issues but takes the reader directly to the Word of God as the source for its foundation.Whether you are a Calvinist or an Arminian, you would do yourself well to purchase this book and digest the meat found therein. The book, while covering a rather deep subject, remains quite easy to read and the content of Dr. Boettner's thoughts flow together easily.A great book!"},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"\\"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination\\" is the most thorough and well argued explanation and defense of this doctrine I have ever read. It is based on scripture with lots of helpful quotes and extended explanations from some of the greatest theologians from Augustine forward to the early twentieth century. Boettner argues with the passion of a convert, but uses reason and sound analysis to present an excellent case. If you want to know what Reformed Christians and Presbyterians believe about God's sovereignty I highly recommend this book.One problem: Dr. Boettner is so gung-ho and excited about Reformed theology and Presbyterianism that to those who are not convinced some of this book comes across like a Calvinistic pep rally. If you are not a convinced Calvinist hear him out because there is a lot of good food for thought here."},{"Title":"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination","review":"This is the most reasonable, thorough and concise explanations I have ever read on the topic of election and predestination. Though at times Boettner does tend to be a bit long winded and does also throw in a bit of his post-millennial views, this is probably one of the best works that any Calvinist (or even Arminian or Palagean) to read."},{"Title":"Modern Criticism and Theory: A Reader (2nd Edition)","review":"This \\"Reader\\" is a collection of some of the most influential and famous essays, or exerpts of larger works, by critics of the past 100 years.

If you're interested in Structuralism/Semiology, Deconstructionism, Reader-response, Feminism, and Cultural Studies, then this anthology will work well for you.This book is extremely useful to readers who are interested in literary criticism, and who do not necessarily want to do library searches to find the particular essay. The short biography of the author, as well as the \\"cross-reference\\" notes at the end of the biography, are helpful too. A similar anthology is *Literary Theory: An Anthology* edited by Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan, which also collects the highlights of the theorists's work.

I got it for a class a year ago and have used it as a supplement for nearly every class and paper since. The presentation makes the high-strung contemporary theory very accessible and the editors have done well to include a very broad scope of topics and positions, while maintaining a manageable size. It is very possible to read all of the essays, and each is very salient. I'm sure the 3rd edition (which has recently been released) only improves on all counts, most significantly in terms of including more and more contemporary critics. However, it is not necessary to shell out the extra $40 or so for a copy of that 3rd edition, or a brand new copy of of 2nd, when a used but immaculate 2nd edition will cost about $10 with shipping. The 2nd edition offers a very comprehensive--but not over-exhaustive--reading of trends in contemporary theory.

It opens astutely by positing, \\"Two of the most dreaded questions children ask their parents are: Where do babies come from? [and] Please, oh please can we get a dog?\\"Peterson, a dog trainer, fully understands how children can benefit from having dogs in their lives. But she wants to help educate parents about the commitment a dog requires. She gives them a reality check when it comes to expecting the children to care for the dog, endeavoring to make sure that potential first-timers know that dogs should never be purchased on impulse.Peterson has written something unique: a book specifically designed for parents to read before the dog is purchased. As such, there's room for great detail on some important topics that can help keep parents from making a big mistake. She takes the reader through a series of realistic questions. (Will your family's leisure activities accommodate a dog? Can you afford to keep a dog? Is your marriage healthy?) She even devotes a chapter to helping parents decline those pleading puppy requests.For the parents who get through the first few chapters and still want a dog, Peterson includes detailed pages on how to choose a breed (including a comprehensive table of breeds prone to a variety of genetic diseases); where to purchase and equally importantly, where not to purchase a dog; and how to find and recognize a reputable breeder, even when reading a newspaper ad. She paints a clear picture of what a responsible breeder is, and what puppy buyers can expect from a breeder. Then she helps the reader prepare the house for the new dog.This is the perfect book for the responsible parent trying to find the very best way to answer the daunting title question. That answer may well be no. But if it's yes, this book will help parents and children make the very best of that decision.[...]Janine Adams is an award-winning writer and the author of seven books.

In this room.After that, only fire. Only ritual.&quot;Volume Seven of &quot;From Hell: Being a Melodrama in Sixteen Parts&quot; by writer Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell contains only one part of the award-winning Jack the Ripper graphic novel (there are ten volumes in all). &quot;Chapter Ten: The Best of All Tailors&quot; covers the murder of murder of Mary Jane Kelly (A.K.A.. Marie Jeanette Kelly, Mary Ann Kelly, Ginger) at 13 Miller's Court on the night of November 9, 1888. The title of the chapter comes from a rhyme that was reported to be the favorite rhyme of William Withey Gull, the physician that Moore casts as Jack the Ripper in this narrative: &quot;If I were a tailor I'd make it my pride / The best of all tailors to be / And if I were a tinker, no tinker beside / Should mend an old kettle like me.&quot;The point Moore makes with the title is, of course, ironic, for the murder of Mary Kelly is considered the last of the recognized Ripper killings (the exact number of victims is in dispute among fervent Ripperologists) and was unique in that it was committed inside the small room where Kelly lived. Because he was not outside where he could be interrupted, as was believed to have happen with Elizabeth Stride on September 30, the Ripper was able to engage in mutilations beyond the scope of what he had done with his prostitute victims to date. In fact, one of the reasons Mary Kelly's murder was assumed to be the last by Jack the Ripper is that it was seen as the climax of his escalating mutilation of his victims. Consequently, Moore's point would be that this was the Ripper's grotesque masterpiece representing his horrific &quot;best.&quot; There is an additional irony in that the rhyme mentions a kettle and the cover art for Volume Eight of &quot;From Hell&quot; pictures the melted kettle they found in the fireplace of Kelly's room.Throughout the &quot;From Hell&quot; series Moore provides an Appendix at the back of each volume in which he notes his supporting evidence and the dramatic liberties he has taken in constructing his narrative argument. There are also some fanciful elements to the story, but they do little to mitigate the horror of what is being depicted. But for this chapter he finds such notes &quot;almost unnecessary, given the singular and specific nature of the event described and the relatively brief span of time over which the said event took place.&quot; Moore admits speculation on the order of the mutilation but notes the existing evidence and spends most of his time explaining his trails of thought that led him to depict the murder in this particular fashion.Moore also points out that the depiction here is a close as he can get to a portrayal of what might have happened on that night, not only in that room but in the Ripper's mind, and that he certainly does not want to get any closer. &quot;The Best of All Tailors&quot; is the bloodiest chapter of &quot;From Hell&quot; and if this was a movie it would be NC-17 (the film adaptation of &quot;From Hell&quot; spared us the graphic details of Kelly's murder, even stopping the description of the police surgeon before it gets to the part that would give you nightmares for a week.Through deduction, induction and abduction, Moore creates a compelling story and the fact that it is not what really happens has little to do with how much we enjoy &quot;From Hell.&quot; Do I believe that Sir William Gull was indeed Jack the Ripper? No, I do not. I have heard many theories regarding his true identity that have been plausible, at least at face value, and I am more than willing to lead it to the knowledgeable experts to argue out their respective merits. But I was not reading &quot;From Hell&quot; to be convinced of the guilty or innocence of any one regarding the world's first infamous serial killer. I read it because as we have known ever since Alan Moore did his own take on the Swamp Thing, one of his greatest strengths as a writer is to make us look at old things in new ways."},{"Title":"Reach Beyond the Break: The Avery Johnson Story","review":"While I'm a big Avery Johnson fan, this book (writing quality, typos, organization) is simply not at the professional level.

His analysis of Babar I find lacking somewhat in understanding of European realities (after all, to suppose that &quot;savages&quot; - elephants - can become civilized is, for a Frenchman of the 1930s, somewhat of a step foward)and therefore contrived.

He says, however, that in reading such stories I was indoctrinated as a child. He villifies our childhood comic books, and blames them for the mistakes that people in our country have made as adults. This book is written for the sort of people who think that &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; teaches racism. If you think that, sure, pick the book up.

It is a collection of simple but no less meaningful poems inspired by Bly's interest in Toaism. If you have tried to read some of the popular Toaist texts, such as the writings of Loa-Tzu, and felt as if it went over your head, this is the book for you.But These poems are not restricted to an exploration of Toaism, they also redefine solitude. Bly transforms solitude into a glorious, desirable experience, rather than the miserable affliction that the word has come to represent today in the minds of most people. The truth is that solitude is an essential food for poets, and &quot;Jumping Out of Bed&quot; could not have been written unless Bly had tasted solitude.The subtlty and depth with which he explores the simple (often overlooked) pleasures of being is well appreciated. Also, the &quot;woodcuts&quot; by Wang Hui-Ming not only make the book beautiful, they offer a freshness not found in most books of poetry. Too often, a book of poems is just a boring display of black words on white page after white page. Wang Hui-Ming takes this book to a different level. If you enjoy Bly's poetry and do not have this book, get it. If you want a book of poetry free of confessional or self-congratulatory muck and full of importance, this is for you.By the way, if you ever have the opportunity of seeing Robert Bly read in person, DO IT! He's fantastic."},{"Title":"Jumping out of bed;: Poems","review":"'Jumping Out of Bed' is a collection of poems by Robert Bly. It also is an unusually attractive collaboration of verbal and visual images. Wang Hui-Ming's splendid woodcuts illustrate the poems with his own bestiary of avian and marine life.The joys of solitude, the discovery of correspondences among all forms of life and matter, the delights of being -- rather than striving -- are themes which run through the book.Bly has also included several exquisite translations from the Chinese. Each translation is appropriately accompanied by the original text, in calligraphy by Wang Hui-Ming.Robert Bly won the National Book Award for poetry in 1968.

Mosher, using Captain Mosher's logs and memoirs. Interspersed is a huge amount of information about the basics of the whaling profession, and highlights from the history of whaling: the Essex (the source inspiration for Moby-Dick), Mungo Jones, John Boyle O'Reilly, Tilton's Walk, the mutiny on The Globe, the opening of Japan, the discovery of the Gulf Stream. All is told in a compelling narrative style typical of the mid-20th century but, alas, gone from contemporary historical and geographical surveys such as this. The language is rich with sailing terms and whaling terms, MOST of which are defined in the text and collected in a glossary at the back. (In the age of the internet, the missing terms are easily discovered on line.) And, there are tons and tons of pictures: drawings, photographs, museum exhibits, etc. When I recently picked this book up, I thought, \\"What a mishmash!\\" but while reading the book I quickly corrected myself. Everything is exactly where it needs to be to keep the 230-page tale compelling.But that doesn't answer the \\"Why?\\" of the book, does it? Well, 48 years ago, this was the first book I ever read cover to cover on my own. I guess I was a typical, Eisenhower era boy, more interested in rough housing, exploring, seeing how much trouble I could get into and out of. But I had a 7th grade teacher who saw something and by sheer luck, she was my 8th grade teacher as well. She drew me into her confidence then nudged, cajoled, pushed, heaved sighs of exasperation, and...well, she never gave up. I must have done something right one day because she rewarded me with permission to go to our small elementary school's library on my own, when no one else was there, and pick a book to read. ME! The kid who could think of a whole lot of mischievous things to do with a book before reading it, including burn it. But this one caught my eye; it must have just been published (1959). A book about whaling--I'd seen the John Huston/Ray Bradbury/Gregory Peck Moby Dick (1956) on the ABC Sunday Night Movie, and it thrilled me to no end. Besides, what kid could resist a book title that has a truly exotic word like \\"scrimshaw\\" (I had no idea what it meant) AND \\"sudden death\\" in the title. I gobbled it down and haven't stopped reading since. (Admittedly, book No. 2 suffered by comparison.)So, if you really need a recommendation for this book, the best I can offer is the fact that it inspired my 48-year reading habit that still tends to the occasional wildly-imaginative adventure. Including, thanks to the internet, a return to the very first book I ever read. Thank you, Ms. Paxton, for believing in me."},{"Title":"Time Capsule/1950: A History of the Year Condensed from the Pages of Time","review":"In this case, the editors put the only logical likeness on the cover, General Dwight David Eisenhower. As leader of the Allied armies that invaded the beaches of Normandy in June and by the end of the year had entered the edges of Germany, his was the greatest influence of the year.One of my favorite things to do with books like this is to randomly open it to a page and then read what is there. In this case, I turned to page 156, which explained that in early February, Argentina broke diplomatic relations with Germany and Japan. The last and most reluctant Latin American nation to join the Allied side, it was in many ways still sympathetic to the German cause.My next random opening was to page 66, where one of the articles was about overproduction of eggs. Written in a somewhat silly style, it demonstrates a bit of the seriousness of the war years. Every aspect of production had to be stepped up and efficiently managed, even the production of eggs, which was managed by the War Food Administration.With few exceptions, 1944 was a year of Allied victories and Axis defeats. That is why the emphasis in this book is on the war and the effect on domestic life. This book is one of the best ways to catch a series of glimpses as to what was going on in the world in 1944. Everything from the explosions of guided missiles in London to the (over)production of eggs was important in that year of decision."},{"Title":"Time Capsule/1950: A History of the Year Condensed from the Pages of Time","review":"General Eisenhower is on the cover, but in the beginning of the year, it was the Russians that made all the headlines. The Red Army halted the German siege of Leningrad and going west, just like our pioneers. Like our colonists were pushing the Indians to the edge of our continent, the Red Army was pushing the Germans to the edge of Europe. For ourselves, we made a giant leap into the Kwajalein Atoll, incidentally, the largest atoll in the Pacific. The book is all World War II. Of course, there is baseball and boxing and science and technology and the movies and the theater. Buy the book, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Time Capsule/1950: A History of the Year Condensed from the Pages of Time","review":"In this case, the editors put the right picture on the cover of the time capsule. Whatever your opinion of his legacy, General Douglas MacArthur was a dominant person in the news of 1950. The biggest event was of course the opening of the Korean War when the North Korean armies invaded South Korea. At first it appeared that there would be no stopping them, but as the year progressed, the Inchon landings put the U.N. forces under MacArthur on the offensive. At year's end, the Chinese forces had entered the war in force, driving U. N. forces back south in an inglorious retreat. Given that MacArthur completely failed in his tactics and his duty to obey orders, it was the beginning of the end of his military career.I always find it interesting to randomly open books in this series and in this case, my random examination demonstrated how incredibly unsettled the world was in 1950. I read about the unstable situation in Greece and all the rest of Europe, problems in Indochina, the tense situation between the People's Republic of China and the Nationalist forces on Taiwan, and vast bloodshed in India. In the United States, it was the year that Joseph McCarthy began his bogus hunt for communists.With all the bad news of the year, it is somewhat surprising that everything turned out as well as it did, although there was a lot of death and suffering along the way. 1950 was a tumultuous year, one of widespread fear. This is the only environment where a man like Joseph McCarthy could ever rise to such prominence. If you are interested in a brief summary of the major events of the year 1950, this book is the place to look."},{"Title":"The Joy of Breeding Your Own Show Dog (Howell Dog Book of Distinction)","review":"Whether you are just about to acquire your first show dog, or awaiting the birth of your first litter, this book is a MUST HAVE for your bookshelf. Full of sound advice and helpful suggestions, this book takes the reader from buying their first show prospect, to grading your first litter of puppies. The author is quick to point out that breeding dogs is not for the person looking to make a quick buck, but for the serious lover of their chosen breed. She feels (as I do) dogs that can't make the grade in the show/performance ring should not be bred. The chapters on genetics is easily understood and simply written. I would not think of breeding another litter without this book at my side! S.

It details the warning signs of a failing pup so that you can take proactive action. Don't let the title scare you into thinking that this book is not for you.

It goes into Mendels laws of inheritance which, although simplified genetics, is about the best a lay person can use. Gives an honest look at inbreeding/linebreeding/outbreeding. I first borrowed it from the library, and then had to buy it.The reason I only gave it three stars is because it is mainly for toy dog breeders. The author seems to consider anything over 20 pounds as a \\"large breed\\". Also the author considers cropping ears as barbaric, yet thinks you should put a miss-marked puppy down at birth. Considering the amount I've seen markings change from birth to adulthood I think only a pup with a congenital defect should be put down at birth. Anyway, a mis-marked puppy makes as good a pet dog as one with excellent markings."},{"Title":"The Joy of Breeding Your Own Show Dog (Howell Dog Book of Distinction)","review":"I burrowed this book from a public library and have loved the book, i actually had to purchase this book thru Amazon.

A GREAT read!"},{"Title":"The Joy of Breeding Your Own Show Dog (Howell Dog Book of Distinction)","review":"In my opinion this book by noted Yorkshire Terrier breeder and elegant lady, Ms Ann Serrane, has been the very best guide to breeding I have ever seen or read. It is very comprehensive and gives the good, as well as, the bad of breeding dogs, the great rewards and the biggest problems and what to expect. She interviewed many top breeders from all over, including the infamous Leon Shiver of Shandown Pointer fame. Leon was one of the most knowledgeable breeders all around in my opionion and I was blessed to be able to learn so much from him and his wife Shan, both gone now, but so much knowledge. She included the best methods to use in whelping pups and the biggest problems and helped with advice to better overcome the problems. I believe every breeder of dogs, especially very well bred dogs, should have this book in their library as well as Rachael Page Elliott's DVDs and books on structure, \\"DOGSTEPS\\" and Pagey's other related books and DVDs. I rate this book as one of the highest on my list of ones to read and to have for beeders.Thank you for having it available for me to repurchase it after so many years.Bless you,ReeReeCreat'n Chinese Cresteds & 1 Xoloitzcuintle"},{"Title":"The Joy of Breeding Your Own Show Dog (Howell Dog Book of Distinction)","review":"Excellent read for a new breeder such as myself and a great value considering the cost of this book if bought new.

There was an inch section on the outside binding that looked like someone's dog tasted it, but the inside was in perfect condition and looked like new. The book is from the original printing period before they updated the cover but for $5, it's the same excellent resource for anyone interested in breeding and raising dogs to have. Especially when other copies were $35 and up for the same book. I don't think they changed any of the information in the second printing, just the cover.It is an excellent resource, and while I'm glad I found one for such a great price, it's well worth the investment if you pay more.

People who can no longer get this book should check out Terri Shumsky's HOW TO BUY AND RAISE A GOOD HEALTHY DOG, which contains all the same information given to Ann Seranne PLUS lots more.Here's what Boxer Review said about Terri Shumsky's book.The Book ShelfHow to Buy and Raise a Good Healthy Dog is mostly about breeding andraising a dog. It contains one chapter on the buying of a dog, one chapter on generalhealth care (covering about 65 pages) and three appendixes on genetics, food andnutrition and microchips.&quot;This is another Doral publication which was written by breeder and judge Terri Shumsky. The illustrations are effective particularly in regard to the birthing process. As a matter of fact, the information given in the &quot;Having Puppies&quot; chapter is exceptional and useful for both the novice and experienced breeder. I think that the information on general health care is quite sufficient for most dog owners. Other books which have been reviewed in this column (The Merck Veterinary Manual,Hands-On Dog Care, The Purina Encyclopedia of Dog Care and the Five Minute Veterinary Ready Reference) are perhaps too extensive for most health questions. Shumsky's book fills a niche of providing just about enough information.&quot;"},{"Title":"The terrible year: The Paris Commune, 1871","review":"....if you take this gem of a book to bed with you.France loses a war. Paris is surrounded by the Prussian army. The government decamps to Versailles and agrees to a hobbling peace treaty with the enemy. The besieged Parisians refuse to accept defeat. They send up reconnaissance balloons and eat all the animals in the zoo. They set up their own Commune authority and declare war on the French government. Their Commune government quickly degenerates into madness, Lord of the Flies-style, murdering the archbishop, much of the clergy, and many others denounced as politically suspect.An episode far more murderous and traumatic than the Reign of Terror or the Occupation of the 1940s, and still deeply cherished, feared and argued about in France to this day."},{"Title":"The terrible year: The Paris Commune, 1871","review":"The Franco-Prussian War, the Prussian siege against Paris, and the rise and fall of the Paris Commune in 1871 are the topics of this short, well organized book. We are not told much about the reign of Napoleon III other than the disaster of declaring war on Prussia at a time in which Bismarck was consolidating the German state under the rule of Prussia. The fall of Napoleon III stimulated the rise of the Republic under the leadership of elites, who in turn evoke or activate the National Guard to protect the city. The Prussians invaded France and demanded complete surrender from the French, now represented by the hold-out city of Paris. It appears that there were many units among the National Guard, with many units made up of middle class neighbors, however many were also made up of labor and worker class folks. Defense of the city required that weapons be distributed to the working class. Whereas this was a necessity of war, it armed the \\"Reds\\", the poor workers, whose grandfathers had probably be an erupting force during the French Revolution. A long siege began that involved the use of hot air balloons to carry military messages, some of which made their way correctly and some of which ended up in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and even Norway. The food shortages impacted the poor first prior to rally impacting the middle and upper classes, but eventually shortages resulted in the people eating horses, dogs, cats, and animals in the zoo. The Republic was managed poorly for many reasons, which put the French at a disadvantage compared to the Prussians. Eventually, after several ill timed and ill planned scrimmages, the French did negotiate. However the lingering resentment of the laboring underclass erupts soon after the Prussians leave and the city is taken over by the Commune. Horne emphasizes the chaotic nature of the management of the Commune, but two facts need to be considered. One is that the laboring class had far less experience at governance that did the upper class elites. I wish Horne, in the name of fairness had explored this point. The Republic was also run in a crisis reactionary manner during the siege by the Prussians but they get far less commentary on their weaknesses than do the leaders of the Commune. The other fact is that the laboring class did support the war efforts when the Republic was in control to a greater degree than did the elites when the Commune was in control. There is some interesting analysis of how the Commune failed to take over the Bank of France and thus left a weapon in the hands of the upper classes. The artist Courbet and his role in the destruction of the Vendome Column was interesting. The role of Victor Hugo in all aspects of French history during this time was also interesting. As the Commune loses power, the historic buildings of the city are targets for arson including the burning of the historic Tuileries palace, so near in proximity to the Louvre. However the upper and middle classes are not long out of power and overthrow the Commune, resulting in the deaths of over 20,000 poor laboring men and women and children. Many were executed in mass and buried in mass graves. War is terrible but Civil War may often be worse. Alistair Horne is a popular historian and whereas I think he may have tried to be balanced in his history of the Paris Commune's fall in 1871, his biases against the Commune come through. The upper and middle classes murdered far more poor men and women workers in the fall of the Commune than did the Jacobites kill during the entire Reign of Terror. Horne tells us of the significant lessons learned by the Communists Lenin, Marx, and Stalin based upon the rise and fall of the Commune. To some degree, Horne makes more connections of the Commune to Marx and to Lenin than to the Labor Movement and Socialist movement, which seemed to me to be tarnishing and not entirely fair. I found the book interesting and well focused, but Horne seems to have a personal view point that is prejudicial against the Commune that emerges from his use of adjectives, his descriptions, and even some of his conclusions."},{"Title":"The terrible year: The Paris Commune, 1871","review":"I am going to assume that anyone landing here already has an interest in the subject. So... no rehash.This is a short book. I like that. Horne tells the tale with wit, charm, interesting tidbits, sweeping themes and all that other stuff you look for in a book (history or not).I hope to read all of Horne's histories of post revolutionary France all the way through to WWI. Its a subject that tells a great deal about emotional and intellectual underpinnings of Europe's secular, internationalist politics in our time.Great writer, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"And You Invited Me In: A Story of Redemption","review":"I commend the author for writing on the topic of unconditional love in a situation (AIDS/homosexuality) which a Christian disagrees with. How does a believer maintain integrity while loving as Jesus would? Tyler's placing her perspective within a novel provides the reader an opportunity to suspend judgment while following the developing story. One comes to care for each character who is struggling with their past and present. Initially I found some difficulty in following who was who and each person's back story (there are many characters), but after awhile that got ironed out. Once into the book, I read it straight through. The author knows the context of many conservative Christians and does a fair job of showing the range of attitudes without stereotyping. Her depiction of the gay characters is also thorough, neither sanitizing nor alarmist. The complexity of the plotting mirrors the complexity of each main character. Each struggles with hurts, need for attachment and a history of regrets, the main Christian character Annie included. Each faces personal sin and the need for transparency whatever the personal cost. I wondered how she would end the story of Scot and was pleased with her decision to not tie up loose ends with a tidy conclusion. There is room for another book to follow Scot on his journey of new faith. \\"And You Invited Me In\\" would make a great choice for a book group discussion."},{"Title":"And You Invited Me In: A Story of Redemption","review":"The authors of this novel have done an outstanding job of delving into the explosive mix of emotions Christians must feel in sorting out their beliefs regarding homosexuality and Christian love and fealty to family. In less capable hands, this premise could have melted into melodrama, but these authors have handled it with great compassion and insight. I hope to read much more from them in the future."},{"Title":"Creativity and Madness: New Findings and Old Stereotypes","review":"Rothenberg looks at creativity from the perspective of a scientist. He examines psychological ideas- Freudian, depression, bi-polar, schizophrenia; linguistic trends- use of alliteration, metaphors, rhymes; personality characteristics- motivated, determined, and able to organize one's ideas; and relates them all to his search for answers to why some can create such wonderful works of art. He dispells myths about creativity being some mystical birth-right that only the chosen few possess, and implies the conclusion that creativity is more the product of an aware mind and feeling human being than tormented genius.
