Jacqueline Vaughn Switzer gives us a comprehensive introduction to and overview of U.S. disability policy in all facets of society, including education, the workplace, and social integration. Disabled Rights provides an interdisciplinary approach to the history and politics of the disability rights movement and assesses the creation and implementation, successes and failures of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by federal, state and local governments. Disabled Rights explains how people with disabilities have been treated from a social, legal, and political perspective in the United States. With an objective and straightforward approach, Switzer identifies the programs and laws that have been enacted in the past fifty years and how they have affected the lives of people with disabilities. She raises questions about Congressional intent in passing the ADA, the evolution and fragmentation of the disability rights movement, and the current status of disabled people in the U.S. Illustrating the shift of disability issues from a medical focus to civil rights, the author clearly defines the contemporary role of persons with disabilities in American culture, and comprehensively outlines the public and private programs designed to integrate disabled persons into society. She covers the law's provisions as they apply to private organizations and businesses and concludes with the most up-to-date coverage of recent Supreme Court decisions-especially since the 2000-2002 terms-that have profoundly influenced the implementation of the ADA and other disability policies. For activists as well as scholars, students, and practitioners in public policy and public administration, Switzer has written a compassionate, yet powerful book that demands attention from everyone interested in the battle for disability rights and equality in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8PNKDAAAQBAJ&dq=Disabled+Rights:+American+Disability+Policy+and+the+Fight+for+Equality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"98 Things a Woman Should Do in Her Lifetime","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Atlanta Youth Murders and the Politics of Race (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","description":"Between 1979 and 1981 a killer terrorized Atlanta, till Wayne B.

This view (and similar views) have been called Scientism. In this book, scientists' views about science and its relationship to knowledge, ethics and religion are subjected to critical scrutiny. A number of natural scientists have advocated Scientism in one form or another - Francis Crick, Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan, and Edward O. Wilson - and their impact inside and outside the sciences is considered. Clarifying what Scientism is, this book proceeds to evaluate its key claims, expounded in questions such as: is it the case that science can tell us everything there is to know about reality? Can science tell us how we morally ought to live and what the meaning of life is? Can science in fact be our new religion? Ought we become \\"science believers\\"? The author addresses these and similar issues, concluding that Scientism is not really science but disguised materialism or naturalism; its advocates fail to see this, not being sufficiently aware that their arguments presuppose the previous acceptance of certain extra-scientific or philosophical beliefs","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o-pGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The National Collegiate Athletic Association: A Study in Cartel Behavior","description":"Intercollegiate sports is an enterprise that annually grosses over $1 billion in income. Some schools may receive more than $20 million from athletic programs, perhaps as much as $10 million simply from the sale of football tickets. Drawing on nontechnical economic data, the authors present a persuasive case that the premier sports organization of colleges and universities in the United States--the NCAA--is a cartel, its members engaged in classically defined restrictive practices for the sole purpose of jointly maximizing their profits. This fresh perspective on the NCAA offers explanations of why illicit payments to athletes persist, why non-NCAA organizations have not flourished, and why members have readily agreed on certain suspect rules. Tracing the historical development of this institutional behavior, the authors argue that the major football powers in the early 1950s were able to gain control of the internal processes of NCAA enforcement. Over time--as other schools' teams improved and began to win on the playing field--the more powerful institutions applied pressure to bring the newcomers under NCAA investigation and, ultimately, to place them on probation. By carefully managing NCAA enforcement regulations, major schools blunted the threat to their continued growth presented by other teams. Offering a valuable case study for sports analysts and students of economics and cartel behavior, this book is a revealing glimpse inside the embattled NCAA.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cmv5YNVTVCYC&dq=The+National+Collegiate+Athletic+Association:+A+Study+in+Cartel+Behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Forsyte Saga, V1","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"To Prove I'm Not Forgotten: Living and Dying in a Victorian City","description":"With the growth of English cities during the Industrial Revolution came a booming population too vast for churchyards.

Using the principles of ancient wisdom to make sense of the current global situation, this book invites us to look at the USA from the biggest possible picture: that of cosmic meaning. With a rare blend of compassion, humor and fearless taboo-busting, Soul-Sick Nation reveals America's noble potential without sentiment and diagnoses its neuroses without delusion, shedding new light on troubling issues that the pundits and culture wars inflame but leave painfully unresolved: the WTC bombings, the war in Iraq, Islamic jihad, media propaganda, consumerism and the American Dream. In her interpretation of the birth chart of the entity born July 4, 1776, Murray offers an in-depth analysis of America's essential destiny--uncovering, chapter by chapter, the greater purpose motivating this group soul. She shows how this purpose has been distorted, and how it can be re-embraced in the decades to come. She decodes current astrological transits that express the key themes the USA must learn in this period of millennial crisis-including that of the responsibility of power-spelling out the profound lessons the nation will face in the next few years. Combining the rigor of a political theorist with the vision of a master astrologer, this keenly intelligent book elucidates the meaning of an epoch in distress, and proposes a path towards healing-of the country and of its individual citizens. Murray explains how each of us can come to terms with this moment in history and arrive at a response that is unique and creative. This book willleave you revitalized, shorn of illusions and full of hope.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fc4COetEiPEC&dq=Astrology+of+Personality:+A+Reinterpretation+of+Astrological+Concepts+and+Ideals+in+terms+of+Contemporary+Psychology+and+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through Hope and Despair: A Fan's Memories of the Chicago White Sox 1967-1997","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S-qRAAAACAAJ&dq=Through+Hope+and+Despair:+A+Fan%27s+Memories+of+the+Chicago+White+Sox+1967-1997&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self Directed Behavior","description":"Achieve your life goals with SELF-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR!

Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments? The shocking answer is: None of the above! In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: \\"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\\" Eker does this by identifying your \\"money and success blueprint.\\" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \\"revise\\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it. In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \\"Wealth Files,\\" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth. If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4AUbNnnOzSAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Song: The Battle of Powder River and the Beginning of the Great Sioux War of 1876 (Plainsmen)","description":"Blood Song Terry C.

His personal ambitiousness and racial ambivalence makes him a sort of American Hamlet: undone by indecision. Will he be  a credit to his race  by advancing an African-American heritage he loves and appreciates in the face of a hostile culture, or will he retreat into the mediocrity of a safe, white, middle-class family life? Along the way, he shares his penetrating observations about race relations in the American north and south, about the  freemasonry  of subterranean black American culture, about the emerging bohemian jazz subculture in New York City, and about traditions of African American religious music and oratory.

The amazing opportunity is that anyone who wants to stay in Heaven, can. This is the starting point for an extraordinary meditation upon good and evil, grace and judgment. Lewis's revolutionary idea is the discovery that the gates of Hell are locked from the inside.

In spite of his religious training, Sayy?h had a positive attitude towards modern European customs. He mingled with people from all social classes and developed a fair understanding of their ideas; he saw that they were free to openly criticise their governments and religious authorities.

Nicknamed \\"The Sled\\" by those few who flew it, the aircraft was shrouded in secrecy from its inception. Entering the U.S. Air Force inventory in 1966, the SR-71 was the fastest, highest flying jet aircraft in the world. Now for the first time, a Blackbird pilot shares his unique experience of what it was like to fly this legend of aviation history. Through the words & photographs of retired Major Brian Shul, we enter the world of the \\"Sled Driver.\\" Major Shul gives us insight on all phases of flying, including the humbling experience of simulator training, the physiological stresses of wearing a space suit for long hours, & the intensity & magic of flying 80,000 feet above the Earth's surface at 2000 miles per hour. SLED DRIVER takes the reader through riveting accounts of the rigors of initial training, the gamut of emotions experienced while flying over hostile territory, & the sheer joy of displaying the jet at some of the world's largest airshows.

This internationally acclaimed revelatory history \\"filled with first-person accounts from articles and diaries\\" (The New York Times) of the transformational decade that followed World War II illustrates how Germany raised itself out of the ashes of defeat and reckoned with the corruption of its soul and the horrors of the Holocaust. Featuring over 40 eye-opening black-and-white photographs and posters from the period. The years 1945 to 1955 were a raw, wild decade that found many Germans politically, economically, and morally bankrupt. Victorious Allied forces occupied the four zones that make up present-day Germany. More than half the population was displaced; 10 million newly released forced laborers and several million prisoners of war returned to an uncertain existence. Cities lay in ruins no mail, no trains, no traffic with bodies yet to be found beneath the towering rubble. Aftermath received wide acclaim and spent forty-eight weeks on the best-seller list in Germany when it was published there in 2019. It is the first history of Germany's national mentality in the immediate postwar years. Using major global political developments as a backdrop, Harald J?hner weaves a series of life stories into a nuanced panorama of a nation undergoing monumental change. Poised between two eras, this decade is portrayed by J?hner as a period that proved decisive for Germany's future and one starkly different from how most of us imagine it today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hpgoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conversations With Nostradamus: His Prophecies Explained, Vol. 1 (Revised Edition & Addendum 2001)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Who Sees the Lighthouse?","description":"In this cumulative rhyme, lighthouses from around the United States are observed by one sailor, two pilots, three gulls, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RMULAAAACAAJ&dq=Who+Sees+the+Lighthouse%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gershwins","description":"Presents an illustrated tribute to the lives and legacies of the Gershwins that is presented through the stories of twelve of their most enduring songs including \\"Strike Up the Band\\" and \\"Love Is Here to Stay.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WQjgAAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Gershwins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Dharma: The Emerging Western Buddhism","description":"One of America's most respected Buddhist teachers distills a lifetime of practice and teaching in this groundbreaking exploration of the new Buddhist tradition taking root on American soil.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UOsFwgjax9IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Anti-Gravity Handbook","description":"The new expanded compilation of material on Anti-Gravity, Free Energy, Flying Saucer Propulsion, UFOs, Suppressed Technology, NASA Cover-ups and more.

Lam rim chen mo) is one of the brightest jewels in the world s treasury of sacred literature. The author, Tsong-kha-pa, completed it in 1402, and it soon became one of the most renowned works of spiritual practice and philosophy in the world of Tibetan Buddhism. Because it condenses all the exoteric s tra scriptures into a meditation manual that is easy to understand, scholars and practitioners rely on its authoritative presentation as a gateway that leads to a full understanding of the Buddha s teachings. Tsong-kha-pa took great pains to base his insights on classical Indian Buddhist literature, illustrating his points with classical citations as well as with sayings of the masters of the earlier Kadampa tradition. In this way the text demonstrates clearly how Tibetan Buddhism carefully preserved and developed the Indian Buddhist traditions.

Do heaven and hell exist? And if so, how can hell be reconciled with a loving God? By sharing the very latest scientific, philosophical, anthropological, ethical, and theological evidence on life after death, noted Christian scholars Habermas and Moreland present a strong case for immortality with this book. They begin by taking up the question of whether life after death is real and what evidence supports its reality. They then explore what the afterlife is like and go on to show how having this reality in your future should affect the way you live here and now. This book will reassure you that there's no need to fear death - as long as you're prepared eternity that follows.

In this book - which was a tremendous success in Italy - Norberto Bobbio challenges these views, arguing that the fundamental political distinction between Left and Right, which has shaped the two centuries since the French Revolution, has continuing relevance today. Bobbio explores the grounds of this elusive distinction and argues that Left and Right are ultimately divided by different attitudes to equality. He carefully defines the nature of equality and inequality in relative rather than absolute terms. Left and Right is a timely and persuasively argued account of the basic parameters of political action and debate in the modern world - parameters which have remained constant despite the pace of social change. The book will be widely read and, as in Italy, it will have an impact far beyond the academic domain.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fy_fCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Feast Unknown","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mYjDAQAACAAJ&dq=A+Feast+Unknown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japanese Master Swordsmiths: The Gassan Tradition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Online Style Guide: Terms, Usage, and Tips","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pushkin Threefold: Narrative, Lyric, Polemic, and Ribald Verse - The originals with linear and metric translations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sand Creek","description":"Sometimes called \\"The Chivington Massacre\\" by those who would emphasize his responsibility for the attack and \\"The Battle of Sand Creek\\" by those who would imply that it was not a massacre, this event has become one of our nation s most controversial Indian conflicts.

The most frequent design elements in Kentucky rock art are engravings of the footprints of birds, quadrupeds, and humans. Other design elements include anthropomorphs, mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and abstract and geometric figures. Included in the book are stunning illustrations of the sixty confirmed sites and ten destroyed or questionable sites. In the thirty some years during which this information was collected, there has been an alarming deterioration of many of the sites. Ancient carvings have been destroyed by graffiti or have lost extensive detail because of climatic or environmental conditions, such as acid rain. Although all the Kentucky sites are officially listed on the National register of Historic Places, several no long exist or are at present inaccessible.

Most interpreters have seen the motives for these reform measures as purely political, but Thomas Goebel demonstrates that the call for direct democracy was deeply rooted in antimonopoly sentiment. Frustrated with the governmental corruption and favoritism that facilitated the rise of monopolies, advocates of direct democracy aimed to check the influence of legislative bodies and directly empower the people to pass laws and abolish trusts. But direct democracy failed to achieve its promises: corporations and trusts continued to flourish, voter turnout rates did not increase, and interest groups grew stronger. By the 1930s, it was clear that direct democracy favored large organizations with the financial and organizational resources to fund increasingly expensive campaigns. Recent years have witnessed a resurgence of direct democracy, particularly in California, where ballot questions and propositions have addressed such volatile issues as gay rights and affirmative action. In this context, Goebel's analysis of direct democracy's history, evolution, and ultimate unsuitability as a grassroots tool is particularly timely.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xy7d75BTKDYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devonian Paleontology of New York","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GdW5oQEACAAJ&dq=Devonian+Paleontology+of+New+York&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A FRIEND IS SOMEONE WHO LIKES YOU","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Diamond Sutra Explained","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kde-AAAACAAJ&dq=Diamond+Sutra+Explained&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Happy Birthday!

The Reader juxtaposes the main theoretical approaches to urban power with vivid accounts of actual political experiences on such key themes as the urban crisis, the politics of race, ethnicity and gender, national urban policy, suburbanization and globalization. Strom and Mollenkopf illustrate how thinking about cities is central to our understanding of democracy and citizenship, and how although the parties to urban politics may change over time, the struggle of new groups to gain access and representation is a constant theme. The Editors' introductions suggest topics and questions for class discussion, demonstrate the significance of urban politics, and suggest directions for further reading and thinking, while the associated bibliography enables deeper investigations.

'Where is your nephew?' repeated Neveille. 'Why do you ask me?' 'I ask you,' retorted Jasper, 'because you were the last person in his company, and he is not to be found.' The Mystery of Edwin Drood, Dickens's last novel, lay unfinished at his death. Speculation remains rife as to its probably conclusion; evidence suggests that, fascinated as Dickens was by details of the plotting, his basic concern was for character and appropriate setting, in particular the character of the hero-villain, Jasper. The ancient city of Cloisterham, its cathedral a reminder of mortality, human frailty, and the lawful life, is an effective background for what Dickens daughter called a tale of 'the tragic secrets of the human heart'. Humour is provided by a host of characters ranging fro Mr Grewgious, the admirable though eccentric lawyer, and Miss Twinkleton, guardian of the Young Ladies' Seminary, to Durdles, the hard-drinking stonemason, and Deputy, the irreverent lodging-house boy. This edition contains Dickens's working plans for the novel, and the text is that of the authoritative Clarendon edition. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

This unique format covers various pathologies that may be related to a patient's symptoms, and features illustrations and sonograms that demonstrate each pathology. The book is divided into five major sections: abdomen, obstetrics, gynecology, superficial structures, and a miscellaneous section to include pediatric and vascular clinical indications. Each chapter within those sections focuses on a clinical indication, and incorporates background information, a clinical scenario, discussions of pathologies and differential diagnoses, illustrations, sonograms, patient scenarios with multiple choice and case-based questions to ensure you have a solid understanding of the material. Symptom-based presentation makes it easy for beginning and experienced sonographers to quickly find information related to the patient's symptom. Summary tables of differential diagnoses and sonographic findings provide you with a brief overview of all chapter material for quick reference. Clinical scenarios at the beginning of each chapter help you learn to apply information to the clinical setting. Case studies and discussion questions give you the opportunity to enhance your critical-thinking skills and measure your comprehension of material. Over 900 ultrasound images correlated to the pathology illustrate what you'll encounter in the clinical setting. Glossary helps you define important terminology. New chapters provide you with more complete coverage of the pathology sonographers encounter in practice. New case studies with critical-thinking questions set up realistic situations for you to use as a frame of reference. 600 updated images produced by the latest technology keep you on the cutting-edge of sonography.

With his academic career torpedoed, Sheldrake has become the champion of ?the people's science?.

To overcome a crisis of melancholy after the death of his father, Montaigne withdrew to his country estates and began to write, and in the highly original essays that resulted he discussed themes such as fathers and children, conscience and cowardice, coaches and cannibals, and, above all, himself. On Some Lines of Virgil opens out into a frank discussion of sexuality and makes a revolutionary case for the equality of the sexes. In On Experience he superbly propounds his thoughts on the right way to live, while other essays touch on issues of an age struggling with religious and intellectual strife, with France torn apart by civil war. These diverse subjects are united by Montaigne's distinctive voice - that of a tolerant man, sceptical, humane, often humorous and utterly honest in his pursuit of the truth. M.A. Screech's distinguished translation fully retains the light-hearted and inquiring nature of the essays. In his introduction, he examines Montaigne's life and times, and the remarkable self-portrait that emerges from his works. Michel de Montaigne (1533-1586) studied law and spent a number of years working as a counsellor before devoting his life to reading, writing and reflection. If you enjoyed The Essays: A Selection, you might like Francis Bacon's The Essays, also available in Penguin Classics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EyVFuyze44QC&dq=The+Essays:+A+Selection+(Penguin+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kings and Queens of England and Scotland","description":"Profiles each British monarch, and looks at events, objects, and rituals associated with the British throne","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QmfWAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Kings+and+Queens+of+England+and+Scotland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Crooked Death: Coatesville Pennsylvania and the Lynching of Zachariah Walker (Blacks in the New World)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QK33AAAAIAAJ&dq=No+Crooked+Death:+Coatesville+Pennsylvania+and+the+Lynching+of+Zachariah+Walker+(Blacks+in+the+New+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut (Transaction Large Print Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ERxzPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Southern+Gates+of+Arabia:+A+Journey+in+the+Hadhramaut+(Transaction+Large+Print+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning to Heal","description":"To be a Christian involves becoming more like Jesus and this involves at least three things: Developing the type of relationship with God that Jesus had.

Cutler was an officer with the elite X-2 counterintelligence branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and with its successor, the Strategic Services Unit (SSU). Counterspy offers a rare firsthand account of the secret war against Hitler and the postwar competition with the Soviets for German intelligence assets.While with X-2, Cutler analyzed the super-secret Ultra intercepts and vetted agents about to be sent into Nazi Germany. Cutler provides an insightful overview of OSS operations during the war and their contribution to the Alliesa victory. This is also one of the few books to describe the role of the OSS and the SSU in the postwar occupation of Germany. Cutleras first job after the German surrender was to vet all of Allen Dullesas wartime sources inside Germany, who were aptly nicknamed the Crown Jewels. Just as the OSS was reorganized into the SSU, Cutler moved to Berlin, where his first task was to collect intelligence from former Nazis. Soon he became chief of counterespionage in Berlin. Soviet intelligence had already begun recruiting former German intelligence officers to spy on Americans, so Cutleras top priority was to uncover Soviet objectives and either neutralize or double their agents. Cutler reveals previously unpublished case histories of double agents against Soviet intelligence and details agentsa recruitment, missions, methods of operation, successes and failures, and fates. All of these events are recounted against the fascinating background of postwar Germany. He provides a vivid picture of the mood of the German people, how they rationalized war guilt, and how they coped with the devastation throughout the country. With photographs and a foreword by bestselling author Joseph E. Persico (Rooseveltas Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage), Counterspy is a unique account of espionage during the momentous years of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EKm4CTtOGVIC&dq=Counterspy:+Memoirs+of+a+Counterintelligence+Officer+in+World+War+II+and+the+Cold+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Air Command;: A fighter pilot's story","description":"Autobiography of a Canadian fighter pilot who rose to become an air vice-marshall in the R.A.F.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_FuZAAAACAAJ&dq=Air+Command%3B:+A+fighter+pilot%27s+story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dake Annotated Reference Bible","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fI9hrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Dake+Annotated+Reference+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Escape Routes: Further Adventure Writings of David Roberts","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"BRADMAN","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Man Who Loved Mars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MHp2vgEACAAJ&dq=The+Man+Who+Loved+Mars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Pencil Pastimes: Book of Seek-A-Word","description":"Sharpen your pencil and your mind with this impressive collection of up, down, forward, backward, and diagonal puzzles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XDsAAAAACAAJ&dq=The+New+Pencil+Pastimes:+Book+of+Seek-A-Word&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AIDS: A Second Opinion","description":"Drawn from extensive research of alternative and traditional medicine, a unique resource shatters the myths about AIDS to provide a new understanding of this enigmatic illness and furnishes a wealth of alternative treatments for AIDS patients, from nutritional support to metabolic stabilization therapies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EAmiOwAACAAJ&dq=AIDS:+A+Second+Opinion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stray Lamb","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Drawing Blood: Forty-five Years of Scarfe Uncensored","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blood Done Sign My Name: A True Story","description":"The author returns to his hometown of Oxford, North Carolina, to make sense of the thirty-year-old murder of a black man by a Klansman, and the Klansman's subsequent acquittal by an all-white jury.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fz0TAAAAYAAJ&dq=Blood+Done+Sign+My+Name:+A+True+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Coming Fury","description":"Chronicles the history of the American Civil War, starting with the Democratic Party's Charleston Convention in 1860, and ending with first battle of the war at Bull Run.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BvmTNAEACAAJ&dq=The+Coming+Fury&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Perspectives on Microsoft Access 2000 - Introductory (New Perspectives Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Hit: Level One (Natural Golf, 1)","description":"If your golf game has been plagued by inconsistency and less-than-peak performance, you may be going against your \\"natural swing\\".

Knowing it was his 'lifework,' Tomkins conflated 'life' and 'work,' reifying the superstition that its completion would equal death and refusing to release for publication long-completed material. He knew the risks associated with this obsessive, neurotic behavior, and the results were as bad as predicted. The first two volumes of Affect Imagery Consciousness (AIC) were released in 1962 and 1963, Volume III in 1991 shortly before he succumbed to a particularly virulent strain of small cell lymphoma, and Volume IV a year after his death. This last book contains Tomkins's understanding of neocortical cognition, ideas that are even now exciting, but until this current publication of his work as a single supervolume, almost nobody has read it. The bulk of his audience had died along with the enthusiasm generated by his ideas. Big science is now more a matter of big machines and unifocal discoveries as the basis for pars pro toto reasoning than big ideas based on the assembly and analysis of all that is known. Tomkins ignored nothing from any science past or present that might lead him toward a more certain understanding of the mind. Every idea, every theory deserved attention if only because significant observations can loiter in blind alleys.\\"--From the prologue by Donald Nathanson, MD Volume 2 of Springer's deluxe new edition of Tomkins's masterpiece includes The Negative Affects: Fear and Anger and Cognition: Duplication and Transformation of Information.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wKrhzAEACAAJ&dq=Affect,+Imagery,+Consciousness:+The+Negative+Affects+:+Anger+and+Fear&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The rise of the Dutch republic;: A history, (Everyman's library.

It is not a study of the assimilation of American immigrants and of the resultant formation of the supra-ethnic American nation. The two processes--de-ethnization and Americanization, opposite cultural-linguistic self-maintenance--are equally ubiquitous throughout all of American history. As a nation we have paid infinitely more attention to the Americanization process than to the self-maintenance process. This study represents an all too preliminary attempt to redress this imbalance in attention. At the present time, non-English language skills are recognized as scarce and vital commodities in the conduct of our nation's international relations. Is it possible that we have appreciable but as yet unrecognized resources of these scarce commodities? This is an attempt to explore the current extent and status of culture and language maintenance efforts. Varying approaches, topics, and levels of collaboration and cross-fertilization were encouraged. It is hoped that the report produced leaves the field of inquiry somewhat more organized than when this effort began.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RnFsAAAAIAAJ&dq=Language+loyalty+in+the+United+States:+The+maintenance+and+perpetuation+of+non-English+mother+tongues+by+American+ethnic+and+religious+groups&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Original Water Color Paintings By John James Audubon For Birds Of America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pestalozzi, the man and his work","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Chocolate Debutante","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"War of Vengeance: Acts of Retaliation Against Civil War POWs","description":"The violent retaliation between sides in the American Civil War was perhaps most apparent in the taking of prisoners.

Lonnie Speer takes no sides as he points an accusing finger at both the Union and the Confederacy for their equal parts in treating the prisoners poorly.

Yet these celebrated companies are united by another factor not generally equated with competitive success: They are all family-controlled businesses. While many view the hallmarks of family businesses stable strategies, clan cultures, and unencumbered family ownership as weaknesses, Danny Miller and Isabelle Le Breton-Miller argue that it is these very characteristics that create formidable competitive advantages for many such firms. Managing for the Long Run draws from a worldwide study of enduring, family-run organizations including Cargill, Timken, L.L. Bean, The New York Times, and IKEA to reveal their unconventional success strategies and how these strategies can be adopted and applied in any organization. Miller and Le Breton-Miller show how four driving passions of family-run firms command, continuity, community, and connection give rise to a set of practices that defy modern management thinking yet ensure a company s long term competitive advantage. Outlining how these practices can enhance strategic efforts from operations to brand leadership to innovation, this book shows what every company must do to manage for the long run.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5fqYqzlWU5IC&dq=Managing+For+The+Long+Run:+Lessons+In+Competitive+Advantage+From+Great+Family+Businesses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Fucking Move/Book and Record","description":"A totalitarian regime has ordered all books to be destroyed, but one of the book burners suddenly realizes their merit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b-o_K_AFJiUC&dq=One+Fucking+Move/Book+and+Record&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alligator Sue","description":"After being separated from her parents by a hurricane on the bayou, a young girl is raised by an alligator and later must discover who she really is.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YPRzswEACAAJ&dq=Alligator+Sue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Surrender","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heavenly Answers for Earthly Questions: Simple Lessons for a Life Worth Living","description":"Drawing on her own neardeath experience, the author presents a compelling and inspirational guide on how to achieve a meaningful, vital life, explaining how to overcome despair, reduce stress, and create a productive, spiritually enriching place for oneself in the world.

Spence's Wyoming is a land fast disappearing, a land of pioneers and poor framers, of cowboys and mountain men and the strong women who helped settle the land.

Some armies brutalize ethnic recruits; others simply reject them. Alon Peled compares the experiences of Malay-Muslim soldiers in Singapore, Arabs in Israel, and blacks in South Africa. Drawing on his interviews with senior officers and policymakers, he examines the histories of these armies and their levels of ethnic integration. He also suggests how minority soldiers can be gradually recruited, integrated, and promoted. Ethnic soldiers can only succeed, Peled argues, when officers formulate manpower policy on the basis of combat needs rather than political concerns. Peled highlights the behind-the-scenes roles played by officers and ethnic leaders. He advocates new policies for change, recommending that the leaders of ethnically torn countries such as the republics of the former Soviet Union and states in central Africa allow professional officers to introduce soldiers from mistrusted ethnic groups through a process of phased integration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TXQbyG2EKCwC&dq=A+Question+of+Loyalty:+Military+Manpower+Policy+in+Multiethnic+States+(Cornell+Studies+in+Security+Affairs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The prospects for revolution;: A study of riots, civil disobedience, and insurrection in contemporary America,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Kitchen Congregation : A Daughter's Story of Wives and Women Friends","description":"A memoir of motherhood and memory by the author of The Road to My Farm centers around the lives of five women as they struggle with the joys and pain of motherhood, discussing men, children, and favorite recipes in the kitchen.

An ambitious departure for an author renowned for his realism, this collection of short fiction  collectively . . . [engages] in a reconnaissance through the dustier reaches of man s experience with [the] spectres of doubt, defeat, failure and paradox  (Kirkus Reviews). In  Under the Garden,  William Wilditch, a restless loner given to wanderlust, takes one final journey as he approaches death back to his childhood home where he discovers that the memories of his youth are simply not to be believed. In  A Visit to Morin,  an admirer and old friend of a once-renowned Catholic writer is unprepared for the startling confessions of the spiritually bereft, now-reclusive scribe. On a vast plantation, a peculiar wish is granted a poor leper by his physician-in-charge and for one rowdy winter night, a  Dream of a Strange Land  becomes a reality. Finally, for a group of children scouting the apocalyptic ruins at the edge of their village,  A Discovery in the Woods  opens their eyes to a lost world they never knew existed.

Together with his late wife Sunanda, the couple have generated an extraordinary read in The Forgotten Woman: The Untold Story of Kastur Gandhi. Here is a book that is not only informative and accessible, but also graced by an elegance and sensitive understanding of a grandmother who was far from being ignorant or clueless a propos the importance of her husband's mission in life. Kastur Gandhi wife of Mahatma Gandhi. Arun informs his readers in the introduction that he refuses to believe that his grandmother Kastur was incompetent as this was not his experience, nor that of his parents. Although she may not have been formally educated and could not read or write, upon reading this fascinating book we discover she certainly was far from being an unaware and a blundering fool. And as Arun states: \\"without her unstinted cooperation Grandfather could not have achieved the spiritual heights that he did.\\" Beginning with an account of the Satyagraha struggle which Gandhi led in South Africa for seven years, Kastur had to give up a great deal and make sacrifices while living an austere life that many a woman would have rebelled against and probably would have also thrown out their husbands. There is even an anecdote where Mahatma wanted to turf out Kastur from their home. Perhaps initially she may not have understood her husband's technique of passive resistance that ruled out both verbal and physical violence, however, eventually she did come around to accept its principles as she championed it and embraced it whole heartedly. As Arun mentions, \\"that even though she could not, on her own account, accept any of her husband's peculiar new notions unless she was convinced he was right, she would always try to understand his way of thinking and, whenever possible, acquiesce to his wishes.\\" What I found astonishing was her acceptance of her husband's harsh and sometimes cruel treatment of their children, herself, relatives and others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HV6ajgEACAAJ&dq=The+Forgotten+Woman:+The+Untold+Story+of+Kastur+Gandhi,+Wife+of+Mahatma+Gandhi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unknown Ajax","description":"\\"Wonderful entertainment from first page to last.\\" ?

Weary of fighting, the American people were determined to defeat the imperial power that had so viciously attacked them in December 1941, but they were uncertain of the best means to accomplish this goal. Certain of victory -- the \\"inevitable triumph\\" promised by Franklin Roosevelt immediately after Pearl Harbor -- Americans became increasingly concerned about the human cost of defeating Japan. Particularly after the brutal Iwo Jima and Okinawa campaigns, syndicated columnists, newspaper editorialists, radio commentators, and others questioned the necessity of invasion. A lengthy naval and aerial siege would have saved lives but might have protracted the war beyond the public's patience. Advertisers filled the media with visions of postwar affluence even as the government was exhorting its citizens to remain dedicated to the war effort. There was heated discussion as well about the morality of firebombing Japanese cities and of using poison gas and other agents of chemical warfare. Chappell provides a balanced assessment of all these debates, grounding his observations in a wealth of primary sources. He also discusses the role of racism, the demand for unconditional surrender, and the government's reaction to public opinion in the decision to drop the atomic bomb. Compelling and controversial, this is the first work to examine the confusing and contradictory climate of the American home front in the months leading up to V-J Day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SsQeBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boomerang;: An Australian escapade","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empires","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Backstreet Mom: A Mother's Tale of Backstreet Boy AJ McLean's Rise to Fame, Struggle with Addiction, and Ultimate Triumph","description":"Featured on \\"Oprah\\" and \\"Good Morning America.

Its invasive growth, he argues, threatens to break down our society's immune system and--if not soon restrained--could reverse all the progress that has been made toward social equity and stability. On every continent, in every state, there are indicators of profound economic and environmental collapse. From the lands of indigenous communities to the currency markets of Asia, from the ocean floors to the ozone layer, the collapse is all-encompassing and deep-reaching. John McMurtry traces the causes of this global disorder back to the mutating assumptions of market theory that now govern the world s economy. He diagnoses the malaise as a pathologist would a biological cancer, tracking the delinked circuits of the global system s monetised growth as a carcinogenic disorder at the social level of life-organization. In the wide-lensed tradition of Adam Smith, Marx and Keynes, McMurtry cuts across academic disciplines and boundaries to penetrate the inner logic of the system s problems. Far from pessimistic, he argues that the way out of the global crisis is to be found in an evolving substructure of history which provides a common ground of resolution across ethnic and national divisions. Reaching beyond conventional textbooks, this fascinating study offers a new paradigm which is accessible to intelligent citizens the world over.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=79G3Jsb2KYwC&dq=The+Cancer+Stage+of+Capitalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cosmic Discovery: The Search, Scope, and Heritage of Astronomy","description":"Originally published: New York: Basic Books, 1981.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nr2GDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cosmic+Discovery:+The+Search,+Scope,+and+Heritage+of+Astronomy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eagle or Sun?

It started in the early 19th century, when Samuel Hahnemann, a German medical doctor, discovered that he could stimulate remarkable healing by prescribing medicines in a more holistic way. He carefully observed not just his patient's main complaint, but also other physical, mental & emotional symptoms which he found very important for selecting the curative medicine. In time, he discovered that side effects were virtually absent & curative action most profound when the doses were extremely small. The discipline of homeopathy was built on these successes, & Hahnemann set down its principles in this book, the ORGANON OF MEDICINE. Widely acclaimed by homeopathic physicians as the most understandable & accurate translation, this book describes a powerful weapon against the acute & chronic diseases of modern life.

His book places the fiction by Maori writers in the context of a culture of survival and traces its textual engagement with violence between empathy and sacrifice, from the privacy of domestic violence to the public arenas of systemic violence and war. He argues that out of this confrontation with violence emerges a distinctive ethnic world view created by the construction of individual experience, the development of an ideological stance and the expression of a spiritual orientation. Heim's analysis shows works of fiction by contemporary Maori writers as challenging explorations of the constraints placed on the literary imagination by the urgent facts of the human condition and the imperatives of culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KHevY9jygGwC&dq=Broken+Lines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Christmas Story / The Adventures of Megan Martin","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=si0HAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Christmas+Story+/+The+Adventures+of+Megan+Martin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fishes of Missouri","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cattle Ailments: Recognition and Treatment","description":"This guide to the recognition and treatment of ailments in cattle features a clear, concise text built around a range of specially taken colour photographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5lMKPQAACAAJ&dq=Cattle+Ailments:+Recognition+and+Treatment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terry and the Pirates","description":"The Library of American Comics and Clover Press are proud to publish Terryand the Pirates: The Master Collection.

As the car shifted gears for the climb toward the New City, an Israeli Army jeep nosed into the road, forcing Bernadotte s car and the two following him to come to a full stop. From the jeep sprang three uniformed men clutching automatic weapons. In a moment that set the stage for a legacy of violence that has since characterized Arab-Israeli negotiations, Count Bernadotte was shot six times and killed. The assassins were never brought to justice. A Death in Jerusalem reveals the forces behind this assassination, the passion that first dictated the tactics of terrorism in Israel and that continue to shape the thinking and actions of those even now determined to block accommodation with the Palestinians. At its birth in 1948, the State of Israel was endangered as much by a fratricidal war between Jewish moderates and extremists as it was by the invading armies of its Arab neighbors. In the first test of its authority, the fledgling United Nations forged a temporary truce between Arabs and Jews and dispatched Count Bernadotte to negotiate a permanent peace. A Swede with a reputation for skillful negotiations with the Nazis for the release of prisoners, including Jewish concentration-camp victims, Bernadotte had seemed the ideal choice for mediator. But he was dangerously unversed in the Israeli underground s passionate visions of a homeland restored to its biblical geographical proportions. To the Stern Gang, led by future Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, any concession of land was as threatening to Israel s integrity as the Arabs  invading armies. And the Sternists did not trust Count Bernadotte, whom they saw as threatening Israel s claim to the holy city of Jerusalem. As Bernadotte prepared his plan for the allocation of disputed territory, the Stern Gang plotted his murder. Drawing on previously untapped sources, including Bernadotte s family and former Stern Gang members, Kati Marton tells the vivid and haunting story of what propelled the Sternists, how they achieved their goal, and how and why the assassins were shielded from prosecution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uhgK3GfdpnMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quiller Solitaire","description":"Quiller's survival skills have never been so crucial as in this eerily prophetic mission torn from today's headlines.

It then develops the theory of optimal search for a moving target, providing algorithms for computing optimal plans and examples of their use. Next it develops methods for computing optimal search plans involving multiple targets and multiple searchers with realistic operational constraints on search movement. These results assume that the target does not react to the search. In the final chapter there is a brief overview of mostly military problems where the target tries to avoid being found as well as rescue or rendezvous problems where the target and the searcher cooperate. Larry Stone wrote his definitive book Theory of Optimal Search in 1975, dealing almost exclusively with the stationary target search problem. Since then the theory has advanced to encompass search for targets that move even as the search proceeds, and computers have developed sufficient capability to employ the improved theory. In this book, Stone joins Royset and Washburn to document and explain this expanded theory of search. The problem of how to search for moving targets arises every day in military, rescue, law enforcement, and border patrol operations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=scrtCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadowrun 09: Shadowplay","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Imagination's Provocation: Volume I: A Collection of Short Stories","description":"A collection of twelve short stories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WaTPVlarjh4C&dq=The+Imagination%27s+Provocation:+Volume+I:+A+Collection+of+Short+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arthritis (Diseases & Disorders)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"St. Therese of Lisieux: Her Last Conversations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Design of Cities: Revised Edition (Penguin Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The ABCs of Collecting Online 2 (Revised edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Britannia All At Sea (Best of Betty Neels)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, Book 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"I'll Fly Away: The Life Story of Albert E.

New York City native Jeremiah Salinger is one half of a hot-shot documentary-making team. He and his partner, Mike, made a reality show about roadies that skyrocketed them to fame. But now Salinger s left that all behind, to move with his wife, Annelise, and young daughter, Clara, to the remote part of Italy where Annelise grew up the Alto Adige. Nestled in the Dolomites, this breathtaking, rural region that was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire remains more Austro than Italian. Locals speak a strange, ancient dialect Ladino and root for Germany (against Italy) in the world cup. Annelise s small town Siebenhoch is close-knit to say the least and does not take kindly to out-of-towners. When Salinger decides to make a documentary about the mountain rescue group, the mission goes horribly awry, leaving him the only survivor. He blames himself, and so it seems does everyone else in Siebenhoch. Spiraling into a deep depression, he begins having terrible, recurrent nightmares. Only his little girl Clara can put a smile on his face. But when he takes Clara to the Bletterbach Gorge a canyon rich in fossil remains he accidentally overhears a conversation that gives his life renewed focus. In 1985, three students were murdered there, their bodies savaged, limbs severed and strewn by a killer who was never found. Although Salinger knows this is a tightlipped community, one where he is definitely persona non grata, he becomes obsessed with solving this mystery and is convinced it is all that can keep him sane. And as Salinger unearths the long kept secrets of this small town, one by one, the terrifying truth is eventually revealed about the horrifying crime that marked an entire village. Completely engrossing and deeply atmospheric, Beneath The Mountain is a thriller par excellence.  Can be compared (with no fear of hyperbole) to Stephen King and Jo Nesb?.

American high schools, where students learn the basics of citizenship, thus ought to play a critical role in the success of democracy. Yet studies examining the impact of high school government and civics courses on political knowledge over the past quarter-century have generally shown that these courses have little or no effect. In this important book, Richard G. Niemi and Jane Junn take a fresh look at what America's high school seniors know about government and politics and how they learn it. The authors argue convincingly that secondary school civics courses do indeed enhance students' civic knowledge. This book is based on the most extensive assessment to date of civic knowledge among American youth--the 1988 National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) Civics Assessment. The authors develop and test a theoretical model to explain the cognitive process by which students learn about politics and they conclude by suggesting specific changes in the style and emphasis of civics teaching.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mQwOx8KWzk8C&dq=Civic+Education:+What+Makes+Students+Learn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wizards of The Game","description":"The story of the arcane table-top game that became a pop culture phenomenon and the long-running legal battle waged by its cocreators. When Dungeons & Dragons was first released to a small hobby community, it hardly seemed destined for mainstream success--and yet this arcane tabletop role-playing game became an unlikely pop culture phenomenon. In Game Wizards, Jon Peterson chronicles the rise of Dungeons & Dragons from hobbyist pastime to mass market sensation, from the initial collaboration to the later feud of its creators, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. As the game's fiftieth anniversary approaches, Peterson--a noted authority on role-playing games--explains how D&D and its creators navigated their successes, setbacks, and controversies. Peterson describes Gygax and Arneson's first meeting and their work toward the 1974 release of the game; the founding of TSR and its growth as a company; and Arneson's acrimonious departure and subsequent challenges to TSR. He recounts the \\"Satanic Panic\\" accusations that D&D was sacrilegious and dangerous, and how they made the game famous. And he chronicles TSR's reckless expansion and near-fatal corporate infighting, which culminated with the company in debt and overextended and the end of Gygax's losing battle to retain control over TSR and D&D. With Game Wizards, Peterson restores historical particulars long obscured by competing narratives spun by the one-time partners. That record amply demonstrates how the turbulent experience of creating something as momentous as Dungeons & Dragons can make people remember things a bit differently from the way they actually happened.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NrVCEAAAQBAJ&dq=Wizards+of+The+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Have Lived Before: The True Story of the Reincarnation of Shanti Devi","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Complete Fairy Tales of Charles Perrault","description":"Perrault's fairy tales in a scintillating new translation, including the less familiar verse tales and with illustrations by Gustave Dor .

The incentives created by the legal system are thus a natural subject of study by economists. Moreover, given the importance of law to the welfare of societies, the economic analysis of law merits prominent treatment as a subdiscipline of economics.

The author, Tsong-kha-pa, completed it in 1402, and it soon became one of the most renowned works of spiritual practice and philosophy in the world of Tibetan Buddhism. Because it condenses all the exoteric s tra scriptures into a meditation manual that is easy to understand, scholars and practitioners rely on its authoritative presentation as a gateway that leads to a full understanding of the Buddha s teachings. Tsong-kha-pa took great pains to base his insights on classical Indian Buddhist literature, illustrating his points with classical citations as well as with sayings of the masters of the earlier Kadampa tradition. In this way the text demonstrates clearly how Tibetan Buddhism carefully preserved and developed the Indian Buddhist traditions.

In this memoir, he tells the story of the bomb s development from the presentation of the project to President Roosevelt, through its planning, research, and building phases, to its use against Japan. From the perspective of the key position he held during World War II, Compton describes the project as a large-scale group effort leveraging the knowledge and talents of numerous scientists, industrialists and administrators all working as part of their nation s war effort.  An absorbing and eminently readable account... packed with new information, enlivened with precious detail and illuminating insights into the minds and personalities of the chief actors in the drama... Mr. Compton tells, and tells well, the story of how, with his unflagging encouragement, the brilliant team under the late Enrico Fermi brought about the first nuclear chain reaction... [an] important book.    Henry Guerlac, The New York Times Book Review  This book... is without doubt the most authoritative source available on many aspects of the atomic bomb project... Better than in most histories the real factors underlying one of mankind s most important developments are set forth in this work... The story is a personal one, which... gives the book a Churchillian authenticity... No historian will ever dare to neglect this volume in writing the history of World War II. It is beautifully written, carefully documented, and thoroughly interesting from cover to cover.    W.F. Libby, Science  For those who were in the project, it will mean many recollections. For those who were not, it should give an inkling of the character and capacity of many of the individuals, including Arthur Compton, who made success possible.    Lieutenant General Leslie R. Groves, U.S. Army (Retired)  Atomic Quest is an absorbingly interesting story of the people who blazed the trail into the atomic frontier... In a lifetime filled with brilliant accomplishments, Arthur Compton s four-year leadership in the quest for the atomic bomb was his grandest achievement... It is fortunate indeed that he returned to the fold long enough to set down in Atomic Quest a story that only he could tell.    Richard L. Doan, American Journal of Physics  Dr. Compton is a thinking man whose reflections range far beyond the confines of his scientific work: indeed, the distinctive quality of his book lies in his ability to reconcile the atomic bomb and similar operations with his belief as a practicing Christian.    John Barkham, Saturday Review Syndicate  It should be required reading for every American, for the free world... The narrative alone makes the book worth reading; its hopeful philosophy makes it mandatory reading.    Robert S. Kleckner, Chicago Sunday Tribune  As... director of the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project, Dr. Compton has an important record to add to the annals of the beginning of the Atomic Age, for his was a personal and intimate connection with it.    Kirkus  A leading physicist s personal account of the wartime developments in atomic energy, culminating in the production of the atomic bomb.    Henry L. Roberts, Foreign Affairs  Informal, anecdotal, packed with behind-the-scenes incidents and impressions... arrestingly interesting.    George W. Gray, The Saturday Review  The most controversial part of the book is that which endeavors to foresee the future of a world faced with the threat of war with nuclear weapons and the inevitable widespread destruction that will accompany their use.

In Nothing Greater, Nothing Better an international team of distinguished theologians and biblical scholars admirably fills this need, offering clear and inspiring discussion of the nature of God's love and its implications for the Christian life. Kevin J. Vanhoozer begins the book by outlining the proper theological context of and main issues involved in meaningful talk about God's love today. Gary D. Badcock revisits the distinction between agape and eros, crafting a fresh understanding of these terms in relation to God's loving act in Christ. Geoffrey Grogan reviews the biblical evidence that ought to guide our thinking about God's love. Lewis Ayres examines Augustine's view of God's love as expressed in his commentary on 1 John and in his profound work on the Trinity. Trevor Hart examines the perils of using human language to speak of God, including attempts to fully grasp the concept of God's love. Alan J. Torrance looks for insight in the great Johannine assertion \\"God is love.\\" Tony Lane queries the possibility of thinking about God's wrath and God's love together. Paul Helm asks whether God can love the world, turning, provocatively, to natural theology for an answer. David Fergusson takes up the vital eschatological concern: will the love of God ultimately triumph? The book closes with a sermon on Hosea 11 by Roy Clements that moves reflection on God's love from dogmatics to doxology. Though exploring the subject of God's love from many angles, these chapters are united in their understanding that it is not human love per se, but rather the love of the man Jesus -- representative both of God and of an authentic humanity -- that is the ultimate criterion for thinking about the love of God. Readers will find this volume both thought-provoking and spiritually uplifting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=suE_fpEeOUwC&dq=Nothing+Greater,+Nothing+Better:+Theological+Essays+on+the+Love+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women and Men in Management, Third Edition","description":"Table of contents","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XfDZrkzmjKAC&dq=Women+and+Men+in+Management,+Third+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brushbacks and Knockdowns: The Greatest Baseball Debates of Two Centuries","description":"Presents a collection of essays that include, \\"Who Was Better, Babe Ruth or Barry Bonds,\\" \\"Who Was the Greatest Lefthander of All Time,\\" and \\"The Myth of Competitive Balance.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=md_HJSkihpYC&dq=Brushbacks+and+Knockdowns:+The+Greatest+Baseball+Debates+of+Two+Centuries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introducing Shakespeare","description":"Shakespeare's absolute pre-eminence is simply unparalleled. His plays pack theatres and provide Hollywood with block-buster scripts; his works inspire mountains of scholarship and criticism every year. He has given us many of the very words we speak, and even some of the thoughts we think. Nick Groom and Piero explore how Shakespeare became so famous and influential, and why he is still widely considered the greatest writer ever. They investigate how the Bard has been worshiped at different times and in different places, used and abused to cultural and political ends, and the roots of intense controversies which have surrounded his work. Much more than a biography or a guide to his plays and sonnets, Introducing Shakespeare is a tour through the world of Will and concludes that even after centuries, Shakespeare remains the battlefield on which our very comprehension of humanity is being fought out.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UMAcBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English traits","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FOMuAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Picnic with Monet (Mini Masters)","description":"A follow-up to A Magical Day with Matisse provides a simple introduction to the work of French artist Claude Monet, featuring his Impressionist paintings of city and country scenes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2ouTEzjRSKAC&dq=A+Picnic+with+Monet+(Mini+Masters)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ingles al Portador (English to the Bearer) (Spanish Edition)","description":"For more than sixty years, The University of Chicago SpanishEnglish Dictionary has set the standard for concise bilingual dictionaries.

By no means a literary Utopia in the tradition of Thomas More and Francis Bacon, it was designed as a blueprint for immediate and specific reform, the adoption of which would--in the writer's belief--allow the country to achieve an unprecedented degree of peace, harmony, and social justice. It was the final and most important literary production of the Diggers, a tiny band of mid-seventeenth century visionaries who undertook to turn the political revolution that had just destroyed monarchical government into a social revolution that would remedy the economic grievances of generations of 'oppressed commoners.'

Where does it come from? Can we really hope to find any rational way of deciding how we ought to live? If we can, what would it be like, and how are we going to know when we have found it?

By choosing some of the finest pieces of writing, old and new, in and about ethics, he conveys the intellectual excitement of the search for answers to basic questions about how we ought to live. From the debates of Socrates and the profound writing of Rousseau to Jane Goodall's reflections on the ethics of chimpanzee kinship and Luther's commentary on the Sixth Commandment (thou shalt not kill), this engaging reader offers a complete and thorough introduction to the fascinating world of ethical debate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UglxQgAACAAJ&dq=Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maid Marian","description":"An irresistible reimagining of the Robin Hood legend, Maid Marian brings to life the rollicking--and romantic--world of the Middle Ages. An orphan and heiress to a large country estate, Marian Fitzwater is wed at the age of five to an equally young nobleman, Lord Hugh of Sencaster, a union that joins her inheritance to his, vastly enriching his family. But when she is seventeen, Lord Hugh, whom she hasn't seen in years, dies under mysterious circumstances, leaving her alone again--a widow who has never been a bride. Like all unmarried young ladies of fortune, she is made a ward of Richard the Lionheart, England's warrior king. With King Richard away on Crusade, Marian's fate lies in the hands of his mother, the formidable Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, who will arrange her second marriage. The lucky bridegroom will get Marian's lands and, in return, pledge his loyalty--and silver--to King Richard. Marian herself is irrelevant and she knows it. Determined not to be sold into another sham marriage, she seeks out the one man whose spies can help uncover the queen's plans--Robin Hood, the notorious Saxon outlaw of Sherwood Forest. Marian is surprised to discover that the famed \\"prince of thieves\\" is not only helpful but handsome, likable and sympathetic to her plight. Following her plan, Robin s men intercept a letter from Queen Eleanor, from which Marian learns, to her horror, that she is to marry her late husband s brother. His family's history of mysterious deaths, puts Marian in grave danger. Once married, her land becomes theirs and they can easily dispose of her--a fate she may have only narrowly escaped already. On the eve of her wedding, Robin Hood spirits Marian back to the forest. Queen Eleanor believes her to be dead, allowing Marian to begin a new life with Robin Hood's outlaws, who pledge to help her regain her fortune and expose the treachery of her enemies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I9KmaF9qAfMC&dq=Maid+Marian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Verilog HDL","description":"VERILOG HDL, Second Editionby Samir PalnitkarWith a Foreword by Prabhu GoelWritten forboth experienced and new users, this book gives you broad coverage of VerilogHDL.

A veritable \\"intellect on fire,\\" Fanon was a radical thinker with original theories on race, revolution, violence, identity and agency. This book is an excellent introduction to the ideas and legacy of Fanon. Gibson explores him as a truly complex character in the context of his time and beyond. He argues that for Fanon, theory has a practical task to help change the world. Thus Fanon's \\"untidy dialectic,\\" Gibson contends, is a philosophy of liberation that includes cultural and historical issues and visions of a future society. In a profoundly political sense, Gibson asks us to reevaluate Fanon's contribution as a critic of modernity and reassess in a new light notions of consciousness, humanism, and social change. This is a fascinating study that will interest undergraduates and above in postcolonial studies, literary theory, cultural studies, sociology, politics, and social and political theory, as well as general readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-ZFODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A detailed analysis of the Constitution (New Littlefield college outlines)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Five for Silver: A John the Eunuch Mystery","description":"The year is 542.

Between 1492 and 1870, approximately eleven million black slaves were carried from Africa to the Americas to work on plantations, in mines, or as servants in houses. The Slave Trade is alive with villains and heroes and illuminated by eyewitness accounts.

San Francisco Chronicle How ordinary Americans suffer when the rich and powerful use tax dodges or break the law to get richer and more powerful and how we can stop it. There is an elite crime spree happening in America, and the privileged perps are getting away with it. Selling loose cigarettes on a city sidewalk can lead to a choke-hold arrest, and death, if you are not among the top 1%. But if you're rich and commit mail, wire, or bank fraud, embezzle pension funds, lie in court, obstruct justice, bribe a public official, launder money, or cheat on your taxes, you're likely to get off scot-free (or even win an election). When caught and convicted, such as for bribing their kids' way into college, high-class criminals make brief stops in minimum security \\"Club Fed\\" camps. Operate the scam from the executive suite of a giant corporation, and you can prosper with impunity. Consider Wells Fargo & Co. Pressured by management, employees at the bank opened more than three million bank and credit card accounts without customer consent, and charged late fees and penalties to account holders. When CEO John Stumpf resigned in \\"shame,\\" the board of directors granted him a $134 million golden parachute. This is not victimless crime. Big Dirty Money details the scandalously common and concrete ways that ordinary Americans suffer when the well-heeled use white collar crime to gain and sustain wealth, social status, and political influence. Profiteers caused the mortgage meltdown and the prescription opioid crisis, they've evaded taxes and deprived communities of public funds for education, public health, and infrastructure. Taub goes beyond the headlines (of which there is no shortage) to track how we got here (essentially a post-Enron failure of prosecutorial muscle, the growth of \\"too big to jail\\" syndrome, and a developing implicit immunity of the upper class) and pose solutions that can help catch and convict offenders.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cQlAEAAAQBAJ&dq=Dirty+Money&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Penguin Book of English Verse (Penguin Classics)","description":"This ambitious and revelatory collection turns the traditional chronology of anthologies on its head, listing poems according to their first individual appearance in the language rather than by poet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HFkFHCZpNloC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Russ Paley's Ultimate Guide to Network Marketing: Your Step-By-Step Guide to Wealth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Marble Woman: Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spook (Nameless Detective Novels)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The White Witch of Rosehall","description":"A very striking and curious story, founded on fact, of the West Indies of the early nineteenth century.

Few stop to think that behind the occasional glitter of official functions are thousands of families facing all the routines and crises of life-births, deaths, childrearing, divorce-far from home, relatives, and friends, in an unfamiliar and sometimes unfriendly country and culture. This book provides reflections and perspectives on the realities of Foreign Service life as experienced by members of the Foreign Service community around the world. The writers share their unvarnished views on a wide variety of topics they care about: maintaining long-distance relationships, raising teens abroad, dealing with depression, coping with evacuations, readjusting to life in the United States, and many others. These are stories from the diplomatic trenches-true experiences from those who have lived the lifestyle and want to share their hard-learned lessons with others. ?If you are new to the Foreign Service, this book will offer insights and practical information useful in your overseas tours and when you return home. Even if you are a seasoned veteran of the Foreign Service, the reports and reflections of others may encourage you to compare and evaluate your own experiences. ? If you (or your partner) are contemplating joining the Foreign Service, this book can serve as a reality check, giving you honest, personal perspectives on both the positive and negative aspects of Foreign Service life. ? If you are a student wondering what the Foreign Service is all about, this book will broaden your knowledge and provide you with an insider's view not found in any textbook.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fYf34paJtsQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Economics Today: The Micro View (The Addison-Wesley Series in Economics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kj2ve8Q2bYYC&dq=Economics+Today:+The+Micro+View+(The+Addison-Wesley+Series+in+Economics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culturally Competent Practice: A Framework for Growth and Action","description":"On cultural competence in social work","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HYVHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Culturally+Competent+Practice:+A+Framework+for+Growth+and+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flat Stanley","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Symbols of Judaism (Beliefs Symbols)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Detroit's Statler and Book-Cadillac Hotels: The Anchors of Washington Boulevard (MI) (Images of America)","description":"During the first three decades of the 20th century, Detroit's Washington Boulevard was transformed from a minor backstreet into a major commercial and social center. Three brothers named Book dreamed that Washington Boulevard would become \\"the Fifth Avenue of the Midwest.\\" It was through their efforts, as well as those of businessmen like E.M. Statler, that the dream became a reality. The two fundamental developments that anchored this dream were the massive Statler and Book-Cadillac Hotels.

Inspiration for non-geniuses everywhere  (People). The daughter of a scientist who frequently noted her lack of  genius,  Angela Duckworth is now a celebrated researcher and professor. It was her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience that led to her hypothesis about what really drives success: not genius, but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance. In Grit, she takes us into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she s learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.  Duckworth s ideas about the cultivation of tenacity have clearly changed some lives for the better  (The New York Times Book Review). Among Grit s most valuable insights: any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal; grit can be learned, regardless of IQ or circumstances; when it comes to child-rearing, neither a warm embrace nor high standards will work by themselves; how to trigger lifelong interest; the magic of the Hard Thing Rule; and so much more. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that not talent or luck makes all the difference. This is  a fascinating tour of the psychological research on success  (The Wall Street Journal).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pFoJCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Town Called Isle: A collection of short stories (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blood Money","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Patterns & Projects for Scroll Saw","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gas Discharge Closing Switches (Advances in Pulsed Power Technology)","description":"Pulsed power technology, in the simplest of terms, usually concerns the storage of electrical energy over relatively long times and then its rapid release over a comparatively short period. However, if we leave the definition at that, we miss a multitude of aspects that are important in the ultimate application of pulsed power. It is, in fact, the application of pulsed power technology to which this series of texts will be focused. Pulsed power in today's broader sense means \\"special power\\" as opposed to the tra ditional situation of high voltage impulse issues related to the utility industry. Since the pulsed power field is primarily application driven, it has principally an engineering flavor. Today' s applications span those from materials processing, such as metal forming by pulsed magnetic fields, to other varied applications, such as psy chedelic strobe lights or radar modulators. Very high peak power applications occur in research for inertial confinement fusion, the Strategic Defense Initiative and other historical defense uses. lri fact it is from this latter direction that pulsed power has real ized explosive growth over the past half century. Early thrusts were in electrically powered systems that simulated the environment or effects of nuclear weapons detonation. More recently it is being utilized as prime power sources for directed energy weapons, such as lasers, microwaves, particle beam weapons, and even mass drivers (kinetic energy weapons).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hnD1BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trail Guide to the Body: How to Locate Muscles, Bones & More!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Goole and Selby Railway (Locomotion papers ; no. 100)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Celestial Clock","description":"Dalla storia alla fantascienza.

We returned again in the summer of 1999. Upon our return I wrote an epilogue which forms the last chapter of this book. Living in the Russian hinterlands for a year and a half was a fascinating and discouraging experience for my corporate executive husband and myself. He was there to implement a Joint Venture agreement between a small Russian company in Pavlovo, in the Nizhny Novgorod region, and a large company in the United States. The purpose was to try and bring the Russian factory and management up to western standards so they could compete on the world market. I maintained my sanity amidst poor living conditions, scarce food, and the two long winters by keeping a daily journal. Upon our return I wrote this book based on our daily living adventures: the chicken store, the black radish cold remedy, the bread store giving  change  in bread, a personal attack by gypsy children in Moscow... The book is organized into chapters which would generally be considered  aspects of daily living:  my struggle to find food, our poor housing conditions, frightening personal episodes, the half-existent communication system, being entertained in Russian homes, my struggle with boredom and isolation (no foreigners lived in our town of 70,000 people until one Peace Corps volunteer arrived about eight months after we did). The difficulties and problems were exacerbated by the fact that we are an educated, affluent couple in our 60s. We had hoped to make some contribution to improving Russian life. A forlorn hope. My husband s experience with the joint venture was even more discouraging than my struggle with daily living. He has also written a chapter of the book. In the epilogue I describe both my continuing frustrations with the difficult life the people of Pavlovo continue to be faced with and the improvements we observed. There are some positive changes that are being made in that city that give some hope that these Russians that we came to know and to love so well will not always suffer such deprivations. The young people are the hope of their nation. The following direct quotations are the opinions of some of the readers of my manuscript:  If you ve ever looked at photos of Russian women stoically waiting in lines and wondered what it would be like to share their fate, travel with Missy Moore to Russia via her memoir  Americans in Bear Country.  Russia, outside of Moscow, suffers from third world problems: inadequate roads, water supply, availability of necessities. The warmth of Russian hospitality softened these hardships. You will struggle and suffer with the Moores and wonder at their perseverance.  ______Susan Robertson, EFL instructor at Hillsdale College and advisor of Foreign students.  As a management consultant active in the former Soviet Union, I have seen with my own eyes much of what Ms. Moore describes in her book. The most noticeable characteristic of the New Russia, as I see it, is how much of the old USSR still remains. Ms. Moore has a keen eye for the stepping stones and stumbling blocks Russia has encountered in its headlong jump from Communism to a murky New World characterized by sloth, corruption, and drunkenness. She neatly balances her own experiences and perspective with an appreciation of the larger challenges faced by her  adopted  country. This book would be a welcome addition to my library, and an invaluable primer for any businessperson or visitor hoping to navigate the minefield of Russia today. It is an invaluable resource for anyone trying to appreciate the Herculean task of transforming the sodden,","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=db2MAAAACAAJ&dq=Americans+in+Bear+Country+-+Living+the+Russian+Way&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abbie's Outlaw (Harlequin Historical)","description":"Abbie's Outlaw by Victoria Bylin released on Mar 29, 2005 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZHVP34qFHpYC&dq=Abbie%27s+Outlaw+(Harlequin+Historical)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Mrs. Gibsons","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Russia Under the Czars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GA7cAQAACAAJ&dq=Russia+Under+the+Czars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time and Again: A Systematic Analysis of the Foundations of Physics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=luaSzQEACAAJ&dq=Time+and+Again:+A+Systematic+Analysis+of+the+Foundations+of+Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drummer's Luck","description":"DRUMMER S LUCK is based upon actual events that occurred in America s Revolutionary War at the surrender of Yorktown in 1781 when a young British drummer boy resolutely stood silhouetted on a parapet under fire from Continental riflemen to beat out a call to parley.

Millburn's maritime route to freedom was far from uncommon. By the mid-nineteenth century an increasing number of enslaved people had fled northward along the Atlantic seaboard. While scholarship on the Underground Railroad has focused almost exclusively on overland escape routes from the antebellum South, this groundbreaking volume expands our understanding of how freedom was achieved by sea and what the journey looked like for many African Americans. With innovative scholarship and thorough research, Sailing to Freedom highlights little-known stories and describes the less-understood maritime side of the Underground Railroad, including the impact of African Americans' paid and unpaid waterfront labor. These ten essays reconsider and contextualize how escapes were managed along the East Coast, moving from the Carolinas, Virginia, and Maryland to safe harbor in northern cities such as Philadelphia, New York, New Bedford, and Boston. In addition to the volume editor, contributors include David S. Cecelski, Elysa Engelman, Kathryn Grover, Megan Jeffreys, Cheryl Janifer LaRoche, Mirelle Luecke, Cassandra Newby-Alexander, Michael D.

Since then no other book has approached the breadth, scholarship, and balance of that landmark volume. For this long-awaited second edition, the original editors have been joined by Albert Ludolf, who brings expertise in biological neurotoxicology, and together with their distinguished contributors they have completely rewritten and reorganized the text.The scientific and clinical foundation is laid in three comprehensive introductory chapters. An overview of the biological basis of neurotoxicity provides the goundwork for discussing the scope of human and veterinary neurotoxic disease.The bulk of the text is devoted to an alphabetical treatment of chemicals with neurotoxic potential. This consists of tightly written overviews of the properties, actions, and mechanisms of all manner of substances, whether natural or synthetic. The neurotoxic side effects of experimental agents and of therapeutic as well as abused drugs are covered extensively. Environmental pollutants, workplace contaminants, personal-use products, food additives, and agents harbored by plants, animals, and humans for use against their respective enemies are discussed. Each substance is rated on a three-point scale for the weight of evidence indicating a specific neurotoxic effect in humans, animals, or laboratory models. These effects are summarized and cross-referenced in a series of appendices and an extensive index.In summary, the second edition establishes neurotoxicology as a scientific discipline that melds neurobiology, toxicology, and neurology. From this unique vantage point, the book examines in encyclopedic manner several hundred chemicals with the capacity to induce neurological illness in humans and animals. Indispensable for the experimental neuroscientist and toxicologist, as well as for practitioners of human and animal medicine, the book also provides an authoritative, critical, and pithy reference work for specialists in public health and the legal profession.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-bqEAAAAIAAJ&dq=Experimental+and+Clinical+Neurotoxicology+(Spencer,Experimental+and+Clinical+Neurotoxicology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Dos & Taboos","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Microsoft Excel 97 Exam Cram","description":"Microsoft''s Office User Specialist Program i s designed to help companies with the training and assessmen t of computer users.

Leary, E. Merton Coulter Professor of History, University of Georgia This magisterial study by Arthur J. Dommen sets the Indochina wars 'French and American' in perspective as no book that has come before. He summarizes the history of the peninsula from the Vietnamese War of Independence from China in 930-39 through the first French military actions in 1858, when the struggle of the peoples of Indochina with Western powers began. Dommen details the crucial episodes in the colonization of Indochina by the French and the indigenous reaction to it. The struggle for national sovereignty reached an acute state at the end of World War II, when independent governments rapidly assumed power in Vietnam and Cambodia. When the French returned, the struggle became one of open warfare, with Nationalists and Communists gripped in a contest for ascendancy in Vietnam, while the rulers of Cambodia and Laos sought to obtain independence by negotiation. The withdrawal of the French after their defeat at Dien Bien Phu brought the Indochinese face-to-face, whether as friends or as enemies, with the Americans. In spite of an armistice in 1954, the war between Hanoi and Saigon resumed as each enlisted the help of foreign allies, which led to the renewed loss of sovereignty as a result of alliances and an increasingly heavy loss of lives. Meticulous and detailed, Dommen's telling of this complicated story is always judicious. Nevertheless, many people will find his analysis of the Diem coup a disturbing account of American plotting and murder. This is an essential book for anyone who wants to understand Vietnam and the people who fought against the United States and won.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MauWlUjuWNsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Maritime & Transportaton Terms","description":"Updated and expanded to include new equipment and also new documentation relating to bills of lading and charter-parties, this new edition of Peter Brodie s dictionary provides a reference tool for all of those who use or operate cargo ships, both tramp and liner, or who are concerned with their use.

In The End of Night, Paul Bogard restores our awareness of the spectacularly primal, wildly dark night sky and how it has influenced the human experience across everything from science to art.

He confronts the challenge of defining the illness and describes the vast range of available medications, the efficacy of alternative treatments, and the impact the malady has on various demographic populations, around the world and throughout history. He also explores the thorny patch of moral and ethical questions posed by emerging biological explanations for mental illness. He takes readers on a journey into the most pervasive of family secrets and contributes to our understanding not only of mental illness but also of the human condition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_h9wCQAAQBAJ&dq=Demon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ohio Indian trails,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_z0XAQAAMAAJ&dq=Ohio+Indian+trails,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sword of Truth (Wakefield Dynasty #1)","description":"Raised a commoner, but reunited with his father, Sir Robert Wakefield, as an adult, Myles Morgan must adjust to life at the court of King Henry VIII.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mschczi2tA0C&dq=The+Sword+of+Truth+(Wakefield+Dynasty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Animation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Digital Knight","description":"\\"This book traces the long arc of Black women's relationship with technology from the antebellum south to the social media era demonstrating how digital culture transforms and is transformed by Black feminist thought\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S3EnEAAAQBAJ&dq=Digital+Knight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never Sorry: A Leigh Koslow Mystery (Volume 2)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Understanding Yourself and Others, An Introduction to Temperament - 2.0","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Boy Jack (Nick Hern Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Life & Opinions of Tristam Shandy (BBC)","description":"LIFE Magazine is the treasured photographic magazine that chronicled the 20th Century.

Helliconia Spring introduces us to a tumultuous world that follows an eccentric orbit around a double-star system and the satellite from Earth secretly monitoring it. Hugo and Nebula Awardwinning author Brian W. Aldiss then explores the social and religious divisions keeping the planet s population in conflict even as they re devastated by plague in Helliconia Summer, and concludes the trilogy with Helliconia Winter, which recounts both the threat of a looming, frigid age of decay and the hope of a new future. The Helliconia Trilogy is both a riveting story and a thought-provoking examination of how our destinies are shaped by the environment around us. Aldiss s study of fields from astronomy to climatology to geobiology endow all three novels with rich details of the planet Helliconia. This riveting, century-spanning saga is a timely exploration of what climate change can mean for our own planet.  Brian Aldiss s towering imagination places his Helliconia Trilogy far above standard science fiction  (Daily Mail).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xfM1DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extinct","description":"Just 28,000 years ago, the blink of an eye in geological time, the last of Neanderthals died out in their last outpost, in caves near Gibraltar. Thanks to cartoons and folk accounts we have a distorted view of these other humans - for that is what they were. We think of them as crude and clumsy and not very bright, easily driven to extinction by the lithe, smart modern humans that came out of Africa some 100,000 years ago. But was it really as simple as that? Clive Finlayson reminds us that the Neanderthals were another kind of human, and their culture was not so very different from that of our own ancestors. In this book, he presents a wider view of the events that led to the migration of the moderns into Europe, what might have happened during the contact of the two populations, and what finally drove the Neanderthals to extinction. It is a view that considers climate, ecology, and migrations of populations, as well as culture and interaction. His conclusion is that the destiny of the Neanderthals and the Moderns was sealed by ecological factors and contingencies. It was a matter of luck that we survived and spread while the Neanderthals dwindled and perished. Had the climate not changed in our favour some 50 million years ago, things would have been very different. There is much current research interest in Neanderthals, much of it driven by attempts to map some of their DNA. But it's not just a question of studying the DNA. The rise and fall of populations is profoundly moulded by the larger scale forces of climate and ecology. And it is only by taking this wider view that we can fully understand the course of events that led to our survival and their demise. The fact that Neanderthals survived until virtually yesterday makes our relationship with them and their tragedy even more poignant. They almost made it, after all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uCHsf-UxnAcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Museum of Early American Tools","description":"This delightful evocation of simpler times and the tools that built America has always held a special place in the hearts of lovers of Americana and Yankee ingenuity.

Charlottesville, Virginia, 1978: Mike is a successful forty-something lawyer, a onetime congressional staffer who's had it with Washington; Joss, his wife, is a filmmaker. They're Virginia liberals with a clan of close-knit friends--a bright, edgy, flirty, games-playing group, spinning like a Catherine wheel around Mike and Joss. But the sparks that fly between the two are getting hotter and more dangerous, as Joss' restlessness turns to impatience and then anger. When one of the group introduces them all to the woman he wants to marry, things suddenly explode--this new arrival and Joss fall passionately in love, and their whole world careens out of control. What ensues is tragicomedy, as Mike tries to allay his rage and misery by letting himself get sucked into a trial run for a seat in Congress. He wants to be a hero to someone; instead he becomes the unwitting star of a political farce. Meantime, Joss is struggling with her new life, and their two young daughters (who form a lovingly unmerciful Greek chorus commenting on the action) have to navigate a turmoil in which one parent is a public joke and the other a private scandal.

Joey, the illegitimate son of a major NY mafioso, decides to break away from a decidedly unpromising future in the old neighborhood of Queens. But will the old neighborhood and the Family let him go in peace? Not if knucklehead half-brother Gino has anything to say about it.

The book comes at a time when the most influential national media have focused attention on the subject of the literary canon. They have made it an issue not merely of academic but of general public concern, expressing strong opinions on the subject of what the American student should or should not read as essential or core texts. Is the literary canon simply a given of tradition and history, or is it, and must it be, constantly under construction? The question remains hotly contested to the present moment. Arnold Krupat argues that the literary expression of the indigenous peoples of the United States has claims on us to more than marginal attention. Demonstrating a firm grasp of both literary history and contemporary critical theory, he situates Indian literature, traditional and modern, in a variety of contexts and categories. His extensive knowledge of the history and current theory of ethnography recommends the book to anthropologists and folklorists as well as to students and teachers of literature, both canonical and noncanonical. The materials covered, the perspectives considered, and the learning displayed all make The Voice in the Margin a major contribution to the exciting field of contemporary cultural studies. This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press s mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

Jiihnichen, J. Loeckx, and M. Wirsing. During that seminar, after Egon Borger's talk on How to Use Abstract State Machines in Software Engineering, Wolfram Schulte, at the time a research assistant at the University of Ulm, Germany, questioned whether ASMs provide anything special as a scientifically well founded and rigorous yet simple and industrially viable framework for high level design and analysis of complex systems, and for natural refinements of models to executable code. Wolfram Schulte argued, referring to his work with K. Achatz on A Formal Object-Oriented Method Inspired by Fusion and Object-Z [1], that with current techniques of functional programming and of axiomatic specification, one can achieve the same result. An intensive and long debate arose from this discussion. At the end of the week, it led Egon Borger to propose a collaboration on a real-life specification project of Wolfram Schulte's choice, as a comparative field test of purely functional declarative methods and of their enhancement within an integrated abstract state-based operational (ASM) approach. After some hesitation, in May 1997 Wolfram Schulte accepted the offer and chose as the theme a high-level specification of Java and of the Java Virtual Machine.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0D-qCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters To a Young Evangelical","description":"A best-selling minister and social activist offers an uplifting vision of what it means to be an evangelical and offers loving guidance to all of those who wish to lead a genuinely Christian life in a confusing world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bv4eE7kdIzcC&dq=Letters+To+a+Young+Evangelical&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rabble In Arms","description":"The second of Roberts's epic novels of the American Revolution, Rabble in Arms was hailed by one critic as the greatest historical novel written about America upon its publication in 1933.

While millions of aviation enthusiasts see their shows every year, the story of the man who formed the squadron has never been told. He is Roy Marlin \\"Butch\\" Voris, a World War II Ace and one of only two aviators ever to command the Blue Angels twice. First Blue details the epic journey of an unassuming man whose strong character and desire to fly launched him into a life of drama, heroism, and accomplishment unique in his field. Because he wanted to serve his country during World War II, a young Butch Voris found himself flying fighter planes as part of the pitifully prepared and outmanned front in the early stages of the Pacific theater. He was nearly killed there but went on to be a leader in one of the most fearsome naval air squadrons in the Pacific. As a pilot, Butch is unquestionably in the same class as more recognized aviator heroes such as Chuck Yeager and Pappy Boyington. While his World War II experience alone could comprise a book, Butch may be best known for his efforts in the creation of the naval air demonstration team, the Blue Angels. After the war, Voris was personally chosen by Admiral Nimitz to start the Blue Angels and to lead them, first in prop planes and later in jets. The story of his efforts is as exciting as it is inspirational, and it's told here in meticulous detail and with great humor. Today the Blue Angels still follow traditions established by Butch. Butch's involvement in military flight didn't end with the Blue Angels; he became a major player in the development of the F-14 Tomcat and NASA's Lunar Explorer Module for Grumman. Butch dedicated his life to his work, and here, finally, is the remarkable, untold account of this true American aviation pioneer and hero: a man whose life had unparalleled influence on naval aviation and whose legacy continues to inspire millions of Americans each year.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jNo9TF1IeY4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charlotte's web","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Aquamancer","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Barron's GMAT, 2008 with CD-ROM (Barron's How to Prepare for the Gmat Graduate Management Admission Test) 14th Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Age of Sex Crime","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Winner's Circle","description":"Book 17 of the nationally bestselling Joanne Kilbourn series is classic Gail Bowen: masterfully compelling storytelling that combines a modern, urban family with a gripping, satisfying mystery.

For nothing could have prepared them for the madness of what they found. And in the heat and horror of battle they took on new identities, took on each other, and were reborn in fields of fire...

Warner prominent in his day as a writer and newspaper editor was a dedicated amateur gardener who shared with Mark Twain, his close friend and neighbor, a sense of humor that remains deliciously fresh today. In monthly dispatches, Warner chronicles his travails in the garden, where he and his cat, Calvin, seek to ward off a stream of interlopers, from the neighbors  huge-hoofed cows and thieving children, to the reviled, though  propagatious,  pusley weed. To read Warner is to join him on his rounds of his beloved vegetable patch, to feel the sun on his sore back, the hoe in his blistered hands, and yet, like him, never to lose sight of  the philosophical implications of contact with the earth, and companionship with gently growing things.

Confessional texts, whether penitential manuals or literary depictions of confession, suggest ways that people spoke about themselves and how they understood their interiority. In Confession and Resistance, Katherine C. Little cautions that medieval selfhood should not be understood merely in terms of confessional practice. She points to the controversy over confession and, more generally, lay instruction that was generated in late medieval England around the heresy known as Wycliffism (or Lollardy). This controversy, she maintains, reveals the contested nature of the language of medieval selfhood. Through her readings of Wycliffite sermons and polemical writings, Little argues that the Lollard resistance to confession should be understood as a debate over self-formation. For the Wycliffites, traditional confessional language had failed in its expected function--to define the self and to reveal the interior--and had to be replaced with new terms and new stories taken from the Bible. This new view of Wycliffism, as a crisis in the language of selfhood, allows the author to reevaluate the impact of Wycliffite ideas in Chaucer's Parson's Tale, Gower's Confessio Amantis, and Hoccleve's Regiment of Princes. Little finds in these texts, all of which include confession as a theme, a similar concern with the inadequacy of the traditional confessional mode. \\"Our understanding of the intricacies of medieval thinking about the self is still less sophisticated than it needs to be, if we are ever to have a full history of the western subject. Built around a series of readings of Middle English theorizations of the self, confession, and community, this carefully-focussed and well-written book significantly advances our thinking on these closely related topics. On the way to its goal, Little's study also illuminates several other areas of current interest in medieval studies: the exemplum as a system of teaching and object of suspicion; the fault-line between Lollardy and fourteenth-century orthodoxy; and the impact of the Lollard controversy on the new patterns of orthodox belief and practice that emerged in the fifteenth century.\\" --Nicholas Watson, Harvard University \\"Confession and Resistance is a significant contribution to our understanding of late medieval Christianity and culture in England. Little shows the inventiveness with which Chaucer, Gower, and Hoccleve engage with Wycliffite textuality and ideology, often assimilating these as sources of a self-reflexive and vigorous orthodoxy cultivated by a learned, 'clerical' laity. Her focus should make the book of interest to those working in early modern fields as well as to medievalists.\\"--David Aers, James B.

Philanthropy's preeminent expert and critic, Waldemar Nielsen probes deeply into the intensely personal factors that are involved in donors' decisions. Giving practical advice for would-be founders and directors, Nielsen drives home his argument with an unusual series of case studies. Triumphs and tragedies are equally instructive in his well-chosen philanthropic parables. This book comes at a pivotal point in American philanthropy when there are 35,000 active American foundations with combined assets of $175 billion. Pointing to the massive individual wealth accumulation that occurred during the 1980s (there are now 64 American billionaires and 210,000 deca-millionaires), Nielsen predicts \\"the number, assets, and grant making of American foundations will double by the first decade of the new century\\". Always providing specific examples, Nielsen details the pitfalls of traditional family foundations, the attractions of community foundations, the successes of women in philanthropy, and the achievements of both special- and general-interest foundations. As our troubled society faces cutbacks in government programs, Inside American Philanthropy will be a revelation for every citizen interested in our powerful and little-understood nonprofit institutions. This book is essential reading for established donors and potential foundation creators, as well as legal and financial advisors working for wealthy families and foundations and fund-raisers for museums, churches, colleges, and other nonprofit organizations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YQ3WYPRE2K0C&dq=Inside+American+Philanthropy:+The+Dramas+of+Donorship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Earth's last great places: Exploring the Nature Conservancy worldwide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aDTCHwAACAAJ&dq=Earth%27s+last+great+places:+Exploring+the+Nature+Conservancy+worldwide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foetal Attraction","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o5-CqJWAiUsC&dq=Foetal+Attraction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jim Brickman / Piano Anthology (New Age)","description":"Jim Brickman is one of the hottest New Age composers and performers in the industry today.

A leading specialist on rural China, Professor Unger presents a vivid picture of life in rural areas during the Maoist revolution, and then after the post-Mao disbandment of the collectives. This is a story of unexpected continuities amidst enormous change. Unger describes how rural administrations retain Mao-era characteristics -- despite the major shifts that have occurred in the economic and social hierarchies of villages as collectivization and class struggle gave way to the slogan to get rich is glorious. A chapter explores the private entrepreneurship that has blossomed in the prosperous parts of the countryside. Another focuses on the tensions and exploitation that have arisen as vast numbers of migrant laborors from poor districts have poured into richer ones. Another, based on five months of travel by jeep into impoverished villages in the interior, describes the dilemmas of underdevelopment still faced by many tens of millions of farmers, and the ways in which government policies have inadvertently hurt their livelioods.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kRRZngEACAAJ&dq=The+Transformation+of+Rural+China+(Asia+and+the+Pacific)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Napoleon in love (An Atlantic Monthly Press Book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHY - For Beginners","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A tragedy at Hillsville: A full-length play","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8V92HAAACAAJ&dq=A+tragedy+at+Hillsville:+A+full-length+play&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Minerva's Baby","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t03TAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Go to Bed, Fred: A Good Night Book & Muppet Puppet","description":"A nighttime rhyme helps children get ready for bed","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pFQJAAAACAAJ&dq=Go+to+Bed,+Fred:+A+Good+Night+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Jakarta, First Edition","description":"Lonely Planet Pocket Jakarta is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on Jakarta's can't-miss experiences.

Put it on the shelf beside The Autobiography of Malcolm X.   Kirkus Reviews Elaine Brown assumed her role as the first and only female leader of the Black Panther Party with these words:  I have all the guns and all the money. I can withstand challenge from without and from within. Am I right, Comrade?  It was August 1974. From a small Oakland-based cell, the Panthers had grown to become a revolutionary national organization, mobilizing black communities and white supporters across the country but relentlessly targeted by the police and the FBI, and increasingly riven by violence and strife within. How Brown came to a position of power over this paramilitary, male-dominated organization, and what she did with that power, is a riveting, unsparing account of self-discovery. Brown s story begins with growing up in an impoverished neighborhood in Philadelphia and attending a predominantly white school, where she first sensed what it meant to be black, female, and poor in America. She describes her political awakening during the bohemian years of her adolescence, and her time as a foot soldier for the Panthers, who seemed to hold the promise of redemption. And she tells of her ascent into the upper echelons of Panther leadership: her tumultuous relationship with the charismatic Huey Newton, who would become her lover and her nemesis; her experience with the male power rituals that would sow the seeds of the party's demise; and the scars that she both suffered and inflicted in that era s paradigm-shifting clashes of sex and power. Stunning, lyrical, and acute, this is the indelible testimony of a black woman s battle to define herself.  A glowing achievement.

Instead, during four tumultuous years in office, Carter endorsed many of the fiscal and economic policies later espoused by his Republican successor, Ronald Reagan. But Carter also backed most New Deal social programs and, however reluctantly, pursued a traditional containment foreign policy. In this book more than a dozen eminent scholars provide a balanced overview of key elements of Carter's presidency, examining the significance of his administration within the context of evolving American policy choices after World War II. They seek not only to understand the troubled Carter presidency but also to identify the changes that precipitated and accompanied the demise of the New Deal order. By the time Carter took office many Americans had become disenchanted with big government and welfare spending, and his presidency is viewed in these pages as a transitional administration. As this volume demonstrates, Carter's dilemma emerged from his effort to steer a course between traditional expectations of federal government and new political and economic realities. While most of the contributors agree that his administration may be justly criticized for failing to find that course, they generally conclude that Carter was more successful than his critics acknowledge. These thirteen original essays cover such topics as the economy, trade and industrial policies, welfare reform, energy, environment, civil rights, feminism, and foreign policy. They offer thoughtful assessments of Carter's performance, focusing on policy both as cause and effect of the post-industrial transformation of American society that shadowed his administration. A final essay shows how Carter's public spirited post-presidential career has made him one of America's greatest ex-presidents. Grounded on research conducted at the Carter Library, The Carter Presidency is an incisive reassessment of an isolated Democratic administration from the vantage point of twenty years. It is a milestone in the historical appraisal of that administration, inviting us to take a new look at Jimmy Carter and see what his presidency represented for a dramatically changing America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uY14AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Carter+Presidency:+Policy+Choices+in+the+Post-New+Deal+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best American Short Stories 1990","description":"Presents a collection of stories selected from magazines in the United States and Canada","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O7Iua-SB1JUC&dq=The+Best+American+Short+Stories+1990&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rag Rugs: Contemporary Projects in a Traditional Craft","description":"Discusses the history of rag rugs, introduces equipment and techniques, and provides instructions for making twenty projects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tj0PAAAACAAJ&dq=Rag+Rugs:+Contemporary+Projects+in+a+Traditional+Craft&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Cristo de Los Milagros (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Forever After","description":"The War Against Evil Has Been Won!

To win the aforementioned War Against Evil, four mantic objects of great power had been summoned forth from dark recesses in which they had lain secreted for a thousand year since, in fact, the last Great War Against Evil. But there was a reason these objects had been buried so long ago: if they are left in the open for any length of time the forces that emanate start to combine and Bad Things start to happen.

Beginning with the bank panic that accompanied the outbreak of the Great War, Blobaum guides his readers through spy scares, bombardments, mass migratory movements, and the Russian evacuation of 1915. Industrial collapse marked only the opening phase of Warsaw s wartime economic crisis, which grew steadily worse during the German occupation. Requisitioning and strict control of supplies entering the city resulted in scarcity amid growing corruption, rapidly declining living standards, and major public health emergencies. Blobaum shows how conflicts over distribution of and access to resources led to social divisions, a sharp deterioration in Polish-Jewish relations, and general distrust in public institutions. Women s public visibility, demands for political representation, and perceived threats to the patriarchal order during the war years sustained one arena of cultural debate. New modes of popular entertainment, including cinema, cabaret, and variety shows, created another, particularly as they challenged elite notions of propriety. Blobaum presents these themes in comparative context, not only with other major European cities during the Great War but also with Warsaw under Nazi German occupation a generation later.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ImZhDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Millard Fillmore, 13th president of the United States","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Elements of Mystery Fiction: Writing the Modern Whodunit","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gun Control in Germany, 1928-1945","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AgkAAQAACAAJ&dq=Gun+Control+in+Germany,+1928-1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Junior Cookbook","description":"An all-new edition of the perfect kids' cookbook now more fun than ever!

No-one knows this better than author Gordon Cope whose life took a very exciting turn when his wife, Linda, was offered a one-year posting to the world's dream destination - Paris, the City of Lights. Cope and Linda find the Paris of their dreams on the Right Bank of the Seine in Le Marais, a neighbourhood rich in controversy, conspiracy, culture, and madness - in short, their kind of place. In Paris, more than anywhere else, Cope is struck by the immediateness, the now, of his surroundings, amid centuries of history, and the subtle rhythms and pulses of the neighbourhood. His observations on life in Le Marais - its delightful residents, fascinating history, and sublime culinary experiences in the local brasseries and restaurants - are crystal clear and create an appealing intimacy. So, as Cope undergoes his own metamorphosis from typical tourist to established year-round resident, some days you might find yourself wandering the narrow lanes of Le Marais with him as he introduces you to the denizens of the area. On other days, you might find yourself at Cope's side, delving into the colourful history of Le Marais. And on in-between days, you will find your mouth watering at Cope's delectable descriptions of their frequent forays into fine dining.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VwFENgAACAAJ&dq=In+a+Paris+Moment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gut Feelings: From Fear And Despair To Health And Hope","description":"The successful singer describes her lifelong struggle with obesity and the feelings of shame and self-hatred that accompanied it, her decision to have weight-loss surgery, and the changes in her life following the operation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Aqmu88_waHoC&dq=Gut+Feelings:+From+Fear+And+Despair+To+Health+And+Hope&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Full-Color Sourcebook of French Fashion: 15th to 19th Centuries (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","description":"Illustrations depicting 500 years of French fashion, reproduced from a rare 19th-century publication, progress chronologically from flamboyant headgear and voluminous robes of 15th-century royalty to high-waisted Empire styles of the Napoleonic era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zPDDAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing (2nd Edition)","description":"This handbook is unique in linking for students the skills of critical thinking, reading, and writing - in the composition classroom and throughout the curriculum.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QeYIHO5DaGMC&dq=The+Allyn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inferno","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"If Not Now: Developmental Readers in the College Classroom","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Getting to Maybe -","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Titanic and the Mystery Ship","description":"What fascinates most people are the conspiracy theories that abound about her.

Some are metaphors, expressions of love and light. Some are similes that make you smile as well as spark an internal glow. The prayers and poems are accompanied by the biblical writings of the Divine, written by the prophets of the Old and New Testaments. Some are personal prayers and visions of what God has for me as well as for each of us. There is so much He has already given us. We simply have to recognize each glorious gift as we travel through life and in relationship.I did not begin to truly know myself and to accept myself as I am, until these special words, these holy words, began to flow from the Almighty into my heart, then from my heart onto paper. I began to experience the joy of Jesus, the Christ in my soul, an inexpressible exuberance and a sense of spiritual freedom I had never known before. And now that I have discovered that I could express this freedom and truly feel happiness by writing about this gift, I can, finally, with courage, express the opposing end of this continuum of sadness and serenity, and recognize that they are one in the same. We must surrender to our pain and sadness in order to experience the joy of Jesus Christ and all He has to offer us, for He is Lord of all.God is the true source of love that we are all a part, as He gave his only begotten Son, Jesus to the world to save our souls from condemnation (The Book of John the Divine, 3:16).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UZuR6hJLQp0C&dq=The+Holy+Bible+containing+the+Old+and+New+Testaments+(King+James+Version+Giant+Print+Reference+Edition,+Regency+Bible+from+Thomas+Nelson)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Klan Unmasked","description":"The author, who writes of his experiences as an undercover agent in the KKK after WWII, has added an afterword and new photos to this edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=foytiryjiD8C&dq=The+Klan+Unmasked&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horse Whispers in the Air (Horsefeathers 3)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b5B_Anm5X0YC&dq=Horse+Whispers+in+the+Air+(Horsefeathers+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gladiators","description":"The Gladiators (1939) is the first novel by the author Arthur Koestler; it portrays the effects of the Spartacus revolt in the Roman Republic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jRIbAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Gladiators&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women: A secret folio","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill's ASVAB Basic Training for the AFQT (McGraw-Hill's ASVAB Basic Training for the Afqt (Armed Forces)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Africa: A Biography of the Continent","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hollywood looks at its audience: A report of film audience research","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n8FZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hollywood+looks+at+its+audience:+A+report+of+film+audience+research&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King and Goddess","description":"The Sanskrit narrative text Dev  M h tmya,  The Greatness of The Goddess,  extols the triumphs of an all-powerful Goddess, Durg , over universe-imperiling demons. These exploits are embedded in an intriguing frame narrative: a deposed king solicits the counsel of a forest-dwelling ascetic, who narrates the tripartite acts of Durg  which comprise the main body of the text. It is a centrally important early text about the Great Goddess, which has significance to the broader field of Pur ?ic Studies. This book analyzes the Dev  M h tmya and argues that its frame narrative cleverly engages a dichotomy at the heart of Hinduism: the opposing ideals of asceticism and kingship. These ideals comprise two strands of what is referred to herein as the dharmic double helix. It decodes the symbolism of encounters between forest hermits and exiled kings through the lens of the dharmic double helix, demonstrating the extent to which this common narrative trope masterfully encodes the ambivalence of br hma?ic ideology. Engaging the tension between the moral necessity for nonviolence and the sociopolitical necessity for violence, the book deconstructs the ideological ambivalence throughout the Dev  M h tmya to demonstrate that its frame narrative invariably sheds light on its core content. Its very structure serves to emphasize a theme that prevails throughout the text, one inalienable to the rubric of the episodes themselves: sovereignty on both cosmic and mundane scales. The book sheds new light on the content of the Dev  M h tmya and contextualizes it within the framework of important debates within early Hinduism. It will be of interest to academics in the fields of Asian Religion, Hindu Studies, Goddess Studies, South Asian Studies, Narrative Studies and comparative literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=48xmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Tide With Piktors Metamorphosis","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Family Haggadah: A Seder for All Generations [FAMILY HAGGADAH]","description":"Designed as a guide for the Seder experience where young people are present, this adaptation follows the traditional order of the Seder, with a simplified text. clear, simple instructions, commentaries and illustrations of illuminated haggadot and artifacts are included.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8nfl1GspI2YC&dq=Family+Haggadah:+A+Seder+for+All+Generations+%5BFAMILY+HAGGADAH%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dealer Pb","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"America's Child Care Problem: The Way Out","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Star-spangled summer,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dunbi the Owl","description":"This book is based on a story told by Daisy Utemorrah of the Worora people to Aboriginal children living in Derby, Western Australia.

This Library of America volume the most extensive and authoritative one-volume collection ever published covers five decades of Washington s astonishingly active life and brings together over 440 letters, orders, addresses, and other writings. Among the early writings included are the journal Washington kept at age sixteen while surveying the Shenandoah Valley frontier and the dramatic account of the winter journey he made through the Pennsylvania wilderness in 1753 while on a diplomatic mission. Some two dozen letters written during the French and Indian War, including first-hand accounts of the controversial forest skirmish that sparked those hostilities and of Braddock s bloody defeat, record Washington s early encounters with the harsh challenges of military command. An extensive selection of letters, orders, and addresses from the Revolutionary War make manifest Washington s determined leadership of the Continental Army through the years of defeat and deprivation. Included are accounts of battles; letters to Congress and state governments vividly describing the army s desperate need of supplies; Washington s journal of the victorious Yorktown campaign; and letters and addresses showing how Washington upheld the supremacy of civil power in the new republic by peaceably disbanding the army at the end of the war. Letters from the Confederation period (17831789) show Washington s pleasure at returning to his Mount Vernon home, his continued interest in Western land speculation and river navigation, his growing concern with the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, and his role in the framing and ratification of the Constitution. The writings from his two terms as President of the United States show how Washington strove to establish enduring republican institutions, to build public trust in the new government, to avoid the divisions of party and faction, and to maintain American neutrality during the war between Britain and Revolutionary France. Also included in the volume are letters revealing his close and careful management of Mount Vernon and his evolving attitudes toward slavery. Washington s writings demonstrate the keen, practical intelligence that distinguished his leadership in war and peace, as well as the patriotism, dignity, and devotion to the cause of republican government that won the admiration and trust of his contemporaries and his heirs.

He s come to discover the whereabouts of a missing colleague. What he ll find is a mysterious figure known as the Old Man and a conspiracy so devious in its design, he ll wish it was a nightmare. But soon the Old Man will discover that he has awoken a sleeping giant in Rafe Harald. And on a planet of perpetual sleep, a new day is about to dawn.

As he matures from a wide-eyed student into a journalist and a seasoned observer, he develops a passion for uncovering secrets, about China and about himself. The author navigates his way past forbidding walls to peek inside the dark corners of Chinese society, relying on a remarkable collection of friends and acquaintances who help guide the way: an embittered policeman in Xian, a gay professor in Shanghai, and a Buddhist monk in Tibet, who presides at an ancient burial ritual where the corpse is carved up and fed to wild vultures. The Tiananmen Square massacre, people smuggling, and the Falun Gong movement are among the political and social upheavals that the author explains as he witnesses China's uncertain road toward capitalism and its place in the modern world. Along the way, the author wrestles with his own cultural identity, his sexuality, and his spiritual bearings. He finds an erotic outlet in the Chinese \\"Sauna Massage\\" and a stirring emotional connection with Jin Xing, a brilliant choreographer and China's first openly transsexual citizen. Ultimately, he discovers the answer to lifelong questions on a mountaintop in Tibet. Seth Faison, with a subtle understanding of Chinese culture, brings past and present events to life in a thought-provoking account of this mysterious nation and its people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7QyFPwAACAAJ&dq=South+of+the+Clouds:+Exploring+the+Hidden+Realms+of+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Eliot's Middlemarch","description":"Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very little corresponding fibre in him-self, and perhaps too little care about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or foolish, he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate shrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his private affairs.

Having passed out in the lavatory, Bernard awakes in the early hours of the morning to find himself alone and in the dark. Unable to contact the landlord, he is resigned to spending the rest of the night with a bottle of vodka and an endless chain of cigarettes, narrating a story of hilarious anecdotes and witty reminiscences which are enacted by two actors and two actresses who bring to life the various characters who populate Jeff 's world.

Now acclaimed historian and bestselling author Alison Weir has drawn on myriad sources from the Tudor era to give us the first book that examines, in unprecedented depth, the gripping, dark, and chilling story of Anne Boleyn's final days. The tempestuous love affair between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn scandalized Christendom and altered forever the religious landscape of England. Anne's ascent from private gentlewoman to queen was astonishing, but equally compelling was her shockingly swift downfall. Charged with high treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London in May 1536, Anne met her terrible end all the while protesting her innocence. There remains, however, much mystery surrounding the queen's arrest and the events leading up to it: Were charges against her fabricated because she stood in the way of Henry VIII making a third marriage and siring an heir, or was she the victim of a more complex plot fueled by court politics and deadly rivalry? The Lady in the Tower examines in engrossing detail the motives and intrigues of those who helped to seal the queen's fate. Weir unravels the tragic tale of Anne's fall, from her miscarriage of the son who would have saved her to the horrors of her incarceration and that final, dramatic scene on the scaffold. What emerges is an extraordinary portrayal of a woman of great courage whose enemies were bent on utterly destroying her, and who was tested to the extreme by the terrible plight in which she found herself. Richly researched and utterly captivating, The Lady in the Tower presents the full array of evidence of Anne Boleyn's guilt or innocence. Only in Alison Weir's capable hands can readers learn the truth about the fate of one of the most influential and important women in English history.

Throughout the last century, embryology became overshadowed by experimental-based genetics and cell biology, transforming the field into developmental biology, which replaced embryology in Biology departments in many universities. Major contributions in this young century in the fields of molecular biology, biochemistry and genomics were integrated with both embryology and developmental biology to provide an understanding of the molecular portrait of a development cell. That new integrated approach is known as stem-cell biology; it is an understanding of the embryology and development together at the molecular level using engineering, imaging and cell culture principles, and it is at the heart of this seminal book.Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine: From Molecular Embryology to Tissue Engineering is completely devoted to the basic developmental, cellular and molecular biological aspects of stem cells as well as their clinical applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. It focuses on the basic biology of embryonic and cancer cells plus their key involvement in self-renewal, muscle repair, epigenetic processes, and therapeutic applications. In addition, it covers other key relevant topics such as nuclear reprogramming induced pluripotency and stem cell culture techniques using novel biomaterials.A thorough introduction to stem-cell biology, this reference is aimed at graduate students, post-docs, and professors as well as executives and scientists in biotech and pharmaceutical companies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZAYvAQAAIAAJ&dq=Learning+with+LabVIEW+6i&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collecting Blue and White Stoneware","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Werewolf of London (The Universal Horror Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j_SYAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Werewolf+of+London+(The+Universal+Horror+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Susannah's Garden","description":"Some paths are dead ends.

The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck. The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D. s grandparents were  dirt poor and in love,  and moved north from Kentucky s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history. A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Y9KDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Virus Clans","description":"A research scientist uncovers evidence that certain viruses are not only sentient, but also uniting together to plan their next move against their human hosts.
