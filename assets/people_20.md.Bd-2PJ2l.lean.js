Training for the exam is a mostly self study and practice exam, that's why it is so important to find the best material on the market.The training kit has 2 cd's that have over 6 hours of training videos available to view and review at your pace. The speaker(s) are easily understood and the clarity is very good as well. This kit makes a perfect companion to Peter's A+ book, and it is included in e-format on the cd.There is also over 200 practice questions included on the cds and I think this should have been a separate cd. The material covered does in fact go over each and every exam objective, plus more, as in the case of the operating systems covering 9X, ME, NTWS and 2000 Professional.Also included is a workbook for taking notes on any of the topics, which include troubleshooting, printers, which is an excellent breakdown, laptops, hardware and operating systems. I like the fact you can repeat lessons, also the fact you can skip around and customize the learning to your needs.As for the install, I was able to run the software on Windows 95, 98, ME, NT Workstation, 2000 Professional and XP Professional so there is no excuse for not learning. About the only drawbacks is the timing, this should have released closer to the newest exams, and the material should have been on DVD as well."},{"Title":"The French Powder Mystery (Ellery Queen Mysteries)(Library Edition)","review":"The first ten Ellery Queen novels were pure logic problems, unencumbered by considerations of plausibility of character or situation. However, the puzzles are so enjoyable (especially the challenge to the reader once all the clues have been revealed) that we can overlook these flaws.The French Powder Mystery concerns a dead body, discovered when the automatic window display of the French Department Store kicks into action one morning. The logic of the solution is rigorous, and the naming of the killer is literally the last two words of the book - even when the denoument is underway and all is being explained, the name of the bad 'un is still a surprise.A better plot than Roman Hat and the Dutch Shoe Mysteries, I recommend it wholeheartedly!"},{"Title":"The French Powder Mystery (Ellery Queen Mysteries)(Library Edition)","review":"The 1930 novel, \\"The French Powder Mystery\\", is a well-structured detective story that challenges the reader, is scrupulously fair, and makes good reading.Cyrus French is the chairman of the eminently successful and stylistically influential French's Department Store in midsection New York. In recent weeks the store window has been opened precisely at noon each day to exhibit somewhat fantastical, European modern furniture. Today the waiting crowd is awestruck as a dead body tumbles from a wall bed. This second mystery by Ellery Queen, the follow-up to his remarkable first novel The Roman Hat Mystery, was proof positive that this new author was here to stay.The French Powder Mystery foreshadowed the innovative mysteries that would follow in the next few years, classic deductive novels like The Tragedy of X (1932) and The Greek Coffin Mystery (1932) and The Tragedy of Y (1932) and The Spanish Cape Mystery (1935).To me, much of the fascination with The French Powder Mystery was the recognition that the New York of 1930 now seems remotely distant. While drugs and drug addiction were not unknown, they were largely unfamiliar evils. A former college companion of Ellery Queen says, \\"Mightn't it be the same stuff? Heroin, I think you called it.\\" Also, New York at night was more secure. For an alibi a young woman replies, \\"When I left the Zorns that evening, it was a little after ten. I walked and walked in the park (Central Park) until almost midnight.\\" And the wealthy were indeed different: a cosmopolitan young woman had cigarettes, appropriately scented, made up especially for her by a custom tobacco manufacturer.The French Powder Mystery is classic Ellery Queen and should appeal to all fans of deductive mystery stories. Good hunting."},{"Title":"The French Powder Mystery (Ellery Queen Mysteries)(Library Edition)","review":"Frederic Dannay and Manfred Lee, the authors of this and the other early Ellery Queen books, certainly enjoyed mystery. They not only invented a fictional sleuth called Ellery Queen, they also wrote the books under that pseudonym. Not content with that, this novel also has a forward by a fictional 'J.J.McC' and some additional notes by an unnamed 'editor'. You may enjoy all of this or, like me, you may find it all rather irritating and wish they would simply get on with the story.Talking of irritating, was there ever such a provoking hero as Ellery? Pompous, arrogant and vain, he makes Lord Peter Whimsey look like a man of the people. &quot;Scoot!&quot; he says to a police officer, handing him some items for fingerprinting. Anyone who thinks that America has always been a classless society, in contrast to Europe's class-consciousness, should read this 1930 novel.But is it a good tale? Well, yes, if you want a story in the classic mould. It has rather too many red herrings for my taste but I shall say no more, for fear of spoiling it.One other complaint; the authors don't trust to the power of simple story-telling. Characters do not merely 'say' things. They 'grin broadly' - for no apparent reason - and display tobacco-stained teeth when they speak. The authors seem to think they have to embelish everything to retain the reader's interest. When the Inspector orders his men to inspect the crime scene, they do so 'grinning'. Why? Have they forgotten that the victim's poor spouse is in the room?Having said all that, if you are a mystery fan you will want to read at least one Ellery Queen story and this is as good a one as any. One last tip: if, when you reach the final episode, you have not solved the mystery, go back over the earlier parts of the book. As the authors say, the clues are all there."},{"Title":"The French Powder Mystery (Ellery Queen Mysteries)(Library Edition)","review":"'French Powder Mystery' is one of my favorite mystery novel.

(1948)Quite far from my usual orbits of interest, but Sassoon reappeared with the same stellar writing that I had so admired in his \\"Memoirs of A Fox Hunting Man.\\" An allegiance was enticed, again.This hardcover was a first edition (from Saratoga's Lyrical Ballad; & who knows how long it had lain on the shelves in a dusty basement labyrinth before rescue?).During the first reading, the first highlighting sank into the spongy English paper (milled in 1948, or earlier). Later, it was discovered to have vanished, almost entirely; the ancient paper \\"drank\\" the ink (Warning: Do not do this to the pre-1948 Egyptian hieroglyphics in the British Museum. You will get identically poor results).\\"Meredith\\" had been so appreciated that all of the once-highlighted words were immediately given a second & hopefully permanent coat.We don't do this for books that disappoint us.Q: How could have the English publishers acquired an exemption from their government's post-World War II paper rationing - to publish a biography of a by-then almost forgotten novelist & poet (who, only 39 years earlier, had died a national celebrity)?What optimism!

This book is much more than a guide for pilots. Anyone traveling to this area of the United States should read Favorite New England Airports: A Guide to Aviation Activities and Entertainment. It offers one the chance to greatly enhance their vacation to New England!"},{"Title":"Favorite New England Airports: A Guide to Aviation Activities and Entertainment","review":"James Kohns' book appeals to me because the author--rather than trying to write a guide that covers every airport, restaurant, and hotel and quickly becomes obsolete--focuses his comments on several activities and places he has personally enjoyed and thinks others will also like.Kohn loves taking flight to enjoy New England's great outdoors, sports, the arts, culinary adventures, and lovely inns. His enthusiasm is infectious. He covers many places and topics, among them whitewater rafting, outlet shopping, and climbing Mount Katahdin in Maine; skiing, golfing, and boating in Vermont; exploring Nautucket and Martha's Vineyard and historic Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. He notes museums, offers advice on places to eat and stay, and provides the all-important basics of how to get around once you touch down at the airport.In short, pilots who want to explore more of New England will appreciate the book for its practical advice on flight aspects. Pilots and non-pilots alike will enjoy the unique vantage point this book offers on activities. This is a delightful and practical guide to a varied and interesting part of the world."},{"Title":"A Primer of Conservation Genetics","review":"I thought this book was very entry level but that was exactly what the editors were going for.

If you looking for a through introduction to conservation genetics this is not the book (go straight to the big books, an excellent choice is Genetics of Populations, Fourth Edition (2011)) , but it you just want to get your feet wet this will be more than sufficient to familiarize you with the basic principles.I agree with the previous reviewer I feel the price is a bit steep seeing how you can get a far more in-depth text for the same price or often less."},{"Title":"A Primer of Conservation Genetics","review":"The book is fine for beginners in the conservation genetics.So the price, I think that is expensive, because the book is just only an introductionto conservation genetics."},{"Title":"Black Storm: A Horse of The Kansas Hills","review":"I must have read this book 100 times as a horse crazy girl back in the early 70's.

A typology of multimedia authoring software is developed, and brief descriptions of individual authoring packages are provided to exemplify each type. The accompanying CD-ROM contains evaluation copies of many of the packages mentioned (such as Macromedia Director, Adobe Freehand, and SoundEdit) for further exploration by the reader. The book also provides extensive coverage of the multimedia development process, from the roles of the members of a multimedia development team, to planning, costing, producing, testing, and delivering products.

The summary on the back on the book was very appealing as I am a fan of arranged marriages etc story lines, but as soon as I began to read this book I was sorry that I purchased it! The dialogue is unreal and made me laugh out loud at how ridiculuous it sounded. There were so many characters that I got lost on who was who and had to back track to remember who exactly they were. Her descriptions of the characters were unncessary and very repetitive and it was ridiculous of the author to describe every single action the characters made which made the book very tedious to read. The characters Josh and Maura were good enough characters but they were boring and so were the other characters in the book. I also hated how &quot;Papa Isaac&quot; was pushing Maura off onto Josh like she was a piece of meat or something... and finally what was it about the prom that it had to be mentioned at least one hundred times by all of the characters?

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this. Ms. Craft seems to have too many other characters, who were certainly not charming and not engaging. Her main characters never develop beyond a &quot;lack-luster&quot; appeal. And I honestly almost &quot;lost it&quot; when they broke out into the FUNKY CHICKEN!

But, it seemed to me to be more like a really long magazine article than a good book. That may largely be because it is written in the mid 1990's and lots of things have happened since that really belong in a book about Jones' life.Overall it is a pretty good read and informative, but I found myself making an effort to finish it rather than having to make an effort to put it down. Dent's book about the Junction boys and Bear Bryant is a much better effort and one that was written at a better time - afterwards rather than during the story.

Author Rex Warner considers the building of Athens, the marbles of Aegina, Delos and Mycenae, various accounts of the oracle at Delphi. Besides the amusing argument for the repatriation of the Elgin marbles, the bit that will stick with me is this passage on the uniqueness of Greek sculpture, especially when contrasted with the Roman:\\"Statues of Roman emperors or athletes cannot fail to remind us of modern businessmen or bruisers; but in every head, every grave relief or vase from ancient Greece there is a grace, a vitality, often a kind of mystery which can scarcely be associated with anything ordinary or vulgar in our own times.

Her first book, 1,2,3, Get Ready! an eight-week summer program preparing a child for inclusion, proved highly popular among ASMT library users.Johnson, a former off-Broadway actress and mother of a child with autism, has again performed her magic, co-authoring with teacher Sherry Henshaw Corden and psychologist William Allen.Beyond Words is a simple how-to inclusion guide for parents, teachers, and other school personnel. Deftly, Johnson and Corden walk the readers through Pace Johnson's year in a Knoxville general education kindergarten classroom. Information is dispersed throughout the book, in several readable formats including short paragraphs, sidebars and bullets of comments by typically developing peers and their parents, Q and A sections between parent and teacher, and candid solo recollections by each. Psychologist Allen backs all with insightful scientific-based commentary. Pictures documenting Pace's inclusive school year provide a warm visual to the book.Truly a hands-on guide for parents, the book includes an appendix of how-tos including a homemade book on the child - both the child's personal version and a fill-in-the-blank copy, 20 questions for a prospective teacher, schedules, reward boards, social stories and more.Every parent of a school-age child with autism can relate to Johnson's descriptions of her heart-gripping fears as she navigated this first year. Corden's frank concerns and responding courage in turn offer parents a bird's eye view of a teacher's perspective. The teacher's revelations plus the comments of the typically developing peers and their parents are a true gift. Autism parents come to the experience of school inclusion with a weighty bag of anxiety, hopes and dreams. The honest, tender and redemptive observations from those on \\"the other side\\" from the inside provide a medicine cabinet's stock of soothing antidotes for a parent's weary soul.Pace is a good role model for inclusion. Having PDD-NOS at the time of kindergarten, he was blessed with typical and almost gifted cognition. Yet, he was challenged by the fact that he was largely nonverbal. He also had some fierce behaviors described in detail and not uncommon to our children - kicking, hitting and sometimes class-disruptive screaming. It would be easy to romanticize the successful inclusion of this child, but Johnson and Corden bring the reader back to reality. This kid had some big pluses but also some hefty challenges.Luckily, his team had the right attitude plus a saint of an autism mum leading the way. Johnson gives us parents a template of how to work with school systems. Corden, as well, is a role model for general education teachers, the kind we wish we could all be so lucky to have."},{"Title":"Beyond Words: The Successful Inclusion of a Child with Autism","review":"What a great story for inspiring classroom teachers who may work with a child with special needs."},{"Title":"Beyond Words: The Successful Inclusion of a Child with Autism","review":"This book by Mary Johnson, re: her son, Pace, is a fabulous book; heartwarming, informative, and very inspirational!"},{"Title":"The International Adoption Handbook : How to Make Foreign Adoption Work for You","review":"This is an excellent book.

In Alperson's defense, a print publication of this nature is by definition static and outdated before it even hits the market. Still, this book makes for good reading and provides good advice. It is definitely worth reading, but double check the figures and requirements on the Web and elsewhere.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"},{"Title":"The International Adoption Handbook : How to Make Foreign Adoption Work for You","review":"I took this book out of the library, and boy was I glad I didn't buy it before getting a good look at it! The information is woefully outdated (ie: Alperson claims that filing the all-important INS I-600A form costs only $168 - it now costs $405! She doesn't even acknowledge that all the important INS forms are now easily downloaded off the IRS website with concise instructions - a lifesaver!). While her basic information is good, there is nothing here that you can't find online. Our exhaustive pre-adoption research found that the most reliable and up-to-date info is on the web - ever-changing country guidelines, INS procedures and politics place the international adoption process in a constant state of flux. There is no way a print publication can possibly keep up with the changes. Since there is such an emotional toll with adoption, I feel that it is best to seek out only the most current info - that way you won't get your hopes up based on outdated material. Also, by using the web, you can read the stories of individual families and contact them directly to learn first-hand of their adoption experiences. I really learned how to negotiate the process from families who had recently completed adoptions in the country we had selected. They gave me the real inside information, and even helped us to choose the agency that was right for us. If I had gone on Alperson's circa 1997 advice, I would have taken many wrong turns.While Alperson's book contains some good, solid info on the aspects of international adoption that are constants - save yourself the money and avoid being confused by old data by checking out the web. If you are intent on having a \\"hard copy\\" of adoption information, be aware that this book contains serious misinformation regarding country regulations and INS procedures that may set you back."},{"Title":"The International Adoption Handbook : How to Make Foreign Adoption Work for You","review":"This book did have some helpful and insightful information, but most of the ligistics were severely outdated. The costs are so far below the present day costs that they never should have been printed. Also, the author seemed to have a very negative outlook toward the different avenues of international adoption except the avenues she chose to adopt through, such as independent adoption. Actually she was negative towards many aspects of international adoption unless it worked for her. She did not seem very open-minded. She just wants you to know what worked for her and the rest, well...it wasn't important. I would not recommend if you're seeking concrete unbias information."},{"Title":"The International Adoption Handbook : How to Make Foreign Adoption Work for You","review":"This book wasn't quite what I was looking for (more of an instruction manual, less of a personal-journey saga) but it was still definitely an interesting read. Ms. Alperson is very honest and upfront and does have great advice. This book is good moral support."},{"Title":"The International Adoption Handbook : How to Make Foreign Adoption Work for You","review":"Outdated, declasse and so preachy/stupid. You'd be better using the internet to find out the real deal on international adoption than reading this insipid book."},{"Title":"The International Adoption Handbook : How to Make Foreign Adoption Work for You","review":"It was so easy to read and I hope the next person who will buy it."},{"Title":"The International Adoption Handbook : How to Make Foreign Adoption Work for You","review":"While she has a lot of good information (the list of contacts at the end are great), as a Catholic-Christian, married-father adopting from Guatemala, I did not like the single-mother, pro-homosexual slant of the book. It is NOT a handbook of how to adopt internationally. It is her story of adopting a girl from China. In writing the book, she talked to a lot of people who adopted from all over the world. Their stories are spread throughout the book and add a lot to the book. Overall, I was disappointed with the book and would not recommend its purchase."},{"Title":"1000 Masterpieces of Painting Nudes","review":"This is truely and incredible compilation of figure studies from prehistory through the 20th Century. Well worth the purchase price, this thick book includes over 750 pages, is well organized (chronologically), with innumerable high quality reproductions, each accompanied by a well considered commentary. All it lacks for impact is in size. Despite the high quality color printing, it's impossible for me to fully appreciate the details of works of art when they are reproduced in pictures the size of a playing card (2-4 inches). I really like this book, but I'd also love to see it reprinted on letter size or coffee-table size format."},{"Title":"The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It","review":"The Code Book is a delightful treatment of the subject of cryptography. It is a nice combination of history, science, warfare and politics.The author uses interesting historical events as background to narrate the different phases of what might be called the mainstream developments of cryptography and cryptanalysis. It is a captivating presentation.The book started off with the story of Queen Mary of Scotland, and went on to cover the Caesar cipher, Vigen&egrave;re cipher, the famous Enigma, the super-secret Colossus, and the modern day computer based encryption and decryption developments. The author also threw in a couple of interesting \\"sideline\\" stories, such as the Beale cipher, the Rosetta Stone, and the Navajo \\"code talkers\\" who played a key role in the Pacific theater during WWII.My teenage son used to complain that most of the difficult subjects he learned in school would never have any use in real life. I gave him a copy of this book. The book is a compelling story of how science, engineering, mathematics, computer, linguistics, psychology are all critical pieces of this all-important game.There are more technical treatises on this subject, and there are more lengthy and nuanced historical accounts on military intelligence as well. But this book is undoubtedly the best introduction to this uniquely fascinating subject."},{"Title":"The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It","review":"Reading this book gave me my start in my self study of cryptography, its science and its history. While I will not pretend to be anywhere near an expert on the subject, I found this book very insightful. It is an easy read, and not tedious in any way. It is meant as a \\"science for non-scientists\\" type book, and more of a history than anything else. (I have only managed to solve the first two cryptologic challenges at the end of this book, but am diligently working on the rest in my spare time.)"},{"Title":"The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It","review":"Intended for an audience of young adults, Simon Singh's The Code Book will appeal to many an adult reader as it reveals the science of cryptography - the encoding and decoding of private information. The history spans centuries and ranges from an early Enigma machine to email communications and Internet privacy. The Code Book is recommended as an intriguing and informative survey."},{"Title":"The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It","review":"I have always been fascinated by codes and Singh has put together a comprehensive book on the history of codes. Having read many books on codes, Singh was still able to enthrall me with some historical stories that I had not come across. It's not just technical stuff, but is written with the novice in mind as well. But the book holds enough technical information to keep the enthusiast interested as well. The version I bought has a crypt contest in the back, which I enjoyed working on - I was only able to solve the first 3 or so puzzles, but it was a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It","review":"The Code Book was intended for a young adult audience but also holds an ability to interest an adult readership as well. This history of cryptography provides plenty of depth and information on making and breaking codes, providing a historical background on an ongoing battle which has been waged for centuries. An intriguing look at codes and secrecy."},{"Title":"The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It","review":"Singh has provided the reader a delightful history of encryption, beginning with 16th-century codes, proceeding with the mechanized ones, and concluding with modern computer-based systems. He points out how modern encryption is being used to thwart the counterfeiting of dollars, and rejects the so-called Bible Code.Singh also touches on the intricacies of language, and discusses the difficulty of deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphics. This involved the decoding of a language that no one speaks today, and one which has no close relatives among modern languages. He also has a fascinating account of the Navajo Indians and their unique language, and how their conversations were used to keep the Japanese in the dark during WWII.When in comes to the German ENIGMA code of WWII, and in contrast to some English-language books on this subject, Singh gives credit squarely where it is due. He traces the Polish successes with code-breaking, beginning with the cracking of Russian codes by the Biuro Szyfrow (the Bureau of Ciphers) during the 1920 Polish-Bolshevik War (p. 144). In the years before WWII, a Polish team of mathematicians headed by Marian Rejewski recognizably solved the ENIGMA (p. 155). The Poles were ten years ahead of anyone else in this field (p. 160). The later successes of the British at Bletchley relied on Rejewski's work (p. 170), and followed the lead of the Poles (p. 243). Alan Turing followed Rejewski's strategy (p. 171)."},{"Title":"The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It","review":"Singh relates a plenty of interesting facts of the history of cryptography that were kept secret for a long time. Besides, a good introduction to the idea of some simple cryptographic schemes gives the reader a little bit of the thrill that involve the study of codes. Although I liked the book very much, in my opinion, the title does not reflect what's inside: actually, you don't lear how to make, break, hack or crack anything."},{"Title":"The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It","review":"HI! aLRIGHT, LET ME GIVE IT STRAIGHT HAHA I read this book and I found it INTERESTING, witty,(he kinda winks at you..and there are some humorous parts...well, of course not in the slapstick &quot;HAHAHA!&quot; way, but u'll see) challenging (Mr. Singh does not treat us like little babies..the vocabulary is SAT-worthy :p...) -and I didn't know much at all about codes. Mr. singh takes you through everything he wants to show you clearly and adding spice- the historical part is NOT boring...it WOuld be boring without it, actually! He intertwines anecdotes and events in history (i.e. starting from the very beginning, WWI and WWII, the beheading of Mary Queen of Scotts, to the present day) with the use of codes (i.e.-Enigma machine, monoalphabetic substituion cipher -&gt; each letter in the alphabet is represented by a symbol)...This book is cozy (reading it on a dark rainy night...awooooo....), it's really like a novel- It's like you delve into it and it pulls you in...I admit there are some parts that are slightly &quot;technical&quot; but TRUST me, as I said before, he explains it so that even someone who is not math-oriented can follow along.

It was recommended to me, and I picked it up with anticipation, ready to buy a copy. I was very disappointed, (as a psychotherapist specializing in recovery issues), to find that the dual diagnosis approach to recovery and mental health was mentioned exactly once, then ignored in favor of the old &quot;either/or&quot; paradigm discarded by most of us in the eighties; thus the sections on addiction and mental health are of limited use, since the interactions between the two are ignored. This book is better than nothing, but you'll have to infer your treatment plans if you let yourself be limited by its contents.

We didn't get much information on either the diagnosis or how we could help our daughter from the mental health institute we have access to. So we first turned to the internet and looked up the diagnosis. Most of it was very technical, hard to understand and cynical. I found this book at our local library and it has helped us tremendously. It is clearly written for the general public to understand. We felt torn between finally finding something that helps us understand what's been going on and feeling depressed by the prognosis for the future. We think this book's a good start.

The section on what it is like for someone with a particular problem is especailly helpful. It really helped me as a student, and years later, I am still referring to it. If I want to explain something to someone else, I find that reading this book really helps me to explain things to others in an undestandable way.

I often buy such books to tickle the mind, & to get fresh perspectives, in addition to satisfying my curiosity streak.I am very impressed by the work of the author, a widely published humourist & commentator on popular culture. He traces the surprising, unbelievable, & amazing stories behind the invention & marketing of many of the products & companies that shape our lives.Among the many relevations are:- the truth about Spam, without actually having to eat it;- how the founders of Apple Computer really wen into business (Hint: The FBI would not have approved);- How the Life Saver got its hole (Hint: It was not intentional);- How few videos MTV actually had when it started, & the identity of the aging british rocker who was featured in an inordinate number of them;- Why the SONY engineers who built the Walkamn considered it a failure;Not only I have been intrigued but also appalled by the boneheadedness of inventors, business leaders, advertisers & marketers as they are related in the stories. In fact, I have adapted/used many of the revelations as case studies in illustrating personal as well as organisational creativity. I recap the author's prologue: \\"...The reality is that many of our most beloved products were developed by hunch, guesswork, & fanaticism, by creators who were eccetric - or even start raving mad. That's because making something genuinely new requries a different way of looking at things.

It's a collection of 3 Carousels magazines No. 1 to 3. It has many short but moving stories that teaches values and virtues.

I got to know this book because my 5-year-old kid got several reading and written assignments on it from his kindergarten teacher. Every time he brought this book home, my 3-year-old kid would be very excited because she liked the stories in it, too. It is a good book that you can keep for very long.

I would have liked to have had Pendergrast more involved, it was as if he was a secondary character. Maybe that was the point.

There's nothing to indicate to a new reader that it's the seventh book of a series, nor (more importantly) the third book of a trilogy within the series, so an unwary reader quickly find him- or herself confronted with characters making reference to past events that are never explained or expanded upon. As a thriller, it seems competent enough, but I found myself too mired in continuity to ever really get into it."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Special Agent Pendergast is so over the top, nearly a superhero; I just couldn't appreciate him as a protagonist. And the whole evil brother aspect is just too cliche. Speaking of cliche, the Tolkienesque ending, really? Why not just call it Mt. Doom? I admit these guys can write suspensefully, but the story leaves a lot to be desired. The whole house of horror aspect just left me not able to really accept the premise of this novel. I'm purposefully being vague about plot points to not spoil this book for those determined to read it.I also did not appreciate what I took to be Child's contributions to this book. paragraphs of inane details about computer systems. Literally pages of chase sequences turning left on street so and so, turning right on via something or other, down alley whatchamacallit. We get it; you have a city map of Florence. And the Italian names; why use the Italian half the time and the anglicized half the time? Why not be consistent? Was this book even edited for that sort of thing? Ex. They go to Florence (not Firenze) or Milan (not Milano) but are in piazza (not a square) or in talking to suor (and not a sister). The lack of consistency was distracting. And speaking of a lack of consistency, I understand that SA Pendergast is well educated but these two sentences next to each other he would not say: (and I paraphrase) His existence for living is I. My existence for living is him. \\"I\\" in the first sentence but \\"him\\" in the second (vice he)? little details like that throughout the book just kept reminding me that this book was pumped out in a hurry with minimal effort and minimal editing.

I would agree with other reviewers in advising readers to fight any urge to read the last sentence. I was a little disappointed with the ending...

I've read terrible novels that were better than this. It was so unbelieveable throughout that I had to keep forcing myself to pick it back up and finish, and when I did, I wanted those hours back.WARNING SPOILER: A little ways in, I quickly deduced that the one person who could pull off the \\"gimick\\" was museum director Menzies, but then that didn't make sense, because he would have have to have multiple degrees from prestigeous universities in very specific backgrounds, plus spent his entire life getting to the point where he could become a museum director. So I knew it couldn't be him. Wrong. It was. Preston and Childs explained it away in less than a page - totally unbelieveable. And why would a group of people risk their own livlihood breaking someone out of a maximum security prison - it would have been easier, less risky, and less expensive to simply hire a good attorney. You have to totally suspend knowledge of how life really works to believe anything the authors were selling. I enjoy the subject of Egyptology, and normally like these authors, but cripes, this book must have been a deadline- created money generator for the publisher.

I also think you should read 'The Cabinet of Curiousities' prior to reading this.This most recent Pendergrast thriller ties up a lot of loose ends (but not permanently), and has all of the series' most important characters going through their motions as they routinely do. And that's why this book falls short of the heights of its predecessors. Everything is routine.The villainous Diogenes is not as potent or powerful this time, and seems to be 'going through the motions' of what an arch-villain should do. D'Agosto and Hayward do their cop/romance schtick as usual. The reporters are both here, but neither has much to do. Margo Green is a character, but her part seems like it was added in afterwards when the authors realized she was still a loose end.I plowed through this book and found it to be a compelling and compulsive read, but somehow I'm disappointed. I've come to expect greatness from the authors, and this time all they delivered was a solid book. The problem with the book is that there were no surprises, and in a thriller I want to be thrilled.I feel like a Yankee fan who complains because A-Rod only hit 40 homers and drives in 120 runs."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Another fast paced and exciting thriller from the dynamic writing duo.

May his saga continue..."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"If I could give this book higher than a 5=Star rating, it would have one. What a remarkably suspenseful, intriguing conclusion to a great series of books. Pendergast is fascinating, as are all of the characters. It has been most enjoyable seeing their characters develop and interact - makes it more interesting. The authors ability to create and not be held back by explainable reality is what makes the books so interesting. It gives you the opportunity to imagine and wonder.

Accused of the crimes committed by his brother, he is locked away in one of the highest security prisons while his brother plots to get away with the perfect crime. Preston and Child have once again configured a fast moving murder mystery with their wonderful compilation of interesting facts and characters."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Book of the Dead ends the \\"Pendergast Trilogy\\" and I have to say that this was the best book of the three. Finally there is some closure to the Pendergast vs his brother battle, and we find out what caused Diogenes to hate his brother. Unlike the last book, Dance of Death, this one really holds it's own and ties up so many loose ends from the previous novels that it is a MUST read for ever Preston/Child fan out there.I think that the most enjoyable part of this book is that it featured other main characters rather than just Pendergast. Many return from previous novels and all in all it makes for a very enjoyable read.If I have one complaint, I would have to say that the last line of the book was not only expected, but really a disappointment. If they had ended the book two paragraphs earlier I would have been very happy but this is not a major issue.One side note, if you have not read Brimstone and Dance of Death, you need to before reading this one or you might be a bit confused. Other than that this is a first rate page turner that builds up the suspense as it reaches a fascinating climax.All in all this is one of the best Preston/Child works out there. I cannot wait to see what comes next from these two dynamic writers!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"For those who haven't read an Agent Pendergast novel before, this book will be very confusing - go back and read the earlier books first. For anyone who's been following Pendergast's story, this is one of the best in the series. Our hero gets a little more human, just as he did in \\"Dance of Death\\" and \\"Brimstone\\". The battle with Diogenes continues, and every time things seem resolved, there's another shock around the corner. I finished it in one day, and can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"If you are perusing these opinions you already know what incredible writers these two men are - what you don't know is that this is a wonderful read. The Pendergast brothers keep your interest and Agent Pendergast and his high-tec antics keeps the imagination open. That's what you should do - don't say, \\"That wouldn't happen\\" or \\"impossible\\" - just go with the flow and enjoy this masterful piece of verbal art. The ending is open -- and I feel that Diogenes will reappear -- to claim his child -- and that there is more to happen to Constance - we still don't know her entire story but it will surface with the birth of a child. Please read ALL the books by these gentlemen. They are sensational authors."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"These authors are two of my favorites.I enjoyed this book very much,but, can we get away from the museum for a while. I am aware that one of the authors worked there and it is a facinating place, just the right setting for these stories. However, it seems as if there is always a new exhibit with a gala opening that turns into chaos.I would like to see some more stand alone books from these guys. I like the idea of using characters fron previous books in stories that are not set in the museum. Agent Prendergast and brother Diogenes are like evil twin Sherlock Holmes. It would be nice to read about their family history. We have seen glimpses here and there, but not enough for me.I will continue to buy every book published by these authors and cannot wait for the next on."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"As David Spade would say, I like this book better the first time I read it, when it was called \\"Relic.\\" Preston and Child can turn out potboilers, guilty pleasures that aren't literary masterpieces but make with the page-turning fun, but they also aren't without their flaws. Too often, they drop arcana into a situation that doesn't call for it (anybody can Google up a ton of trivia on any subject, and besides, you shouldn't try to impress your reader by your mastery of obscure facts). Agent Pendergast is again perfect in every way. Need a safe cracked? He knows the metallurgy necessary to pick the weak point in the lock. Not to give away a plot point, but in this book he McGuyvers up one particularly necessary element in a manner that's just too convenient.And convenience is the downfall of this book, and of most P&C; books. What could be a situation fraught with drama is instead defused by Pendergast's godlike abilities, including the ludicrous \\"memory crossing\\" technique that is P&C;'s way of conveniently explaining away anything they don't know how to write into their books.Chop off a few chapters, give Pendergast at least one or two flaws, and drop the attempts to dazzle the reader with trivia, and this would be a five-star summer read. As it is, it's just laughable and tedious."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Diogenes Pendergast has slipped through the grasp of law enforcement again and again all the while making it look as if his brother, FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast is really responsible for the wave of crime. With Aloysius locked away in a federal penetentiary, Diogenes is available to execute his master plan - the ultimate crime targeting as many victims as possible. Disguised as a museum employee, Diogenes has access to the setting of an Egyptian tomb that is being refurbished for a grand public opening. Nora Kelly, the curator for the exhibit, is working feverishly to get the tomb ready for the opening, but an ancient curse attached to the tomb seems to resurface, making it difficult, if not impossible, to stay on track. Meanwhile, D'Agosta, along with Eli Ginn, Proctor, and Constance Green, are working just as hard to find a way to spring Aloysius from his prison and clear his name.Fans of Preston and Child will enjoy this thrilling conclusion to the trilogy. It is by far the fastest paced and exciting of the three. At this point in the series, the reader is used to the convenient appearance of characters from past books so it is easier to move past that shortcoming and just get into the plot of the book. It is always fun to see how the brilliant Pendergast brothers will use their genius minds and impressive world knowledge in an effort to outdo each other and stay ahead of everyone around them. For all of the series faults, this exciting and page turning conclusion saves the day."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"If you're looking for a fun adventure story, THE BOOK OF THE DEAD certainly delivers the goods. This is basically a Indiana Jones movie in a novel format -- lots of big action scenes, a dramatic prison break, even a bit of Egyptology thrown in for good measure. None of this is remotely realistic, but it's a lot of fun and I kept turning the pages.This is not Lincoln/Child's best book by a long shot, but it's a good novel overall. This novel is rather slow-paced at the beginning, but it picks up nicely after the first hundred pages or so. This novel also has pretty much zero character development --every major character in this novel has been introduced in a prior book by Lincoln/Child.I've read most of Preston/Child's books, and my major problem is that the writers are beginning to repeat themselves. For example, much of this novel is set in the Museum of Natural History. Many of the scenes in this book remind me of their first novel RELIC, which takes place in the same locale (and with many of the same characters). For the next Pendergast book, I would strongly suggest leaving the museum behind.For those who don't know, this is the third book in a trilogy --the first two books being BRIMSTONE and DANCE OF DEATH. I would strongly recommend reading those two books first, since they provide a lot of the background for this novel. Indeed, you might be better off reading novels like THE RELIC or THE CABINET OF CURIOUSITIES first, because they are considered by many fans to be Preston/Child's best novels."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Preston and Child in \\"The Book of the Dead\\" conclude their classic trilogy of the confrontation between Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast and his pathologically evil younger brother Diogenes. The novel commences very shortly after it's prequel, \\"The Dance of Death\\" concludes and therein lies the problem. Without having at least read \\"Dance of Death\\" you'd be lost just picking up \\"The Book of the Dead\\". Having myself read the prequel when it was first released, enough time elapsed to create a bit of fuzziness about the plot.Closely paralleling the Star Wars trilogy as to the relative dispositions of the forces of good and evil, we find our heroes back on their heels as in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". Agent Pendergast is incarcerated in an impregnable federal penitentiary implicated in a slew of crimes committed by his brother Diogenes, who had framed him. Pendergast's sidekick. NYPD Lt. Vincent D'Agosta had been disgraced as a result of his involvement with him and faces a departmental disciplinary hearing. He was forced to sever romantic ties with Cpt. Laura Hayward.The plot begins with a delivery of a suspicious package to, where else, The Museum of Natural History. Powder leaking from the package spawned fears of bioterrorism. Careful lab analysis concluded that the powder was a large amount of industrial diamond grit. Examination of this grit by the museum's mineralogy experts revealed that the grit was actually the pulverized remains of the museums priceless diamond collection which had been purloined by Diogenes.This revelation set into motion, by the directors of the museum, a huge project designed to distract the public from destruction of the precious stones. Former P & C heroine and museum curator Nora Kelly was assigned the job of re-opening the lavish Egyptian tomb of Senef, which had been bricked up in the bowels of the museum in the 1930's. The tomb which had been shrouded by rumors of a curse surrounding it was to be again opened amid a gala pageant funded by a ten million Euro bequest by a mysterious French count whose ancestors originally uncovered it. This all fell under a nefarious plan orchestrated by Diogenes to wreck havoc using the exhibit as his base of operations.In the meantime Lt. D'Agosta working with wheelchair bound genius Eli Glinn of Effective Engineering Solutions were plotting a scheme to spring Pendergast from prison. Pendergast made aware of events surrounding the museum and Diogenes' plan was anxious to break out to thwart his brother.The wily Diogenes however was taking no chances and was trying to seduce Constance Green, the young but ageless ward of Pendergast, who lived in his Riverside mansion, using her as a wedge against his brother.The plot thickens as the brothers attempt to fufill their goals. A major revelation in this book is the insight we get into the genesis of the conflict between the two brothers. A boyhood prank perpetrated by a nine year Agent Pendergast on his seven year old brother resulted in his partial blindness and twisted his psyche forever creating an insurmountable rift. Also revealed by P & C are some aspects of the story behind the mysterious Constance Green.Since the authors have indicated that \\"The Book of the Dead\\" concludes their trilogy, we can hopefully look forward to some fresh new plot fabrications. In the concluding scene of the book, seeds were planted for a possible direction their next eagerly anticipated novel will take."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The Book of the Dead closes out the informal trilogy centering on the gifted Pendergast brothers (and deadly rivals) Aloysius and Diogenes. Brimstone (2004) and Dance of Death (2005) were virtual set-up books to the culminating heart-stopping events in this new offering. I highly recommend that readers attain a working familiarity with those other titles (as well as the rest of the Pendergast ouvre) before tearing into The Book of the Dead. There are just too many things going on which connect to prior books for new readers to otherwise get full, comprehensive enjoyment.All the familiar faces are back, and have varying degrees of impact on the proceedings. Margo Green, for example, only has a cameo appearance, much to my regret. William Smithback Jr, the reporter with the \\"nose\\" for news, and Eli Glinn (from The Ice Limit and Dance of Death) also take somewhat of a backstage role. Instead, Nora Kelly, Vincent D'Agosta and and Homicide Captain Laura Hayward come to the fore. Constance Greene also has an integral part to play. But, of course, the main star of the show is maverick FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast, with his psychopathic younger genius of a brother Diogenes getting the second star billing. As an additional teaser for the readers, one of the long-time supporting characters turns out to be a sleeper villain.The sprawling, prestigious New York Museum of Natural History has survived the bloodcurling events of The Relic and The Reliquary, but the latest mishap involving grounded up diamonds just might be the last straw. The museum powers that be, in an attempt to forestall negative publicity, decide to re-open The Tomb of Senef, which has been sealed off decades ago and long forgotten in the dank recesses of the museum. But, of course - because this is a Preston & Child production - there is a supernatural curse on the Tomb of Senef. Nora Kelly, selected to head up the exhibit, must deal with not only the Tomb's murky past and reputation, but also with the repercussions of one murdered hired hand and two more employees who've entered the Tomb and come out murderously insane. Meanwhile, Captain Hayward attempts to make sense of all the unsettling museum shenanigans. Little by little, she is coming to believe D'Agosta's assertion that Diogenes Pendergast is the main culprit behind it all, and that, furthermore, Aloysius Pendergast is innocent of his charged crime. Speaking of whom, Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast is still busy cooling his heels in the maximum security Herkmoor federal prison, but not for long, as Eli Glinn and Vince D'Acosta begin to set the stage for the agent's hoosegow breakout. Meanwhile, behind the curtain, pulling the strings and paving the way for his \\"perfect crime,\\" lurks the brilliant, amoral mastermind Diogenes.This is a damned good read, one which I polished off in one hot summer day. I had no idea museums were so interesting. Special Agent Pendergast is one of my favorite literary characters (he's kinda like what would've happened if Sherlock Holmes and Fox Mulder had a baby), and I always relish revisiting his macabre universe. I was wondering if Preston & Child could pull this one off, and, mercifully, they do, and with great style. This is a riproaring, edge-of-your-seat thriller which lives up to the quality of Preston & Child's best efforts. Several dangling plotlines left over from the previous novel(s) are gratifyingly resolved. In The Book of the Dead, we become privy to how Eli Glinn effects Agent Pendergast's escape from daunting Herkmoor, the fate of Margo Green and Constance Greene (no relation), the resolution of D'Agosta and Capt. Laura Hayward's estranged relationship... We also finally discover the terrible secret which is the source of the brothers' bitter enmity, and how it impacts Diogenes's vengeful master plan.So what're you doing still reading this? Go check the book out already."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"For those of you who have been waiting on pins and needles for Preston & Child to wrap up the Pendergast Trilogy, this book certainly couldn't have come soon enough. The trilogy began (unofficially that is) with 'Brimstone' which was one of their best books since 'The Cabinet of Curiosities', which remains my 2nd favorite novel by this amazingly talented duo. But believe it or not, they actually went one better with 'Dance of Death'. I am having a difficult time deciding which one stands above the rest (with the exception of 'Relic' which I still believe to be their masterpiece -- so far anyway).To set the stage to some degree, events in 'The Book of the Dead' began with 'Brimstone' leading us to see the emergence of Special Agent Pedergast's younger, more disturbed brother, Diongenes. His twisted mind, and how he became so demented specifically against his brother is alluded to, and finally totally explained in this novel which wraps up the trilogy, and yet sets the stage for further Pendergast tales. As 'Dance of Death' ends, Agent Pendergast is incarcerated for a series of crimes which were actually committed by Diongenes, and carefully crafted to point guilt towards his brother, with whom he has a hatred for that borders on madness. As the story picks up right after 'DoD', the largest collection of diamonds on earth have been stolen, and suddenly appear back at the Museum -- only as ground up worthless grit. Why on earth would Diongenes do something so unexplainable? As we discover soon afterwards, the firm headed by Eli Glinn, according to his most thorough predictions, Diongenes has set the stage for what he considers to be the 'Perfect Crime', but it hasn't happened -- YET. And when it does, it will make everything he has done up to this point almost pointless by comparison. So what could be worse than murder and the seemingly perfect framing of his brother? That, of course is just PART of what awaits you within this nearly flawless tale of greed, revenge and sheer thrills.Constance Green, who has been quite an enigma since she was introduced in 'The Cabinet of Curiosities' has quite a roll in the final pages. We see more of exactly why Diogenes has a hatred that seems to be bottomless, and more importantly, why specifically his anger is directed towards his brother. The opening of the near-forgotten Tomb of Senef is the stage set for the final act of Diogenes' plan for which he has spent over a decade preparing for. After some poor press at the Museum (this establishment is as unlucky as any building or person in modern fiction...) it has come to the attention of the Director that what they desperately need is something to offset everything that screams for the Museum to be shut down...hence the opening of an Egyptian tomb that hasn't seen the light of day since the 30's, and from what everyone slowly learns, it was closed for good reason. Does the so-called 'Curse' continue to this day, or has someone carefully manipulated events in such a way that all it can do is create more interest in the Tomb's opening? What about the stories of people quite suddenly going mad, are they true? And what about Agent Pendergast being stuck in a maximum security prison? How can he possibly orchestrate the capture of his brother from such isolation directed by a rogue FBI agent with an agenda all his own? All I can say is this: you get the answers to ALL these questions and just when you think the book is over...a secondary chase begins which takes us to Europe, with the most unlikely of the characters that have been introduced in the Pendergast novels. Oh, by the way, the very last line simply ensures more novels that will pick up where this one left off -- even though the storyline is pretty much tied up at the end, we haven't seen the last of Agent Pendergast, of that I am certain. Unlike many readers, it took me a while to get to really like Pendergast...but I have almost reluctantly come to be a huge fan. He definitely isn't your typical protagonist, but he certainly is one of the most original. Yet another Grand Slam from the best duo working in fictional thrillers today. ALL of their solo novels are great, but just like Lennon & McCartney's song writing talent, they just seem to work better together. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Judging by the ancillary material published with this book, co-authors Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are prolific and successful purveyors of popular pot boilers.While reading through this book, I found myself shuttling between regarding this P&C; opus as the most awful tripe (or codswallop, as some Canadians might say) and ruefully enjoying it as a guilty pleasure.Let us be clear about one thing: this is a book of no literary merit whatever. The P&C; formula clearly consists of improbable plotting, characters lifted from a better writer, undigested chunks of research material scattered throughout like raisins in a cookie, silly psychobabble notions, pointless quotations of poetry (proudly and even more pointlessly identified in an appendix) and occasional passages of laughably overwritten, absurdly high-flown material.As a ghastly example of the last, consider this:\\"Because it's time we spoke, you and I. It's the least courtesy you could pay me, after all.\\"Constance took another step, her fingers tailing along the polished wood. Then she paused. \\"Courtesy?\\"....\\"Constance,\\" he said in a quiet voice. \\"Du calme. Du calme.\\"\\"Courtesy!\\" she cried once again. \\"How dare you speak of courtesy! You murder my guardian's friends, disgrace him, tear him from this house!\\" She stopped abruptly and struggled. A soft groan rose in her throat: a moan of frustration, mingled with another, more complex emotion.The man continued to speak in a smooth undertone. \\"Please understand, Constance, I'm not here to hurt you. I'm restraining you simply to prevent harm to myself.\\"She struggled again. \\"Hateful man!\\" [Pages 86-87 of the paperback edition]I suggest that such dialogue is truly suitable in only two places: about halfway through the novel \\"Frankenstein,\\" or in a Monty Python sketch. I laughed and groaned simultaneously, when I stumbled upon it.And then there is that ever-memorable motif that pops up again and again: \\"Draaaaag-thump. Draaaaag-thump.\\"As for the lifted characters, can anybody possibly doubt that the lethally battling Pendergast brothers are other than Ersatz Holmes and Pseudo Moriarty, updated hardly a whit, and deposited improbably in the 21st Century?There is doubtlessly a thesis to be mined by some industrious doctoral candidate-drone from P&C;'s lunatic plotting. Constrained by word-length requirements, I'll touch on no more than a jailbreak scenario that is considerably less convincing that the escapes orchestrated from Colonel Klink's stalag by Hogan's Heroes, a diabolical master plan, devised and carried out by the Moriarty-clone, that must have been lifted straight out of the Joker's Gotham City playbook, and a conclusion that all too obviously harks back to a very famous literary precedent, one that will be almost too painfully obvious to virtually anyone who reads it.Speaking of that conclusion, it comes as a painfully over-extended anti-climax. The book ends properly and perfectly obviously with the conclusion of Chapter 66 on page 496. The book then abruptly changes direction and staggers on for another sixteen chapters--101 pages!--to a second and much lesser finale. If P&C; had only a speck less of hack in their collective make-up and an additional speck of art, they might have realized that their second ending, needed or not, would have been better served had it been presented as a one-page kicker.Finally, there is the matter of tone and style. Throughout the book I experienced odd feelings of familiarity that I could not quite place--particularly with the often repeated introductions of characters with their identifying tags: \\"Agent Pendergast,\\" or \\"Captain of Homicide Laura Hayward\\" or Dr. Adrian Wicherly.\\" It finally occurred to me that such things were characteristic of the old network radio crime dramas. \\"The Book of the Dead,\\" I realized, owes as much to \\"The Green Hornet\\" and \\"The Shadow\\" as to \\"The Final Problem.\\"This lumpy confection really ought to get two disdainful stars, but I am forced to admit that it has just enough guilty pleasure in it to raise it up to the proud status of a full-fledged mediocrity, so ... three stars."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This book was billed as the capper to the Pendergast series, when all of the plot threads left by \\"Dance of Death\\" would be neatly sewed up. Much to my delight, the authors were apparently seduced into keeping things going. Not to give the plot away, but I doubt that we've seen the last of Diogenes, and the last sentence in the book just screams \\"continuation.\\"Not that I mind. I'll be anxiously awaiting the next installment. After being sorely disappointed in \\"Brimstone,\\" but enthralled with \\"Dance of Death,\\" I can say with certainty that this book is the best of the three. I have criticized Preston and Childs for being poor \\"finishers\\" in several previous novels, but that is decidedly not the case in this one.Highly recommended, but read the other two noted books first, along with \\"Cabinet of Curiousities.\\""},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Good thing this is a written review, eh?I got the book this morning, and I just finished it. It is AWESOME! All the books in the Pendergast Cycle, by that I mean all since the original book entitled \\"The Relic\\", have been brilliant. (\\"Reliquary\\" was the low point, but it was still superior to most other books in the genre and related genres.) This was a spectacular culmination of all the previous works.I don't want to give anything away, and so I must cut this review shorter than I'd like. Suffice it to say, no one will be disappointed. If they are, then they're square. No, really. The book is wildly entertaining, intriguing, and amazing.

The \\"Diogenes\\" trilogy.Extremely well written, and eloquently poised, the imagery and characterizations blend to create the perfect thriller. Preston and Child contribute the perfect combination of talent, to be indistinguishable as more than one author.Agent Pendergast and the collaborating cast of characters are so real, so carefully created, that they bring to life the story, and draw you into the reality of the novels. The obviously well documented, and researched background information gives a vivid backdrop to the plot and your imagination builds the elaborate scenes for every location.I will be buying more of the authors' past books and will be eagerly anticipating more of the Pendergast saga as it unfolds.HIGHLY recommended reading, you won't be disappointed.

Put them by your reading chair, but do not open them.Clear your calendar--call in sick, take vacation days, whatever you need to do. Check for sufficient provisions for several days--whatever your reading food of choice is.

With new twists at every turn, this book will keep you guessing, right through the end."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Hey, here's a shocker for everyone complaining about this book: It is NOT a stand-alone novel! You see, what happens when you read only the third book in a trilogy is that you might not understand everything that is going on. That is why it is wise to start trilogies from the beginning.Preston and Child can't be expected to fully develop characters they've been showcasing in novels for the past 10 years or so every time they begin a novel. Seasoned fans know when Pendergast has made his appearance in a book, and new readers shouldn't start here anyway.If The Book of the Dead was recommended to you by a friend, go buy The Cabinet of Curiosities instead and begin there. Relic and Reliquary are decent enough reads, but the truly amazing stuff begins in Cabinet."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Preston and Childs deliver another good story.

After savoring so many previous efforts, \\"Book of the Dead\\" is like reading a bad novel by an acolyte author. It is everything previous Preston/Child novels are not - predictable, formulaic and uninspired. Sure, there are occasional flashes of technical and storytelling brilliance, but they are few and far between. I suspect this gifted writing duo was pressured into writing faster than they prefer, were too busy doing other things, or have grown weary of their characters. Let's hope future books return to the suspense, subtlety and craftsmanship for which Preston/Child are rightly praised."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Child and Preston have delivered another thriller ride with movie success written all over it. The Book of the Dead was a page turner from the opening. As an editor I insist on justice being rendered to every word, but the tempo of this novel had me flying through page after page. I also must disagree that this can be a standalone novel. For the most enjoyment, all the Pendergast books need to be read in order. This from a logical analytical mind point of view. So start with Relic and read them all. Watch SA Pendergast grow. You won't be disappointed.Previous reviews have elaborated about the content, so I won't. Suffice it to say, Aloysius Pendergast isn't your normal hero. Although this has been billed as the last of a trilogy -- because of the denouement between protagonist and antagonist -- there is still much more to tell. And so much more can be expanded on with the other characters. I hope our authors do this."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Diabolical Diogenes outdoes himself. The book reveals the abysmal depth of his madness and despair. I would have liked to see more direct reference to Special Agent Pendergast, as I so enjoyed him in the authors' other books. Here, he is peripheral to the real drama of the story and did not appear much, and one has to really draw on memory of prior books to connect with the character. Nonetheless, it is a page turner that practically reads itself, I easily finished it in one day. On par with Brimstone and Dance of Death, but falls just a little short of Relic, which I think is the author's best thus far."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I was alittle afraid that the theme was over used as good and evil( Aloysius vs. Diogenes) went head to head again,but true to form Preston and Child provide readers with an excellent story.

As the book was building to a climax I couldn't put it down. It definitely kept my interest and I finished over half the book in one night. The suspense kept me going.... The serial killer's past ,present and future made for one interesting reading experience. I highly recommend this and I look forward to reading other novels by these authors."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"When these two authors collaborate,readers are in for a treat. This so-called trilogy of novels involving FBI agent Aloysius Pendergast ends (or does it?) with this fast moving book. The loose ends that were left hanging in Brimstone and Dance of Death are purposefully tied up. Without giving away the plot, our protagonist, Agent Pendergast, has his final showdown with his evil brother, Diogenes, in a volcanic island near Sicily. Aloysius, however, is not the one who does his tormented brother in. It's a surpirse plot twist that reverberates right through to the very end of the book and leaves things open for still another Pendergast-based novel. Run, don't walk, to your library or book store and get a copy of this book for your summer reading. You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Another enjoyable romp with the cast of characters from \\"The Cabinet of Curiosity\\" Preston and Childs are paralleling the career of the worlds' greatest detective and shuffling names a bit. Sherlocks' brother Mycroft belonged to the Diogenes Club and his great adversary was thrown over the Falls. All of this gets worked into the Pendergast Saga in fun forms. Fans of Conan Doyle will be delighted, but those who can't see through the veil will be a bit confused. It is still a great read and promises future amusment as well. Once again the joy is in the details, the poetry, the wine, the locations, and the ambience of a glorious pair of literary lights at the top of their form."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Just finished the book today and am still digesting everything that went on, as a lot gets answered while new questions are raised. I agree with the other reviewers that while this book can be read itself, it becomes much more enjoyable if you've read at least Brimstone and Dance of Death, if not all of P/C's books. I gave it four stars as opposed to five because it was not as good as the aforementioned novels, but it was a great read nonetheless. If you are a P/C fan you know you will have trouble putting this one down.Without spoiling anything, this time around the Event is revealed and sheds light on Aloysius and shows some of his flaws as an adolescent. There's D'Agosta and the prison break, and its always good to see Eli Glinn and EES in action, if only briefly. The same goes for Smithback who gets less time here than in previous novels, as the focus is on Diogenes as well as Constance. We also are treated to a brief appearance of Special Agent Coffey. And of course there is the Tomb and the Museum and its ever rising body count.I must say the book ended entirely different from what I expected which is a credit to the authors for not doing the obvious. P/C have done it once again, and this one meets the high standard set by their previous work. I am already anticipating the next one. Highly recommended. Buy it now!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I think this was the one that came a little damaged, though well packaged. Its fine, all things considered. It was a little slow, but in well before the allotted time. This will be well loved by the time it is retired."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"A fine read that concludes the Pendergast trilogy. This was my first read in the series but it made enough sense with the hints and backstory. By far the best part was the escape from a maximum prison facility. The ending and the fate of the villain was disappointing for a number of reasons (no spoilers). There are a lot of sub tales taking place and most of them revolve around the NY museum but that's okay, especially if you like Egyptian History and all its mysteries. Pendergast is a compelling character and probably the main one in the series but he seems to have equal screen time compared to some of the other main characters. WHEN READ: July to August 2010; OVERALL GRADE: B."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The Book of the Dead is worthy being the finale and conclusion of the Diogenes trilogy ! It carried over the excitement from the previous Dance of Death and builds up to an mouth-watering conclusion . Maybe the only negative part was how the final fight comes about , but that is a minor glitch . Overall a wonderful read , and I finished it in one day !!!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I discovered Preston and Child not too long ago, and I am now in love! The Pendergast series has been my favorite...I couldn't put this last book down. Pendergast is like a modern day Sherlock. Kept me engrossed from the very beginning, the short chapters gave it a fast move, which I always love. Just wanted to keep turning those pages. Enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the characters and surroundings, colorful visuals... as good as watching a movie."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I have to confess I prefer Preston & Child's stand-alone novels to their Pendergast series, which leaves me going against the popular grain, ha ha. Having said that, The Book Of The Dead is a great thriller. I really enjoyed the evil brother, his evil plot, and his evil techno tricks. Other characters like Smithback and Nora Kelly are also very engaging. The Egyptian background is fascinating.As for Agent Pendergast himself, I'm still not sure why I haven't warmed to this guy. It might be because he's so stiff. I understand this is supposed to be his appeal, that he's a super genius, but I just don't feel any connection to him. Fortunately, the rest of the story more than carried the day.Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This was the book that introduced me to Preston & Child and most importantly Aloyisius Pendergast!! I've been hooked ever since!!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This author is terrific. I can hardly wait to purchase more of these novels. The details are amazing and the storyline is mesmerizing."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I am a great fan of Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child, especially the Agent Pendergast books. This book is a great ending to the feud between the two brothers. A must read for anyone with siblings!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I'm rating this book a 5 star book, however, it's not as good as the last one I read, \\"Dance of \\". I do think the book is great...but I do know that Preston and Child have written better. You won't regret reading this book though and I highly recommend it. It will reveal some secrets that have left us hanging about Pentergast and his evil brothers past."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"A couldn't wait to read this third in a series book about Pendergast and his brother. It is action packed and I couldn't put it down till I finished. Preston and Childs are great with keeping you on edge and this does it perfectly. A must read."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Lincold Child and Douglas Preston have hit another home run with Book of the Dead. They hooked me with Relic back in the 90's, and I've been an avid reader of all their works ever since. Year after year, they continue to produce compelling stories that are crafted so well that each new book is almost impossible to put down. The dishes remain dirty in the sink. The dog gets ignored. The mail piles up in the mailbox until the last page is finally read.Book of the Dead is no exception. Every chapter builds on the suspense and tension of the previous one until things are flying along and you're desperate to read the next page. There are surprising revelations, great twists and a couple of real surprises along the way.Preston & Child are two of the best storytellers writing today. Do not miss out on the ride they offer every time you open one of their books.John R. Bruning"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"So I have to be honest, the beginning was very confusing to me. Perhaps it is because this was the first book I read out of the series. Nevertheless, after the initial shock of numerous characters and scenes, I fought the urge to continue reading and I'm so glad that I did. This book is a master piece! It is jam packed and full of excitement, adventure, and knowledge. My only disappointment was the ending but as a writer myself, I understand that everyone can't be pleased. Overall, it is a great novel indeed."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I'm addicted to these two authors. Another fast, fun read. I love the museum setting, with some science and history thrown in."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This is a well written and very exciting book that I would recommend to anyone who has an interest in Ancient Egypt and Suspense."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Yet another great Special Agent Pendergast thriller. Preston/Child have created one of the oddest and most entertaining heroes in the mystery genre. Looking forward to many more stories."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The Book of the Dead is the third book in Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child's \\"Diogenes\\" trilogy, the seventh book featuring the fantastic Special Agent Pendergast, and the eleventh book overall that these two writers have worked together on and it picks up shortly after Dance of Death (the previous book).Special Agent Pendergast sits in prison for crimes he didn't commit, D'Agosta suspended from the police force and facing a disciplinarian hearing for his role in the previous book, Constance teetering on the verge of a breakdown, Margo still in the hospital; all victims of Pendergast psychotic brother's Machiavellian plans for global revenge.Therein lies the first problem with this book, it is not a complete story; to have any idea as to what's going on you have to have read the previous two books (Brimstone, and Dance of Death). This wasn't a problem for me but newcomers beware; this is NOT the place to start in this series.The second problem is that, being a fan of their work, I expected so much more from this book. Cabinet of Curiosities and Still Life with Crows are the two best in the entire series and, I admit it, I was spoiled by them. They are the two that the others must compare to and Book of the Dead just doesn't hold up. The surprises weren't surprising, the plots didn't seem all that impressive, and the ending was too obvious for my taste (I knew what the last two words of the book would be less than 100 pages in).The final problem is that, as a character, Diogenes just isn't very interesting. His motivations, his history, his scheme for revenge, his trophy trunk, his childhood trauma etc... None of it really seems to work to make him a worth adversary for Pendergast or an interesting villain in general. In fact Diogenes penchant for failure basically renders Pendergast a superfluous character for 90% of the book.In spite of all of those negative comments there are some really good moments in this book and, if you read the other two, it is worth the read. It is an action packed story that keeps you turning the pages, the scenes with Pendergast in the prison are fantastic (I don't want to spoil anything but the final prison scenes are genius), Laura Hayward steals quite a bit of the show as the tough as nails homicide captain trying to find the truth, and seeing Special Agent Coffey finally get his comeuppance was worth the entire book.Finally, the last 100 pages (with the exception of the last chapter) were a fantastic globe hopping, cat and mouse game that made up for a lot of the failings. I wish that last 100 pages could have been the basis of the entire book because everything you expect from the P & C books are there in force; suspense, surprises, twist, turns, you name it... But there just wasn't enough."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This book starts off slow till about the middle and then steamrolls to the end. Fans that read the prior books will not be disappointed. Newcomers to the series should read at least the prior book (Game of Death) to get a full appreciation of this work.Eli Glinn from The Ice Limit, plays a prominent part in the book as well as Constance (Pendergast's ward). We finally learn what caused Diogennes to become the evil opposite of Pendergast. Once again the NY Museum of Natural History is the focal point of the story, with its assortment of employee murders, which makes one wonder why anyone would be brave enough to work there?The book does have an interesting twist at the end which suggests that the authors will be planning more Pendergast tales."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The first book was incredible and the second book of the series was equally mesmerizing but this book bored me to tears. The main character was incarcerated it seemed for half the book. Way too much time was spent on the details of Egyptology. The book had some good parts but even the ending fizzled out and was not worth drudging through all of the tedious details that in my opinion only served as filler to add pages to the book. Save yourself the time and aggravation and stop after the first two books..."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I have read all of their books. I strongly recommend that you read the earlier books in the Pendergast trilogy.Having said that I am more than ready for something different. I feel like we have fallen into a rut where we have another big opening at the museum, another bunch of dead city celebs, and another master crime. It seems we have done this a couple of times now.The blood feud between the brothers comes to a conclusion. (Great can we get back to monsters like THE RELIC?) I don't regret reading this book. It is well written, and many questions are answered."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The funny thing about this book is actually the plethora of great reviews it got/is getting on this site. This book is not at all bad, but then again it's not at all good either. The problem with the book is that is basically the definition of average in a novel. It's hard to rant and rave about this book and Preston/Child if you've read other mystery/thriller/suspense books by other authors that were so much better. All in all, this book is too average to get higher than a three rating and I'd imagine it would be good for an aiport layover or a long drive, not to keep you absolutely enthralled."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Brilliant, scary page turner. Let your imagination go wild reading this excellent thriller. Preston & Child have created another entertaining novel. I'm sorry we'll have to wait for another Agent Prendergast novel."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"THE BOOK OF THE DEAD brings the trilogy of Aloysius Pendergast and his demonic brother, Diogenes, to a startling conclusion. As in the previous novels, Child and Preston serve up a humdinger of a plot, fraught with gory murders, supernatural undertones and breakneck action and suspense. The characters continue to be richly drawn, with some surprise twists and a frightening sequence in the museum's new Egyptian display. You'd be more involved if you've read the two novels leading up to this one, but you can still enjoy the book nonetheless.One of the strongest features of a Preston/Child book is its cinematic quality. You can just see this book on the big screen. The horrible secret of the two brothers' youth is finally revealed and it gives some kind of motivation for both brothers' life choices. More is given too on the enigmatic Constance Greene. Nora Kelly, Bill Smithback, Vincent D'agosta, Margo Green, Hugo Menzies---they're all back and I only hope we get more Pendergast stories in the future. A great read folks!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Another great read and thrilling conclusion to the trilogy. This set of books is nestled within a series containing Special Agent Pendergast. For greatest enjoyment, I recommend reading at least these three books in order: 1- Brimstone, 2- Dance of Death, and 3- The Book of the Dead."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Jyst what you expect from a Preston & Child book. Packed with action and surprises at every turn. I can't wait to read the next book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Book arrived in good condition. Preston and Child just do not disappoint. Diogenes trilogy thriller that can stand on its own. You won't want to put it down. Print not too small to tire the eyes for long reads. Ship time just barely acceptable."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I picked this book up on a whim. I read the back cover and thought, \\"hmm, seems interesting.\\" When I got home and began reading it, I was hooked from Chapter 1. This was the first book by Preston and Child that I have ever read. It launched me on my path of addiction to the Pendergast series. I backtracked and read the previous novels starring Agent Pendergast and then went on to read all the others. Preston and Child are a truly great combination. I highly recommend their books, especially the ones featuring Agent Pendergast."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The Pendergast series is one of the most entertaining I've read in years. Preston and Child make a good team. There story thread follows through without confusion."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"As usual you can't put the book down and you're always surprised.The charactersare great and the suspense is incredible. I can't imagine what it must belike living with either author or how two people could have such talentedand unusual ideas."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Whenever I sit down and get started on a Preston and Child novel, I have some basic expectations: the characters will speak at a level most people don't hear on a daily basis; there will be some element of the supernatural or spiritual; and there will be intrigue that, even if implausible, draws you into the world Preston and Child so carefully craft. Book of the Dead is no exception.While some aspects of the story are difficult to believe - including the science behind the main event - there's enough detail present in the writing (and, indeed, the writing is exceptional) to allow the reader to suspend their disbelief and just go with it. Not having read the previous two Diogenes novels (Relic and Reliquary, I believe) may have left me with a bit of a disadvantage as there were references to previous events. P & C state that their novels can be read as stand-alones, and that may be the case, but I'd still recommend knowing the backstory before diving into Book of the Dead.While not a front-of-the-line psychological thriller, I did find the description of the \\"Event\\" that leads to our main conflict to be incredibly chilling and disturbing. I wouldn't recommend reading this while alone in a house in the mountains that you don't really know."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I feel like all my reviews for the Pendergast series are starting to sound the same, I'm gushing as if in love about how fantastic the books are but its still true, this story is phenomenal and it makes you want to read another and another, this could easily have thirty volumes and I would still want to read them all, as usual this book reads smooth as silk while the action cuts like a knife.The Book of The Dead is the standard great stuff that one would expect from the insightful and intelligent duo, their stories breathe a life of their own and to me they feel different than other novels. Our world is filled with books, one can find them everywhere but whenever I read a Pendergast novel I feel as if I was holding something of heft and value, there is knowledge in these pages; ancient cultures, science, architecture, folklore and mysticism, curses, artifacts and it all sounds real enough to touch and some of it is but I especially adore all the breathtaking characters both good and bad and some in-between, in my opinion they are invaluable to the books. I guess they speak to me, true love haha... Pendergast lives in my mind beyond the pages of the book, that's how great he is.The third in the Diogenes Pendergast trilogy and seventh in the Aloysius Pendergast series ( I highly recommend starting with Relic, Pendergast#1) story continues on the wild hunt to catch and expose the elusive Diogenes who is conveniently presumed to be dead by everyone but the small circle of our heroes. The Queen of Narnia, The Heart of Eternity, The Indigo Ghost, Ultima Thule, The Fourth of July, The Zanzibar Green and of course Lucifer's Heart, all precious diamonds that were stole in the last installment are destroyed by Diogenes and arrive pulverized into a rainbow colored snow to the museum as a final act of madness and show of power. The previous book was simply fantastic and it exposed Diogenes' identity but only to the reader, the entire museum still has no idea that not only is Diogenes alive but his secret identity is walking right under their noses. To make matters worse, Aloysius Pendergast is in a top security prison and everyone that has always been jealous of him is gunning for the guy to go down, he deals with that brilliantly, boy that was fun! Even though Aloysius is locked up he is the only one who can match up against his evil and twisted genius of a brother, their journey takes them half way through the globe and back.My personal favorite part of the tale was the prison sequence, well pretty much all of it, I don't want to spoil anything but what happens to Pendergast in the prison is nuts. I read all the parts while holding my breath, some I had to re-read because they were simply too good to only read once. Ingenious and stunning, no deus-ex machina way out of this puppy! Lots of stuff happens, there is also the museum exhibit with a tomb that appears to be cursed, madness and mayhem breaks out as usual, lovers of museum thrillers will have a ball with the Tomb of Senef and those who love Pendergast will gobble up everything he does and says. I was finally impressed with Constance, I never really gave her much thought before but through this book she became another strong contender for future stories and my dear Vincent D'Agosta, he was wonderful as was Laura Hayward. For some reason Laura Linney ( the actress) kept popping into my head when Hayward's scenes came up, she was something, the woman can hold her own.This was such a tremendous journey with the two brothers that I'm not sad to see it over because I'm really looking forward to the next chapter, the next book sounds quite potent and meaty and I might need a bit of a break to let my brain prepare for another greatness of Preston and Child. I don't read them back to back on purpose as much as I really want to, after all it's not good to eat dessert three times a day, same with books, I save the good stuff to be savored when I'm really in the mood for greatness.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Became interested in Ancient Egypt as I was researching info. for my 6th grade sp. needs student. While I was trying to find more books at their level, came across this one on Amazon and ordered it. It was worth every penny. It brought all those \\"difficult\\" names into my reality as if they were current. The intrique of the story and the facts so amazing that it was a challenge not to put the book down when I needed to do so. It also seems that even if I hadn't become interested in Ancient Egypt, this would still have been a book difficult to put down. It does take place in NY during the present."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I've just finished the BOTD 5 minutes ago so it's quite fresh in my mind.A very good typical book from Preston and Child. Spoilers ahead.Why are they good? They are good because they are very good at providing a chilling and scary backdrop. Their stories are scary, period. It kept me up til 5am last night until my eyelids could no longer keep up against gravity. It's just like a good horror movie, only in book form. The museum is a great setting for them, so they keep going back to it as you can't ask for anything better. I used to close up buildings for a living at night, if Preston Child had been around then, I don't know if I'd have kept my job.Alright, so why doesn't it get a 5 star rating? Problem are the Pendergast brothers, especially Diogenes. I think the trilogy is a mistake because you always know who or what the adversary is: Diogenes. Whereas in the stand alone books, you don't know what the adversary is, and the book keeps you guessing and biting your fingernails. It's a mistake to write from Diogenes' POV because, like the cliche, familiarity breeds contempt. You are no longer scared of him once you see how he works and thinks.I do have a problem with Diogenes setting the whole Tomb of Senef thing up. That kind of work requires special knowledge, and I don't see how or where he can acquire it, what with having to seduce you know who and all that. And how's he gonna get all that stuff installed with everyone there. More omnipotent stuff.Same thing with Aloysius, since an unkillable, omnipotent, omnipresent character is what I call lazy writing - you can make him do anything, no need to think. Don't know how to finish the chapter? No problemo, Special Agent Pendegast shows up in the locked room, kills the bad guy, saves the girl, end of problem. But I forgive Preston and Child since I'm still favorably disposed towards SA Pendegast at this point.Now that I know Smithback is cool, I rather like him as it creates a subplot.A pregnancy? Oh no, can't we stop beating this to death and go to a stand alone book?Overall, still quite a good book for 80% of it. However, this book is not a 5 star for me, but 4 or 4.5 stars.PS, I'm migrating this review from my old account to my new one."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This is the latest book in the series featuring Agent Pendergast, and the final book in the Diogenes trilogy. As I've said before, Pendergast, in my opinion, is one of the greatest literary heroes ever created, and I certainly was not disappointed in The Book of the Dead. In fact, Pendergast, having been through so much in the previous book, Dance of Death, becomes an even more complex character and actually shows his more vulnerable side. Secrets are finally revealed about his relationship with Diogenes, and we finally find out about the \\"Event\\", a memory that Pendergast has long suppressed, and something that absolutely chilled me to the bone. It remains the best book I have read all year. For fans of Preston and Child, this is a can't miss book, but for new readers, it's still a thrilling tale worth reading."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are masters of suspense! Great book - hard to put down! I love Agent Pendergast!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I was somewhat let down by this one, after the other books in the series. I expected it to go out with more of a bang. Still, these authors entertain by educating readers, and they certainly do that here. I wish the characters were a bit richer and the plot a bit less rambling, but, you know, there are a lot of worse books out there (I know that's an awful endorsement of any book and I don't mean it as harshly as it sounds). I enjoyed this one, for the most part, while I was reading it; I guess it just isn't as memorable as I'd have like it to be. I'll keep reading Preston and Child's books with hopes they go back to the snappier style of their earlier stories."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Once again the team have written a book that one can not putdown, that is until you get to page 183, pages 183 to 214 are missing, replaced by pages 311-342, there is no sign of the missing pages anywhere in the book, did I get the one in a million book,"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"It's still a Preston/Child book, and I love Pendergast and all the characters, but this book wasn't as good to me. I will explain what I didn't like. The \\"Event\\" reminded me too much of Malin Hatch from RIPTIDE and his brother's death. And the psychotic light-show as Diogenes' big finale didn't wow me at all. Viola Maskalene lost her attraction, being more flat and boring a character in this book. And all the time spent in the prison bored me to tears - come on, we all KNOW Pendergast's breaking out. This novel lacked the atmosphere of the others. I love the NY museum setting, and I love Egyptology, but it felt contrived here. The backgrounds were hollow and other characters entries seemed gratuitous, while Diogenes & Constance stole center stage in this installment. I don't even remember Constance Green being featured very prominently in Cabinet of Curiosities. And Diogenes wasn't as scary anymore. As usual, the pages turn quickly and the excitement builds. Of the three Pendergast novels, I really liked BRIMSTONE best, and DANCE OF DEATH a close second, BOOK OF DEATH third. This one just lacked atmosphere for me and also I was disappointed in the revealing truth of what happened to the brothers. But their writing is still better than many and I will continue reading their novels. I admired their sentence about a new James Rollins book, whose book AMAZONIA scared the willies out of me. It's great to see talented authors so secure and confident like that."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Agent Pendergast returns and although he and his friends tie up all of the loose ends from the previous two books, I'm really missing an original plot line with even a couple of new characters. It's a must read for anyone hooked on his relationship with his brother and this book does answer all the questions,including how his brother got that way. I'm really hoping for another \\"Cabinet of curiousities\\" or \\"Still Life with crows in the future, something with a new plot idea.\\""},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This book is awful! It's 'Silence of the Lambs' meets 'Dark Shadows' meets Ann Rice's witches' series - with none of the originality of any of them. The characters are ridiculous stereotypes from soap operas and cop shows. Their names are hard enough to swallow, but their actions stretch the suspension of disbelief. Come one, \\"Aloysius and Diogenes Pendergast!\\" An FBI agent who lives in mansion, complete with a dungeon? Ancestors who lived on the brink of madness and genius? It's just really an awful, awful book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Another to add to the \\"never read another book by this author\\" pile. Pure clich&eacute;.In their defense, this was the first of their books I read and may have missed the character development. That would not have saved the book from the cookie-cutter clich&eacute;s of the modern book though."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I fell in love with this 2 guys(as writers)when they wrote Relic.Since then I couldn't wait for another book to come out.Agent Pendergast got me hook so bad.Idea and skill and touch is 3thing I see when I read fiction.I know for sure Preston-Child got this 3 thing beautifuly."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I read all the books these two fellas put out, but this want was not their best. From the 'Haunted Tomb' to the struggle by the Volcano, it just played too much like a Scooby-Doo cartoon.Hoping for a better Pendergast mystery next time."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Preston/Child books are somewhat evil: you buy them and... you're done reading the whole thing the night after the purchase. Their Pendergast stories are quite a page-turners. One thing that started to bother me though is that with every new book they keep repeating the same stuff over and over again. Not to mention that the whole Viola plot is just downright ridiculous. Personally, I still think that The cabinet of curiosities was the best Pendergast book, but I will definitely go and grab the Wheel of Darkness as soon as I can. Addiction is a hard thing to fight:)"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The previous two installments of the Pendergast-Bros Trilogy had been found wanting - in both originality and density. The basic story did not seem to hold much substance and, thus, repeated dilutions and page-fluffing elongated a one-book story into a Trilogy.However, this is indeed the best of the three. If not for anything but for the culmination of the story and the tidying of loose ends.Of course this is not saying much: the can surely write; they can surely keep building the tension of a thriller without ever loosing their rhythm - but, let's face it: how many times are they going to redo THE RELIC? The Museum is so overused, every time they mention it we know someone is bound to get killed in some long-forgotten subbasement...Let's hope they decide to do the long awaited sequel to THE ICE LIMIT they left unfinished.PS:***SPOILER***Odds are we are not done with Diogenes...Not very imaginative (temporary) demise either: Arthur Conan Doyle had used it with Professor Moriarty and they are called \\"hidden cliffhangers\\" since."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I think this is the best of the books running from 'Crows' on. This book didn't drag in any chapters, and the old Pendergast reappeared where he was missing somewhat in Brimstone and Dance of Death. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Book of the Dead is a perfect ending to a great triolgy of books, the started with Brimstone and Dance of Death. I highly recommend reading those before starting this one, each book basically continues from where the previous one left off in a cliffhanger fashion. The Book of the Dead continues with Pendergast battling his evil brother Diogenes, and it continues to be compelling. Dance of Death was probably more exciting than this book, but I found this book to just be more interesting. It reveals alot about the characters, and you learn more about a certain girl who is shrouded in mystery. She plays a pivotal role in this book, and it ends in a bang. You honestly can't go wrong with these books, they once again show why they are the masters of mystery."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I have been a huge fan of the dynamic duo of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Every novel written by this duo is way above the average beach/summer read and even better than most of the techno-thrillers in terms of believability. But ever since the Pendargast trilogy began to unfurl, I have grown restless because despite being a die-hard fan of Special Agent Aloysius Pendargast, I longed for return to the \\"Relic\\" era, when Pendargast was one of the major force behind the novel, not the only novel, as has been in the last three works. Most importantly, I thought that maybe this work would round-off this \\"family affair\\", but the last sentence of the novel obliterated that hope. Neverthless, this book is essential for all Preston-Child fans, esp. those who have read the \\"Dance of Death\\". Enjoy it, maybe with that small misgiving."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I like the way Doug and Lincoln completed the series. They added all the good elements I like in their novels including a creepy museum atmosphere and a mystery of who or what was driving people crazy. Was it a curse? A chemical? A disease? My only complaint was that there was no icky bug, but the story was good enough that it wasn't needed. I think they did an outstanding job of tying up loose ends and bringing the story to an exciting conclusion. And, some things I suspected turned out like I thought but there were a few surprises too.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Preston and Childs wrap up the \\"Pendergast trilogy\\" with an addictive novel that shows all their strengths: complex plotting; interesting people and backgrounds; and, a rare gift, the ability to layer in fascinating detail without slowing the pace of the story.As a science and history writer, I know something about the effort that good research demands, and the work diplayed here makes my head hurt just thinking about it. From the look of exotic locales to the details of making your own explosives, there is something for every reader to learn here while enjoying the well-paced, absorbing story.There are always quibbles. I would have preferred that Agent Pendergast's brother/adversary, Diogenes, meet an unambigious death rather than a \\"fell-over-the-cliff\\" demise that reminds me of Sherlock Holmes' plunge over the falls. And when the museum was setting up for its big gala, I kept waiting for some character to object, reminding everyone how terrible things went the last time they threw a big gala (in the novel Relic).These are minor objections, though. When I started this novel, I was literally unable to put it down until it was done. Preston and Childs have indeed done it again."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"If you're a Preston & Child fan, you will be hooked from page one.

However, don't think this is the final installment,,,,the authors leave the reader with a blockbuster of an ending that will keep you counting the days until the next release . This novel has it all : plot twists, attempted jail breaks, and seemingly hopeless cliffhangers . Personally, I literally couldn't put this novel down until I was more than three quarters of the way through . The action and excitement are non-stop ."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This has been a fine series of books! Hopefully, as the end indicates there will be another! This writing team is VERY entertaining! (In the can't put it down catagory)-The Book of the Dead was a great read!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I have read every single book by the duo and I can honestly say that this book is terrible. Possibly the worst one from the duo. Other than the prison break portion, everything else was just awful. (If you like prison break, read \\"Dirty White Boys\\" by Stephen Hunter)What the hell happened to Douglas and Lincoln? Where is the imagination and the flow of Riptide, Ice Limit and Relic?I can't believe I bought this at hard cover price. If you are a fan of the duo, borrow this from the library. It's not worth the paperback price."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"After stumbling over a weak and silly plot in Brimstone, the authors recovered nicely in Dance of Death, and now has brought the trilogy home to an-almost flawless conclusion in Book of the Dead. From the moment Pendergast busted out of Herkmoor prison, this fantastic and horrifying tale held me enthralled. The book features wild action, the \\"gotta-love-him\\" journalist Smithback, interesting tidbits involving Egyptology, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and plenty of fun technical information (dynamite, anyone?). I could not put this book down and read it over two days (\\"sorry, honey, the dishes aren't done and nothing's cooking on the stove\\"). Note: this novel is not \\"stand-alone\\"; start with Cabinet of Curiosities, Brimstone, and Dance of Death. Book of the Dead is definitely my favorite in the Pendergast series.Nevertheless, the book sagged in some points. (1) The opening gala museum story is a retread, and after what happened in previous books, you'd think no New Yorker with a lick of sense would ever attend one again. (2) Despite the tension between Diogenes and Pendergast building over three books, Pendergast was inexplicably relegated to bystander in the final face-off. (3) The reason given for Diogenes hating his brother seemed too soft to cause a lifetime of homicidal psychosis. Granted the Event itself scarred young D in more ways than one, but his brother's role in it seemed relatively benign. (4) A sheltered, nervous woman suddenly morphs into a commando in the final chapters, capable of tracking a diabolical villain halfway around the world in two days. Even allowing for \\"hell hath no fury...\\" it was too big of a stretch to believe that she could expertly ambush him on a city street or start blowing bullets into his bay windows. (5) The closing sentence was pitifully soap-opera-ish. Please tell me this isn't the direction the authors are going to head the series in. Just the thought of this extraordinary, super-cool FBI agent reduced to a homebody with a baby sucking on his shoelaces makes me want to reach for the Advil. How disappointing that P&C; managed the novel's multiple gut-wrenching ordeals with the finesse of a slick juggling act only to drop the ball on the reader's toe in the final page.Despite the weaknesses, I'm addicted and when the next Pendergast novel comes out, I'll be first in line. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Read the other books first. That is sound advice repeated through these reviews. This story is interesting and brings a lot of old friends from previous books together for a jolly romp through the dark recesses of a supposedly cursed tomb. Are there any that aren't? You will enjoy it much more if you are familiar with the characters. I have grown fond of them and enjoyed, for the most part, seeing them in action again.One of the joys of Lincoln and Child's earlier books is that you always came away with knowledge of some arcane subject. They are educational and more readable as a result. This one was not so edifying, but rounded out the series nicely.There were some plot holes. The 'Event' a life changing childhood experience of cosmic proportions, is pretty lame when you finally find out the circumstances. This 'Event' is pivotal in the development of the two main protagonists, one an almost saintly cross between Sherlock Holmes and 007. And his evil brother, brilliant monster, part Hannibal Lecter, part Moriarty. As children they discover a box that someone thoughtfully stored in the cellar, 'fully loaded' as it were. Not wishing to spoil anything, suffice to say that it is a stretch to think that anyone would want to keep their mad old uncle Comstock's, gaudily painted, suicide machine in the cellar. But parents who name their children Diogenes and Aloysius are probably questionable anyway.As with previous works, the Museum of natural history in NYC is the backdrop for most of the story.The Museum and a grand gathering of glittering celebrities has been worked to death in this series. There must be a fresher vehicle for the action than retreading the dusty halls of this fine old institution.Hopefully the series will continue, these books are always welcome diversions and the few suspensions of disbelief are worth it for the overall adventure. Read the earlier works, then enjoy the Book of the Dead."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Although the pacing was a little slow in some parts, especially those dealing wtih Pendergast getting out of prison, all told I liked how the authors put this book together.Book of the Dead has all the usual elements in this series, fast action, interesting story and setting, and mostly likable characters. But what I liked most was that, for once, the ending was not too crazy or involving, as literary types sometimes say, deus ex machina. There were some things that were far-fetched, like Constance being able to track down Diogenes as well as she did, that were not adequately explained, but Ive come to expect that.Overall, I was satisfied with the story and enjoyed my time reading it. I was about ready to toss in the towel on this series after several ridiculous plot-twists in earlier books, but this one has brought me back to the fold. I look forward to reading more novels involving Agent Pendergast, one of the more intriguing characters in fiction."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Preston and Child finish what they started two books ago in \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" with \\"The Book of the Dead\\". As in the previous novels, protagionist Aloysius Pendergast is faced with his greatest challenge which is found in the form of his younger brother Diongenes. Diongenes is bent upon revenge against his brother for perceived ills and abuse that were heaped upon him during his childhood. These \\"abuses\\" are finally brought to the surface in \\"the Book of the Dead\\".All of the familiar characters from the earlier books (Nora Kelly, William Smithback, Margo Green, and of course, Lt. Vincent D'Agosta) are all present and play important roles in this novel. The setting is once again the (beleaguered) Museum of Natural History in New York. (site of many P & C novels, by the way)A long forgotten Egyptian exhibit is reopened thanks to the generous donation of little-known benefactor. Nora Kelly is put in charge of the reopening of the exhibit which is designed to restore some of the luster lost by the Museum because of the numerous tragedies that had occured there in earlier P & C books. Diogenes, of course, is behind all of this and tries to use the exhibit and its publicity as the means to \\"repay\\" his brother so that all of the world can see. Pendergast must first find some way to escape from a Federal Penetentiary before he can stop his brother. The last half of the book highlights this battle between brothers.P & C do their usual great job establishing the plot and quickly moving it forward. Their books always hit the ground running from page 1. While it takes a little longer to gain momentum than some earlier Pendergast novels, \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is a satisfying read that will appeal to all P & C fans. And, as is the case with many of the Pendergast novels, the last few pages leave a number of unanswered questions and quite a few open doors for new stories.I do agree with some of the earlier reviewers who stated that readers interested in this trilogy should definitely read them in order. There are just enough character development items and important plot details that one would not pick up on if he or she didn't read the books in progression.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I really enjoy the way these guys write. It's intelligent and engaging. However, this installment seems to try to tie up too many loose ends. The first 10-15 chapters all start with a different character. Would have liked it to stay on a few of the plot-lines longer. The parts about the jail-break and ending held together very well. I'm hopeful the Pendergast brother battle is now laid to rest so they can now do some more Aloysious books that focus on supernatural crime, detective work, etc. All in all, a great read (but not as good as \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" or \\"Still Life With Crows\\")."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Ever since I finished \\"Dance of Death,\\" I have been waiting for this book to come out so I could find out Agent Pendergast's fate and hopefully learn the answers to so many of the questions that book brought up. With \\"Book of the Dead,\\" Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child do not fail to answer all of these questions, but also to provide one of the best fiction books I've read.I was introduced to Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child with \\"Relic,\\" which is the first book in their informal \\"museum murders\\" series and the introduction to Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast, who \\"Book of the Dead\\" focuses on. If you're considering buying this book, you should at the very least have read the prequel, \\"Dance of Death.\\" Without it, you will really be lacking most of the background knowledge necessary to enjoy this book. These two books are more of a single story split into two, and I don't see how anyone can read this as a standalone. If you really want to get to know the many characters featured here, below is the following order you should read their books in:\\"Relic\\"\\"Reliquary\\"\\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\"\\"Still Life with Crows\\"\\"Thunderhead\\"\\"Brimstone\\"\\"Dance of Death\\"I will have to say that \\"Book\\" was not as exciting as \\"Dance,\\" despite being the climax to the Pendergast Trilogy. Part of the reason for that I think is because Diogenes Pendergast is given a lot more exposure and is shown of as more of a flawed character than he was in \\"Dance,\\" which takes a lot of the mystery out of it. Preston and Child do divulge the incident that caused Diogenes to hate his brother so much, which I found fairly interesting but think they could have come up with a better excuse. Margo Green has only a few pages devoted to her, and the relationship between D'Agosta and Heyward takes a backseat. The book strays somewhat from previous novels, which focused on describing a different character each chapter. This would become very frustrating as one chapter would end and the reader would have to wait 50 pages to pickup with that character again. This book just flows more easily and keeps your interest regardless of who the chapter is about. The main focus of the book is on the Pendergasts, Constance, and Nora Kelly. Agent Pendergast's prison break was ingenious and just put me more in awe of his character.In summary, Preston and Child have done an excellent job creating a thrilling suspense tale, as well as tying up so many loose ends from previous novels and answering many questions the readers have. I think could have had a slightly better climax, but overall I'm satisfied with it and just hope they keep collaborating and producing more stories around these people."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The Book of the Dead was a good book, it was slow up until about the middle.. then it became a page turner. I hadn't read the previous two books in the trilogy, and after reading this one, which most people say is the best, i dont think i'll waste my time on them. All in all this was a good book, but not a great one."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Masterful - I don't know what more to say. This is the third book of a trilogy involving agent Pendergast and I think the 7th book in total - in which he has been a main character. Excepting, Still Life With Crows (which I didnt like), I have read and re-read each and every one of these. Preston and Douglas have honed their storytelling skills and are able to provide some incredible reads. This is clearly one of them."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"If you want to maximize your enjoyment of this book, read Brimstone and Dance of Death first, and maybe even Relic and the Cabinet of Curiosities, to get used to the cast of characters in The Book of the Dead. By the time I read this one, I was already emotionally invested in the cast of recurring characters (Pendergast, of course, D'Agosta, Nora+Bill, Margo Green, Constance Greene, and Laura Hayward), so it was a nailbiter for me from start to finish.However, that's not the only reason this is an excellent thriller. In the previous books, there were often subplots that weren't very interesting or weren't important to the main plot. It was distracting sometimes and slowed the book down. Not so with The Book of the Dead. It is deftly plotted and detailed, but not boring. Pretty much every chapter ties in with the main plot (discovering Diogene's plan and stopping it) and moves it along quickly. I also liked that the master plan was actually very believable (just think Pokemon) and awesomely ironic. Also, seeing a whole other side to Agent Pendergast.The important thing is, The Book of the Dead is tremendously exciting and just plain fun. Just when you think it's over, you find out the authors have more surprises up their sleeves. Which is a good thing, because I didn't want the book to end. This is my favorite Preston/Child novel so far (of which I've read 6), for the reasons above. It's not a monster book or nature vs. man book; the characters rely on their wits and are driven by honor, friendship, and vengeance, feelings very human and relatable. This is a thriller that doesn't let up on the action, but also takes time to let us get to know, and get close to, its characters."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This is an enjoyable novel and an ideal poolside book. However, I probably won't read any more Preston/Child novels; here's why:(1) As other reviewers have already noted, this is actually part of a series. The book cover doesn't say anything about this. Obviously the publisher doesn't want to lose impulse buyers who might be put off by phrases like \\"The final book in the Yadayada Trilogy!\\" To their credit, Preston and Child do their best to make this work as a standalone novel, but you'll still end up feeling like you walked into a theater in the middle of a movie.(2) Two of the principal characters, Agent Pendergast and Diogenes, are a bit, ahem, baroque. They talk like characters in a melodrama and are endowed with almost supernatural intelligence and physical stamina. They both seem out of place around the other characters, who are all very realistically portrayed. I found myself rolling my eyes at some of Diogenes's pretentious monologues.(3) The story contains some highly implausible plot elements (most notably a sound and light show that makes people go insane), and Preston and Child don't really go out of their way to make these convincing. If you enjoy Clive Cussler (who routinely expects readers to swallow some pretty absurd things) you probably won't mind this. If your tastes run more to Michael Crichton, you might find yourself questioning some of the book's plot holes and bizarre premises."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Like all of the Preston/Child novels, The Book of the Dead moves at a lightening pace. Carried along by the plotting and the planning, the believable and not so believable events, a reader is left wondering will good (in the form of Aloysius Pendergast) overcome evil (in the form of his brother Diogenes)?There are a number of twists and turns along the way. And a number of loose ends (from earlier novels) are tied together as well. While this novel can be read and enjoyed as a standalone, I think that for dedicated Pendergast fans (of whom I am one), it is best read after 'Brimstone' and 'The Dance of Death'.FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast has joined my select group of fictional heroes.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Enjoyed this but wasn't all that impressed with the story line.

I did enjoy Brimstone, I felt it was alot of story backed into a good novel, with an ending that opened up the Dionesis charactor. Then Dance of Death continued the fued between the the Predergast brothers, this was a good novel. But Dance of Death lacked a few element. For one it took too long to get to the prison sequence, we were half way through the novel before anything happens, second the conclusion was summed up too quickly. I did enjoy it more that most novels, but I was not the biggest fan of this outing. I miss the novels like Riptide and Ice Limit."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"It's an extension from Relic, so you should read that book 1st.

To save face, the Museum accepts a grant to open an old, forgotten exhibit--The Tomb of Senef. It will be the biggest night of the year, and will put the Museum back on the right track.Or, at least, that is the intent. But Diogenes Pendergast, a brilliant and frighteningly crafty criminal mastermind, has a secret agenda of his own. And the only man who can stop him, his FBI Special Agent brother Aloysious, is locked away in a federal prison for crimes Diogenes committed. As time slowly runs out, Special Agent Pendergast and company must soon face the fact that they will not be able stop Diogenes's perfect crime...Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are both, in many ways, like their famed hero, Special Agent Pendergast: they are careful, crafty, subtle, charming, and entirely unpredictable. They have proved this throughout all of their novels (the Pendergast tales and the stand-alones), and \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is no exception--may, in fact, be the perfect culmination of their talents. Considering this may in fact be Pendergast's last tale (true, there is somewhat of a cliffhanger ending, but it's just like these guys to leave us hanging), it's rather appropriate that \\"Book\\" may be one of their best yet. Special Agent Pendergast is certainly the most interesting hero in modern literature (arguably the most interesting since Sherlock Holmes), and his younger brother Diogenes (who first appeared in \\"Dead's\\" immediate predecessors, \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\") is quite possibly the most chilling villain I have yet encountered.For longtime Preston/Child fans such as myself, \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is a pure delight, bringing together characters from most of their previous novels (\\"Mount Dragon\\" and \\"Riptide\\" are the two exceptions, I believe), and introducting new interesting ones. New fans might want to read \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" first; it's not entirely necessary, but it certainly helps (heck, just read all of their novels; all of 'em are top-notch thrillers). Whether you've been reading these guys since they first came out, or have just recently found out how great they are, you can't deny the fact that their novels feature first-rate suspense in a well-written, fully thought out manner; these are intelligent thrillers, novels that have a pulse all their own. \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is simply another great novel by two of today's best writers."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This book opens with a bow to current events: a suspiciously leaky package shows up the museum . . . sending employees into hazmat hysteria. (SPOILER) The museum's diamond collection (stolen in the previous book-- DANCE OF DEATH) has been returned but certainly . . . in no condition to be in an exhibit. And it only gets better and better after that.Its just non-stop thrills. The Museum has been in the publicity pits lately. (You really have to DANCE OF DEATH first to understand why Aloysius is in maximum security prison and Diogenes isn't, why the museum is in trouble, why D'Agosta--a police detective is close to losing his job, and there's that mysterious Constance Green . . . )Anyway, there's several subplots going on. But the main one happens in the museum itself. There's a huge donation but it has attached a condition to the use of the money. They have to re-open an Egyptian tomb exhibit that was bricked up in the thirties. (I'm a little disappointed that they didn't really say why THE TOMB OF SENEF was closed. There were tantalizing hints but it wasn't pursued. Maybe that's another book.)Then there's the Gordian rescue/escape operation of Aloysius Pendergast. (I actually found this to be the best part of the book so I didn't mind that he didn't get out of Herkmoor Penetentiary till page 260 or thereabouts.)An ingenious, intricate and unbelievable prisonbreak . . . with shades of Silence of the Lambs. Courtesy of Eli Glinn, Master Engineer and who appears in ICE LIMIT (another Preston/Child book which I also recommend Highly!!!!).Then there's Diogenes who appears in the book in several guises. But which?? There's also his most peculiar & diabolical courtship of Constance Green wherein we are introduced to the members of the Pendergrast family . . . through the ages!(It would be great if Preston and Child write more books about the Pendergast ancestors who seem to be mad geniuses of one stripe or another.)There's more of Diogenes in this book. Which is good because he holds the same fascination for me as other literary villains like Hannibal Lecter . . . for example. And we also find out what is probably the root cause of Diogenes' psychosis.The race to stop Diogenes plan (on national TV no less) from bearing mad fruit is exciting and at some points, even morbidly funny! Note the nitroglycerin scene.The ending was a bit odd. And it happens all over Italy which is a lot to cram in 100 pages or so. I would have like a final denouement between Aloysius and Diogenes. But that doesn't happen.Just a few minor quibbles. I give this a 4.5!And looking forward to more of Pendergast!!!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The Book of the Dead is the third in a trilogy of books. I wish I had read the preceding two books in the series, in order to understand what was going on in this one. For example, there were references to a diamond heist at the start of The Book of the Dead, and Aloysius Pendergast is in jail for murders he did not commit.The book opens with the arrival at the Museum of Natural History in New York a mysterious package, filled with some kind of dust. It turns out that this dust is in fact the stolen diamonds, ground down into powder. Added on top of the mystery is a mysterious benefactor to the museum, who offers money to the museum if they open the Tomb of Senef, the tomb of a grand vizier that was closed and put into storage in the 1930s. The night of the opening is coordinated by Nora Kelly, assisted by an Egyptologist specially brought in for the event.The ancient Egyptians believed so strongly in curses that a simple message above the door to one of the tombs was a deterrent to potential robbers. Modern-day Americans, of course, don't believe in those old curses; but awfully strange things begin to occur. There are two ghastly, brutal murders, and two other characters seem posessed by demons.The story follows Pendergast's escape from jail, as well as the story of his brother, who stole the jewels from the museum in the first place. The brothers are diametrically opposite; Aloysius is the ex-FBI agent trying to prove that he didn't commit the murders, and his brother is working hard to prove that Aloysius is evil and guilty of some wrong. We of course know right from the very beginning who is the \\"good guy,\\" but the way the story plays itself is interesting to the extreme.The only flaw I can think of in this book is the character of Smithback, the journalist. Always on the lookout for a good story, he seems to figure out the clues to the mystery just a little too fast. But otherwise, this was a gripping book, one that I spent only two days reading because I thought it was so good."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"\\"It was a dark and stormy night...\\" is probably the only clich&eacute; the authors missed.This book is a ponderous mash of clich&eacute;s you've seen dozens of time in \`B' sci-fi flicks and cheesy slasher movies.The characters are colorless props, unbelievable and lacking in sympathetic qualities. Some of the plot elements are laughable. The pace is slow. I sometimes found myself rooting for Mycroft, er I mean Diogenes, to kill 'em all.I had read and enjoyed Tyrannosaur Canyon; Cabinet of Curiosities was OK. I had also read the first 2 books of this trilogy. So, I wanted to finish this book, awful as it is.

I was very upset with this book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I always look forward to the latest book by these authors, and the expectation is tempered only by the fact that where I live, they are unknown and their books only available through Amazon. I spend a lot of my life in airports, and these are perfect books for the endless waiting around or during flights. This being the final part of a trilogy I was even happier to see it drop through my letterbox.The story, as usual, weaves the different recurring characters, and some new ones, into rich and believable situations and I enjoyed the description of the Museum and its warren-like interior. I felt at times however, especially in the later stages of the book, that the sheer volume of unanswered questions, interwoven characters and story threads to be \\"closed off\\" in this final part of the trilogy, meant that the story lost a little of the fluidity I am used to.But I will say that I enjoyed the book, I finished it in one flight, and despite these minor points it remains a good read. Interestingly the back cover mentions that the authors \\"are working on their next Pendergast book\\" - I hope they intend to make it a stand-alone story."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I am not one to write book reviews, typically, although I do a lot of reading. However, I felt strongly enough after reading this book that I figured I'd give it a shot.To give you an idea of my experience with Preston/Child: I have gone back and read every book released by these authors, after I was hooked on the first one I read (The Ice Limit). One of the things that attracted me to this duo in the first place was their attention to detail, and the ability to craft an excellent, intelligent story that would stick with you after you closed the last page. In addition to The Ice Limit, exemplar works in this style were their first book (Relic),Thunderhead, andThe Cabinet of Curiosities.Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I started reading Preston/Child _before_ they started this trilogy. In my opinion, Brimstone went _way_ downhill vis-a-vis their previous books. Don't get me wrong, I liked Brimstone, but it read much more like a Rollins thriller than the typical Preston/Child storytelling.Fast forward to Book of the Dead, which is a _great_ return to their roots. It's obvious Preston/Child love archeology and ancient history, and their mastery at weaving these elements into the story makes this a much better and more satisfying story than in the previous two books in this trilogy.That said, I do have some complaints (spoiler warning). I was disappointed in the last 1/3 of the story - Diogenes' \\"evil genius\\" plan was way below expectations, and the ensuing globe-trotting chase didn't have the detail or intimate knowledge of the geography involved that I would have expected.As other reviewers have mentioned, the pace _is_ slower than the previous two books - but this is a good thing! This is what sets Preston and Child apart from the shoot-em-up drivel that haunts many top seller lists these days. If you're an intelligent reader, and enjoy well-written and detailed suspense novels, I would suggest starting with their earlier works before reading this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Another great book by two fine authors.What more can I say.I have every book these authors have written.They are all well worth reading.Mystery and adventure in a high tech and/or old world manor.You can't put the books down.Sincerly,Jack Barnes"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Once again, Preston and Child deliver the goods.

The only criticism I have is the romance, especially between Margo Green and Smithback seems forced. I understand that it is not a romance novel, but why throw it in there if it is not going to be smooth and believable. Anyway, I do love the fact that everything is explained (although I am not sure I still understance WHAT Constance Green is....really), but the rest is. I now know why Diogenes hates Aloysius (although it is silly) and I am glad that D'Agosta and Lieutenant Hayward worked it out. Now that I am writing this review, there were a FEW things that I didn't like....I really didn't understand why Diogenes picked on the poor curator for the magazine, and why no one suspected who he really was. However, I thought it clever the whole \\"reopening\\" of the exhibit to commit the ultimate crime. There were some good parts (Constance goes Rambo) and some not so great parts (Constance preggers), but I am not sure if I would read another in the sequel. I would rather the images of Constance telling her fate; Diogenes' appearing to shall we say \\"meet his fate\\"; a budding romance between Pendergast and Constance (although he mentions some foolishness about a monetary to get his thoughts together); and the rekindling of romance between Hayward and D'Agosta linger in my mind with old Eli Glinn and Pendergasts' sidekick backing them all up. Hopefully this is it, but with the cliff hanger, who knows. Uh...I thought I said one criticism, I guess it may have been more than one, but I enjoyed the novel.

There is some resolution here for readers who have been following the Diogenes/Aloysius relationship, but the \\"Event\\" from childhood and Diogenes' \\"perfect crime\\" are both contrived, simplistic, and even childish compared to the usual Preston/Child high-tech scariness. Drop foot? You can do better than that! I was really disappointed in this aspect of Book of the Dead, but there are other thrilling sequences that almost make up for it.I am curious if other readers find the marriage of Nora Kelly to William Smithback to be an odd coupling? There is no chemistry here--Smithback is portrayed as an egotistical, self-serving, insensitive journalist--not sure what Nora sees in him, nor he in her, for that matter. Either Nora needs to move on or Smithback's character needs a lot of development and growth. Romantic relationships generally aren't addressed very well in Preston/Child novels. Regardless of some weaknesses, Book of the Dead is recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The final chapter to the \\"war\\" between brothers, a page turner which does lead to somewhat of a anti climax. I expected a more elaborate ending after such a build up during the three novels. But nevertheless a good ending to the series."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Very clever premiss, caused me to look into the actual \\"Books of the Dead\\" which are simplistic yet provided the entire faith system for an ancient culture that dominates the world today. The mystery was fun to read and there were a few nice twists but as in \\"The DaVinci Code\\", the historical fiction far surpassed the story telling."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Book of the Dead was definitely the best of the Pendergast-Diogenes trilogy. Preston and Child tied up the family epic perfectly. Somehow though I do not think we have heard the last of Diogenes. The storyline was artfully told and maintained the reader's interest by being believable. Great pains were taken to make sure that \\"everything fit\\" and that the little things were as accurate as possible. The prison escape rivals the \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" or the \\"Great Escape\\" in cunning. Although I like and have visited many times The Museum of Natural History, I think that Preston and Child have just about exhausted that location for a storyline. Agent Pendergast is terrific but Lieutenant D'Agosta is my personal favorite and I hope he is developed more in future stories. Riptide and Thunderhead have shown that these two writers can expand there genre to new and exciting locations. All in all The Book Of The Dead is well worth the read, but, if this is your first book of this trilogy Lost might be your fate."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I cannot speak highly enough of this book. This was the best Pendergast novel I have ever read. It was exceptional. Everything was superb. The plot, the characters, the conflict...You will love this book! It will entertain you. It will scare you, it will unnerve you, it will sadden you."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"There are positive and negative aspects of this book.Overall this is an interesting book that will entertain you. Most of the characters are well developed with the exception of Agent Pendergast and his protegee. If you have read the two previous book of the trilogy (Brimstone and Dance of Death) maybe that would not be true.However here is the biggest problem of the book. There is no indication that this is a part of a trilogy. I bought this book at the airport before a flight and only after reading the whole book there was an afternote by the authors saying that the book stands alone but it would be better if you read the other two books first. There should be an indication on the front cover about that.The book \\"throws\\" you in the middle of a situation which is enjoyable- I am certain, though, that it would be for more enjoyable if I had read the other two books first. I will not read them now as I know the ending of the story and know the development of the two main characters (Pendergast brothers) and why Diogenes acts the why he does (I will not elaborate as not to spoil the book for the future reader)."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the end of this trilogy and hope the authors continue to write about this cast of characters. I feel like I know them all. I've read and enjoyed other works by Preston and Child, both writing together and individually, and am amazed how much they seem to think as one. Agent Pendergast could become the modern Sherlock Holmes."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I've read every Pendergast book, and Still Life with Crows is by far my favorite. So I tend to measure each book by Still Life. This book, while a lot better than the previous Dance of Death, still doesn't eclipse Still Life. However, it's good for what it is: a fairly predictable and formulaic Pendergast novel. But what's wrong with that? The formula is fun, Pendergast is an intriguing and neat character, and the expanding role of Constance Green is well worth a return trip to whatever Pendergast novel comes next."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Another top-notch page-turner from Preston and Child. You'll want to have read at least Dance of Death before reading this one, and you should really have read Cabinet of Curiosities and Brimstone as well. If you've read and enjoyed any of the novels featuring Pendergast, this is a must read, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"In Book of the Dead, you have everything you'd expect from these two brilliant authors, a solid, fluid story, great writing and some wonderful twists and turns that will keep you riveted.You'll be tempted to rush through the book and get to the end but if you do, you miss the beautiful play of words, their bold attempt to paint the horror and suspense in the more terrifying scenes.The only complaint I have concerns the board members of the New York Museum of Natural History. You'd think they learn from experience. They are a bunch of imbecilic, dull-witted morons who are drunk with social and political ambitions, at the cost of other people's lives. It almost seems unbelievable that they would make the same mistakes again and again.This is, in my opinion, the best installment of the Pendergast Novels. I'm unsure if it can be treated as a stand-alone but I must say that it is, compared to the earlier books, peerless. The storyline is complex, much like a chess game between two masters who are almost equally matched in their gifts. There is a surprise ending and one I didn't see coming.I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Preston and Child or is it Child and Preston? Have done it again. A very satisfying read. Answers a lot of questions and I'm happy to say, still leaves questions. This series is by no means dead. Cant wait for their next books! Oh, and do read other things besides just the Pendergast books, they are awesome writers together or apart."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Reading the first few pages of The Boook of the Dead was like slipping on a pair of comfortable old shoes. It was as if no time at all had passed since last year's Dance of Death, to which this is the third in a trilogy that began with Brimstone. Despite what Harriet Klausner says, this book is not to be read as a stand-alone, a fact to which Preston and Child allude about as strongly as their publisher would allow (so as not to negatively impact sales) in their closing comments.By the end of the book the authors have, as expected, tied up all the loose ends (well, they did leave one or two dangling, pun intended) with Pendergast, Vinnie and Laura, Smithback and Nora, Margo, Menzies, and of course, Diogenes. Like all their books, the pacing is fast, the writing crisp and easy, and as usual the book is difficult to put down. I read it in two days while on vacation at the beach.I laughed out loud with pleasure at the end of chapter 3 when the identity of the suspected biohazard delivered to the museum in chapter 1 was revealed. There is a lot to enjoy here. But as this was the final book in the Pendergast-Diogenes trilogy, some of the suspense was lost as the final outcome was more or less pre-ordained. Thus only 4 stars not 5. Nevertheless, Diogenes still managed to come up with his share of perfidious and insanely clever evil deeds.A must read for all Preston-Child fans, but not the one to start with."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"So the Pendergast vs Diogenes saga comes to a close, as all good things must. And with that said and done, I have to say that either my expectations were way too high or the last two books just weren't as good as I'd hoped them to be!The cast of Book of Dead is large, almost everyone who was in Dance of Death. Sometimes the direction of the story gets lost in jumping around from character to character. And the pace isn't as breakneck as Dance of Death or even Brimstone. The book has a lot of potential and some great scenes but at times it was just plodding along, not really going anywhere, telling some interesting side-stories, but not really doing anything. It felt a lot like material we'd tread before: a museum show that you know is going to go horribly wrong! The Egyptian stuff is interesting but... nothing felt really fresh until the last 50 pages or so (and I'm not going to tell you what it is because I hate spoilers and I know when you get to it you'll know what I'm talking about)!The Pendergast novels have always been about a crime that seems like it could be supernatural but... That's what they are: great mysteries with great characters and great ideas. But the last two just haven't been that... mysterious.I love these writers. I will keep reading their books. Even with an okay book, they still are ten times better than some of the crappy writers out there. But they just haven't been up to their game. Brimstone, Relic, Cabinet of Curiosities... these were amazing Pendergast books! Dance of Death and Book of the Dead were just good. As I said before maybe my expectations were too high but when you are going to pit one of the best detective characters in recent literature against his \\"Mycroft-gone-bad\\" brother, I kind of expect... beyond amazing."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Another weekend trashed thanks to the addictive storytelling of the Preston/Childs team. Like all of the Pendergast novels, \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is pretty much impossible to put down, showing again that an assignment at the New York Museum of Natural History may be the most dangerous job this side of Baghdad.\\"Dead\\" neatly wraps up the trilogy preceded by \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of the Dead\\", tying up the loose ends and flying through cliffhanger after (literal) cliffhanger. The redoubtable Special Agent Pendergast spends the first few hundred pages cooling his heels in an upstate New York maximum-security federal prison, but that by no means diminishes the mystique of Preston/Child's bizarrely original superhero. And Pendergast's deliciously preposterous escape from prison is an entertainment masterpiece, making Tom Cruise's \\"impossible missions\\" look like addition tables.The story: the museum's priceless collection of diamonds, stolen by Pendergast's evil brother in the previous installment, is recovered - sort of. As a deflection, the museum decides to reopen to the public an Egyptian tomb bricked over since the 30s. In preparations for the gala celebrating the tomb's opening, people start disappearing or turning up dead, reviving old stories of mummy's curses and decades-old cover-ups. Meanwhile, the devious brother Diogenes is causing mischief while the familiar cast of Nora Kelly, Bill Smithback, and NYPD's Lt. Vincent D'Agosta, and Capt. Laura Hayward are on the case, rolling along to not one but two white-knuckled climaxes. One word of warning: \\"The Book of the Dead\\" will probably not read well as a standalone. Best to tackle \\"Brimston\\" and \\"Dance\\" first.If like me you're a Preston Child fan, you know that this is pure adrenaline, not literature - James Bond, Laura Croft, and Indiana Jones rolled up into an extravaganza of action, thrills, suspense, and fantasy. Those expecting an education in Egyptology or the mysteries of the real \\"Book of the Dead\\" may be disappointed, but for pure fun, this is the ultimate summer read."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I love the Pendergast books, and I have read them all. I still say the best was either Relic or Reliquary, then Dance of Death. This book and Brimestone probably come next and then Cabinet of Curiosities and finally still life with crows, which isnt bad at all. This was a great book, and it does a lot to explain Pendergast's past, but I dont really like the climax (Which I cant say here because it is somewhat surprising.) It does end on a strange cliffhanger however and it was very enjoyable, featuring many of the same elements as Relic and Dance of Death. I deffinatly recomend reading this, but read the series in sequential order (Relic, Relquary, Cabinet, Still life, Brimestone, Dance, and then this) They are all good."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast has been imprisoned for murder.

After a diamond their returned the museum's precious collection in the form of dust, she has a monumental job ahead. She just hopes there's nothing to the rumored curse associated with the Egyptian tomb she's about to open.The Book of the Dead is a thriller laced with the range of human experience. Each character must find the strength to survive the most terrifying events of their lives.Preston and Child continue their Pendergast \\"series\\" with this no-holds-barred accounting between genius brothers, one utterly evil, the other tormented by the need to protect humanity from his sibling.

As such, you would expect to have to have read the previous two works in order to have any idea of what is going on. No doubt much more could be gleaned from the novel if you are an avid follower, but it can also be said that Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child succeed in providing a book that does not completely leave first-time readers in the dark. From the get go, they weave in story elements and background enough to give you some idea of what it is that has gone before. As a stand-alone piece, THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is still a heck of a thrilling ride.The New York Museum of Natural History is the backdrop for the tale, and in page one things already begin to go incredibly wrong. A delivery arrives via bike messenger. Tattered and leaking a mysterious powder, the Museum is shut down in a post-9/11 potential bio-terror panic scenario. The powder in question, however, is not nearly so dangerous, yet it is extremely troublesome. Previously, the Museum's diamond collection had been stolen, and the dust delivered in the box is the remains of that priceless exhibit. Now the question is who would steal something so valuable only to destroy it? And how can the Museum deflect the media scrutiny to come?The answer to the second question is simple: locate and reopen the Tomb of Senef exhibit. Originally opened 70 years previously, the exhibit was mysteriously shut after a series of grisly murders began to plague the Museum. Giving the old Egyptian presentation a state-of-the-art overhaul seems to be a wonderful idea until the murders begin again. As if this weren't bad enough, FBI Agent Aloysius Pendergast and his maniacal brother, Diogenes, are involved in a chess match that yields some startling results in the book's final pages.THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is crafted much like a rope. Not just one simple thread, the novel takes the stories of several characters and winds them tightly around each other to form one strong and compelling story. With so many characters floating around, it would become a tangled mess in the hands of less capable authors. Preston and Child have a clear idea of their direction for the individual arcs and their place in the storyline as a whole, and thus are able to snag readers as soon as the cover is cracked. They propel the story forward with great skill and without ever leaving readers with a shred of disinterest or boredom. This is not merely quality writing, this is quality storytelling.--- Reviewed by Stephen Hubbard"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Never picked up a previous one and won't pick up a later edition. I'm half way through and have no idea what's going on! Why the hero is incarcerated, why a special agent can think he can tell a warden to keep an attorney from his inmate (who isn't actually sentenced yet), or put him in danger in a prison yard, and think he can do it again -- all on the word of an agent he's never met before. There's two women who are dead or injured and I'm clueless as to why. One Prof. entering the museum at 3 in the morning -- when 2 men were attacked there the night before and one died! Its really, really stupid !!! Like a really bad B movie. Hey, I love thrillers - believe me, this is terrible!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Serial killer FBI special agent Aloysius Pendergast is serving time in solitary confinement in upstate New York's Herkmoor Federal Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison that no one has ever escaped from. At the same time that the disgraced Fed assumes his adversarial brother Diogenes set him up, the New York Museum of Natural History is trapped in scandal, embarrassment and fabrication. The museum has been exposed by the media concealing that dust is what has become of the priceless diamond collection stolen by them during a less than ethical era and recently purloined by Diogenes.To distract the public, the museum hires archaeologist Nora Kelly and British Museum Egyptologist Dr. Adrian Wicherly to reconstruct the Tomb of Senef from artifacts in their basement. The plan is to dazzle wealthy patrons and the press especially her spouse a New York Times reporter, who broke the diamond story. Adrian realizes that the tomb's hieroglyphics include a curse of insanity on whoever besmirches it, which happens as workers and visitors become crazed murderers. FBI agent Vinnie D'Agosta frees his peer Aloysius from prison while Diogenes stands trial for murder.Though THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is exciting and can stand alone, newcomers should first read the previous Special Agent Pendergast thrillers (see DANCE OF DEATH and BRIMSTONE) because this tale ties up the dangling participles from the previous novels. The story line is action-packed with supernatural overtones and homage to Holmes and Moriarty gripping readers from start to finish as Douglas J. Preston and Lincoln Child deliver a terrific thriller that never takes a breather. No one combines a cerebral (think Holmes) mystery with non-stop adventure (this team wrote RELIC) than this pair as they prove this once again."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"It only takes a few pages of reading this book before you realize that this is not a stand-alone book. In fact, it is the seventh book of a series that recounts the heroics of Aloysius Pendergast and even more disturbingly, it is the culminating volume in a trilogy that recounts the battle between him and his brother Diogenes. I wish there was any kind of indication on the book's cover of this fact as that alone would have deterred me from picking it up and reading it. Unfortunately, though, that was not something the editors did. Maybe sales are so bad that they decided to not even offer a hint about it to catch a few hundred unweary souls? If so, this definitely backfired in my case!The book falls in to the thriller genre. It takes place in modern day New York City with the Museum of Natural History as its focus and background. In the first chapter we learn the conclusion of what took place in the last book (huh? Oh, something to do with a collection of diamonds that was stolen). Then, in rapid fire, we meet one of the curators who just got married to a reporter (apparently they were involved in the previous books), a woman who is convalescing from an attack, another woman who lives in an old house, and an FBI special Agent (that being the first Pendergast) who is now a resident of the biggest, baddest, maximum security prison in existence - this as a result of some murder he did NOT commit in a previous book.This technique of presenting material in rapid fire mode, in very short chapters, was popularized by Tom Clancy and carried through by Dan Brown in their thrillers and they make it work. In this book it does not work as the transitions are way too jerky. Of course, the fact that they rely on the reader having knowledge of all the plot lines that were developed in two to six previous books does not help matters. It is only by the time that I reached the middle of the book, that some of the threads started making sense and got connected to each other.The plot line is just as convoluted and non-sensical. Since the museum is in trouble, it decides to pull off a publicity stunt and reopen an exhibit that's been walled off for 70 years. This being the Tomb of Senef - an Egyptian tomb that is rumored to be cursed. Coincidentally, all the main characters manage to get involved as do some characters that we meet in the middle of the book that happen to be the love interests of the FBI dude. How convenient. Of course, the tomb still appears to be cursed and there are several scenes of people dying in really horrible ways as the storyline progresses.As it turns out, the whole story is of the battle of the Pendergast brothers. As we read the book, it is clear that one is evil and is attempting some sort of massive morbid crime. However, the other is in jail. So, how to solve the dilemma? Why, let's get him to break out of the jail that has never had an escape. That's it! Now, how do we arrange this? Well, we first bring back some super-secret outfit that has all kinds of fancy methods of doing things that are not always legal. Then, we make agent Pendergast into some kind of genius who understands things at a glance - even when never experiencing them before - let's see, we also make agent Pendergast into some sort of martial arts expert in an art that allows him to remotely kill people when he is being pounded by six others, and then, let's also make him a complete renaissance man by having him pick up drum rhythms and play them back and CONTROL them with no practice needed.Do you find it interesting that every female protagonist in this book is beautiful, young, and completely accomplished? There is a mysterious woman who lives her life cloistered and shut off from the world. Towards the end of the book, she needs to leave the house that she's lived in for decades and is immediately able to assume all kinds of disguises that fool everyone, travel in the modern world of trains and airplanes with no negative effects except for spending too much money (how did she get a passport?) and manages to elude the villain who has been planning on his campaign of terror for 15 years or more and is intimately familiar with many locations - yet she manages to ambush him in several of them; knows more than he does about others; and she manages to win the final battle between them. Totally unrealistic!There is a police captain - of course, a beautiful young woman; a museum curator - a beautiful young woman; etc. One of the things that really bugged me is that each of these characters was a shallow clich&eacute;. There is no development of personalities or of character here. These are line-drawn cartoons and nothing more.Another departure from reality is that neither of the brothers ever have a problem with money or the government agents that are all around them. The bad brother has unlimited funds, houses all over Europe and the United States and a horde of passports, papers, and disguises that allow him to appear as someone else while having completely different thoughts inside. He is also a genius who can accomplish all kinds of feats better than the world renowned experts that are all around him - but then he slips and is destroyed by quoting a line from an Italian poem.The good brother also has no money worries; is also a genius that knows everything; and is also unbothered by such things as breaking out of jail, killing people, and jetting around the world at whim. How can it be that all the bureaucracies that we all have to deal with daily, do not impact of affect these folks?In summary, this book is only of interest to those who want to find out how the story continues from the previous books. I will not go back and read any of the others in the series as the whole premise of these books and the plotlines are so unreal and improbable as to be off-putting. Stay away."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I got the 12-CD edition from my library, and found the reading by Scott Brick so awful I quit before the end of the first disk. From what I heard of it, the story is good and deserves better treatment than it get."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I've just finished the BOTD 5 minutes ago so it's quite fresh in my mind.A very good typical book from Preston and Child. Spoilers ahead.Why are they good? They are good because they are very good at providing a chilling and scary backdrop. Their stories are scary, period. It kept me up til 5am last night until my eyelids could no longer keep up against gravity. It's just like a good horror movie, only in book form. The museum is a great setting for them, so they keep going back to it as you can't ask for anything better. I used to close up buildings for a living at night, if Preston Child had been around then, I don't know if I'd have kept my job.Alright, so why doesn't it get a 5 star rating? Problem are the Pendergast brothers, especially Diogenes. I think the trilogy is a mistake because you always know who or what the adversary is: Diogenes. Whereas in the stand alone books, you don't know what the adversary is, and the book keeps you guessing and biting your fingernails. It's a mistake to write from Diogenes' POV because, like the cliche, familiarity breeds contempt. You are no longer scared of him once you see how he works and thinks.I do have a problem with Diogenes setting the whole Tomb of Senef thing up. That kind of work requires special knowledge, and I don't see how or where he can acquire it, what with having to seduce you know who and all that. And how's he gonna get all that stuff installed with everyone there. More omnipotent stuff and lazy writing.Same thing with Aloysius, since an unkillable, omnipotent, omnipresent character is lazy writing - you can make him do anything, no need to think. Don't know how to finish the chapter? No problemo, Special Agent Pendegast shows up in the locked room, kills the bad guy, saves the girl, end of problem. But I forgive Preston and Child since I'm still favorably disposed towards SA Pendegast at this point.Now that I know Smithback is cool, I rather like him as it creates a subplot.A pregnancy? Oh no, can't we stop beating this to death and go to a stand alone book?Overall, still quite a good book for 80% of it. However, their books are no longer 5 stars for me, but 4 or 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This is the sixth novel in Preston and Child's ongoing series of books about Special Agent Pendergast and the third in an informal trilogy focusing on his brother Diogenes. All the old characters are here--Nora Kelley, Smithback, D'Agosta, Constance Greene, etc., but the spotlight is really on the two brothers. You may think your family has problems, but they're nothing compared to the family relationships and rivalries of the Pendergast family. In this novel, Special Agent Aloysius Prendergast and his younger brother finally reach endgame in their long, convoluted struggle.As usual the, much of the action takes place in the Museum of Natural History, which--also as usual-- is mounting another spectacular but ill-fated exhibit. In order to counteract bad publicity over the theft (and unexpected return) of its diamond collection, the new museum director decides to reopen a long-forgotten exhibit buried in the Museum's subbasement. The refurbishment of this exhibit, an authentic Egyptian tomb, is the background against which much of the action plays out. Needless to say, the lavish opening is a disaster. Meanwhile, Special Agent Pendergast is in jail, having been framed for murder by his brother Diogenes in \\"The Dance of Death.\\" His escape from a maximum security prison forms another major thread in the narrative.Against this background, Preston and Child paint their usual story of thrills, chills, and over-the-top mayhem. These guys really know how to write a good yarn Those who have read their other books will probably notice a certain amount of formula (they seem to have a thing for underground settings and mass stampedes), but the authors manage to reinvigorate it each time around. \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is written with intelligence, wit, and enough plot twists to kink any rope. On top of all this, we get to see more of peculiarities of Pendergast's family and what makes the agent tick, including \\"The Event\\" that started Diogenes on his path. This is one of those books that, once you've started, is difficult to put down. Loose ends get tied up, but the authors leave more than enough in play for future go-rounds.A word of caution: Don't read the ending until you get there. Normally, by the time I'm midway through the book, I find that hard to resist. But, on the advice of another reviewer, this time I didn't peek. The wait was worth it. The last sentence is a humdinger."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I must admit that it was a bit slow to start after the exciting finish of the last book, but it became just as nerve-wracking once the story started moving. Not to mention that this one had yet another cliffhanger of an ending! I thought that it would all be over after this one, but though this is a trilogy within the series, it seems that the next book will pick up right where this one abruptly leaves off. I really ended up liking Diogenes' character... I do wonder where this series will go!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I'm not sure what's happening to this franchise, but I want it to stop. First of all, the story depends on a couple of blatantly absurd plot twists and character developments that required me to suspend my disbelief beyond the breaking point, and I just couldn't. Second, and I noticed this in the prequel to Book of the Dead, the books are starting to get bogged down under the weight of their own useless details. Someone's done a lot of research, that is clear, but in some spots this reads like an eighth-grade social studies report -- not one single useless detail on any subject is omitted, whether it's a street map, an exclusive brand name (often so little-known that it conveys nothing to most readers; a simple description of the item would have been both more useful and less pretentious), or the specs of a machine. Also annoying are the \\"conversations\\" about obscure objects or artists that sound as if they were lifted directly from a Wikipedia or encyclopedia entry. Last, I was completely blown away by the Mac notebook ads in here (what else would you call a lengthy paragraph that serves no purpose whatsoever except to recite the virtues of a Mac notebook as opposed to a PC?). Are we at the point where companies can buy ad space in books now?"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The characters come out of late-night television dramas. The plot requires suspension of reality to the point where paranoid quasi-paranormal drama is normal. Um... the progress of the book is well-paced, it's super easy to read, and it's moderately distracting from whatever dental surgery you may be undergoing at the time. However, it's designed for people who move slowly because they have tiny brains. The plot is obvious and easily guessable. The characters require incredulity to accept. Every three paragraphs, when you begin to think you're reading a comic book, they spout off some Internet research about a technology or Egypt. I have read books this bad before but they weren't best sellers. I would only recommend this to people with a fear of polysyllabic language."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I really liked this book.

This time around filling in a lot of blanks.An extraordinary story and one of the best I've read this year. Addictive to the very end. Keep up the good work. I can't help but look forward to more novels with Agent Pendergast. Actually anything you guys write will be more than welcomed.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I want to start off by saying, the only reason i didnt give this book, or any other book I normally read, a 5 star rating... is because I believe a 5 star rating should be reserved for those \\"works of art\\" that have been written. Some might say that would have to be poetry, others might say it has to be a classic tale that is a pure expression of fine grammar and intellectual genius... what those books are? I dont know... and I probably never will, either.My point, is to state, that without stepping on the toes of those people out there with their nose in the air for works of less than historic truth, or cultural facts, i can say this book (along with the previous duo in the trilogy) was one of the most entertaining reads of my life. There was a lot more mystery to the characters than i would have hoped for (things like constance greene and some of the other people in the storyline) but considering Constance is somewhat of a main character, and the Cabinet Of Curiosities is supposedly the cure to the unknown about her, there really has been some exposure to her past and whatnot.But aside from the lack of background that i would have liked to learn more of, the books were great. Lots of twists in the plot, somewhat gorey and goulish, but also had some sex appeal in it. All-in-all, it was very entertaining, had lots of culture (whether it be fact, or fiction) and it kept you wanting more... i spent all my free time working on finishing these books, and I must say, all in all, it was worth it. Somehow, i feel the door was blown open for another sequel to the story, yet i heard so much to contradict that theory before buying... i heard this was closure... no more anything... kinda sad, seeing as how you can get attached to the characters... but still, the fact that there could be another sequel, kind of upset me... i dont like waiting, im not a patient person, and that kind of upset me a bit. But thats probably the only negative thing I can really say about the series, and even that.. is just a personal perception. Have fun reading, just make sure you buy the other 2 books... Brimstone, and Dance Of Death, and read them first... the book can stand alone, but the whole story is much more enlightening."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The Pendergast novels have been very entertaining and this one is a very nice followup to the series. At the start, things look very grim. Lots of twisty plotline and details about art, technology, and science that intrigue the reader. Breathless pace at times. I couldn't put this book down until it was done! There was a satisfying conclusion as well, which the last book didn't really have. You will be entertained."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"While the book was fairly entertaining it barely touches on the Book of the Dead. Was the title merely a marketing ploy to appeal the those who liked the B movie The Mummy?"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This is a deeply plotted story that is true to the teaser blurb on the back cover, which gives away some of the things that I would have thought would be kept as surprises. The book starts out with an interesting premise--a natural science museum receives a parcel containing bag of dust. But though this device is explained later, it is really never developed to satisfaction as the plot turns to the museum re-opening a long-closed exhibit of an Egyptian pharaoh. There is the psycho-thriller aspect of the villainous and rather unhinged Diogenes Pendergast; the spy genre aspect of his brother, Aloysius, a brilliant FBI agent now rotting in prison; the romantic sidebar of the reporter and his wife who works in the museum.The book also introduces Aloysius's ward, Constance Greene, a character who is mentioned only briefly in the beginning, but really plays no significant role in the plot or character development until near the end of the book, where she comes out of nowhere. Her character is only sketched, not really providing enough acquaintance with her to understand her or her later actions in any depth. Another character, Margo Green is briefly introduced but not dealt with much thereafter, just distracting from the story rather than adding dimension. The similarity of the two characters' last names doesn't do the reader any service, either.But that's OK, this is a good beach read.Although the story provides a compelling story line, and creates tension with increasingly frenetic action throughout, it fails to develop its two-dimensional characters. In this way it reminds me ever so slightly of Tom Clancy, who also drops his flat characters onto mazes of fascinating plots, and escalates the action steadily to climax.The authors (two partners wrote this book) have done some homework on their Egyptian mythology and ancient history, but have a tendency to use naive or just lazy assumptions. For example, a reporter calls a lab to extract some information:\\"...This is Bill Smithback of the Times....can I ask you a few questions?\\"\\"You said you're a reporter?\\"\\"That's right.\\"\\"I suppose so.\\"I cannot imagine any high-profile testing lab that would allow its employees to talk to the press about confidential tests.There are also factual errors, such as one scene, albeit inconsequential, where a museum employee was analyzing clay pottery using carbon dating techniques. The problem is that carbon dating works on organic material, and clay is mineral material. The authors ask us later to believe that properly formulated sound and light applied over a very short period of time (minutes) can cause targeted brain damage to produce specific, predictable behavior. Another scene refers to a \\"low-voltage, high amperage shock,\\" but any electrician will tell you this is an oxymoron; voltage is directly proportional to amperage. An FBI agent gives direction to a prison warden with great authority, but the prisons are not under FBI jurisdiction.The book is filled with phrases that might have been trendy in a 1940's detective novel but just sound trite here, or just bad cliches:\\"The case against him was good. Maybe *too* good.\\"\\"...his head, which was shaved bald as a billiard ball...\\"\\"...the man [had] a bullet head that contained about as much gray matter as a spaniel.\\"\\"'How did you come by this information?' Pendergast asked in a voice so cold D'Agosta felt his blood freeze.\\"\\"The two men held each other's gaze for less than a minute, but to D'Agosta it seemed to last forever.\\"\\"His heart was beating so hard in his chest he thought it might explode at any moment.\\"\\"It doesn't matter what happens in that room. Do you understand me Vinnie? Because whatever happens in there, happens to both of us. We're in this together.\\"The even crib a phrase from Churchill: \\"...enigmas wrapped in mysteries.\\"And my favorite exchange between two supporting characters, a man and woman facing each other again a time after an ugly breakup:\\"You lied to me. Played me for a fool. I was willing to offer you everything. Everything. And you--\\"\\"And I am so very sorry. God, if only I could turn back the clock, do things differently. I tried my best....\\"If you keep your sense of humor you will enjoy this greatly while listening to the waves lap onto the beach.And the biggest disappointment of the book was the fall-flat revelation of a backstory told by Aloysius, the only witness, where Diogenes experienced something as a child that changed him forever, and the telling of it built and built, came to a head as we understood how horrible it must have been, and the authors escalate the tensions as Aloysius tells it, we anticipate learning of the horrible Event, so horrible that it made Diogenes attempt to take his own life rather than continue the experience, and we await Aloysius to tell all. WHAT DID YOU SEE, ALOYSIUS?\\"I beg you, do not ask me that.\\"Just remember the SPF 30."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Recall the absolute thrill be it in a movie or the book when Holmes does his logical deductions? And how he always was an expert on virtually anything? Well folks we have our own Sherlock Holmes now and has so far stood the test of time. Agent Pendergast is by far the most compelling character to emerge from our fiction writers in a long time. And best of all the authors know to ALWAYS leave you wanting MORE. You read the kind of story the has immediacy to keep you interested and I regret each page I finish only because there will be less of the book to read. If you are reading this review and have not had the pleasure of reading any of these collaborations in the past how I ENVY you. Go to the first book and get ready for some of the best reads you will ever have. The characters are true characters with many many characteristics that make them 'real' in that they each stand out and on their own as people. And the Villians! Ah he has his professor Moriarty a definite ode to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. If you love Sherlock Holmes and mysteries and thrillers in general then read EVERYTHING done by these authors.

By far this is my favorite of the Pendergast series!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"As the final book in the series of the Preston and Child triolgy of the Agent Pendergast saga this work has its good and bad moments. However on an overall scale the book is well worth reading and does have some good thrills in it.As we pick-up the story from a prior writing, Agent Pendergast has been sent away to prison and it seems all is lost for the good guys to capture the errant brother Diogenes who has caused all of the problems thusfar. The reader is led through a series of scenarios about the New York museum and a valuable old tomb that they have sealed away in their basement which a benefactor wishes them to reopen and put on display. As the plot goes on the tomb opening is really a ploy that leads to several more greater crimes. In the meantime Agent Pendergast with some help escapes from his prison and is soon hot on the trail of the pending disaster about to befall at the museum as they reopen the tomb.The story leads futher into the unmasking of Diogenes' plan and his alter ego as he tries to escape his brother only to be tracked down by a most unlikely person. This person is no other than Pendergast's ward Constance Greene who reveals at the very last sentance of the book her reason for wanting to kill the criminal brother. There are a few other revelations as well that are made during the last hundred pages or so which the reader will appreciate after having read the previous book in the series.In summary the book has its ups and downs and does drag at times, but there are some sections that really do keep the reader on the edge of his seat reading deeper and deeper into the book for the outcome. It's well worth your time to get a copy and read."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The Book of the Dead, by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Book ReviewThe third and final book in the trilogy of novels by award winning novelists Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, picks up where the previous book - Dance of Death - leaves off. FBI Special Agent Pendergast is in Hekmoor, a high security prison, framed for murders he did not commit. Those murders were carried out by Pendergast's diabolical brother Diogenes who has now gone into hiding. Having stolen priceless jewels from the New York Museum of Natural History, he returns the diamonds crushed to dust. In a bid to downplay this horrendous \\"attack\\" against the museum, its management accept a donation from a reclusive French count to reopen one of the museum's oldest, and now long forgotten, exhibits: The Tomb of Senef. But the tomb has a curse, and as the exhibit nears its grand opening, strange murders begin to occur within the museum walls.Special Agent Pendergast has an ally, Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta of the NYPD, and with help from a secret organization D'Agosta manages to enter Hekmoor's high security walls and assist Pendergast in a daring and well thought out escape. The meaning of this enterprising bid for freedom is obvious: Diogenes Pendergast must be stopped from carrying out his \`perfect crime', and the only man capable of preventing such a felony is FBI Agent Pendergast. It is a race against time for Pendergast to unmask his brother and prevent the slaughter of hundreds of innocent lives.The Book of the Dead offers much, and for the most part it delivers. Once again the characters are well defined and strong, although quite how Special Agent Pendergast is able survive a brutal attack six on one against brutish gangland thugs while in prison - and quite how he manages to escape from Hekmoor in the first place without so much as a single glitch - often leads one imagining how realistic such a character could be. The setting for the majority of the book, New York and its museum, is enjoyable as always, but the real storytelling comes in to play when Diogenes finds himself on the run, chased by not only Pendergast but an unlikely hunter. The pursuit heats up in the Italian city Florence and comes to its conclusion on the desolate, yet inhabited, island of Stromboli, near the island of Siccily.Everything that has gone before, not only in this book but certainly in the previous novel - Dance of Death - and to a lesser extent in Brimstone, the first in this unofficial trilogy, should lead to this one moment, the final 30 pages of climactic action when the two brothers meet in a duel of the death. It falls flat on its face. The end chapters are so unfulfilling, so unrewarding, so utterly devoid of closure that for a while it made me wonder why I had read so much for so long. If the meaning was to leave the plot open for the possible return of the fallen character, then even that was done poorly.The Book of the Dead is a good read and it does have its great moments as one has come to expect from this talented author duo, but don't be disappointed if the rollercoaster ride stutters to a level slow stop instead of leaving you screaming down that one last cavernous drop."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Same title as the Cornwell book, but entirely different story. I picked this up as a paper back at the airport before a trip and had never read these authors before. This was part of a series but I understood most of it without having the background. Set in a museum and dealing with Egyptian artifacts and murder. Good story. I would advise reading earlier books by these two before picking up this book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I enjoyed this book. I came across it by accident when looking for Lee Child. It was a quick read but enjoyed it alot!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This could have been a good mystery if not for the multitude of unnecessary characters in the story, all introduced in each short chapter.Historically, it leaves something to be desired, but most unfortunately rarely delves into the science & particulars of egyptology and the reason for the title of this book. It mentions a few times, but briefly the meaning of the ancient texts. It was an easy read but could have been much more interesting with some historical facts that could have fitted nicely into this story."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child bring what is unofficially called \\"The Diogenes Trilogy\\" to a gripping conclusion with \\"Book of the Dead\\". The story arc that began with \\"Brimstone\\" and continued with \\"Dance of Death\\" wraps up with a number of questions answered, and important changes in the lives of some of the major characters.\\"Book of the Dead\\" brings the usual players- D'Agosta, Hayward, Smithback, Kelly, Green and of course, the Pendergast brothers- back to the New York Museum of Natural History for another round of the deadly cat-and-mouse struggle between Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast and his criminal genius brother Diogenes. Readers will find echoes of \\"Relic\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" in the premise of another big museum exhibit gone wrong, but the novel is in no way a stale re-hash of previous plots. Preston and Child put their characters in precarious and confounding situations, and Diogenes spins a complex web of evil. There are even a few surprises thrown in.One of the most fascinating details is the revelation of the event that sent Diogenes over the edge and into a lifeleong hatred of brother Aloysius. The story arc draws to a satisfying conclusion, but the authors leave just a little room for doubt, plus a \\"Wow!\\" moment on the final page.One of the most enjoyable aspects of Preston and Child's work is their ability to put old characters in new and interesting settings. Pendergast, D'Agosta, Hayward and Smithback were first introduced to the reader in \\"Relic\\". Nora Dunn originally appeared in \\"Thunderhead\\" before later crossing paths with Pendergast in \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\". Eli Glinn was introduced in \\"Ice Limit\\", while Viola Maskelene came along in \\"Brimstone\\".If \\"Book of the Dead\\" has a weakness, it lies in the fact that Pendergast is sometimes too good at everything. He's not physically imposing, but he can take out prison toughs in the blink of an eye. He's brilliant, well-read and a master of spiritual disciplines. At times one wants to ask, \\"What can't this guy do?\\" This is a flaw common to many heroes in the genre, and detracts only minimally from the enjoyment of the story.A note to the reader- Do not read this novel as a stand-alone piece. At minimum, read \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" before diving into \\"Book of the Dead\\". If you are a fan of the adventure-thriller genre, start with \\"Relic\\" and read all the Pendergast novels in order. A few plot threads from \\"Still Life With Crows\\" and \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" carry over into the Diogenes Trilogy, so take your time and enjoy all the works of these fantastic authors."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This is the 2nd Pendergast novel I have read and I would rate it slightly below \\"Brimstone\\" but in the same ballpark and well worth reading. These books have an aura of the supernatural but the stories are in the end grounded in reality. The hero Pendergast has an evil brother as smart as he is, an everyday NYPD detective as a sidekick and several continuing female characters. I like the female no nonsense NYPD detective captain the best. This story flags a bit at times and has some filler. It could have used an editor with a green eyeshade to shape it up. But this series is different. I would buy it if only because it's not set in Florida or Southern California but it worthwhile aside from that. Buy it for the unique, well crafted characters and interesting plot. One comment - Pendergast's \\"ward\\" is creepy. She is NOT someone who would at least pretend to be interested while you explained the infield fly rule. I wish she would wander off into the moors lost in deep thoughts and fall off a cliff."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"As the final book of what the authors term \\"The Diogenes Trilogy\\" I was all set for a final battle to the death between Pendergast and his very evil brother Diogenes. I was pleasantly surprised to see the book move in a very different direction. Perhaps too much time was spent in extricating Pendergast from his unjust confinement, but the detailed process was executed with fascinating and belivable precision. As with the other Pendergast books, the strange protagonist manages to carry out his plans with such amazing ability that it is a bit mystifying that Diogenes could have accomplished so much of the mayhem that he has pulled off in the past. It was painful to watch Diogenes in action as he duped the the innocent Constance, but the reversal which happens is both believable and highly satisfying. The character of Constance is one which bears even further development, which I suspect is what will happen in Wheel of Darkness. I certainly hope so."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Preston and Child are so much more than the sum of their individual parts when they collaborate. This is so evident yet again in Book of the Dead. This novel finishes with a bang what is an informal trilogy revolving around Aloysius Pendergast and his brother Diogenes. This trilogy is populated with many of their previous characters and protagonists serving in supporting roles to the brothers, and is a very satisfying novel and a truly enjoyable read. How do I know this was a trilogy? One of the best things about this book is a brief two page note from the authors at the very end where they explain in which order to read their works and why.I have to give one warning though about what is otherwise a terrific book. I'm not a professional reviewer, as are the writers of the two reviews which have already appeared here, but I have to say I disagree with them that this can be truly appreciated as a stand alone novel. If you have not read any of the previous works then do yourself a tremendous favor and take the recommendation of both the authors and myself: go back and start with Relic and work your way forward from there. There is so much pleasurable reading you have missed and there is simply too much going on in this book which, without the knowledge of the previous stories, you will not fully appreciate. So, with that one warning, on to my verdict.I loved this book. It was everything I could hope for in a denouement and so much more. I, like so many others, have been waiting impatiently for a year for the answers and resolutions to the many apparently insoluble issues and problems created by the authors in their foregoing works. Finally, to my great relief, the book was released yesterday and with all apologies to Amazon, this was not a book I was willing to wait a day or longer for someone to deliver to me so I let myself off work early and went and bought a copy locally. I mentally steeled myself to be slightly disappointed because I simply could not see how the authors could convincingly solve the myriad of problems they had created previously. Yet, with a kernel of hope in my core, I started reading around 3 in the afternoon. I finished after midnight. Yes, as is typical of Preston and Child, this is one of those books that you will want to finish in one go and will find very hard to put down. I am happy to report that the authors, with grace, style, and panache, provided answers that are believable, convincing and reasonable and which resolve all the complex issues previously created. There was so much to like about this book! The Cain and Abel brothers (or Holmes and Moriarty if you prefer) have been locked in their dance of death for their entire lives. But what caused this to be? What is the unimaginably horrible crime that Diogenes is working feverishly to perpetrate? How can Aloysius escape from a maximum security federal penitentiary that has never suffered an escapee? And when will there finally be a point to Constance Green? All these loose ends are tied up for us finally in a deeply satisfying way.This novel delivers excitement, thrills, scares, mysteries, tension as fine as any you can read, and delivers them in sinfully addictive prose that drags you from one page to the next without remorse or relent. The best thing about the book is its relentless intelligence and the competence of the two siblilngs as they work to thwart and foil each other. The prison break was so intelligently crafted, the diabolical crime really was diabolical and also so personal it just dripped with hate, revenge, and misguided retribution. One final bit of praise. The authors finish the book with one of the most satisfying closing sentences I've ever read. It nailed the last niggling reservation I had and I unreservedly admire how they set me up for it, stringing out my reservation to the very last sentence of the very last page and then just crushing it. Do not skip forward to the last sentence. Restrain yourself, don't do it. You can't appreciate it fully unless you have been through the other novels and force yourself slowly through this one, but my hat is off to Preston and Child for crafting this enormously enjoyable conclusion that ties up all the loose ends and sets the stage for what may come yet in the future,"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The board members of the New York Museum of Natural History just don't seem to learn. After experiencing the terrors of THE RELIC and THE RELIQUARY, one would think they would be concerned about reopening the Tomb of Senef, particularly since two men have experienced unexplained neurological damage while working on the project. However, the board is determined to pursue the project to deflect attention from their attempts to cover up the return of their entire stolen diamond collection- returned as diamond grit, that is.Diogenes Pendergast has put into motion the perfectly orchestrated crime. This crime is an attempt to recreate the work of his ancestor, Comstock Pendergast, and will affect all who enter the Tomb. Nora Kelly, William Smithback, Viola Maskelene, Margo Green, and Constance Greene are all returning characters from previous Preston and Child books and they too are part of Diogenes' diabolic plan.Meanwhile, former Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast is incarcerated at Herkmoor Penitentiary, as part of Diogenes' twisted plan (see DANCE OF DEATH for details). Herkmoor Penitentiary is considered impossible to escape but that is before Eli Glinn employs his agency's technical expertise. Pendergast, Vincent D'Agosta, and Captain Laura Hayward will have to work together yet again to stop Diogenes from wreaking destruction on their friends and the entire city of New York.Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child demonstrate once again why they are the masters of this genre. THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is a cleverly crafted thriller with enough twists and turns to keep the reader turning the pages well into the night. While the returning characters provide a sense of familiarity, Preston and Child do not sacrifice the plot by any means. THE BOOK OF THE DEAD draws the reader in from the first sentence and doesn't let go until the very end. This is not a novel you will want to put down as Lincoln and Child continually keep you guessing as to how the characters will thwart Diogenes.THE BOOK OF THE DEAD can be read as a stand alone novel as the authors provide the necessary background to understand the basic plot. However, readers will miss the intricate details that make this series so successful if they do not read the earlier novels. At a minimum, this reviewer recommends reading DANCE OF DEATH prior to THE BOOK OF THE DEAD if only to provide the full complexity of Diogenes' deviousness. Part of what makes the Preston and Child novels so addictive is the authors' innate ability to weave together numerous plotlines from various books into a cohesive format. Readers familiar to the series will recognize details and characters from previous books and will be impressed at the sheer brilliance of Preston and Child at combining all of these elements into one book. THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is one thriller you do not want to miss reading!!COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"As usual, Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child confirm their great ability in writing cool, well-conceived page turners.In this book in particular, a lot of details about some of the characters are unveiled, and the \\"Pendergast Trilogy\\" featuring Aloysius vs. Diogenes finally comes to an end... and what an end!Apart from the praises for the writing style and action scenes, for the characters and the mood, another point I found particularly strong in this book was the obvious amount of research the authors did. I am Italian, and the small details, for example the streets of Florence, or the cuss exclamation of a Carabiniere, or even the cell number of a bus driver (which uses a correct prefix for an Italian cell phone, no fake \\"555\\" number) all prove that they really went into research for the book.Also, the frequent sentences in Italian are correct and do make sense this time (unlike some of their previous books where the sentences were dictionary-translated and light-years from what a \\"real\\" Italian would say).The only quirk I found was with the audio book itself - while the guy who reads the book has a fantastic voice and a clear, perfect tone, it's also very clear he is not at ease with the Italian language.Some accents he uses while reading Italian words range from mildly amusing to utterly ludicrous, but then I guess it's something only a native Italian speaker would notice.All in all, a fantastic book, definitely well worth it!If you appreciate Preston and Child's novels, don't miss this one, with a single caveat: for maximum enjoyment you will need previous knowledge of facts and characters, so reading the other books (at the very least Brimstone and Dance of Death, ideally quite a few others) is *strongly* advised."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Book of the Dead is the third book in what Preston & Child call their \\"Pendergast Trilogy,\\" which began two years ago with Brimstone.Secrets are revealed, including \\"the Event\\" which transformed Pendergast's brother Diogenes into a sociopathic killer.Characters from previous novels, inlcuding The Ice Limit, Relic, Thunderhead, and Cabinet of Curiosities make notable appearances. Pendergast's mysterious ward, Constance (who has done very little in the earlier books,) takes a lead role with spectacular results.There's action, violence, a scheme to murder millions, some twists, and the best prison scene since Silence of the Lambs.If you've been waiting for this book, you won't be disappointed. If you're new to the series, you might miss out on a lot of the references to previous stories, and you'll enjoy this more if you read those earlier books first.I read it in one sitting, staying up all night, and I'm tired but happy.Congrats on another winner, Mr. Preston and Mr. Child."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I've read a fair number of books by Preston and/or Childs. Some were good; some better than good. This book was a complete waste of time. First of all, this is not a stand-alone book, although there is nothing on the outside as to mark it as a sequel. But even if I had some inkling into the chronology and backstory of all the characters, I doubt that I would have found anything about the characters, the setting, or the plot in the least bit credible. Things just keep happening that don't make sense--it's not that they are mysterious or spooky or build suspense and are explained later--they just don't make sense. Coincidences abound. Police and bystanders alike act in ways that defy logic. Characters do things that are bizarre and unrealistic. I understand that thrillers depend on a willing suspension of disbelief from time to time, but this goes way beyond that. Thoroughly disappointing."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"\\"The Book of the Dead\\" is everything a thriller fan could hope for - a page-turning, unputdownable, thrilling, decadently readable, thoroughly entertaining, slam bang finale to a colourful, imaginative trilogy!The basic plot premise is simplicity itself! FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast's younger brother Diogenes has announced his plan to execute a mysteriously undefined perfect crime. As a result of intense psychological examination, Pendergast has determined that this crime is to be Diogenes' revenge for a childhood sin perpetrated against his younger brother, the nature of which has been completely suppressed in Pendergast's unconscious memories! The dastardly crime must be prevented at all costs despite Pendergast not knowing even the tiniest detail of Diogenes' actual intentions! The story gallops at breakneck speed from crisis to crisis as the life or death clash between Pendergast and his psychopathic megalomaniacal brother escalates to a thrilling climax but we are privileged to watch it being played out with masterful attention to character building, dialogue, detail, pacing and clever ratcheting or release of tension!As we have come to expect from their previous work, Preston and Child have once again packed their tale with a dazzling myriad of mini-plots that have afforded them a number of stages from which they could also deliver a series of wildly entertaining and informative lectures - the politics and history of Egyptian archeology; the religious beliefs and burial practices of the ancient Egyptians; the nature of security in a modern maximum security prison built for incorrigible offenders; the logistical details of mounting a world class exhibit in a modern museum; the potential for neurological damage caused by intense light and high volume sound bombardment; the trivia of diamond classification, colour, cut and value; and, arcane details of forensic evidence examination such as the study of knots or cloth; to name only a few examples.Readers who have observed Pendergast's growing resemblance to Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes in the novels which preceded \\"The Book of the Dead\\" will shiver with a frisson of delight at the tumultuous Reichenbach Falls style climax which takes place on the very flanks of Mount Stromboli in Sicily. When Pendergast announced his intentions to retire to a period of solitude and contemplation at a Tibetan monastery, I quietly sent up a short prayer to the writing gods with the fervent hope that Lincoln and Child bring Pendergast back for a 21st century version of \\"The Final Problem\\"! Quiet retirement or beekeeping would not suit Pendergast any better than it did Holmes.And, by the way, be very, very sure that you read this novel right to the very last sentence ... and what a last sentence it is!Oh yeah ... did I say that I enjoyed the novel?Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Once upon a time there was a strange monster running around the basement of the New York Museum of Natural History and an eccentric FBI agent... And so went the tale of the first book in which special agent Prendergast made his appearance. There are now seven books in this series and, despite the authors' protests, it wouldn't surprise me to see number eight coming along at some time. They have always been better than merely readable and have occasionally shown flashes of brilliant. Unfortunately they don't make the transition to film very well.Preston and Child pull out all the stops in this latest volume, the third to pit Prendergast against his evil brother Diogenes. The setting has returned to the New York Museum of Natural History once again, where a desperate leadership is attempting to counteract the bad press coming from Diogenes spectacular jewel theft. This, as you may remember, left Prendergast imprisoned for evils he did not commit and one of the world's most valuable collections stripped of it's treasures. When the jewels are returned as powder the museum hatches the idea of reopening an ancient Egyptian tomb buried in its cellars, complete with a multimedia light show, as a way of distracting the public.In the mean time a group of Prendergast's friends plot to break him free from the Herkmoor Federal Correctional and Holding Facility. This clumsily named prison is a foreboding institute that is more than the equal if its Victorian equivalents - dark, menacing, and full of FBI agents who are bent on breaking Prendergast's will. No one has ever escaped, but no prison has ever encountered this new version of the Mission Impossible team before. Of course, locked away in prison, Prendergast himself doesn't play much of a part in the early going - something of a mixed blessing.Regulars to this series will recognize that Prendergast, with his overstated Southern gentleman style, austere looks, and brilliant mind, is a spitting image for Sherlock Holmes. Diogenes outdoes Moriarty as archfiend, and Mycroft as the brilliant older brother. The resemblances are uncanny, and no doubt intentional. Prendergast's personality has that same coldness to it as Holmes, and the same irritating habit of always being right. One can quite understand why Diogenes is dedicated to eradicating him.This time the situation is even more desperate as Diogenes devious plot unfolds quickly, and we discover a multitude of falsehoods and betrayals. Prendergast's brother is intent on getting even with everyone who has stood in his way, not just his brother. New York is again to be the site of a disaster. In the mean time you will find yourself delighted by Preston and Child's amazing facility with the details of a prison break, an unending supply of Egyptianalia, and the methods of a no-holds-barred museum exhibition. Book of the Dead is really the best of a long series. You probably should start with an earlier volume, probably Brimstone, but going all the way back to Relic wouldn't be a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"(NO MAJOR SPOILERS)One way or the other, I have to agree with some previous reviewers: this novel doesn't quite live up to the other fantastic Pendergast sagas, which have the best combination of action, suspense and mystery I've read to date, along with great characterization. I'd say this one focused more on characters than being \\"gripping\\" based on plot alone as might be expected.It's a well-written and carefully constructed book, a must-read for all Pendergast fans, but doesn't have the blazing rushes of adrenaline the previous ones had, all things considered. This may bore new-comers more than Dance of Death and should definitely not be read alone. Book of the Dead simmers more than boils, with certain parts to be slowly savored, mostly thanks to previous knowledge of the characters. I'm glad this novel is supported and fed by a larger plotline from the previous Pendergast books, because as a standalone, you'll miss the powerful characterizational kicks and might be disappointed to find few nail-biting twists, which are in fact slightly redundant when compared to what happens in, say, Reliquary or Brimstone.This 'conclusion' to the Pendergast trilogy wraps up details well, though a trifle bit transparently. The New York Museum problems are similar to previous ones mentioned in at least two other novels, and it's almost getting old. Or at least predictable. Same setting is fine, but it's almost exactly the same situation too, albeit with a different source of trouble. Also, a major flight at the end seems a bit forced, and a certain brave character's sudden competence and fury, though gratifying, came out of thin air and seemed almost too convenient.The diabolicalness of Diogenes is explained in this novel and while he's rather not as rounded out as I would've liked, he nevertheless is given a reason why he is how he is. I thought it was a relatively far-fetched explanation and didn't mesh with the plot quite as well as other explanations for past events in past Pendergast novels. I also thought his series of actions leading up to a 'master plan' as told in in Dance of Death made more sense than his ultimate goal here, which progresses to somewhat of a vague cliche.What Book of the Dead does best is continue to focus on the human side of Pendergast's world, which makes up for the lack of an independent plotline. The best part of this book for me was Pendergast and his facility experiences, the final stage of which indeed reminded me much of Hannibal Lector's, as mentioned previously. That and his behavior and interaction with certain people was absolutely priceless.I expected the final sentence of this book to come at one point or another; don't be surprised if your mind discovers it, even if just briefly, when you're still far from the end, as this is a kind of plot development sure to complicate the issues and keep at least one end loose for the future. No complaints, but it was coming.All in all, I honestly felt Book of the Dead lost steam and some of my attention at the end, which is why I regretfully give it a 4/5, which is not bad for it being the lowest opinion I've had for any Pendergast novel so far. This novel is definitely worthwhile just to see Pendergast deal with various awkward situations. I would have to disagree about the level of tension and adrenaline being high; rather, I found this laid-back and familiar due to its emphasis being on characters and motives and decisions, none of which originate from this book.At the end of the day, I will always be looking forward to more Aloysius..."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The Book of The Dead finishes up the storyline started in \\"Brimstone\\", and it does so in a powerful way. After the rather disappointing ending of \\"Dance of Death\\" (a cliffhanger doesn't work when it takes you a year to put out your next book), TBOTD actually brings things together rather nicely. It's not a perfect story though, so be prepared. While Pendergast has taken the starring role in the last few novels, the book is well over half finished before he becomes a major player. I was getting a little anxious and thinking Preston and Child were going to leave us with another cliffhanger here, but Pendergast does become a central part of the story and his battle with Diogenes takes on a powerful life of its own.That being said, you WILL need to have read the previous two books to fully understand what's going on. And it was nice to see Constance getting to do something besides sit in the library and read all the time. She's a character that deserves to be explored (and that's almost guaranteed for the next book). The major disappointment of this book is that it includes yet ANOTHER disasterous opening at the New York Museum (for those keeping score, that's three big openings in the Preston/Child series and three big disasters). Can those museum people not take a hint? And who are the idiots who actually buy tickets to these things thinking \\"Oh, the other times were just flukes\\"? People die when they open exhibits there! Don't go!While this story doesn't end on a cliffhanger per se, it definitely leaves you wanting to know what happens next (a few of the characters futures are in question). I love the characters Preston and Child have created. Each has an individual personality and depth. All in all, this is another incredible story by the team and it ends the trilogy with a bang. Grab this one and you'll be looking for their other novels, guaranteed!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Ok, so I was afraid...you know the kind of fear from wanting a book to be as good as you want it to be...but fearing you'll be disappointed? I have waited since the day I finished Dance of Death to find out how the heck Pendergast was going to break out of prison, what exactly Diogenes was now plotting since his previous plan had been ruined, and most important of all...what is the EVENT that happened between these two brothers that caused Diogenes to hate Aloysius so much that he spent twenty years of his life plotting the \\"perfect crime\\" against him???Well these, and many other plot lines, are all gratifyingly tied up in the Book of the Dead (and there's even a little twist at the end - even though I have to admit I guessed that one).The story starts out solidly setting up the plot about the museum needing an exhibit to save itself from the bad publicity resounding from the diamond heist in DoD. Because I don't wish to include spoilers- all I'll say is that it just becomes more and more engrossing, until frankly I was rocketing through the story at a million miles an hour. I had no reason in the world to be afraid of disappointment as the book was everything I had hoped it would be and much, much more! This book is definitely now my favorite of the Pendergast series (especially because of the background story of the EVENT, which further clues readers in on what makes Pendergast tick)...and all I can say is \\"Man, can these guys write!\\" and that now I can't wait until the next one!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I have never ordered this book so I don't know why you are asking me to review it!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"First off i haven't read any of the other Prendergast and saw that it said each book was meant to stand alone so I read it anyway, but have to say i was disappointed. I'd read Preston's Tyrannosaur Canyon and loved it so i thought i'd give this a try since i love Egyptian themes as well but I can't say I was all that impressed. First off the title is misleading, because i can't remember even one point in the book where the mention \\"The book of the dead\\" its nonexistent in this book, but still revolves around the opening of a pharaohs tomb. The book was suspenceful and there were a lot of parts i really enjoyed, but i felt the explanation for motives and events that were really hyped up throughout the book had sort of weak explanations, and the ending wasn't too thrilling. It's not an awful book, but I can't say i came away in awe."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This is the last installment of the trilogy following Brimstone and Dance of Death. The books are about FBI agent Aloysius Pendergast battling his evil brother Diogenes. I was a big fan of the agent Pendergast character, particularly in the earlier Cabinet of Curiosities, but this trilogy didn't excite me as much. The last book wraps up the story in a satisfying manner, but there was really no mystery or intrigue. However, it was not boring either. For example, agent Pendergast's escape from prison was most entertaining, but the outcome was never in doubt.There was also no supernatural element to the story, as there was in many of Preston/Child's earlier novels. There is no historical intrigue, no new characters introduced, and no plot twists. We are merely observers watching a linear story unfold, the outcome of which is known from the beginning. I was hoping that this would be the end of the Pendergast stories, but the book ending hints that there are more to come.To be fair, this book is fun to read and I blew through it in a couple of days, but Preston/Child have done much better in the past. I hope that their next collaboration involves all new characters and settings. After all, how many more people can die in the New York Museum of Natural Histrory before they shut it down?!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I bought this book on the way home from our memorial Day weekend and finished it in two days! It was just as good as Dance of Death. READ THIS BOOK!!!! While you're at it, also read WINTER HILL by Matthew Farrell. This was one of the best books I've read to date."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I very much enjoyed Brimstone and was looking forward to completeing the series, but in light of Mr. Preston's opinion of ebook readers, specifically Kindle owners, I have decided to take my Wal-Mart attitude and MONEY and give it to some other author who appreciates me.Those Indie authors seem to be a down right inviting group.Sorry Mr. Childs if you do not share Mr. Preston's views."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Characters not well developed. Plot(s) fragmented and difficult to follow. A long read with little payoff."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Sorry, but this is just NOT a good book, not even close! I was duped on this one - and by many of the reviews written here and on another big book site! I should NOT have listened!This book is nothing but B-movie schlock on paper. Poor plot, poor characterizations, extremely unrealistic settings. It reminded me of something on Cinemax at 4am. Do yourself a favor: Watch that instead."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The cover is deceiving. Looks to be about the ancient Bood of the Dead which the Egyptians of 900-600 BC used for their religious rituals. The English version came out in 1895 of the Papyrus of Ani found in the tomb of pharaoh Ramses, whose ceiling was decorated with astronomical scenes. It is the collection of prayers, spells and rituals for the after life th Egyptians of antiquity believed in, worshiping the God Osiris.Along the vein of Shakespear's tragedies, the antagonist is aptly named Diogenes after the philosopher who influenced Will with his cynical attitude toward life, not death. Being demonic in this story and a criminal of first class, he challenges his FBI agent brother Aloysius to a duel of wits. If you read 'Relic' and 'Dance of Death' then you know all the background of these two and the trouble they have endured. Diogenes had stolen some diamonds from the New York Museum of Natural History and returns them grown into dust, for ashes of the dead.This Egyptology story is based in the underground tomb of Senef which had been a popular exhibit at the museum until the 1930s when it was suddenly closed amid rumors of unnatural occurrences. Now it is about to be reopened, and we find Aloysius as a prisoner in the dungeons of a maximum prison. Sounds more like England, Scotland, or wherever they have dungeons, not New York in America. We are aware of the lower reaches in some of the churches there, but a museum sounds suspicious. Oh well. It is an interesting read, especially for the fans of the authors Preston and Child (I like his first name Lincoln). But I am an unbeliever in life after death. It was not as compelling as Elizabeth Peter's novels about the tombs along the Nile and the Puramids of Egypt. Now, that's more my style."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The alternate title of this book should have been \\"HOW TO AFFECT AN AIR OF SOPHISTICATION AND URBANITY IN SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF PLODDING AND FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOTTING COUPLED WITH TWO DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES SO PREDICTABLE IN THEIR PRETENTIOUS MUSINGS\\".An overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors. I had hopes for these two having started with \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\". Their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but I retained hope for latent talent. Then this? This self-indulgent, conceited tome demonstrated a predisposition not unlike that so manifestly exhibited by the socially-upward-mobile.I am so saddened to see that some of the most lauded exponents of modern popular fiction are the likes of Messrs. Preston and Child and perhaps the worst offender of all, Dan Brown."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"The other reviewers will tell you about the book. I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read. What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism. I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published. I guess most people will sell their souls for money. Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments). The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men. The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters. This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.So this is just a warning. If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"For fans of the Pendergast books by Preston and Child,this is a must read. It wraps up the unofficial \\"Diogenes Trilogy\\" begun in \\"Brimstone\\". The story climaxes on a cliff by the sea and takes Constance, Pendergast's ward, to a whole new level. While it can be read as a stand alone novel, you should really read \\"Dance of Death\\" first. Its a great summer read with intricate escapes, international flight, games of \\"cat and mouse\\" and a look into Diogenes' lair, as well as Pendergast's psyche. Its not \\"War and Peace\\", but it will keep you frantically turning the pages while sitting on that beach!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Do not read this book unless you plan on being immobile for a while. You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Absolute must reading - especially if you are a Pendergast fan!!! This book brings satisfying closure. Fast paced, and probably one of the best use of 6 hours of my time!!! Bizarre, fast moving, action packed and a worth read on a long flight."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"My family is full of avid readers of the Pendergast books, and as a result refer their friends to Aloyious. This is one of the better books, since you can read any in the series at any point to get \\"hooked\\". This one deals with the New York Natural History Library and the fact that there is so much stuff in it that entire exhibits can be there and be lost. That alone is so much food for the imiagination to run wild with! It is well worth the read, but write your name in the book so hopefully you will get it back - you will want to reread!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"apparently it is very easy. Don't bother, this book should be marketed to young readers. It started off better than it ended, which is worst than startng off slow and building. Totaly unbelievable, unimaginitive and well, which means its pretty boring and predictable. Its a 1 1/2 stars at best. A mysterious benefactor, a magician style arch nemesis all seem over the top. I guess I should have read the first two novels in the trilogy because I don't think this novel stands by itself very well. My bad."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I didnt' realize this was part of a series when I read it, and it is great to know that was not necessary. The book is written in such a way that prior character knowledge or lack there of does not detract from the story. Book of the Dead is intense and I had a hard time putting it down. I couldn't resign myself to wait to find out what happened next. Diogenes is just so evil and cunning and \\"wow\\". Pendergast has his hands full...but you never stop and think...he's not going to make it - you just aren't quite sure how he's going to get there. The details are well covered, and the idea that there are sealed exhibits and tunnels, and shelves with jars of all kinds of things hiding in museums makes me want to go on a scavenger hunt. Completely captivating, amazing, intense read!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Pendergast is in jail, framed by his brother. His friends, led by Vincent D'Agosta, plot to help him escape. The New York Museum of Natural History receives a mysterious package - that turns out to be diamond dust - their rare diamonds, stolen by Pendergasts brother Diogenes inDance of Death, have been reduced to nothing but powder by a vengeful Diogenes. An ancient tomb, bricked up in the catacombs of the museum, is re-opened, but strange occurrences are once again haunting the museum. And we finally learn about what caused the terrible rift between the brothers when they were young - why Diogenes is so angry. And finally the brothers have a showdown, after Diogenes seduces Constance - Pendergast's ward - and leaves her emotionally unstable.There is so much going on in this book that I don't even know where to start. So, rather than spoil it, I'll just tell you that I liked this book a great deal - I liked the fact that we're finally getting some perspective on what happened between Pendergast and Diogenes, and I enjoyed the clever device Diogenes created to cause mass hysteria/insanity in the museum. Those who are a fan of Preston and Child and/or of the Pendergast tales will not want to miss this."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This book was an amazing ending to a trilogy that I loved!

As with their other novels, I didn't feel like I was reading a book, but rather that I was there seeing it all happen in front of me. The writing is fantastic, and the plot will keep you on the edge of your seat. I would really recommend that you read Brimstone and Dance of Death before you read this, otherwise much of it doesn't make sense.I highly recommend this book, along with all of the other books by these authors."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I luved this book at best. Grabbing intro and interesting all the way through. This is not a review, it being thankful to entertaining writing. Go get it and the other Preston series."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Preston and Child have done it again. They have created a suspence novel TOGETHER that keeps the reader on his toes. There are about four stories going on at once, but they all conclude at the end of the novel. My question though, has to do with the last two words of the novel. What will they do now?"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This book was much anticipated - with the disappointment of Dance of Death, I wanted to see if Preston/Child got their acts together, and boy did they - I read this book in one session - was hooked from page 1.This takes us back to the Museum of Natural History, where we began in Relic, and the opening of another exhibit, this time a ancient Egyptian tomb that has been literally bricked up for over 50 years in the museum - We see our old friends from earlier works, including non Pendergast books, and they all mesh together beautifully.Agent Pendergast is in a high security prison, framed by his equally genius brother Diogenes. Diogenes, has been a busy boy - he stole the Museum's diamond collection, ground them to dust and sent the dust to the museum. He is able to enter Pendergast's boarded up home and woo the much protected ward Constance toward 'the dark side'. That path is sensual and exciting, and there are many revelations about Constance that make the story more rounded -The ending made me have a quick intake of breath - it took me unawares! So many of the stories in the series seem to be tied up and here is a curve ball!For those new to this series, I recommend at least reading Cabinet of Curiosities which can give you some background.The author's notes at the end of the book gave the reader a great overview of the characters' entrances into the series. It was much appreciated.This is the best in the series and if you are remotely a fan of Pendergast, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Awful and dragged out. If done in half the pages it may have been a decent book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Oh, what a tangled web they weave. Again, this Preston-Child novel, The Book of the Dead, contains so many characters and subplots it's almost too daunting to absorb and seems to bog down the read at times (though I'm still a huge fan of these authors). I stayed with the book to the very end but found myself skipping entire passages to get back to the action. Not on par with their earlier works, to be sure."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Incredible \\"end\\" to the Pendergast / Diogenes books. This is not a stand-alone Pendergast book. While you could pick it up and read it, you'd be missing out on one hell of a backstory with everything (there are 2 before this one). I highly recommend the whole series (Brimstone, Dance of Death, Book of the Dead)."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"this was my first book of the series, actually of both authors, and i am completely hooked! the action was hard core and i loved the main character pendergast. he is just the best good guy! you know kinda bad...i am definetly a serious fan and i cant wait to read everything by these authors."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This was the second book I'd read by Preston & Child, but the first with the character of Agent Pendergast. It wasn't until I finished the book that I even knew there was a trilogy and that this was the last book in it. If I'd known that, I probably would have preferred to start with at least one of the other two books in the series.I would most definitely classify this novel a page turner. It kept the action going and kept me me anxiously anticipating what was coming next. However, the authors moved various plotlines and characters ahead at the same time by skipping from one to the other. While I understand this tactic, it can be tremendously frustrating, when you're at a tense point in one storyline, to come to a screeching halt in that storyline and move to another one which may be at a very different point.Most novels of this ilk require a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief, and this one is no exception. If anything, it requires a much larger dose than the average thriller. There were portions of the story that would have been laughable had they not been in such capable hands as these authors. The story was good enough and the characters strong enough that I was able to move past the fact that there was a lot of unbelievably wacky stuff going on.While I enjoy suspense, I am not a person who enjoys reading horror, ghost stories, etc. As a result, I probably would have never bought this book had I picked it up in a bookstore because it sounded like it was going in that direction. Instead, I saw it on a \\"loaner shelf\\" at the place where I volunteer and, after reading a few pages, was relatively convinced that it wasn't going to be that kind of book, so I took it home. It is certainly suspenseful and there are elements of ghost story/horror writing in it, but it was not overdone. In fact, I will happily be returning the book to the loaner shelf next week with my recommendation to coworkers to pick it up and go for a ride! :)"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Having not read the previous books, and only found out that other books should be read prior to this one, I think I missed out on a great oppirtunity for a good read.

It managed to stand alone well enough but the Constance long-childhood thing was very unclear and hinted at annoying. If a focus was going to put on it, then it should have been flatout stated. Despite that, it was a rewarding, quick and exciting read. For a suspense novel, there were very few holes...I can't think of any except a weird statement made about Nora by her husband that seemed like something bad editing failed to catch a change in characterization. Still, a fun story great for a rainy day or beach."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"This is book 3 in the 'Pendergast trilogy,' and you should read Brimstone and Dance of Death first. Taken as an aggregate it's a very engrossing, entertaining read (taken seperately they tend to leave you hanging - at least the first two books did, so you might as well get all three at once!).The whole series is full of interesting characters and bizarre situations, and while some plot points are utterly predictable, there are still enough twists and turns that keep you guessing.

Not having a copy of \\"Dance of Death,\\" I ploughed on---happily so---with just a little trepidation regarding what seemed like a repeat plotline---some terror going on in New York's Museum of Natural History with an impending gala that surely spelled doom ala the first Pendergast novel \\"The Relic.\\" In this case, despite the repetitions, author team Preston and Child know how to churn out a great page-turner---I finished a very satisfactory read in a few non-stop and enjoyable sittings.Now for those of you who are unfamiliar with this team's efforts, this is popular writing for the general masses, winging their way through airports and train stations, wanting a compelling read to soak up tiresome commuting time. Not exactly great literature. However, it is entertaining storytelling with tight albeit sometimes improbable plot lines that have beguiling scientific or historic solutions that can't always be foreseen by the reader. The trick of utilizing a group of characters that reoccur in subsequent books allows the authors to develop the characters over time without stalling the action or the momentum of the bigger story. The short chapters drive the story forward in a manner that pushes the reader to stay up until the wee hours just to find out what happens next. The denouement satisfies as well as tantalizes---there is always that bit of a cliffhanger that ensures successful cash register sales for the next installment. (I, for one, am thrilled that \\"Wheel of Darkness\\" is due out at summer's end.)Bottom line? I am not about to spoil the plot of \\"Book of the Dead.\\" If you have followed the rather exciting overactive lives of FBI agent Pendergast, his ward, Constance Greene, his diabolical brother, Diogenes, New York Times reporter, Bill Smithback, his wife, southwestern archaeologist, Nora Kelly, police lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta, police captain Laura Hayward, museum curator Margo Green and the rest of the Museum of Natural History crew, you already know what to expect. \\"The Book of the Dead\\" does not disappoint. Recommended to those who enjoy fun, beguiling, continuous writing that doesn't take itself too seriously.Diana Faillace Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I enjoyed the book but was a little disappointed because it didn't quite live up to the build up from the previous book. The ultimate crime executed by Diogenes wasn't as diabolical as I expected and the chase at the end could have been fleshed out a lot more, with better explanations of how the pursuer tracked the pursee. Overall, though, Lincoln and Child produced another entertaining page turner."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"I have read the following novels by Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child or both: DEATH MATCH, RELIC, MONUT DRAGON, RELIQUARY, RIPTIDE, THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES, STILL LIFE WITH CROWS and THE BOOK OF THE DEAD. They are excellent writers. They are masters of the English language and have the rare ability to draw the reader into the storyline. On more than one occasion, I became so involved in the novel, I lost track of time - missed an important meeting and supper. One cannot pay a higher compliment to an author.For the second time (see my review of THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES), I read THE BOOK OF THE DEAD out of sequence. Throughout my reading, I waited for an explanation of how Pendergast got in prison. It was not until the end, that I realized that THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is the third novel in a series. Thus, my warning to the reader, read BRIMSTONE and DANCE OF DEATH first! Publishers really need to include warning labels."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead","review":"Great last book in the \\"Trilogy\\". Settles some questions raises others.

Dan Freeman (get it) is hired as the CIA's token black; he is literally &quot;the spook who sat by the door&quot;. However, Freeman has his own agenda and while the CIA is using him to alleviate pressure from white liberals, he's soaking up as much knowledge as he can. When he leaves the CIA and goes back to the 'hood, he brings an extensive background in the techniques and theories of armed insurrection and he leads the revolt against whitey.All of the familiar elements of blaxploitation abound: whitey's stupid, the hero possesses somehyper-magnetism which draws all women to him and earns the instant respect of all men, thetwo most hated groups are white liberals--who don't recognize the racism inherent in their ownideas and the black middle class--which has sold out.Later turned into a very bad movie"},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"While my political views are close to Greenlee's, I'm not a big fan of these racial apocalypse type of books. Too much like a reverse &quot;Turner Diaries&quot; for me."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"I read this work when first published, loaned it out to a friend & never saw either again. In the mid 80's, I stumbled on to a copy of a video version(!) with a street vender, when I returned with cash payment...[right], he was gone. Finally, I heard an interview with the author on radio: Not one much for fiction, this book is an exception because of its impact upon media stereotype (Africans in the New World etc); However, the interview with Sam Greenley, was key in relation to what happened to many of the people involved with the making of the film: the involvement of the FBI with Hollywood to recoup their investment then confiscate all but two copies! Mr. Greenley became a cab driver (was an educator I believe), actors like Paula Kelly could'nt work in the industry for years.I recommend this book (screenplay done by author but book is much better)to the USA, for it is classic unspoken Americana, and currently \\"on stage\\" elsewhere today."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"I must have read this great book 35 years ago and it still pops up in my memory from time to time. A black man is hired to improve a white politician's image as an &quot;equal opportunity employeer&quot; and the new hire is assigned absolutely nothing to do but sit at his desk by the door and be nothing more than background color for the politician.Well, the book really takes off when the new hire turns out to have his own agenda going and it involves being a bit more than window dressing for &quot;whitey&quot;Perhaps we should send a copy of this book to Colin Powell for Christmas."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"I rented the film about 20 years ago and found it to be simple but explosive, thought provoking, and very revolutionary.Then, I read the book and it was totally awesome. I don't usually read fiction, but once I started I could not put it down. The author, Sam Greenlee just had a knack for pulling the reader further into the story line and around each corner the excitement began again. The beginning gives no indication of what the ending has in store. Read it and have fun!!!"},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"The book is quite interesting--definitely a page turner. It serves as a very fascinating exploration of the political outlook it presents. Hard truths continually hit you with regard the portrayal not just of establishment Whites, but also of liberal Whites and middle class Blacks.I do have to take away a star based about the actual revolution plot itself, though. Many aspects of its execution require a signficant suspension of disbelief. And its goals are never detailed by the Freeman character to his soldiers, nor to the reader by Greenlee, beyond to &quot;be free&quot;, to &quot;make Whitey stop messing with us&quot; and to &quot;make Whitey choose between global interventionist policies (e.g. Vietnam) and continuing to oppress us&quot;.Um . . . OK . . . so what does that mean? U.S. military policy has long been readiness to fight two major wars on two different fronts. How do various guerilla uprisings suddenly force such a choice? And even if they do, who's to say the choice wouldn't just be to concentrate on cracking down on Blacks? And even if that weren't the choice, what exactly constitutes a victory? Do Blacks run their own neighborhoods independent of any governmental authority that has Whites in it? Black neighborhoods secede for city, state or federal government control? Or do we all move to one place and the fed governemtn turns the land over to us for our own independent nation? Or do we expect that at the end of the rebellion Whites will just magically stop being racists because we've shown we fight back?Just HOW will things be different at the end of the successful guerilla campaign? We will be &quot;free&quot;. But what does that mean? What are the precise specific objectives. You don't undertake a war without some sort of measure in that regard and that is never given to us in this novel.All that said though, the rest of the story elements are compelling and certainly make the book worth a read. Despite my criticism regarding the details of the plot, the book kept my attention from beginning to end and it had me looking long and hard until I found a copy of the movie to view also."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"If the new world order conspiracies make you think, then this book will inspire you and empower you.

Just imagine if every 'black' person read this book and took it to heart?"},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"The Spook Who Sat By the Door is a metaphor for the black man that America thinks it has control of. Karenga once wrote that, \\"The negro was made and manufactured in America\\" and it has long been the belief of white people that they have \\"their negroes\\" under control. Because of the wholesale sellouts that left the streets following federal jobs in the post-riot sixties, far too many people in trouble think that most blacks have assimilated. This book will put the lie to that pronouncement. Simply, a brother gets into the system and doesn't become OF it. He works during day, trains revolutionaries and plans by night. Although he doesn't live to see his dream come true, it is his tireless work that brings the inevitable revolution into fruition. For people who are serious about struggle and organizing, this book should be read.

However, the author made his protagonist Freeman an employee of the clandestine agency, the CIA. It's the late 1950s and early 1960s. Freeman quits the CIA, disgusted with the prejudice and careerism in the bureaucracy, and goes back home to Chicago to be a community organizer, where he uses the \\"agitprop\\" (agitate and propagandize) techniques he's learned to radicalize and push for civil rights. The novel is a send-up of the establishment keeping down the poor-and-stuck on the domestic front. I also read it as the fictionalization of what Greenlee absorbed from his embassy post as a foreign service officer, observing the operations of U.S. (and other countries, too) personnel applying similar tactics against political groups."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"I had an excellent transaction with this seller.

He was strong and a leader."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"This novel, written in the 80s (and later made into a movie by the same name), answers the question: What would happen if a modern black hero/CIA agent built a guerrilla army made up of black inner city street gangs, and incited armed insurrection in America among them?The novel's protagonist and hero is a super-square yuppy, Ivy-league trained, black spy, who just happens to have also been the first black CIA Agent. His job as a spy was to monitor community-based radicals from a non-profit CIA storefront in an inner city black Chicago neighborhood. However, the whole time the CIA thought he was spying on community radicals, he was in fact actually assuming the role of a double agent training and helping to foment black revolutionary aims in the inner city.After he left the CIA, he succeeded in teaching street gangs all of the tools of normal CIA spy tradecraft and set up revolutionary cells in Chicago that were eventually replicated across the country's inner cities. And although he was eventually caught up with and killed, his martyrdom, incited riots in ghettoes across the country. Over night, America literally became James Baldwin's \\"the fire next time.\\" Black people took to the streets to redress century old grievances.The significance of the novel today in our post-modern \\"post-racial\\" times is that it recalls from deep within the white subconscious one of white America's rawest psychic fears: a revenge movement on the part of blacks to get back at whites for a half millennium of slavery and discrimination. At least up through the riots of the Civil Right's era, this was more than just a palpable fear.But a second reason this idea still has currency is that at least one author, Webster Tarpley, a well-known conspiracy theorist, in his book about Obama, (The Unauthorized Biography of Barack Obama (BHO)) theorizes that BHO has been a \\"controlled agent\\" of the plutocrats, who was also \\"sheep-dipped\\" in intelligence as a Chicago community organizer. Now, that he has been elected President, Tarpley in his book worries and wonders out loud whether Obama may indeed become a real modern day \\"spook who sat by the door.\\"Given the way BHO has condemned and lambasted black men as a whole, and especially those within the inner cities, I believe Tarpley's fears are misguided. The real fear is whether or not BHO is being used in exactly the way the plutocrats intended for him to be used: To advance the plutocratic agenda. Tarpley can rest assured that the limp-wristed President we have in the Oval Office today will not rise to the level of being another \\"Spook who sat by the Door.\\" An insightful book even though its material is finally dated.

The author presents a character that manipulates our perceptions about the ideal hero, anti-hero, and antagonist all to satisfy an agenda set on puting power and courage back in the hands of the people. It really makes you wonder about the apperances and the assumptions we all make based upon what people allow us to see about themselves.The beauty of this book rests in the realization that you never really know the motivation behind the actions of some people. There really could be a &quot;spook&quot; working with the President or on an executive board with a major corporation that is planning to unleash the fury of a downtrodden socio-econmic class and show what potential is being wasted on street corners and in jails in every city and the consequences of turning a blind eye to the people that bear the brunt of society's worst hypocricy- equal opportunity."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"I am not a person who reads alot of books but this book was a rare exception, I read the whole book in one night.

I don't agree with killing for freedom but at the same time, I ironically understood many of Freeman's decisions. I can't give this book five stars because I don't agree with the overall turn-out of the book, but I would have to give it four and a half because it was a page-turner, interesting, intriguing, enlightening, and educational.

If the Soviets hadn't recruited an army of Black terrorists by 1975, chances were they never would.The Spook Who Sat By The Door is essentially a dystopaian novel under just that kind of premise, but this time it's internal; what would happen if the CIA trained a Black man as a secret agent, and he used what he'd learned to destroy them? Dan Freeman is recruited into the CIA, not on the basis of talent, but because it's election time. A patronizing pseudo-liberal senator needs a gimmick to get Black votes, and what could be better than integration of the CIA? He's certain he'll gain the support of the NAACP and the CORE with a big splash in the papers, \\"Senator Stanley McLiberal demands Black trainee for CIA.\\" And get them in they do, but only Freeman passes the course. It turns out he's extremely qualified for the job; college grad, army officer, combat veteran, martial artist, etc. He refuses to associate with his laid-back Southern classmates, none of whom last the month. He trains hard, practicing his marksmanship on his own time, going out of his way to be the best at everything there is to know in the CIA; weapons, ordnance, communications, propaganda. Then of course he goes back to Chicago, recruits street gangs for a terrorist organization, and all hell breaks loose.I'm told this novel caused a big stir in the 70's, but today it appears forgotten. It's not included in any collections of African American literature, and the only copy I could find was almost 20 years old. Sam Greenlee had been in the US foreign service, but unlike the character in the book, he got sent overseas and was in Baghdad during the 1958 revolution. Perhaps the book might seem dated to some, with no mention of computers or cell phones. There's also a generational gap in the music styles; Freeman listens to John Coltrain and Miles Davis, while today's young people would be into hip-hop and R&B.; The late 1960's \\"summers of rage,\\" where America's cities burned, is not as familiar to young people today.There are some funny aspects to this book. The street gangs play all kind of pranks on the police and the National Guard; they rob an armory, kidnap a General, play cat-and-mouse with the National Guardsmen, broadcast calls to arms from a cassette player mounted on the El, and when the Guardsmen try to take it down, they find too late that it's booby-trapped. First the police can't handle it, then the National Guard comes in, and the National Guard are all weekend servicemen whose \\"stand and fight\\" training is useless in an urban setting. The General, despite his bravado, is unqualified for a combat role, and finds that his regiment are really just trained to march in parades. It reminded me of the book \\"First Blood\\" where a battle-hardened Green Beret wipes out these weekend warriors. The scene where the kidnapped General is found babbling reminds us of a scene from Ralph Bakshi's \\"Coonskin.\\"It's time this book were brought back to light. It's a great parable on what the USA was at the time; a racially charged environment full of angry young people and adults who hated them."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat by the Door","review":"I did not know what to really expect from this book.

He ends up paying with his life. Laura Cheney is a gently-bred lady with spunk. She's went through labor alone and she's penniless. While she digging for water, her son is kidnapped by the man who won her in a bet. Though she has no money, Laura is desperate and goes into town. She finds Deke Sheridan, a white man raised by Indians. After an illuminating conversation, he agrees to help her. I really liked this couple. Deke was harsh, but only because of his past and the surroundings he lived in. CA slowly gets Deke to respect Laura's determination (riding a horse after giving birth only three days prior, continuing on the trail while ill) and her feistiness. He also saves her life by telling his brother that she's his wife, much to Laura's dismay, but she learns their ways and comes to respect Deke's adopted family. As a mother, I felt for Laura when she realized her son was missing, and I could empathize with her wanted to find him so desperately. Deke was a heartthrob, too. He's not very educated in the intellectual sense, and his mouth is foul sometimes, but he did know a lot about human nature. Laura's steel-tempered gentility slowly cracks the shell that has become Deke's shield for so long."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Amber","review":"Catherine Anderson is a masterful storyteller and \\"Cheyenne Amber\\" is a polished tale. Amazingly, Anderson's story flows with harmony and heartwarming emotion.Deke Sheridan is a hero. I don't know what source Catherine Anderson draws upon to sketch her heros, but that man must be a dream. For Ms. Anderson always writes the ultimate male. Consistently, Anderson's heros are rugged, tough, protective males, but so sensitive. Her men are every woman's fantasy.Laura Cheney, a dignified lady from Boston, has journeyed through hell courtesy of her husband! Tristan Cheney was a cruel, vindictive, unsupportive man. Fortunately for Laura Cheney he died the same way he lived - with brutal force. Fortunately for Laura Cheney - she met Deke Sheridan. Fortunately for the reader - Anderson supervises their romance.Laura Cheney is a penniless widow and her newborn son is missing. Courageously, she begs Deke Sheridan for his help, but Deke Sheridan is not interested in Laura's \\"white world\\" dilemma. Raised by the Cheyenne, Sheridan sees trouble in Laura's bruised eyes -- trouble he wishes to avoid. In spite of his misgivings, Laura soon earns his respect and support.This author provides an exquisite tale. Ms. Anderson uses humor and description to tell this story. This reader hung on to her every word. She gives her reader solid direction by creating real characters and delivering vivid scenes. Well done, Catherine Anderson.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Amber","review":"Deke Sheridan wants nothing to do with the woman who entered the Saloon, disheveled and desperate, pointing a broken and unloaded gun at him, in order to gain his help finding her missing son.Laura has suffered through a horrible marriage to a drunkard husband who abused her and gambled all their money away. Now, her husband is killed and she is left utterly alone in a place she barely knows. She has just given birth several days before, all by herself, there had been no one there to help her, and her husband had been away gambling. In short, Laura is a survivor, and she is desperate to find her missing baby.Deke finds himself unable to refuse this woman's desperate plea, as he sees the anguish in her eyes, and the courage she displays. He finally agrees to help her, since he is the best tracker there is.From there on the adventure starts, as they set out to find Laura's baby, and begin to care for each other, and then fall in love. This story will make you laugh out loud, some parts were hilarious. Then there were some moments that were so tender, and beautiful to make you smile and sigh in love. And there are moments that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, in suspense. And moments that are deeply moving.Great story, great characters.The banter between Laura and Deke is one of the most memorable I have ever read in any book. A precious, funny, moving, suspenseful and unforgettable story. An excellent read, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Amber","review":"I love the way Catherine Anderson tells a story. I wish there were more books like this. I have read all her books"},{"Title":"Cheyenne Amber","review":"Overall Rating: 4.95 // Action: 4.5 / Emotion: 5 / Romance: 4.5 / Sensuous: 1 / Intrigue: 2 / Western Flavor: 4 // Humor: 21 / Tears: 8The are several reasons why absolutely loved \\"Cheyenne Amber\\" by Catherine Anderson. First, have always been a fan of western romances, particularly those that feature Indians or Half-breeds. Second, Catherine Anderson is a favorite author, so was pre-disposed towards enjoying the book before even opening the cover. Third, loved the hero's personality; namely, his confidence, his maleness, his disregard for polite society, his ability to overcome the obstacles thrown in his path (both physical and emotional). Fourth, the book is peppered with laugh-out-loud humor as the hero and heroine communicate on totally different wave-lengths. Fifth, become emotionally invested in the plight of the hero and heroine, suffering pangs of sympathy with tears.\\"Cheyenne Amber\\" contains all the necessary characteristics that make for a great read. {1} An amazing alpha hero, who is not afraid to reveal his vulnerabilities and risk opening his heart again. {2} A wonderfully entertaining, wounded, yet strong, heroine, who eventually lowers the barriers around her heart. {3} Lots of western-style action to keep the story moving at a swift pace (and shine a light on the hero's skills). {4} A book so well-written than the emotional involvement reaches both ends of the spectrum: heart-felt laughter and soul-searing tears. {5} The romance of a man who is determined to find a way to keep the woman he loves and have a happily-ever-after. {6} A tad bit a suspense that keeps the reader just a little bit on edge at times (i.e., {a} will they find Laura's son, {b} will Francisco catch up to them; {3} will Deke ever get through to Laura).Even though all the above factors are necessary to make a great read, the most wonderful aspect of this book is the dialogue that flows between Deke and Laura. As with all Catherine Anderson books, \\"Cheyenne Amber\\" is a must read. Her wit and sense of humor come shining through in bright, vivid detail.Wolf Bear Does Books presents more in-depth, detailed, review of \\"Cheyenne Amber\\"."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Amber","review":"This was a pretty decent read. I have read better but it was a page turner. The idea of Laura hiring Deke as a tracker to find her son who was kidnapped by Comancheros was good. The attraction between them seemed to be pretty one-sided at first. Deke seemed to like Laura right away. Laura's attraction to Deke became apparent midway through the book. I found Deke's way of speaking to be sweetly amusing. I could almost literally hear him.I would recommend this book. It was a pretty decent romance novel."},{"Title":"June Roth's Fast and Fancy Cookbook","review":"Lots of photos throughout (in both color and black & white) make this is a fun book to look through! Its chock full of great china pieces, glass and cookware(see how many you can identify - I love playing that game with old cookbooks!). The recipes are imaginative and very mid-century faux exotic, lots of \\"Chinese\\" recipes with the only real Asian ingredient being a little soy sauce, and similar minded \\"curries\\", etc. - although not truly international fare -and who could get authentic ingredients in the 1960s outside of San Fran or NYC anyway- many of these are truly delicious and sport glamorous, foreign-sounding names.

This is what it takes to deal adequately with the issues of science and specifically Christian theology. This book gives an alternative to literal creationism, intelligent design, theistic evolution, scientism and other popular options. It is the book I as a Christian have been seeking for a long time. Other than being too brief, it does an excellent job at bringing the focus back on Christ rather than all the details that have kept us bogged down in endless debates. Buy this book, and get one for a friend!"},{"Title":"The Cosmos in the Light of the Cross","review":"I have often wondered why so many books on science and Christian faith say so little about Christ. When such books focus on origins, fossils and floods, it makes me wonder why Christians support them so strongly. Finally, here is a book that turns the priorities around and gets the focus back on Christ, showing profound connections between what the Bible says about Christ and what we see (and don't see) in nature. This book will help any Christian to see what matters in the creation/evolution debate, and will offer new insights into the meaning of familiar Bible passages.George Murphy is a Lutheran pastor with a Ph.D. in quantum physics. Hence he is fully qualified to represent authentic Christian theology and authentic, up-to-date understanding of modern science. I highly recommend this book to all thoughtful readers on these subjects."},{"Title":"The Cosmos in the Light of the Cross","review":"George Murphy holds a PhD in physics from Johns Hopkins and an MDiv from Wartburg Seminary, making him one of a rather small group of people with advanced degrees in both science and theology.His goal in this book is \\"to discern the presence and activity in the universe of the God revealed in the cross\\", which he calls \`chiasmic cosmology', and to \\"consider the scientific picture of the world in the context of such a theology.\\" He begins by discussing the history of the role of natural theology in Chapter 2. In chapter 3 (Theology of the Crucified God) he points to the cross-resurrection pattern in the Bible. Chapter 4 is a very brief overview of how scientists understand astronomy, modern physics, chemistry, biology, and paleontology.In chapter 5 he discusses scientific and theological methods for understanding the world, concluding that a \\"human being cannot through some knowledge achieved entirely by her or his own efforts know God or God's purposes in the world.\\" Chapter 6 (God's Action in the World) is a good summary of models of divine action, suffering & evil, and miracles. Murphy draws an analogy between the kenosis of Christ and God voluntarily limiting his divine action in the world. Chapter 7 (The Origin of the Universe) is a very readable summary of cosmologists' current understanding.Chapter 8 (Evolution as Creation) is a very nice summary of the status of origin-of-life research and a summary of evolution theory and its theological implications. Murphy believes that God does things in the world through natural processes, quoting Charles Kingsley, \\"We knew of old that God was so wise that He could make all things; but behold, He is so much wiser than even that, that He can make all things make themselves.\\" Regarding death before the Fall, Murphy suggests that \\"extinction and natural selection are the mark of the cross placed on the biosphere.\\"Chapters 9, 10 and 11 discuss Technology and Ethics, Medicine and Bioethics, and The Natural Environment. In Chapter 12 (The Goal of Creation) Murphy argues that the purpose of the universe was to evolve so that God could become incarnate and that \\"the incarnation was not only a solution to the problem of sin (though it was that) but the very reason for there to be a universe.\\" [p. 184]He refers to Scripture throughout, using it to support his viewpoints. On a number of issues, including the anthropic principle and the identity of Adam, he presents various views without taking a strong position.I saw this book referred to so many times that I finally had to read it, despite its relatively high price. The author succeeds in his goal of keeping Christ in the creation-evolution debate. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in that debate."},{"Title":"The Mehndi Kit; Learn the Traditional Art of Henna Body Decoration","review":"This henna book had some of the best mehndi designs for hands I have seen. Most books give you beautiful pictures but don't take the time to explain each design. This book does. The hand art is a must for people starting out.The only bad thing about this book and the kit it comes with is it has the smallest amount of henna I have seen in any kit. 5 grams isn't much at all. Plus, the solution to mix with the henna is a dry crystalized form that doesn't appear to have all natural ingredients. I think this is bad since Mehndi is a purely natural body art.

In no particular order:1) Weiss' severe scolding of, and warnings about, brokers and brokerages were in fact right on the money. He was proven correct by events that happened after he wrote about them. In fact, some brokerages and investment bankers were worse than he had described.2) Yes, in fact he does sell several newsletters of the doom and gloom variety, but to his credit, does not peddle them in the body of the book.3) Mentioned should be made of his description of using Treasury-only checking accounts for regular banking. It is quite useful.4) Similarly mention should be made of his interesting strategy of investing in mutual funds, moving freely amongst the funds as other traders (e.g. me) would move amongst stocks. Maybe it is common knowledge, but it wasn't to anyone I know. I think this one I will try.All in all, for persons who read mostly conventional books for advice about stock trading, this book provides a very interesting perspective for traders of any age.

This warning needs frequent repeating. But Dr. Weiss fails to meet the needs of those who know they know little, and are looking for help in navigating among &quot;trusted&quot; mutual fund companies such as TIAA-CREF, Fidelity, Vanguard, and the like. These companies have deserved reputations for providing sound investment vehicles, but they, too, have their dogs. For the most part, these companies seem to aim at giving their customers the option of informed choice in electing a comfortable level of risk. For one who is inexperienced and building for retirement, some help in exercising that choice would be welcome.

No one I have read recently has put more legitimate effort into the clarification of the current Stock Market madness. He has for years been pounding the table to get the attention of the sleeping public. I was a lost investor and now I have finally seen the light. This clear, well documented and researched book guides the hapless investor who has been lead by the nose by corporate lackeys toward the green pastures of financial reality. Bannished is the false promise of double digit returns, blown away is the magician's accounting wand, uprooted is the greedy corporate money tree, and stripped away is the emperor's phoney three piece balance sheet.What is finally revealed to the immature and naive investor is the grotesque shakey skeleton of the U.S. stock market. Behind the facade of hundred year old buildings and high tech trading floors is the pupeteer who is manipulating the lifeless carcass of a soon to be crumbling giant. At last we have the real picture and Martin Wiess must be listened to if you want to protect your financial body.

No one in the corporate controlled media, no one in the corporate controlled analysts ant hill, no one in the impartial accounting world, and no one on CNN, FOX, CBS, ABC and FNN.

Also, most mutual fund companies frown on the kind of frequent trading the system can dictate. Of course, there are always ETFs, and some companies, like ProFunds, don't care how much you trade.I have a diversified portfolio, based on Modern Portfolio Theory, but instead of rebalancing once a year, I use the indicators in the book to decide when to sell the excess value of a winning fund, and when to buy enough shares of an underweight fund to bring it up to its target weight.I almost never sell at the exact peak, but I generally take my profits before the fund tanks. And, I almost never buy at the exact bottom, but I generally get back to target weight before the fund starts a big run-up. So, I ultimately end up buying low(er) and selling high(er) than I would without his indicators.I still don't have the software.

Later the series became a tetralogy with the publication ofAge of Extremes : The Short Twentieth Century 1914-1991.Although each book stands up as a volume in it's own right it is very difficult, when finishing one, to not want to continue to find out 'what happens next' even if you know perfectly well what happens. And this is because, even though the books are not narratives in the normal sense of the term, the way Hobsbawm draws out the themes and events of each period really makes you want to find out how he is going to explain subsequent developments.This volume, like the others in the series, is made up of more-or-less discreet essays on individual aspects of the period under consideration. Each subject is a chapter and the chapters are gathered together into three sections - Part 1: Revolutionary Prelude, Part 2: Developments and Part 3: Results. The chapters in Part 2 include The Great Boom, The World Unified, Conflicts and War, Building Nations, The Forces of Democracy, Losers, Winners and Changing Society. And then in Part 3, he looks at the effects of these developments.Partly because of this structure but also partly because of the quality of the writing, it is a really interesting and illuminating read. So much of what we are living through today has its seeds in this and the previous period; to make any sense of the world today this is required reading.There have been some criticism of Hobsbawm for being overtly Marxist in his outlook and theoretical basis. He says himself in his introduction:\\"The historian cannot be objective about the period which is his subject. In this he differs (to his intellectual advantage) from its most typical ideologists, who believed that the progress of technology, 'positive science' and society made it possible to view their present with the unanswerable impartiality of the natural scientist, whose methods they believed (mistakenly) to understand. The author of this book cannot conceal a certain distaste, perhaps a certain contempt, for the age with which it deals, though one mitigated by admiration for its titanic material achievements and by the effort to understand even what he does not like. He does not share the nostalgic longing for the certainty, the self-confidence, of the mid-nineteenth-century bourgeois world which tempts many who look back upon it from the crisis-ridden western world a century later. His sympathies lie with those to whom few listened a century ago.\\" (P17)In the preface to this edition, he expands on these comments:\\"This has been read by some as a declaration of intent to be unfair to the Victorian bourgeoisie and the age of its triumph. Since some people are evidently unable to read what is on the page, as distinct from what they think must be there, I would like to say clearly that this is not so. In fact, as at least one reviewer has correctly recognised, bourgeois triumph is not merely the organising principle of the present volume, but 'it is the bourgeoisie who receive much the most sympathetic treatment in the book'. For good or ill, it was their age, and I have tried to present it as such, even at the cost of - at least in this brief period - seeing other classes not so much in their own right, as in relation to it.\\" (P11)So leave your prejudices and pre-formed opinions at the door and read a remarkably inclusive, erudite and, above all, readable history of this formative period."},{"Title":"The age of capital, 1848-1875 (History of civilization)","review":"name a single European event that happened between 1848 and 1875...quick! My guess is that a lot of non-Europeans would have a hard time with that one. Yet it was an astonishingly influential period, the time when both capitalism and imperialism became truly, irreversibly entrentched. Hobsbawm tells the tale masterfully. Reading the book, it's hard to believe he didn't actually live through this time himself. The book is a superb marriage of narrative with historical detail. Read it. Read all three."},{"Title":"The age of capital, 1848-1875 (History of civilization)","review":"Um, a few observations are in order. Firstly, Marx's critique of history, economics, and society must not be confused with the later activity of Lenin, Stalin, Mao, nor Ho Chi Min: just because they used Marx as their point of departure does in no way diminish Marx's project. Secondly, Hobsbawm is a Marxist historiographer--not a Marxist per se. Thirdly, the period 1848-75 witnessed some remarkably convulsive and important events: 1) the Crimean War [Britian burned on the Black Sea], 2) the Dano-Prussian War [Prussian victory at D&uuml;pple], 3) the Austro-Prussian War [Prussian victory at Sadowa], 4) German unification under Bismarck, and 5) the Franco-Prussian War which resulted in the spectacular German victory at Sedan, the collapse of the Second Empire, the Paris Commune, and the establishment of the Third Republic.

Get the book."},{"Title":"The age of capital, 1848-1875 (History of civilization)","review":"After the collapse of the Revolutions of 1848, Europe as a whole was pretty quiet until 1914. Economically, however, the period is divided by a serere economic downturn areound 1875. This book covers the first part of this period, when European and American Capitalism grew strong.Since Hobsbawm is a Marxist, he's not much of a fan of this period, but his coverage of it is quite evenhanded and honest. Again, as in the first book, he's challenging to read, but worth the effort."},{"Title":"The age of capital, 1848-1875 (History of civilization)","review":"Excelente libro que resalta y muestra de manera clara los origenes del complejo siglo XX.

What one notices in this and in his other books on Western history is that his animus toward capitalism and his approbation of socialism is never far fom the surface. The closer he writes of the late 20th century, the more vicious his bile is toward a freewheeling style capitalism; and conversely the further he is removed in time from that era, the less his writing becomes a screed. THE AGE OF CAPITAL examines how capitalism became entrenched in the fabric of Western society. As Hobsbawm writes of expanding populations, of the growth of a solid middle class mercantilism, of an explosion of technology and literacy, one can read between the lines to sense that he bemoans the obvious fact that capitalism, and not an incipient socialism under Marx and Engels, became the invigorating factor that created a market economy that would in a few more decades lead to the internecine wars of the next century. As Hobsbawm relates how the mid 19th century saw an acceleration of human growth and capital, it is as if he were setting up an economic straw man that begged for the emergence of a Marx to puncture that capitalist piggy balloon. For those readers who speak glowingly of Hobsbawm's soaring critical vision that is not at all impacted by his acknowledged Marxist bias, I suggest that it is quite impossible for any Marxist to claim credibility to write fairly and impartially of matters historical, since it is that same soaring vision that somehow managed to overlook and excuse the tens of millions of miserable human beings who died under the red star of socialism merely to prove futiley that Marx was right all along."},{"Title":"Wilfred Thesiger The Marsh Arabs","review":"Thesiger's travels through the lands of 'Arabia', and his observations about the people who lived there, are important...and wonderful. I don't know why this book is out of print, since it describes brilliantly (and compassionately) the now-vanished world of Iraq's Marsh Arabs. This book was written in the mid-20th century, about the tribes who live/d at the confluence of the Tigris & Euphrates rivers. They lived (and are still trying to live) in what is probably the cradle of civilization, although Sadaam Hussein drained the marshes to end the resistance of the tribes there. Westerners struggling to understand the middle-east can start with anything by Thesiger. He retained some of the British Imperialist condescention toward Arabs, but seemed to feel a similar condescention toward his British peers...kind of a cranky guy.

The exercises attempt to work all the muscle groups, and also your heart. The system has the following key attributes: 1) it works, keeping a minimal level of cardiovascular and muscular fitness 2) it takes only 15 minutes, guaranteed, which even the busiest of us can handle 3) you don't break a sweat, so there is little cool-down time or wet clothes when done 4) it requires no equipment 5) it can be done in a motel room with as little as 6 foot by 4 foot space 6) it is easy to remember (well reasonably) 7) it is graded, so you can progress steadily (with the accompanying sense of achievement) or drop back a level if you miss a few days or weeks.

Progress up the charts is gentle and so gradually paced that aches and injuries are minimized, and one feels a real sense of accomplishment as he or she advances up each level. When the aches and pains are at a minimum, one is more likely to stay with the program in those early weeks when temptation is high to quit. It is the perfect blend of calisthenics to tone and strengthen the major muscle groups and aerobics to keep the cardiovascular system fit. I have enjoyed and benefited from this program greatly over the years. Now as an older version of myself I'm happy to return to it.That being said, there are some limitations to the program, but they're easy enough to work around. They are outlined in the book \\"Rating the Exercises: How To Choose the Exercise That Suits You Best\\" by Charles Kuntzleman (1980). In it fitness experts evaluate a number of different fitness programs that were popular in the early 80s. They criticized the 5BX and XBX for not having appropriate warm-up and cool-down periods to allow for stretching and prevention of muscle injury. The rebuttal to that is the warm-up period was built into the calisthenics so extra warm up wouldn't be necessary. So, if you feel you need stretching, then do that. Also, they criticized what appeared to be some outdated exercises, which seems reasonable. Some of the variations of the exercises, such as #1 (toe touches) and #3 (the Superman) include hyperextensions of the back that could lead to injury in some persons, especially those with delicate backs. 5BX includes bouncing on toe touches and has straight-leg sit ups, which have since been rejected by every modern fitness expert for being potentially injurious to the lower back. These are easy enough to compensate for--just don't bounce on toe touches or do the stretch at the top, bend knees when doing sit ups, and don't hyperextend the back. Additionally, Kuntzleman's experts thought that the duration of the walk/run activity was of too short a duration to have much benefit. I'll leave that up to the individual to decide. Recent studies by Kenneth Cooper, the Aerobics guru of the 70s and 80s, have shown that over-exercise leads to oxidation and premature aging of the cells, and that one actually needs much less exercise than previously thought in earlier decades. Some sources indicate a brisk 20-minute daily walk is all one needs to begin reaping the benefits of cardiovascular fitness. I'm of the opinion that the 20-minute daily walk I will do is better than the 30-minute run I won't do. It's a super fitness program. Good luck finding a book, though. If you can't, there are free .pdf versions available online if you Google it. Like Second City Television and Celine Dion, this is another gem from our neighbors to the north.

Rebecca Elliot was left a widow at only eighteen and wanted to travel to find her brother in Sacramento, California. But she was told that she couldn't travel with the wagon train alone. Deciding quickly to find a man to marry and then annul the marriage in Sacramento, Becky chooses Clay Fraser who, with his brother Garth, is traveling to Sacramento on the same wagon train. She gets Clay drunk and finds a preacher who marries them. The trip to Sacramento is a really interesting one, because Clay has discovered what Becky did - so has Garth - and insists that she will definitely live up to her wedding vows, but she insists she won't. Along the long, dangerous trip from Missouri to California both people find that the other is strong and loyal. They find that bonds made during the journey have a way of changing life. This was excellent."},{"Title":"The Frasers-Clay","review":"In 1865 Vermont widow Rebecca Elliot makes it to Independence, Missouri where she plans to join a wagon train heading to California where her brother lives. Though she purchased a wagon with mules, she learns that single women including widows are not allowed on the wagon train as they cause too much of a dangerous distraction. She needs a husband by the morning or she will be left behind.Though she feels guilty, she uses her wiles to cons Clay Fraser into coming into her hotel room, getting him drunk, and having a judge marry them. The next morning Clay is irate as his brother Garth chuckles. Though his trust in females is zero following his fianc&eacute;e's jilting him and his sister's elopement, Clay warns her he expects conjugal rights, which she refuses. On the trail, Clay admires his wife's spunk and soon he and Rebecca fall in love, but he is the poster boy for Johnny Reb and she is the grieving widow who blames him and his kind for killing her spouse at the beginning of the war.This intriguing western romance stars two fine protagonists who display the impact of the Civil War though the fighting is over. Rebecca has no options left in New England as a war widow and she loathes the South; Clay saw his relationship with his fianc&eacute;e end while he dodged bullets a carpetbagger married her. Together this delightful couple struggle not to fall in love while Garth and the reader chuckle at their failure to achieve their stated shared objective during their gender battles. This is a fine tale and hopefully Garth's romance will follow soon.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Frasers-Clay","review":"Rebecca lost her husband in the Civil War.

It's cute that the hero's aristocratic roots contribute to his greater cleanliness in the western outpost.

If you are not familiar with the poetry of E.E. Cummings, this book will make you a surefire fan. The verse is sensitive, gentle and intimate. Beautifully paired with the whimsical, delicate and ever-bright illustrations by Mary Claire Smith, this book will sing to you and your child's hearts.There are very few stories about Christmas which capture the essence of what all the decorations and packages truly represent. This is one of those few. The illustrations bring us back to a time when family and friends, hand-made gifts and music together were what were truly valued. Where Christmas was a festival which celebrated warmth, light, life and love.For those who are sensitive to the masses of trees which are erased from our earth each Christmas, please take a look at this book. I especially appreciate that the angel who takes the tree from the forest to the child carries the tree with roots intact and then, through Ms. Smith's illustrations, the tree is pictured potted.

Sammy looks everywhere, but what she finds instead of Marique is a little elf girl sitting in a tree! At first Sammy thinks Santa's actually sent down a pal, if you know what I mean. But when Sammy get's closer she finds and eight year old little girl who has dreams of the moon. Apparently she's not to fond of \\"The Borsh-man\\" either. No suprise though because she's constantly running off! But she took to Sammy imediately! So now Sammy has a little friend to watch!And to top it all off this mystery, for once, is one Sammy does not want to be stuck in. Unfotunately that is not what happens! The woman who is owner of the dog is EXTREMELY rich! Richer than Marissa! (Which came as a slight shock to her!) And this woman is no Teddy Bear! She's a Croc! (Or that's at least the only way Sammy can describe her.) So when she finds out that Sammy lost her \\"Precious Baby\\" well she's got it in for Sammy! This woman is a bit too nosy and has one in-or-out way to blackmail Sammy. (And just about everyone else in that town!)So Sammy is stuck in the middle of this mystery.Well Sammy thinks it's just a missing dog until she finds out the dogs been dognapped! With a ransom note and all! Well once again Sammy uses her genius mind to figure this mystery out! And as usual you never know until the end. I thought I knew who it was and I was pretty dran close but I didn't figure it out quite right. She figures it out with some mighty hidden clues!I LOVED this book so much I finished it in ONE day!

It's so badly written, I constantly find myself editing it in my head. Obviously, the style is intentional and designed to capture a child's voice but many books are able to do this without such lousy sentence structure.

If you're a teacher who cares about the written word, I'd highly recommend steering kids to a different series!"},{"Title":"Sammy Keyes and the Runaway Elf","review":"Lots of series can be read out of order, (Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, Boxcar Children), without losing much. That's true of the Sammy Keyes books, since each is a stand alone. But, I've read a couple of them now, and realize that the books become deeper, and the Sammy character becomes more interesting, complicated and developed, from book to book.There's a big difference in the reading experience between, say, \\"Sammy Keyes and the Hotel Thief\\", which is book one, and \\"Sammy Keyes and the Psycho Kitty Queen\\", which is number nine. \\"Runaway Elf\\" is number four, and while it is still pretty much a juvenile mystery/adventure the Sammy character is beginning to develop, the secondary characters are coming into focus, and the mystery is better. This is where the series begins to develop into a little more than just \\"The Boxcar Children\\".If your young reader really likes it I'd recommend starting with the first volume and working through them.

The field is dense, the historiography deep, and finding anything new to say sometimes seems impossible. This makes Samuel Edgerton's &quot;Heritage of Giotto's Geometry&quot; all the more remarkable. Edgerton's big question is this: Why did the Scientific Revolution take place in Europe, and catch on first in Italy? He argues that the development in the arts-- most critically the invention of linear perspective, but also innovations in technical drawing, chiaroscuro, and the use of geometry in art-- were the catalyst. The book discusses familiar art historical subjects, mining and medical books, Galileo's drawings of the moon, and Chinese drawings of Western engravings: an amazing range of materials. The book is a model of erudition in another way: it demonstrates how traditional scholarly detective work and clear prose can be used in the service of deeply radical arguments. The book has less jargon than a trendy journal's table of contents."},{"Title":"The Heritage of Giotto's Geometry: Art and Science on the Eve of the Scientific Revolution","review":"Have you ever been to Florence? If so, perhaps you are aware that one of the greatest achievements of the Western artistic revolution, namely the invention of linear perspective, occurred there in the heart of Tuscany. Edgerton examines the relationship between that artistic revolution and the scientific revolution which began with Galileo in this same city. He points out that it was a tradition of medieval Christian doctrine for the privelidged gentry to know Euclidean geometry, since one might discover in Euclidean geometry God's very thinking process. Geometric linear perspective was invented and quickly accepted in western Europe as Christians thought that they were then perceiving a replica of the same underlying structure of reality that God concieved in the act of Creation. Edgerton explains that the new way in which this reality was represented, using the tools of linear perspective and chiaroscuro, invented by Renaissance artists, paved the way for scientific practice, impacting both science and technology. He demonstrates a knowledge of church history, geometry, optics, art and history of science. The book is packed with interesting illustrations. All in all it is a fascinating account of two important revolutions and their interconnectedness."},{"Title":"Justice Is Served","review":"Another great book by the author of Whoever FightsMonsters.

I took several tests before this book and scored consistently higher than 160. I did well on the first practice test in the book. Then I read it. I actually scored well below my average, on tests from all different sources, until I was able to mentally undo a lot of the tips the book gave me. It outlines systems you can use for arguments that don't apply even to the practice tests in the book! One of the primary strategies is to guess on 6 questions in every section to save time, because the author does a lot of assuming its audience is stupid and incapable of finishing. (Finishing all of the questions isn't even a strategy the book considers.) You could get almost all of the relevant tips for free on a good website and the ones you can't are shady at best anyway. (They should call the book LSAT Mediocrity or just stop printing it.)"},{"Title":"A Wizard In The Way","review":"THE WARLOCK IN SPITE OF HIMSELF is one of SCENT's more powerful agents. Rod Galloglass is dedicated to finding the lost colonies and bringing democracy to them. He is permanently assigned to the planet Gramarye, a medieval type of place with potent psychics. Rod's oldest son Magus is one of the most powerful psychics in the universe. Although he no longer works for SCENT, he and his companion Alea and their ship Herkimer roam the galaxy trying to save people from tyrants.Herkimer picks up television signals from a lost planet of Old Earth. Magnus AKA Gar Pike and Alea learns the cities have deteriorated and a nasty feudal society exists. Most of the residents are mistreated serfs while the overlords are magicians who control the local ghosts (energy forces that acquire the memory of the dead) used to frighten the peasants. Gar and Alea with the help of some intrepid locals begins a revolution that brings the planet one step closer to democracy.Christopher Stasheff has provided his fans with many pleasant novels that center on the exploits of Rod and his kin. The latest tale, A WIZARD IN THE WAY, is another entertaining combination of science fiction and fantasy in a universe where the mundane, magical, and technological live side by side. Anyone who relishes an action adventure tale set on a distant planet in a far away galaxy will want to read this book and its predecessors.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Wizard In The Way","review":"If you've read Stasheff before, you know what to expect. A pleasant mix of science fiction and fantasy, with some philosophy, political science, and religion thrown in. Stasheff has been amazingly productive this year, publishing something like four books in six months. I would say that this is a wonderful thing, since I love his books and always look forward to reading the next installments in all his series, except for one thing...There were some strange little mistakes the kept cropping up. To tell the truth, they appear to be more in the nature of poor editting than hurried writing. A character would say something, and the other would answer with a phrase that almost fit, but not quite...or the second character would echo the first character, with an extra set of quotes and all, except the first character never said that exact word. It seems like an overzealous editor changed part of a conversation without making sure to keep all the dialogue consistent.If you're holding your breath waiting for Magnus and Alea to resolve things...breathe. You'll have to wait for at least one more book. A new friend has joined them, and the world they are visiting bears a striking resemblance to Magnus' home planet in many respects...local life forms interracting with human psi-powers, large numbers of local espers.... They use the Tao to help the planet overthrow their cruel overlords.The story was fun, and I definately can't wait for the next adventure (not the least because I'm waiting for Alea and Magnus to resolve all this sexual tension...), but I was surprised and disappointed to see the strange little inconsistencies in the writing...such things jar me out of the story and ruin my ability to immerse myself completely in Stasheff's wonderful stories."},{"Title":"A Wizard In The Way","review":"Magnus D'Armand,AKA Gar Pike, is the son of Rodney D'Armand, the greatest agent SCENT has ever known. He has, or rather he will have with the aid of his family, changed a medieval society of telepaths into the strongest force for Democracy ever known. While Magnus was an aid to SCENT in the beginning, he soon realized that Democracy was not the answer for ALL cases... and with this point in mind he left SCENT under rather poor circumstances... this is Magnus' mission. To reform oppressive societies using that system which will most benefit the people of that planet.This time Magnus arrives with not only his good friend and constant companion Alea, but an additional stowaway as well. He finds a planet that mirrors the developement of his homeworld in that they have empathic and projective telepathy that reacts to the environment of the planet producing... ghosts. He finds a feudal society that manages it's serfs through fear, and exists solely to grab the land of other lords. The power is either technology mastered through ritualized rote memorization, or low level psionic control of the ghosts. What to do? What is the Way?This book sees control and creativity begin to seep away from Magnus and Alea, as their &quot;silent partner&quot; gives them subtle urgings throughout the campaign. Magnus fails to see his own manipulation, and that of his travelling companion.Their ideas come to them in dreams... hello? Magnus DID that trick! On the up side, Alea becomes more aware of her attraction to Magnus, while Magnus, always aware of his attraction to Alea, continues to sublimate his own desire. This is well done... realistically. Magnus is repressed, as well as deeply emotionally scarred. He can not easily overcome these scars, and it will take some time for Alea to get over her own scars enough so that she can help meet him halfway. I would like to see Magnus become aware of his stowaway and/or restore Alea's memories... both WELL within his awsome capabilities...While I did not enjoy this story as much as the last, I did find it less formulaic than some in this series, and because of this it was still an enjoyable read. I will continue to devour anything Stasheff continues to spend some time on producing, and can only suggest that, if confused or dissatisfied by this work, one start earlier on in the series. Please take this as it was meant, a constructive critique by one who enjoys the Warlock series and the Rogue Wizard series... thank you for your time..."},{"Title":"A Wizard In The Way","review":"Excellent plot, characters, and even a bit thought provoking.

I loved the story line of this book, and the characters were likeable.

Gar resolves to teach Tao (The Way from the title) to encourage the serfs to try to better themselves. Initially frustrated by the serf's extreme fear, Gar continues the battle.I would have liked to see more a more direct relationship between Gar's Tao teachings and the rebellion he eventually leads. I think Stasheff missed an opportunity to make this fine book stand out as a unique novel here. Also, Stasheff has avoided the easy happy-ever-after solution to the sexual tension between Gar and Alea.

By the title, I expected the story to take place on the Big Island of Hawaii. The author gives a very picturesque account of the islands, using graphic descriptions of sites and native language to prove her point. She made an error in the word plumeria, referring to it as plusneria. She also made an error in describing plumeria as antheriums. The other error or misunderstanding in the story came when she was describing the relation of the brother and sister, who were half siblings. I couldn't quite understand who the mother and father were to each and how they related to the aunt. The story was good. I did not like how combative the male lead character was. As a woman, I would not have put up with his demanding and somewhat abusive behavior. That was a little unrealistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this read.

It's because of this book I want to go to Hawaii--preferably for my honeymoon. ;o) There's no sex if, by chance, you don't care for its over abundance in romances, which I can easily understand--but there is kissing and some groping. Just enough, in fact. I think it's well written and that the sexual tension keeps the main character's relationship a juicy read. The tidbits about Hawaii are fascinating. The plot is purely romance--no mystery thriller involved here.I first read this when I was very young, but now that I've matured, I realize that some of the characters probably could use a little more development.

So I cannot even be certain the first volume of this series ever actually appeared... Also, I believe the new edition (ISBN: 1597524867) of this specific volume ('Recent philosophy: Hegel to the Present'), published by Wipf & Stock Publishers, is an exact reproduction with only (perhaps) a new preface. My single volume 1966 edition has 876 pages, the new edition (2005, in two volumes) has 892 pages listed here at Amazon.Of course, this volume is dated by its age and also its Catholic orientation. This book carries both the Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur; it will not surprise anyone to learn that most of the books I read do not do so. Now, France (and Italy) were, and still remain, the center of the Catholic intellectual universe. But even still, it is simply absurd that German Philosophy gets 170 pages while French and Italian Philosophy gets 230 pages! How does one possibly justify giving Schelling only 7 pages while de Biran gets 11? As I said, absurd... Also, the inclusion of a chapter on French 'neo-Kantianism' (XI) without a chapter or section on German neo-Kantianism (F. A. Lange, Kuno Fischer, and Hans Vaihinger, e.g.) is equally bizarre. But one could multiply quibbles endlessly: how is it that Gentile merits a mention but Gramsci does not? Generally, the sections on English and American Philosophy are also too long, with utterly pointless mentioning of people like Bosanquet, Bowne and Colden. But enough of that! This book is the first place I encountered, several decades ago, people like Hartmann, Biran, Lamennais and several others. For that alone I am grateful. Also, there are almost 200 pages of notes in which I naturally delighted.But why bother picking up this book? One of the reasons to read people you don't agree with is that they occasionally show you things you would otherwise have missed. For instance, Langan, in the final section of his essay on Nietzsche asks, in effect, 'when do the Greeks laugh?' and, in a handful of pages, manages to speak more sense about Zarathustra's joy, and most especially its distance from the joys of the archaic Greeks, than one finds in whole books on the subject. Although Langan likely was unaware of this, Nietzsche points at this 'Zarathustrian Joy' in a similar manner when he himself, in Ecce Homo, refers to Zarathustra as the 'Yes-Saying' part of his work. The herd of perpetually indignant 'supermen' of course are barely aware of this...Langan wonders \\"gaiety - is this really a Greek Ideal?\\" - And correctly concludes that it is not. Thus Langan is surely correct to say of Zarathustra that in \\"his greatness, in his mercy, he is more than Greek.\\" At the very beginning of 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra', in the Prologue, Zarathustra decides to go down the mountain to share his knowledge and joy with mankind; now, anyone who has read the Iliad knows that this gesture is simply inconceivable to an Achilles, - who was universally considered the greatest of the Greeks. If there is no reason to help, Achilles will help no one. Indeed, with reason, he is prepared to sit on his hands while those that love him die at the hands of their (and his) enemies. But Nietzsche has his creature Zarathustra compare himself to the sun, asking, \\"what would your happiness be had you not those for whom you shine?\\" Like the sunshine Nietzsche intends his Zarathustra to be a gift to everyone; the 'deserving' and 'undeserving' alike... As Langan correctly observes, \\"in practice, Zarathustra feels some compassion, else why would he continue to preach to the 'little ones,' and 'the hens in the barnyard'...\\"Exactly. But is all this, at bottom, merely a case of old wine in new bottles? Does Nietzsche intend to go back to, or reinstate, some natural or historic order? Langan observes that for Nietzsche, \\"Being was indeed becoming, [which] he never doubted, characterizing this principle as 'true, but deadly'.\\" Now, the greatest interpreter of Nietzsche, Heidegger, wants to go back to the Pre-Socratics; I mean to their pre-Platonic experience of Being. It is Heidegger who seems to wish to go back to the archaic Greeks. But how are we to understand Nietzsche? Are we to choose between Langan and Heidegger? Let us not make this choice too easy for ourselves! Nietzsche also knows there is no going back:\\"Whispered to the conservatives.-- What was not known formerly, what is known, or might be known, today--a reversion, a return in any sense or degree is simply not possible. We physiologists at least know that. Yet all priests and moralists have believed the opposite--they wanted to take mankind back, to screw it back, to a former measure of virtue. Morality was always a bed of Procrustes. Even the politicians have aped the preachers of virtue at this point: today too there are still parties whose dream it is that all things might walk backwards like crabs. But no one is free to be a crab. Nothing avails: one must go forward--step by step further into d&eacute;cadence...\\" (Twilight of the Idols, Skirmishes of an Untimely Man, section 43).Yes, we have all read Heidegger's scathing attack on Nietzsche's 'succumbing' to the lure of values in the fourth volume of his brilliant Nietzsche study, but as we can see from the above quote (from 'Twilight of the Idols') Nietzsche has taken the measure of Heidegger, avant le fait, and has given history his judgment: to Nietzsche, Heidegger is but another priest or moralist, trying to fit the world into a bed of Procrustes, - that is, into a former measure of virtue. Like Catholic conservatives, Heidegger wants to go back...Langan, however, has a finer ear for Nietzsche's dedication to the new and his love of joy than does Heidegger. It is in these two aspects of Nietzsche's thought that one can correctly speak of Zarathustra's \\"qualities of a suspiciously Christian tint\\" - but Langan entirely misses Nietzsche's esoteric practices. Thus he mistakenly treats Zarathustra as Nietzsche's mouthpiece...But enough of that! Langan sees, correctly sees, what so many commentators refuse to see: Zarathustra is, and can only be, a post-Christian development. This is but one example of the gems one can pick from old books written by people that one does not agree with. This book is conceived as a textbook for Catholic students, but one is here and there surprised by the sophistication of the analysis. This is why we should all continue to read, for example, Thomists, Marxists, Straussians and Phenomenologists; we read them in order not to miss what we might ordinarily have missed. Four stars for being what is by necessity quite rare: an interesting textbook..."},{"Title":"Politeness (Key Topics in Sociolinguistics)","review":"This most excellently written work covers a very large amount of research done on politeness in the linguistic field since the beginning of the study. I would recommend it to anyone interested and/or working in and/or on politeness as a linguistic object.The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because if you're not familiar with the many theories dealt with in this book, you may get somewhat confused, not that Watts fails to expose them in their essentials, but because it makes tons more sense when you actually know the theories beforehand. However, most of the book is readable even for people who haven't spent ages studying linguistics, though I would not recommend it for someone who doesn't know a thing about linguistics. Naturally, this isn't a work of vulgarisation so it shouldn't be expected to be so widely accessible, therefore yes, maybe I should give it 5 stars.

If you're in the trenches trying to get your manuscript done, don't waste your time reading this -- write instead."},{"Title":"Page After Page: Discover the Confidence & Passion You Need to Start Writing & Keep Writing (No Matter What)","review":"Heather Sellers' \\"Page after Page: Discover the confidence & passion you need to start writing & keep writing (no matter what!)\\" is a beautiful book. The language has a sort of poetic feel to it, and is extremely honest and open--both about writing in general and about Ms. Sellers' own life and experiences, when she needs to use them to illustrate a point. She isn't afraid to make some straightforward and, most likely, unpopular points that probably need to be made.Ms. Sellers is a teacher, and she has had many years of teaching others--and herself--how to develop a writing life. She believes that one should approach writing as though it were a lover. If you fall in love with writing, time slows down. If you fall in love with writing, you make the time for it. If you fall in love with writing, it's easier to sit and pay attention to it. If you don't love your writing, then why should you expect it to treat you well?You'll find plenty of exercises in here, though they may not be what you're used to expecting from a writing book. One of my favorites involves drawing up a rigid schedule for your writing the way so many other books tell you to, then drawing up a ten-year plan that progresses along the lines of, \\"year one: get feet wet.\\"Not everyone will be able to appreciate what this book has to offer. Some people really do just want to approach their writing as a regimented thing, and they'll scoff at Ms. Sellers' romantic (though surprisingly practical, really) viewpoint. Not everyone who doesn't actually want to write wants to hear that they really don't want to write, and they probably wouldn't like it. People who are bound and determined to believe that they're undiscovered geniuses whose work can't be improved upon, and that the people who offer them suggestions for improvement or reject their work are idiots, might not like hearing that a different attitude could benefit them.But for everyone who truly wants to get somewhere with their writing, who wants to enjoy the process, who wants to feel that passion as they sit down to work on their latest project, this is a gorgeous book. So if you are in any way less than perfectly satisfied with your writing life, give this a read. It probably has something of value to offer you. And even if you are perfectly happy with your writing, you might read it anyway. It's a beautifully-written book that's a joy to read."},{"Title":"Page After Page: Discover the Confidence & Passion You Need to Start Writing & Keep Writing (No Matter What)","review":"Heather Sellers presents some unique thoughts about the writing life. She compares writing to a lover, the material you write from as compost, and puts a spin on rejections that makes you positiviely giddy to receive them. Along the way she offers some great advice for writers including reading as much as you can; attending book readings, lectures, and workshops; and my favorite--NAPPING! What's not to love about a book that encourages napping? At the end of each chapter are one or more exercises that stretch not only your writing, but your writing life. If you are a writer in need of a friendly cheerleader, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Page After Page: Discover the Confidence & Passion You Need to Start Writing & Keep Writing (No Matter What)","review":"I think I'm in love with the good doctor. Here's a lady who loves reading more than eating, and thinks making beds is a waste of valuable writing time. I could live with a person of these values.What a great writer, and some great ideas. In this book Dr. Sellers takes a no-nonsense approach to excuses for not writing and encourages aspiring writers to use the same 24 hours granted to all mortals to write for 10 or 20 minutes per day. She teaches you how to focus on your writing, finding quiet time, and accepting the solitude so important to writing. Also, I love her love of reading. Throughout the book she uses the metaphor of reading and writing as lovers. According to Sellers, writers read, and in fact often sleep with their books. I warmed to her imagery here, as I often bang an elbow or my back on a hardbound book left in my bed. My personal favorite bedtime book is an old one, Jean Christophe, by Romain Rolland. This book was written around 1910 and is over 800 pages. There is something about Rolland's writing that sets my imagination drifting into unexpected places. Sellers legitimizes this compulsion of mine, and advises the writer to let your writing flow with your imagination. Sellers also uses some yoga analogies in this book, but the book is not about yoga. I know nothing about yoga, except what I may have learned from David Carradine in the 70s TV series, Kung Fu. It is not a distraction, and illustrates her points well.Sellers does not present actual writing instruction in this book, that is not her purpose here. She is highly readable and offers a ton of ideas for inspiring people to drop the excuses and start writing."},{"Title":"Page After Page: Discover the Confidence & Passion You Need to Start Writing & Keep Writing (No Matter What)","review":"Page after Page is the perfect book for the non-writing writer. For the person who continually dreams of writing yet never manages to get any words on a page, or who can never get past false starts. Heather Sellers has created the perfect how to write book, except this one focuses on how to create a life that contains writing as an integral part of it instead of just a dream.This book does not cover plot, character, description or any of the other advice we seek out when trying to learn how to write, though the information given is worth its weight in gold. Sellers gives her thoughts on overcoming fear, using anxiety for creativity, aligning your life with the dream you want to achieve, as well as how to begin writing and so much more. Reading this book is like having a good conversation over coffee. Heather Sellers is funny, comforting and has filled this book with the truth behind creating a writing life.After reading it I understand how to go about reaching my writing goals. This is definitely a book that will be a continually motivating force in living my writing life."},{"Title":"Page After Page: Discover the Confidence & Passion You Need to Start Writing & Keep Writing (No Matter What)","review":"I wanted to love this book. Really, I did. From the beautiful cover to Heather Sellers' writing style (upbeat and fluid), I was initially drawn in, but all that changed about halfway through the book.Sellers begins this book by saying that she wants her readers to develop \\"a positive, happy, easy writing life.\\" She wants them to have fun with writing. Each chapter addresses a portion of writing or the writing life; exercises follow.While I felt that a number of Sellers' suggestions were good (making sure that your actions support your writing goals, writing a lot, taking breaks when necessary), at the same time, I felt that her message was contradictory. In one section, she tells the aspiring writer to take naps when feeling overwelmed; in the next, she talks about the importance of writing everyday, how you can get rusty when you take breaks, how it can takes days or even weeks to get back in the flow again. On page 70, she asks the reader to consider whether or not they are willing to commit to a 2-4 hour/day writing program for a year, then says, in essence, it's okay with me if you don't want to, maybe you don't want really want to be a writer. HUHH?!In addition, I felt that about half of her exercises were unoriginal: Making lists of writing fears, doing timed writings, keeping a journal and writing at least one sentence in it each day. Heard that all before.That being said, Sellers, HERSELF, is original. The chapter titles and analogies throughout the book (\\"Chapter 15: Compost\\") are creative, and she does include interesting anecdotes from her own life. Her discussion about \\"Derek,\\" a writer she attended grad school with, was insightful, and her stories regarding her love for books are passionate and engaging. The recommended reading list in the appendix is brief but thorough.I wanted to love this book, but I just didn't. It was okay. I'll stick with Julia Cameron, whose message is consistent, to the point, and supportive."},{"Title":"Page After Page: Discover the Confidence & Passion You Need to Start Writing & Keep Writing (No Matter What)","review":"The email I sent to Heather Sellers, the author says it all:>Just wanted to tell you what a wonderful discovery your book was!

First, it's fun to read. Ms. Seller's writing style is enjoyable, and she has kept the chapters very manageable and compartmentalized. I can read a section, get inspired, then put it down for a day or two while I do the exercises, which are the next good thing about the book.At the end of each chapter are exercises that are often very different from typical writing exercises. They seem a little more inspired or thoughtful. For instance, the one I really like is 10 minutes of writing, with a pencil or marker because they're slower than ball point pens, on unlined paper, on a topic using no adjectives or adverbs.Another thing I really like about this book is that a lot of the exercises she has in there to motivate you for writing can be applied to other areas of life as well. Just substitute in your topic of choice (for me it's programming) and work the exercise to apply to that area. It really is a very good book, and well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Page After Page: Discover the Confidence & Passion You Need to Start Writing & Keep Writing (No Matter What)","review":"Heather Sellers presents writing as what it really is. She gives you the truths about writing. She answers questions like: what does it take to be a writer? Is writing really for you? Are you willing to write badly, and then keep going? What is a true writer's life like? In chapter 24, she dispels the theories that writing a book will instantly make you rich and famous, and gives her own personal example of some of her feelings right after her first book was published.\\"But many writers nurture a dream that is false. You will get published. But it is unlikely that publication will solve any problems you have -blocks, money, habits,confidence or writing ability.\\" And, she tells us that you should write because it's what you want to do, what you have to do. Even if you're not going to get paid for it, or famous from it.Divided into 3 parts and 30 chapters, you can read this from beginning to end, or you can open it up anywhere and just start reading. The Table Of Contents is really nice, because, not only does it give you the title of the chapter, but it tells you what the chapter deals with. There's a wide variety of useful writing topics covered.This is on my top five favorite books on writing. My book is bookmarked in several places and heavily underlined. The signs of a loved book.

In an easy to read, conversational style the author makes it clear that you don't need to sit for hours everyday to be a \\"writer\\". You just need to set aside even 10-20 minutes a day and get that pen to the paper. Even reading books, lots of different types of books, can help in achieving your goal. Most of all you have to really want to do it and make it a priority in your life. To make time for it. The most valuable advice she gave was stop talking about it.

I'm a horse lover and first found Jilly Cooper's &quot;Riders&quot; on a trip to the UK. Since then I've tried to read everything she's written, and I'm seldom disappointed. I know very little about the world of classical music but it didn't matter -- her books are so character-driven that it's them you get wrapped up in, not so much the subject matter. This book gave us a &quot;fix&quot; of our favorite characters from past books, but introduced new characters just as interesting and complex. Other characters on the periphery of previous books (like Flora from &quot;The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous&quot; and Marcus from &quot;Riders&quot;) become main characters here, and you have the pleasure of seeing them grow up. You don't need to be a horse fan to love all Jilly's books!"},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"Oh Jilly - I just love most of your books - but the last three in the series you have done on Campbell-Black and co I just haven't enjoyed as much. This is the fifth book in the series which started with Rivals. As usual Cooper focuses on a single theme and a big crowning event - in this case orchestras and a big competition which Rupert Campbell-Black's son, Marcus is competing in. Against him is the heroine of this novel - Abigail Rosen also known as Appassionata.Perhaps it is just me, but I don't much like Rannaldini. He appeared in the Cooper's last book - The Man Who Made Husband's Jealous - he is the bad-guy of the piece, but I find him horrible. Normally with Cooper the bad guys and the good guys are fairly ambiguous - you can certainly like most of the bad-guys but Rannaldini is just evil on two legs. I hope I'm not spoiling anyone's fun by telling you all that Ranaldini finally gets killed off in the next book - Score! - but in the meantime I feel like he lurks with a bit too much sinister pleasure through these pages.Unfortunately Cooper has got me hooked on the series, so every time one of her books comes out it is a must read for me. The first three novels in this series (Riders, Rivals and Polo) were simply bliss - and I loved her earlier books (Harriet, Imogen &amp;c.) If you haven't read Cooper before then you should read her earlier books. If you have read them - well you will probably want to find out what happens next - and the book isn't bad - its just not as good as her past efforts."},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"I'm a long, long, long time fan of jilly cooper (from her first romance novels of emily, harriet, imogen, bella, lisa and co), and have read all the previous marathon novels (riders, rivals, polo, etc). This book was ticking off one line after another, and I often imagined the shocked faces of the English audience as they read some of her imageries of English pretensioin. I know Cooper has tried with Riders and Rivals to reach the American audience but for some reason she did not catch on. That is because she does not have the dripping sap of the American romance audience, and much too talented and intelligent to grab the Daniel Steele audiences that dominates the American romance industry. Perhaps there is too much romping sex to represent real life, but certainly the American romance genre has such a pretension of virtue in an ill disguised soft porn that one can turn bolemic from throwing up with each turn of the page. I'd say her writing is a nice blend of the pop novels and literary novels like Jane Austen, George Eliott, etc. Keen on human behavior but fast paced and sharp. Great plot. Also, Cooper actually made me appreciate classical music, leaving as romantic and passionate image of classic music as I have for rock music."},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"Like other reviewers, I've read all of Jilly's books (I think that 'Polo' is the most entertaining). I had to laugh at the Californian reviewer's idea that Cooper's English readership would be 'shocked' at her satirical look at the social pretensions of upper-class (and nouveau riche) Brits. In fact, Cooper's earthy humour is typical of what you would find in the UK - just read one of our tabloid newspapers . I'm surprised though that Cooper's humour crosses the Atlantic successfully, as it is so particularly English.Appassionata isn't Cooper's best novel, possibly because Abigail Rosen is not a particularly sympathetic heroine. In addition, I found it difficult to believe that orchestral musicians lead lives of such wild debauchery - all the ones that I've met wear their hair in a bun and no make-up. Anyway, I suppose the plot isn't the point of Jilly's books, what entertains instead is the witty commentary and detailed character delineations (and asassinations)."},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"Delightfully written, Jilly Cooper is witty and adds just enough sauciness to keep the book interesting. I love all of her books that I have read, but Appassionata has definitely been my favourite so far! I recommend reading them in order, as the characters weave in and out of each book and following their lives throughout is interesting and makes one feel like the characters are personal friends/acquaintances."},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"I LOVED this book and laughed all the way through!

I found that although unbelievably cliched in a lot of circumstances, I could relate a lot of my own personal experiences with the love and obsession with music to this book. It was about the funniest read I've had in a long time. I don't usually read schlock romantic fiction or even melodramatic prose like this but I thoroughly enjoyed this. If you want a laugh, read Appassionata."},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"I am just reading this title. The story is interesting but I never read book with a lot of spelling mistakes on each page!"},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"Another excellent Jilly Cooper, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I didn't particularly like the main character, Abigail Rosen, and the book as a whole was not quite as good as her first four. Still, I found the book thoroughly entertaining and hard to put down. It certainly brought orchestras to life for me. The meticulous research which has gone into Jilly Cooper's books really shows. There were several interesting sub-plots involving characters from earlier books, such as Flora from &quot;The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous&quot; and Marcus Campbell-Black, as well as many new characters. Everything turns out how you hope it will, and I was sorry to finish the book and have to wait for the next one to be published."},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"I think by the time we finished passing it around, every girl in the music department at my university had read it. This book is well-researched (I'm a musician and only caught a couple slight errors), and written in a delightful, engaging style. Taken for what it is, &quot;Appassionata&quot; is a lot of fun, particularly the characters and the way Jilly Cooper deftly maneuvers them into and out of one anothers' arms. I'd read another book about the Rutminster Symphony Orchestra anytime!"},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"I first discovered the &quot;Rutshire Chronicles&quot; of Jilly Cooper while studying in Scotland. This fifth volume in the series is just as witty, fast-paced, and hilarious as the first four--with all the sex, snobbery, and drama you could ask for. All the best characters from the earlier books make at least cameo appearances (Rupert, Helen, Taggie, Rannaldini, etc.) and the new ones are great as well. Hardly a horse, but the classical music theme is not the slightest bit boring (despite my total lack of enthusiasm for the genre). Jilly Cooper easily buries Danielle Steele and the like... This book can be read by itself, but even though they are hard to get her I recomend getting ahold of the earlier books (Riders, Rivals, Polo, and The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous). As a final note, the whole Marcus sub-plot is great!"},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"This is a fun book and a page turner. There's lots of interesting information about symphony orchestra musicians. For instance, I learned that musicians applaud by banging their bows on the backs of chairs. It was interesting to see how Jilly took her stock two dimensional characters from a horsy setting to a classical music setting. We still have the spoiled female brat, the too good to be true martyr, Snidely Wiplash, the rich working class character with a heart of gold, the rich working class character who is awful etc.I would urge Ms. Cooper, if she continues to put American characters in her books, TO GET AN AMERICAN COPY EDITOR. No American would use the phrase: &quot;Sounds hell.&quot; to describe a dreadful person. This is one of many such errors.Jilly, I like your books so much that I hereby offer said service gratis. It would be worth it to get a pre-publication read of the book."},{"Title":"Appassionata","review":"I am just reading this title. The story is interesting but I never read book with a lot of spelling mistakes on each page!"},{"Title":"The outbreak of rebellion (Campaigns of the civil war. I)","review":"\\"The Outbreak of Rebellion\\" is John Nicolay's story of the early days of the Civil War. Written just twenty years after the events it records, it begins with the rumblings of secession in South Carolina and continues through the first Battle of Bull Run/Manassas. It gives, while not a contemporary account, one based on living memory. On these pages the reader gets an up close view of Abraham Lincoln and is taken back to the days of secession, Fort Sumter, the mob attack on the Sixth Massachusetts in Baltimore, the death of Elmer Ellsworth, issues that made their way from Missouri and Kentucky to the White House and the demonstration of pro-Union sentiment in West Virginia only to name a few. Written by President Lincoln's private secretary, it has a strong Union flavor.Although short, this is a good history. It has sufficient facts to qualify as history, but it is also a period piece, bringing the spirit of the times to the reader. One example of the partisan prose with which this book is filled is Nicolay's assessment of President Buchanan: \\"his condition of mind predisposed him in a remarkable degree to fall under the controlling influence of his disloyal counselors. He possessed the opposing qualities of feeble will and stubborn prejudice; advancing years and decreasing vigor added to his irresolution embarrassed his always limited capabilities.\\" It is better written than many Civil War memoirs. Read it for its spirit, the spirit of a Union triumphant and take the history is a bonus."},{"Title":"The outbreak of rebellion (Campaigns of the civil war. I)","review":"This history of the outbreak of the Civil War is unique in presenting it from the perspective of Lincoln's personal secretary. The man was a participant, and on the legal aspects gives some very clear headed arguments. Much of the precedent goes back to the aftermath of the American Revolution. There were two steps to creating the federal government of the United States. First, each colony had to declare independence from England (which they did together in one document). The individual colonies could now agree to enter into a larger confederation of colonies. It was not at all clear that this would happen, as many had different interests. For that reason the constitution does not outlaw slavery, and fails to address whether member of the union can later secede. These and other touchy issuies might have been deal breakers.The Southern Secession required a similar process, which raised some paradoxes. Nicolay argues that, constitutional ambiguity aside, none had the authority to issue articles of secession. Simply put, it is not among the defined powers of the governors or legislatures. Their oath of office requires them to support and defend the constitution of the United States. But secede they did, after which -- as independent states -- they were free to enter into a new confederacy. Here is where Nicolay finds contradiction in their arguments. They seceeded over the issue of states' rights. But having done so, promptly surrendered them to a new confederacy. Nicolay says, probably due need for immediate action, the confederate constitution was largely taken from the original. Among key changes, the statement that all men are created equal was striken. But there was also no provision allowing a state to secede from the new union. Essentially, Nicolay argues the states' rights issues was merely a pretext.He points to a single man as setting events in motion -- Governor Cist of South Carolina. He wrote a letter to other governors asking, if South Carolina should secede, would the others follow? The answers were ambiguous, but things were set in motion.Nicolay argues that the slavery issue was only vital to a very few states, and even there only to influentual land owners of the deep south. For the ordinary person there was little or nothing to be gained:\\"Drills, parades, meetings, bonfires, secession harangues, secession cockades, palmetto flags, purchase of fire-arms and powder, singing of the Marseillaise -- there is not room to enumerate the follies to which the general populace, especially of Charleston, devoted their days and nights. There was universal satisfaction: to the conspirators, because their schemes were progressing; to the rabble, because it had a continuous holiday.\\"Of all the states, only Texas submitted the articles of succesion to the people for a vote. Texas was a special case because it had only been in the Union about twenty years. Sam Houston was disappointed because he expected the Federal army to help police the Mexican border, but they did not. Houston's scheme was to secede but not join the Confederacy. He believed Texas could conquer northern Mexico, gain access to the Pacific, and be positioned to suceed as an independent nation. The legislature threw him out and went with the Confederacy.The battle of Bull Run is especially well covered, and turns out quite unlike the simplified accounts. A good survey of the struggles in the border states is also given.* * *This book is part of a series of 12 short volumes on the land war published in 1882-3. It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all the documents and communications sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.M.F. Force (\\"From Fort Henry to Corinth\\"), says, \\"The main source of information is the official reports of battles and operations. These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\\"Alexander Webb (\\"The Peninsula\\") adds \\"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\\"Jacob D. Cox (\\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\\") sums up purpose and limitations: \\"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \\"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \\"Wilderness, 1864\\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \\"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \\"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \\"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evning there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also. What to do is not always clear, but I came to admire the ability of most generals to \\"let a situation develop,\\" then \\"read\\" it, and take actions.The complete set:(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G.

Burnside takes over and pursues Lee to Fredericksburg, where the Union army self-destructs in an assault on its fortified heights.(6) Chancellorsville & Gettysburg - Hooker replaces Burnside and tries to take the Union army around Fredericksburg, but is bluffed from the dense forests around Chancellorsville. Lee again breaks free and this time invades Pennsylvania but is stopped at Gettysburg.(11) The Shenandoah Valley in 1864; this valley is a thorn in the Union's flank, and is ultimately razed so Union forces can operate more freely in the east.(12) Virginia Campaign of '64 & '65; Lincoln is desperate to end the war. Grant promises to do so at a price. It will be bloody, but he wants all losses immediately replaced to his army remains at full strength during the long bloody grind to Richmond.IIB- Western Theatre(2) From Fort Henry to Corinth; The Confederacy hoped to fortify the upper Mississippi in Missouri and Kentucky as a jumping off point to invade the north. Grant wrests the initiative, and with the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson. After Grant's decisive victory at Shiloh, the Union never loses the initiative in the west.(8) The Mississippi; the struggle for Vicksburg, which puts the entire Mississippi in Union hands.(7) The Army of the Cumberland; the struggle for Chattanooga; Union defeat at Chickamauga, besieged at Chattanooga, final breakout of the siege.(9) Atlanta; Union drive down the critical rail line through hard country from Chattanooga to Atlanta.(10) March to the Sea & Franklin/Nashville; after Atlanta, Sherman's famed march to the sea, after which he very nearly links up with Grant driving down on Petersburg.CAUTION:This series is public domain. Many publishers offer cheap digital scans with illegible maps and text that is difficult to read -- apparently this reviews stepped on one such land mine.The best editions by far are those from DSI digital scans, with flawless text and clear maps. Most of the have the \\"Look Inside\\" feature so you can see for yourself.For some unfortunate reason, DSI's editions usually don't appear when you search these titles. Try searching a title with DSI after the name, but even that doesn't always work.The Da Capo edition is also good. It's editions are a little smaller in size but of high quality and with excellent contemporary introductions.Final comment - I'm no expert or professional Civil War buff, so don't treat anything I've written as such. This is merely a reader who has derived great personal pleasure from this series. I've tried to convey a sense of what was so enjoyable to me."},{"Title":"The Augsburg Confession and Its Apology (Lutheran Confessions Bible Study)","review":"No one who has ever tried to study the Augsburg Confession will dispute the point that it can be quite complex, especially for those not accustomed to reading theological tracts or confessional documents. Thus, many interested in doing so turn to guides to help them in their studies. Sadly, some guides are not well suited to their purpose. This is one such guide.The structure of the work is satisfactory - only some sections are addressed while others are left out. This is not unreasonable, as an introductory guide to this larger work would not wish to concern itself with each and every article of the faith encompassed by the Augsburg Confession. The problem lies in how the articles once presented are discussed.The book is largely question and answer, only the questions are usually too in depth or too obtuse to reflect the material provided. There is also little background or explanation of the text itself where it is reprinted. From an instructional perspective, these are both serious flaws.A person wishing to learn more about the Augsburg Confession would do well to consult Grane's \\"The Augsburg Confession : A Commentary\\" for a better, more historically and theologically satisfying picture and explanation of this very important work."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"In the unpaginated 'Preface [to the] 1973 Edition', Margaret Mead stresses that her description of Samoan moeurs should be read as applying to conditions at the time of her research. She finds it needful to 'shout' that advice because during her 1971 brief visit to Samoa, 'young critics even asked me when am I going to revise this book and look unbelieving and angry when I say that to revise it is impossible'.This is a reference to an abrasive session with students who told her that her description of fa'aSamoa (Samoan custom) was false and insulting. They were miffed by her styling Samoans 'primitives' and her pronouncement that since anthropologists enjoy an 'immense superiority', they can 'master the fundamental structure' [of primitive society] . . . 'in a few months' (p. 8). In keeping with this arrogance, Samoans attending university were told by their instructors that their experience of fa'aSamoa was not valid evidence against Mead's scientific study. And, as we've just seen, Mead refused to revise her book even when she knew that it was mistaken in many particulars.For Samoans this patronizing manner was the familiar voice of the papalagi (the colonial power). Mead's hosts on her field trip, aware that she enjoyed the protection of the Pacific Fleet admiral and boss of Western Samoa, went to great lengths to provide reliable information. When they learned of what they call her luma fai tele ('shameless defamaton'), they could not comprehend how she could have betrayed their hospitality. They were also aggrieved that she deceived them about her marital status. For she accepted the title taupou (ceremonial virgin) although as a married woman she was ineligible. Then she disgraced the title by carrying on with Aviata, a young man regarded as a rake.While Samoans long knew the mendacity of this book, its correction in academic circles commenced only with the 1983 publication of Derek Freeman's Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth (Harvard University Press). That event shook anthropology to its boots. Such was Mead's prestige that the popular mind identified her with anthropology. If her credibility was seriously questioned in respect to the most widely believed anthropological study ever published, the credibility of the profession was at risk. That is why Freeman was attacked with great vehemence, even by those who agreed with his critique.Freeman's book initiated a reappraisal of Coming of Age in Samoa. Martin Orans and Freeman have recently published studies of her Samoa investigations based on her field notes. They confirm that Mead's account of Samoan sexual moeurs is a travesty. But they go beyond that. Mead recorded the accounts given by her informants, but by ignoring key facts, twisting others, and inventing still others, she contrived to represent Samoa as a free love duck pond. She also misrepresented the research she carried out. She was funded to conduct a study of adolescent girls; and she states that she spent 'six months accumulating an intimate and detailed knowledge of all adolescent girls in the community'. Her field notes tell otherwise. She devoted her time to assembling ethnography; the funded study never got off the ground. She states that she conducted 'all' her interviews with these girls in the Samoan language ('I spoke their language and ate their food'). Orans found however that her information on adolescent girls came from 'English-speaking informants using English to communicate'. He notes that 'no conversations in Samoan are recorded in any of the field materials'. This is consistent with Freeman's finding that the study of adolescent girls was not conducted at all.Mead built her picture of free love by tossing off unsupported one-liners. The 'inept lover is a laughing stock'. There are 'no neurotic pictures, no frigidity' in Samoa. Masturbation 'is a universal habit'. Homosexual activity is 'very prevalent' and is regarded as 'simply play'. '[Samoan] girls' minds were perplexed by no conflicts . . . [to have as] many lovers as possible and then to marry . . . these were uniform and satisfying ambitions'. The field materials do not show that Mead collected any evidence whatever about masturbation, homosexuality, or incidence of neuroticism and frigidity. She had but one informant about intimate sexual practices--an eighteen year old school teacher. In 1981 that person told Freeman that he had an affair with Margaret. Thus Samoa's alleged free love amounts to no more than a loose wife's gullibility to the pillow talk of her teenage lover. Such is the 'science' that made this book famous.Research on Mead's field notes clarifies a feature of this book that has puzzled many readers. It is the drastic and repeated inconsistency between Mead's descriptions of Samoan vigilance of virginity and punishments of straying girls, and the attribution of a casual attitude toward sexuality. What we now can see is that Mead patched her free love pillow talk into descriptions given to her by her adult informants.How is that anthropologists for so long were taken in by Mead's yellow anthropology? One part of the answer is that many weren't taken in. The controversy brought to light numerous statements to this effect. Thus Weston LaBarre wrote: &quot;When I was a graduate student in anthropology at Yale in the late '30's, Mead's Sex and Temperament came out. Puzzled that even a big island like New Guinea should have had three tribes waiting to be discovered to prove her point about the non-biological nature of gender, I went to Edward Sapir with my puzzlement. He said laconically, 'She's a pathological liar'. I was startled as much by what he said, as by the fact that an eminent anthropologist and chairman of a department should say this to a mere graduate student.

University Press of America, 1990."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"A few reviewers have referenced the Mead / Freeman controversy. I'd like to explain this controversy and provide some historical context for readers unfamiliar with the book.Coming of Age in Samoa is Margaret Mead's first publication. It launched a career that made Mead one of the most famous anthropologists in American history. I find this book interesting in two ways: historically and stylistically.Coming of Age in Samoa is historically interesting in that it represents one culmination of the conflict between cultural and biological anthropology. Mead was a student of anthropologist Franz Boas, a famous advocate of \\"nurture\\" over \\"nature.\\" Mead borrowed and expanded Boas' ideas, and many cultural anthropologists still cite her work as evidence that a person's cultural upbringing--not his genetic makeup--accounts for most of his personal development.Anthropologists that valued \\"nature\\" over \\"nurture\\" did not dig. Mead's claims were big, bold, and well-received.But Boas' opponents (or his opponents' students and their students' students) were able to breath easy once Derek Freeman, an Australian anthropologist, published a book refuting Mead's findings. Freeman accused Mead of conducting sloppy fieldwork, approaching her subject with predetermined conclusions, and refusing to correct her work after its publication. In response, Mead supporters accused Freeman of attacking Mead personally rather than professionally. While they disagreed about the quality of Freeman's own fieldwork, these critics all thought that he could have written his critique with more tact and civility.Coming of Age in Samoa is stylistically interesting in that it targets a general audience. Some sections seem to come from a travelogue, others from a novella. Very little sounds like the anthropological writing of Boas or other American anthropologists that preceded Mead. Mead's writing has been called unscientific, revolutionary, appropriate, novelistic, and refreshing. Because of its accessibility, it has introduced several generations of undergraduates to anthropology.With that clarification, I'd like to offer my opinion of how Coming of Age reads in 2005.While the book is historically and stylistically relevant, I don't find Mead's prose that exciting. For an introduction to the field, I'd start somewhere else entirely--maybe Malinowski's Argonauts of the Western Pacific, which offers a thorough representation of a culture and an ethnographer's experience with that culture. Mead's book offers clear answers to clear questions, but I don't understand why new students should seek clarity. Something like Malinowski's diary--the strange and honest account of a witness--is more valuable. Mead's book flows, but plenty of books flow. I'd start with vague and rich anthropological writing, the sort that emerges from years research among radically different people. Even if it is a little more difficult, that sort of writing will introduce you to some really meaty and unfamiliar concerns."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"I was the Medical Director of American Samoa a few years after Mead's sixmonth in Ta'u, a village in the Manu'a group and spent over two years there. On my trips to Manu'a I found and talked to Chief Tufele and those Mead worked with. With two years study of Hawaiian I was able to converse with them quite easily. Mead studied Samoan for only six weeks in Pago Pago.There are many errors and self-projections in the work of a 23-year old girl fresh out of college on her first field trip, but not enough to incurFreeman's wrath. About half of his criticisms are not true."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"Coming of Age in Samoa is a pleasantly-written South Sea fantasy, heavy with the author's social agenda upon it. If you buy the agenda, apparently you can hardly help like the book. (See reviews below.) Even if I bought the agenda (and it is hard for me to look at American society and say the sexuality Mead encouraged has made people entirely free of guilt or conflict), I would still choke on her dishonesty. But as they say in the anthro business, different strokes for different folks.Some of the defenses of this book below are hilarious. \\"Sure, it's largely untrue. But it reads well!\\" (And here I thought it was supposed to be science.) \\"It stimulated my thinking about culture! Mead really did interview thirty live Samoans! (In some language or other.) \\"Besides, what scholarship from that era would not sound like fiction today?\\" (Uh, honest scholarship? Do you want a book list?)The interesting thing about this book, to me, is the way it illustrates human self-deception, in particular the hubris of those who claim to speak for \\"Science.\\" Being interested in such curiosities, for me personally the book was worth buying. Mead's sexual fantasies are not the only instance in the 20th Century in which anthropologists sought to throw out \\"religious dogma\\" in favor of \\"scientific\\" new theories of their own cultivation. As pleasant as an idyllic trip to the islands may be, those for whom such theories hold charm should remember that honest scholarship and imagination are two different things, that vacations in Fantasy Island usually cost something, and that the one who takes the vacation is not always the person who pays the bill."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"Freeman's harsh book criticizing Margaret Mead was itself ultimately declared by the American Anthropological Society to be \\"unprofessional\\" and simply not scholarly.

Mead has an ability to present a scientific study in poetic form drawing the reader in while communicating social observations.From a psychological perspectives there are several shortcomings. Mead did a revolutionary work; it was however somewhat incomplete and romanticized to fit Mead's personal predispositions. While stomach or back pain were indicated, No reasons for the high percentage of possible psychosomatic pain were not addressed. In addition, after only 5 months in Samoa, the level of intimacy required for disclosure of familial sexual encounters, both heterosexual and homosexual, is not often attained in such a short amount of time inside the familial clan setting."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"In the unpaginated \`Preface [to the] 1973 Edition', Margaret Mead stresses that her description of Samoan moeurs should be read as applying to conditions at the time of her research.

No. Could she tell a recreational liar from an honest confidante? Yes. In fact, Mead treats all of her research subjects with some skepticism and makes her own attempt to reconcile the extreme traditional prohibitions on extramarital sex, with the fact that it was indeed occurring, and frequently at that.As was typical of the times, however, she did not appear to see the Samoans in the proper light of a fully developed culture, but rather in the manner of a Tarzan novel.Is this offensive? Yes. Does it reveal a good deal of insular cultural ignorance? Yes. Does that mean that all parties interested in the history of anthropology, should avoid the book? No."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"Poorly researched book, which is completely wrong on the facts of Samoan adolescent behavior, as subsequent scholars have discovered.

Clearly, she was writing as the product of her time-- and in fact noted in the preface to the 1952 edition that this kind of book would provide more evidence about the time and place the author was from than about the culture being studied.It is certainly a pleasurable book to read. She paints a picture of an approach to childhood that sets ours off in a not-too-flattering light-- it successfully questions the values of her own culture regardless of how well it captures Samoan culture. I can understand why people from Samoa might find that &quot;regardless&quot; offensive, but I find it (again) a rather hopeless thing to try and judge. I do not find this book less valuable because I question its truth-- I do not know any scholarly book from the 1920s whose veracity would not be tested-- and at this point in time I think everyone who reads it is not accepting it as an authoritative view.File it under history of our cultural thought or under Utopian philosophy if you'd rather not file it under anthropology-- but I'd still recommend that you read it and file it somewhere."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"Famous books in any academic discipline draw a lot of attention (thus making them famous). When negative, most such attention arises from personal jealously about the success of others, and given that Mead is a woman, she draws additional scorn from male academics (and their female supplicants). As a result, many myths develop and circulate around academic departments, and even worse, people rely on textbook (mis)representations in place of their own reading. I encourage anyone with serious interest in traditional Samoa and/or anthropology to read this book for themselves, consider Mead's evidence and analysis, and develop your own assessment. Clearly, most of the reviewers here have not read the book. By the way, I give the book four stars because it does have flaws, but read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"In answer to \\"Mead's Samoa hoax has been exposed\\" (see below), which is based largely upon Derek Freeman's work.Derek Freeman's work has also engendered debate, given its own problems. Both methodology and (inevitably) conclusions have been shown to be suspect. For instance: some of Mead's subjects survived long enough into old age to be questioned by Freeman, whereupon they stated that they lied to Mead regarding their past behavior. With what certainty can it be presumed that they are telling the truth now?But I shan't go on. Suffice it to say that it is of little use to base a critique of one book (Mead's) based upon another of equally unsound and uncertain scholarship (Freeman's). It is simply dishonest of the writer of that review to attempt to discredit Mead by quoting Freeman, while (conveniently) omitting to mention that Freeman's work is not accepted either.Without being able to either substantiate Mead or debunk her, her book remains fascinating for its own sake, more than for its admittedly tenuous conclusions, and is interesting not least for the insight that it gives into the nature of its author."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"Freeman's nonsense aside, which seems to be taken as gospel by one or two reviewers below (apparently, Mead's Samoa is ladden with cultural intentions, but Freeman's work is not with his sociobiological intentions), this is a good book. I think Freeman is dishonest, and the fact that he couldn't attack Mead until after she was DEAD, speaks to me of a cowardly academic disgrace. For shame that he has any followers at all.Mead is not my favorite author: her writing is discontinous, but this book is a good work. Seeing as how many people haven't even realized just how conservative this book is, they believe that the author has had a clear social agenda. The agenda is there folks, but it is not the one you think.Mead's Samoa is probably more correct than Freeman's for a variety of reasons, but to go into various details would require several books.For those with access to JSTOR, I would strongly urge to look at some critical reviews of Mead and Freeman. For those that have access to HRAF, I would suggest looking at short ethnographies of the area. Now, which sounds more accurate? Neither will be completely, but Freeman's work is the REAL emperor without cloths, and its followers should take a closer look at the world ethnographies before they advance either Freeman, or downright simplistic (and insulting) sociobiological nonsense that was already buried some 20 years ago."},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","review":"Dr. Meade truly was one of the most well-known American Anthropologists in the 20th Century.

For one, he wrote his critique AFTER her death, in my opinion this is pure cowardice. Another thing, he claims that the Samoan women Mead interviewed had lied to her.

The Simbas took westerners hostage (in contravention to international law) and threatened to murder them if their political demands were not met.U.S. Air Force transports were organized to deliver Belgium paratroopers to rescue the largest group of hostages in the western city of Stanleyville while simultaniously a column of government troops and mercenaries fought their way northwards to liberate the place.

With the first page you are drawn into the world of Hannah and Timothy. (I will attempt not to drop any spoilers.) Beautifully written and loving crafted, the story is dramatic, wrenching emotion (and several chuckles) along the way. You can feel the angst that young Timothy experiences, along with the rest of the characters (sweet Jemima being one of my favorites) as the are so real, you feel like you know them. The theme of needing God runs throughout as well as addressing our belief that we can somehow earn our salvation.Accurate historical detail is woven throughout the story, proving that she knows her era as well. I would recommend this to anyone who loves women' s fiction, historical, romances or historical romances. This is definately worth the time to read.I also highly recommend the other two books in the series even though each can stand on it's own, the richness and beauty of the story is increased by each one you read."},{"Title":"Son of Perdition (Book Three of Ahab's Legacy)","review":"I've had the pleasure to learn from Louise Gouge in cyber classes and in person. Most recently, I also enjoyed delving into her latest release in the Ahab's Legacy Series. While reading Son of Perdition I knew without a doubt, this woman knows her stuff. Even when forced to put the book down by things that wouldn't wait, my mind continued to check in on the characters as if they were real members of my acquaintance. Though not a suspense, this historical contained enough plot twists to keep me guessing. Even when I thought I could see where she was headed, Ms. Gouge led me with such artistry, I was caught unaware. I do not want to give away too much, for this book is so worth the read, but know, you will never look at Captain Ahab or Moby Dick or even the sides of the Civil War in the same light. When one learns and grows while reading well-written fiction, that is the sign of a great book."},{"Title":"Son of Perdition (Book Three of Ahab's Legacy)","review":"Living down a regrettable legacy proves a formidable task for Timothy Ahab, but one he is prepared to do.

So imagine my amazement when Louise Gouge had me mesmerized by page 3 of her excellent new novel, Son of Perdition!

Flawlessly carved from a wealth of research and cradled in well structured prose, the story transports the reader back in time to the seafaring days of whaling and of America's early Navy, as the son of Mellville's Ahab and the son of a man whose death Ahab caused clash in a world too small to contain them both. It's a story of love in the face of obstacles, of wealth versus poverty, of triumph over the scourge of war and pride. It's a story peopled with characters you'll carry in your heart for a lifetime. Like AHAB'S BRIDE and HANNAH ROSE, before it, it's a story you won't want to miss.~~Sara Probasco, author, speaker, seminar instructor"},{"Title":"Son of Perdition (Book Three of Ahab's Legacy)","review":"Louise Gouge has a knack for wrapping historical accuracy around a wonderful story, blending truth with fiction in word pictures that live on for weeks after the book is finished. Although I enjoyed AHAB'S BRIDE and HANNAH ROSE, SON OF PERDITION is my favorite of this three-book series. The characters come to life on the page, with their stories told in a hauntingly beautiful prose. I highly recommend this story to lovers of history and lovers of well-crafted stories."},{"Title":"Son of Perdition (Book Three of Ahab's Legacy)","review":"In the 19th century where honor and duty are a gentleman's way of life, Timothy Jacob Ahab has reached manhood and must grapple with the legacy left by his father, who doomed a shipful of men in his mad pursuit of a famous white whale. Timothy's struggle to find his place is made no less difficult by the growing popularity of the sole survivor's account, a novel named Moby Dick. Determined to live on his own moral strength, Timothy is given the opportunity of a lifetime to join the Naval Academy on the recommendation of a family friend.On Nantucket Island, Isaiah Starbuck and his younger sister, Jemima, are also experiencing the aftermath of that fateful voyage. From having lost his father and suffered a life of poverty, Isaiah harbors great hatred toward the wealthy Ahab family. When he is accepted into the Naval Academy on his own merits, he finds a safe-haven for his sister so he can pursue a career that someday will provide for them both. Unwittingly, he places his sister practically on the doorstep of Timothy Ahab, who already has felt the first pangs of love for the girl.One man rich, the other impoverished, and the country on the brink of civil war, Timothy and Isaiah enter the Academy where a man's worth isn't measured by his past, but by his actions. There, they must finish what began with their fathers on that ill-fated whaling vessel.In the third book of Ahab's Legacy, Son of Perdition, English Professor Louise M. Gouge yet again brings back the world first brought to life in the pages of Moby Dick, and so deftly does she carry on themes of its precursor, that I have no doubt Herman Melville would heartily cheer her on. Yet, what is most striking about Gouge's writing is her ability to hold me spell-bound for hours at a time, leaving behind the mild disappointment one feels when they start to look for the desired book they were reading, only to remember they've already finished it. -A definite recommend!"},{"Title":"Son of Perdition (Book Three of Ahab's Legacy)","review":"Son of Perdition, By Louise GougeThis well-crafted novel is Louise Gouge's crowning touch to her Ahab's Legacy series. Louise possesses a knack for weaving historical elements into her story in a natural, entertaining way. Her zeal for the abolitionist movement and issues concerning slavery are inspiring. In this third novel of the series, Timothy Jacobs grows up determined to be as different as night and day from his infamous father, Captain Ahab. He changes his name and aims for perfection. But his arrogance shows through. And when he is terribly wounded during a Civil War sea battle, his wrath toward God threatens to turn him into a replica of the father he swore not to emulate. Will he learn to forgive, so that he can seek the forgiveness and love of his heavenly Father? Will he be able to accept the love of Jemima, his childhood sweetheart? Or will he be forever mired in his overwhelming bitterness?"},{"Title":"Son of Perdition (Book Three of Ahab's Legacy)","review":"I read Son of Perdition in two days. I would've finished it in one, but I've been feeling tired lately and going to bed early. What a great story! I liked this one even more than Hannah Rose. Louise has a knack for describing horrific war injuries. Sheesh, I could picture those shredded limbs and blood splattering everywhere. I'm truly impressed. Also, this story has real depth to it. No pussyfooting around the issues in those days. Reality was men had temptations everywhere, and Louise includes that in her novel. I appreciate how that added to her story. The most impressive thing about Son of Perdition was the topics of blame and forgiveness, and how Louise works through that within the context of this story is truly amazing. Oh, and how often have we said to ourselves, \\"I'll never be like that person.\\" We try hard to be just the opposite and sometimes despite all this we look in the mirror and see the very person we never wanted to emulate staring back at us. What a sobering truth. Only God can fix that. So if you want an emotionally deep and touching story about an era not often written about, which includes Navy battle scenes from the civil war, you'll want to read this book. The author has unique insight rarely observed in historical fiction. Oh, and her passion for the abolitionist movement and issues regarding slavery are truly inspirational. Great debates between Northern and Southern Navy brothers at the Naval Academy.

If you enjoy historical fiction, you will love her books."},{"Title":"Son of Perdition (Book Three of Ahab's Legacy)","review":"In one of those odd literary coincidences two Moby Dick fans simultaneously got the bright idea of writing fictional accounts about Ahab's wife, but while Sena Jeter Naslund was writing for publication, Louise M. Gouge was writing her dissertation novel, not really expecting to ever publish it. (One assumes that the critical and commercial success of Naslund'sAhab's Wife: Or, The Star-gazer: A Novellead Gouge's editor and agent to push her into polishing it up for publication as her third book.) What resulted was the Ahab's Legacy trilogy, of which this is the third volume.You might think it unfair to compare the two, and you'd be right but for the wrong reasons. Naslund'sEveryone Loves Una; Or, The Navel-Gazer: A Mary Sue, as I call it, is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish. In contrast the Ahab's Legacy trilogy was a pleasure to read.Similarities abound, both authors having decided that an unconventional girl was needed to win old Ahab's heart, but profound differences exist that make for interesting comparison and contrast. Thus, while Una is a laughably absurd prodigy, Hannah is simply a woman slightly ahead of her time due to an unconventional upbringing as the doted on only child of a devoted widower. While Una basks in the worship of mid-nineteenth century New England's thoughtful elites, Hannah reads their books, attends their lectures, and finds her thinking profoundly influenced by them. While Una leaps into the anti-slavery cause, along with every other trendy cause, without a moment's hesitation, Hannah agonizes for half a book over whether a widow with a small child dares to actively assist the Underground Railroad, despite her growing conviction of slavery's evil. Compared to unintentionally hilarious Una, Hannah comes across as only slightly more modern than everyone else, an all too human figure.This third volume is about her grown up son's attempts to avoid his father's self-destructive path when he too is badly wounded during the Civil War. After having picked up the first two volumes on clearance, I was not in a huge rush to special order this volume because, my curiosity satisfied about Gouge's take on Ahab's wife, I frankly expected it to be the weakest book.I was wrong; it is the strongest. Timothy Jacob Ahab is a \\"good boy\\", absolutely determined not to follow in his father's self-destructive path so he doesn't believe that he needs to become a Christian. His former childhood friend who blames him for his father causing his own father's death, Isaiah Starbuck, is a \\"bad boy\\" who isn't a Christian either. For awhile their shared adventures at the Naval Academy resemble countless children's books of the period, but Gouge is not writing a children's book. Though revealed in the back cover blurb and foreshadowed from the beginning, the turn still shocks, and Timothy's fall is a heartrending horror. \\"Moby Dick\\" the book, here described as a survivor's account by Ishmael rather than a novel by Melville, also plays a key role, and we get some interesting analysis of Captain Ahab's mistakes from a Christian point of view.Note: Louise M. Gouge is a devout Christian, and Christian themes are explored throughout the novels so if Christianity gives you a rash, you have been warned. However, to her credit, Gouge does little preaching and never gets preachy.The first book of the trilogy isAhab's Bride, and the middle book of the trilogy isHannah Rose."},{"Title":"Son of Perdition (Book Three of Ahab's Legacy)","review":"Hannah Rose, Ahab's widow is married to David Lazarus.

He is the son of the deceased Captain Ahab. Though family and friends have upheld the honorable side of Captain Ahab's character, he has also heard the rumors of his father's last voyage and how he was blamed for the death of many. Timothy encounters his childhood friends, the children of Mr. Starbuck. This causes him to again reflect on what kind of man his father truly was. Though he has been raised in a Christian home, he must face the truth that all of us will eventually: That our righteousness is not enough in the face of a just God and that apart from Christ's perfect sacrifice there is no salvation. Beginning during the winds of the Civil War, Ms. Gouge gives her readers a peek into the soul of a young man who must face the coming war between North and South and the war within his heart.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to live a God-centered life.

It's about living life, the God-life, to the fullest - persuing it with excellence, &quot;running with the horses&quot;. It's about how living life this way, and refusing to accept or settle for the mediocre, is, for the Christian, the only true measure of success. In a goal-driven, achievement-orientated world, the life of Jeremiah offers hope and encouragement to those who do not fit the world's mould. Jeremiah's is a life lived passionately for God; a life that refuses to be beaten down, and to be conformed to the standards and patterns of the world. It's not an easy life - Jeremiah has more than his fair share of doubts, despair and rejection. But, ultimately, it's the only life worth living. A stunning piece of writing. Read it, and marvel."},{"Title":"Run with the Horses: The Quest for Life at its Best - MP3","review":"God said to Jeremiah, \\"If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you, how will you compete with horses?\\" To put it in modern language, \\"If you can't pay your bills on time, how are you going to walk on water?\\" Okay, sort of modern. The point is, God wants us to walk on water, and we're still struggling to pay our bills on time. That was Jeremiah's problem, until he realized, \\"No, I won't be able to do that in my own strength; but I will in Yours.\\" And that was when Jeremiah changed from being a spiritual workhorse to being a thoroughbred.No one says it like Eugene Peterson. He's one of the most eloquent writers around, and what he says is loaded with meaning. In this case, no one says what's involved in the quest for life at it's best like he does. In chapter 8, \\"My Wound Incurable,\\" in Run with the Horses, he describes a picture of prayer that looks very much like having dinner in a fine restaurant with the most important person in your life. It's private, intimate, conversational, meaningful, personal - in a word, special. Occasionally, the waiter shows up to take your order, bring your food or take the broccoli back because it was cold; but otherwise, it's just you and your special loved one.Then he writes, \\"But there is a parody of prayer that we engage in all too often. The details are the same but with two differences: the person across the table is Self and the waiter is God. This waiter-God is essential but peripheral. You can't have the dinner without him, but he is not an intimate participant in it. He is someone to whom you give orders, make complaints, and maybe, at the end, give thanks. The person you are absorbed in is Self - your moods, your ideas, your interests, your satisfactions or lack of them. When you leave the restaurant you forget about the waiter until the next time. If it is a place to which you go regularly, you might even remember his name.\\"The confessions of Jeremiah are no parody but the real thing - exclusive focus on God: intense, undivided preoccupation with God. This accounts for much that is powerful and attractive in Jeremiah. Here is the source of the personal intensity and incorruptible integrity that is so impressive in Jeremiah.\\"As Peterson unfolds the life of Jeremiah, you realize how distinguished it was for its lack of triviality, radical faith, unparalleled excellence, spiritual prowess, and risking of everything for God. But Jeremiah wasn't always like that. He had to start at square one like the rest of us. That is where he was when God asked, \\"What is it you really want, Jeremiah, do you want to shuffle along with the crowd, or run with the horses?\\" \\"The response when it came was not verbal, but biographical. His life became his answer, 'I'll run with the horses.'\\" So can we.Waitsel Smith"},{"Title":"Run with the Horses: The Quest for Life at its Best - MP3","review":"This book is a masterpiece. I have read the book of Jeremiah several times, but Peterson makes this prophet of old come alive. We end up feeling what Jeremiah felt; we see what he saw; we understand his fear. Peterson's intrepretation makes this Old Testament book apply personally to our lives whereas sometimes a person can read the Old Testament and have trouble seeing how it relates to modern day. God has surely blessed Peterson with gifts of writing, prophecy, interpretation and understand. Thank you Mr. Peterson for sharing your gifts with us all."},{"Title":"Run with the Horses: The Quest for Life at its Best - MP3","review":"Ancient Jeremiah as personal trainer? He of the many trials and tantrums?Revisited via Eugene Peterson's knowledge and sensibilities, the Old Testament prophet comes alive; he compels present-day readers to \\"run the race.\\" Jeremiah's words and works crackle with passion: visible, audible, and absorbable. You want to be like him--but luckier.As relevant today as when first published, Run With The Horses is a superb merger of scholarship, story, and style. Personal and eloquent, Peterson's observations and exhortations on postmodern culture mirror the ancient seer's: He challenges our assumptions, assuages our fears, and cheers our God-given aspirations.Brief selections from a wide range of writers enhance each thought-provoking chapter, and extensive End Notes point the way to further reading. If in doubt about an older book still being relevant, note the subtitle: The Quest for Life at Its Best."},{"Title":"Run with the Horses: The Quest for Life at its Best - MP3","review":"What do you do when times get tough? When life gets gritty? When the pressures of life squeeze you pencil-thin? Do you give up, give in, and despair? Or do you rise above the difficulties and uncertainties with faith and confidence? In \\"Run With the Horses: The Quest for Life at Its Best,\\" Eugene Peterson takes us through the life of the prohpet Jeremiah and shows us how we can live adventurously, courageously, and excellently despite the challenges we will inevitably face.\\"Run With the Horses\\" is not so much a commentary on the book of Jeremiah as it is a meditation on the life of Jeremiah. Though Peterson does move us chronologically through Jeremiah's life, he chooses only certain \\"episodes\\" or \\"situations\\" to discuss. Peterson ties his meditations on the life of Jeremiah to our lives as Christians, covering such topics as:* Our identities as human beings with a definitive purpose.* How we can be misled through deceptive teachings and words.* How our choices can twart God's purposes for us.* The importance of being honest and vulnerable before God.* The significance of persistence and perseverance when enduring life's challenges.* How God's ways and purposes often seem to contradict what we see and know from the world.In essence, \\"Run With the Horses\\" is a meditation on the anatomy of a life of faith--a risky endeavor that is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I was more challenged and encouraged by this book than any other book I have read in recent memory. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Run with the Horses: The Quest for Life at its Best - MP3","review":"In this study of the life of Jeremiah the prophet we come to see how those who seek to serve the Lord do not have it easy by any means, but the troubles we encounter actually make us more passionate and purposeful and we become all the richer in the process. One of my favorite parts is on page 24 where he says, \\"Life is a continuous exploration of ever more reality. Life is a constant battle against everyone and anything that corrupts or diminishes that reality.\\" Chapter 7 is especially insightful as it relates to the church today. He says, \\"What is wrong is to evaluate the worth of words and deeds by their popularity. What is scandalous is to approve only what is applauded. What is disastrous is to assume that only the celebrated is genuine.\\" How true! One can't help but see the similarity of the priest Passhur in Jeremiah's day to the leader of the largest church in the United States today when you read: \\"Everyone loved to hear him: he was positive, affirmative, confident. He had the ability to draw out the best from everything. He was able to search the Scriptures and find texts that made the darkest days bright.\\" I had to look at the front and see when this book was written.

I've never completed reading Jeremiah straight from the Bible cos I find it very heavy stuff. But after reading Run with The Horses, I'm beginning to appreciate this weeping prophet. I'm still mulling over those chapters that I've read and look forward to turning the pages still. Very sobering stuff in there for personal reflection. You can't ignore what you see/realise in yourself."},{"Title":"Run with the Horses: The Quest for Life at its Best - MP3","review":"\\"A book must be like an ice-axe to break the sea frozen inside us.\\" This quote from Franz Kafka is a worthy description of Peterson's compelling study of Jeremiah.The book speaks of living as a counter-cultural Christian and being authentically, vehemently human. And how so? Through an undivided preoccupation with God; by always taking the better rather than the easier way; by choosing courage over caution. And in so doing, being able to live at one's best, to not just shuffle along with the crowd but to run with the horses.This book is a sharp reminder against the cushy and postured soft-minded religion that, unfortunately, characterises most professedly Christian communities today.Through Peterson's writing, the portrait of Jeremiah comes to life in vivid terms - from his calling as a youth to his prophetic ministry, his friendships, his writings, his experiences of persecution and through it all, his dogged and single-minded obedience to God. He is presented as one who lives life at its best.For me, the book's biting prose and incisive observations, presented through a series of reflections on Jeremiah's life, made the material easy to relate to. Peterson's writing, as always, is \\"terse, concrete, poignant and graceful\\" (a quote from George Adam Smith used by the author himself in the book)A most excellent read that I cannot recommended more."},{"Title":"Run with the Horses: The Quest for Life at its Best - MP3","review":"This book is a study of Jeremiah who reminds us of the importance of not being shallow but of growing our faith, the importance of being authentic. One important point this book drove home for me was that we are free to choose the path we walk but we can't choose, or control, the consequences.

The book was written give or take 20 years ago, and still the technology is not outdated to the general public. Of course, the book would have been a tighter story if the characters did not have troubles with the cannibals, but even then Michael Crichton amazes us. The scenes of the camp are very scary and we really do wonder what happened in the Lost City of Zinj. Amy is more lovable than the other two major characters in this book, and the finale is a little much. This was my second Crichton book after &quot;JURASSIC PARK&quot;, which was much better and scarier, a more entertaining read. This book was great as a second helping, however.

I had high hopes that they might actually get this one right, but once again I was disappointed (I can't remember the last time I was impressed with the movie-version of ANY novel).Chrichton KNOWS how to write a thriller...IF you have treated yourself to any of his other books you know what I'm talking about. 'Congo' is no exception. From a lost city in Africa to a gorilla who understands sign-language and paints remarkable representations of this lost city... Sure it's totally unrealistic, but what Chrichton does BEST is give us a scenario wherein we begin to wonder whether or not it actually COULD happen. A city populated by gorillas that KNOW how to kill, and DO. It's not as unbelievable as you might think. Once again, when this novel came out, Chrichton was at the head of the class as far as technology goes, and even though it seems dated in that particular sense, remember 'Congo' was printed in 1980. When I first read 'Disclosure' I recall his talking about this new way of communicating over computers called, 'e-mail' and it seemed totally foreign to me THEN, but I certainly am aware of it today. NOBODY mixes technology into a fast-moving almost plausible thriller as well as Chrichton does, and if you'll excuse the references to things which we might consider hopelessly outdated today, this book is going to offer you a fantastic ride...TRUST me."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This an extremely good book, slightly predictable, and has great references to now out of date technology.

This book is for techincal thinkers who can visualize."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I loved CONGO, very much. It is extreamly suspensful and well written. It is about a tour guide person named Munro, Karen Ross, from a compony called ETRS, and Peter Elliot, with the gorilla, Amy which he tought sign language going to the Congo to look for the lost city of Zinj where there are specific diamonds called type IIb diamonds. They discover a new type of gorilla on the way and could prevent a World War III with these diamonds. It is funny because of all the &quot;top of the line&quot; computer equiptment which they talk about (the book was written in 1980). But anyway, there is a part in the book where everything is lost. EVERYTHING! The team can't take credit for finding ANYTHING. The book got exiting again but I was so disappointed that I dropped the 5th star I was about the give the book.

In the early morning they establish a satellite link with ERTS headquarters in Houston. When Houston connects, they see the images of smashed tents, crushed bodies, and dark shapes moving about the foliage. The connection dies when something approaches and systematically destroys the video equipment. ERTS needs to find the lost city because of the huge supply of technologically essential type IIb crystals located inside, so ERTS quickly arranges a new team. Complete with a sign language speaking gorilla and an arsenal of highly sophisticated technology, the team descends into the Congo rainforest. One of the great things about this book is that it captures the old-fashioned romanticism of hacking through unexplored jungles like a great 19th century explorer, But it also explores in great detail the complexity of modern technology. The characters enter the jungle with GPS systems, image intensifiers, electrified base perimeters, and the ever-present satellite link with Houston. All luxuries that Henry Stanley and David Livingstone had no access to in the 1800's. The book is surprisingly believable and well researched. All throughout the book, the author backs up the fiction with fact, going in depth into technological advances, primate behavior, and geological activity. The technical jargon makes it difficult to read at times but it's not enough to discourage one from finishing the book. Do not let the gruesome prologue deceive you however; this book does go pretty slow for a few chapters. But if you stick with it, it is well worth your time. The suspense is high from the moment they enter the jungle, and the threats include rebels, cannibals, superstitious natives, hippos, volcanic activity and the mysterious creatures that destroyed the first expedition. If you liked Jurassic Park or the Lost World, be sure to read Congo, it's non-stop excitement to the very end."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Definatly compelling, but it kind of lost itself to wards the end"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"The only reason I picked up Congo was because my friend and I and another friend were reading different books. The friend who was reading Crichton was being driven insane when my other friend and I were talking about our books, so we agreed to read each other's books. The deal included reading Congo, so I borrowed it. I liked Jurassic Park and the Lost World seemed okay, so I had expected an excellent read. And instead it's too predictable about the characters: pride goeth before a fall for Ross, Munro ends up making a profit even if he's a criminal, Amy goes wild, the expedition fails. I already figured out the fact that the people used gorilla guards, and that the gorillas used stone paddles. Some elements present in Jurassic Park and Lost World were here. Enough about the predictability. The book is full of suspense and mystery, and I even enjoyed the pages of prejudice about animals.(No exclamations of wonder, please, all you scientific-book-extract haters.) The book makes me feel as if Crichton is trying to tell us to wake up, animals are far more intelligent than you give them credit for. All in all, a good read, although not excellent."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This is one of my favorite novels, and Crichton is a delightful author. He confirms this with Congo, Spehere, Eaters of the Dead, and so far Timeline. Congo is about a team hired by a corporation to go out and find out what tragedy fell upon a previous expedition. There's plenty of action to keep you wanting more, and then enough to turn the page. The movie cut out the scene about the crashed airplane, and threw in a love story which is ashamed.

It is actually one of the worst adaptations in history, despite they had a good writer. A cast of caracters with different interests enters the dark and deadly Congo. Karen Ross is the most interesting of all. At the beggining one can't like her because she is cold and reserved, but then the reader starts rooting for her. She is under too much pressure to accomplish a mission with a goal that can be seen as greedy and evil. But she states that's part of her job. If her company doesn't do it, then they are finished, she says. Such indifference is hardly punished in the end. I like her because she isn't the stereotypical Good Girl-Sarah Harding-Ellie Sattler-Linda Hamilton-Michael Crichton rude macho heroine. She is just a computer expert like any other and has a very selfish behavior. Anyway, the reader later realizes all the characters are in it for fame and fortune (Peter Elliot is concerned of what to wear when the new species he has discovered is revealed.) The plot intelligently integrates all the different characters into the adventure, another weakness in the movie, in which Karen stupidly goes to the Congo to seek her ex-fiancee and even trusts that the company is funding the whole expedition only to seek him and not the diamonds. Looks like it's a new tendence to put characters in the wild seeking their lost love interest in movie adaptations (The Lost World). The ending is visually great and terrifying, however the epilogue is not very satisfying. Overall a very interesting, technical read that you won't put down"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Read the book only..........do NOT see the movie...it is comically bad."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"(This review refers to the ABRIDGED AudioBook read by Judith Ivey.)Some rare abridged audiobooks can capture the spirit and tone of a novel by cutting a great deal of literary chaff and leaving the listener with the meat of the story. This abridgment of Congo is not one of them. Nearly as lost as the plot's fabled city is Crichton's enjoyable and descriptive language. What the audience is left with feels like the comic book edition of the best-selling novel. WHAM! goes the introduction! ZOOM! to each next scene! Any subtlety Crichton had carefully placed in his words is left by the wayside in favor of actionactionaction.Judith Ivey has a silky reading voice and her narration is smooth... until she encounters any sort of accent... and Congo's got a wide variety of dialects. Her 'Texan' is poor, her 'British' is ridiculous (think Col. Critenden from Hogan's Heroes), her 'African' is insulting (some hybrid of staccato latino and mumbo-jungle), and her translation of Amy the gorilla's sign-language is just plain annoying (it almost sounded as if Ms. Ivey was plugging her OWN ears). I would highly recommend Ms. Ivey if she were reading a tale that took place primarily in the American Upper Midwest (or a teleprompter).Please read the book. Don't wait for the movie... or the tape."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Crichton does a wonderful job of telling how an expedition dissapears suddenly and swiftly in the unknown of the congo.

Crichton kept me on the edge of my seat as I was reading. I couldn't put it down. The description of the settings in the story were so good, I felt like I was there. The charectors we very well developed and had real everyday personalities. If you haven't read the book or seen the movie, read the book first. I enjoyed the book better than the movie. With the plot that this novel had, the movie could have been as good as Jurasic Park, but it lacked personality.If you like Crichton, and haven't read this one, give it a try, and maybe you'll like it."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo, what an amazing book! The tale of a group of explorers who go into the jungle, and then a group of bloodthirsty gorillas rain down on em like a plague. Very awesome, riveting book, way, way better than the movie. Amy is one hilarious gorilla (not an insult, she actually is a gorilla). Yep, good action sequences, cool gorillas, and a relatively believable concept. The reason it gets four stars instead of five is because of the long explanation sequences that occur frequently throughout the book. For example, there will be like five pages about the advancements of teaching apes sign language, and by the time you get through that, you don't even remember what was going on in the story. Coulda done without that, but otherwise a very good book. The movie is nowhere near as good, because the story is shorter and the acting sucks. Even Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson (two great actors for my money) can't breathe life into it. So, in conclusion, skip the movie, sit back, and check this out. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Personally I found this book to be intriquing. The characters and the setting are not a typical science fiction read. Although the books facts about the rainforest and the people are off, I found the story to be plausable. Crichton uses a setting for this novel which sets it apart from other works in the same genre. The characters are believable and some are even likeable in this story. Personally I would recommend this book to begining science fiction readers and casual fans as it is not steeped in science fiction lore. Great book and should be on every Crichton fan's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo by Michael Crichton is gripping story that merges three parts into a whole. The action commences with an expedition of eight dies enigmatically from barbarous beatings, which was recorded on video. Karen Ross in the Houston-based Earth Resources Technology Inc. watches how the deaths occur, and she notices a dark hazy moving figure. Mean while Peter Elliot cognizance his sign language speaking ape Amy has been drawing maps of the Lost City of Zinj, which is where this whole incident happened. As the story develops these Karen and Peter join forces to find the gruesome creature that massacred the expedition. This suspenseful novel that has you heart stop pounding while you turn the page. Crichton creates a fresh tale to weave his mystical words, creating what I believe to be one of his best books. My favorite part of the book is when Peter realizes that Amy has been troubled by the deaths of the expedition, so she begins to draw pictures that lead to the closure of the expedition's death. The bond by which Crichton starts out with three stories and weaves them into one is so strong in this book you could not scratch with a diamond. However I did not like the manner in which Crichton portrayed Karen Ross. Karen Ross is a very smart scientist who was admitted in to M.I.T at the age of thirteen. She is very compassionate, but seems too perfect and almost fake at times. Fortunately, her character does not detract from the story's electrifying plot. I would recommend this book for anyone who is not afraid of suspense and a remarkable use of words. However to receive the full potential of Michael Crichton's Congo, I would read it before I go to sleep."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I was quite disappointed with this book, though I had heard it was gonna be a great read. The basic story line is quite interesting and the desire to know the reasons behind why things happen the way they do make you read this book fast. Nevertheless the &quot;destiny&quot; of the main characters seems too predictable- it's like the heros can't die and this shows from the start. Nevertheless Crichton applies a great deal of scientific knowledge which gives this book a special touch. Comparing the style of Crichton in this book to the one of John Grisham I must say that Grishams books show many more intricate details and tricky-to-follow connections. All in all it's not a book you absolutely have to read."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo his a story that takes us on a journey to the darkest forests, where you thing and feel that you are a parte of it.

There was a couple things though. I didn't like the ending. The ending came very quick and undetailed. He sometimes did not detail some settings good enough to understand. I definately recommend this book to someone else. I feel its for anyone really. I think people would like it because it has culture, history, geography and thrilling events."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I thought this was one of Crichton's best books ever. It kept me on the edge of the seat the whole time. I loved the great detail of the story like Crichton always has."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"A very interesting book as well as very exciting.

It made me shiver in my chair as if I was caught in the midst of this thrilling and chilling novel.The facts that he puts in his books are very accurate. When it comes to sci - fi stories where everything ends up going wrong, you can't beat Crichton!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This book is awesome! If you Like planet of the apes, then this is a great book for you. This takes you deep inside the jungle and makes you feel like your in there and are fighting for your life. These apes are not to be messed with, especialy when they get smarter and smarter. Great book, if you want an adventure."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Note: Letter grades are given at the end of my reviews ranging from A (highest) to F (lowest).Congo (Michael Crichton, 442 pages) is typical Crichton fare. It's fast, simple, and it's very intense. Yet Congo is clearly thoroughly researched, and it's seemingly far-out scientific concepts are just plausible enough that the book manages to keep up its adventurous spirit.Peter Elliot is a scientist who goes on an expedition with a corrupt company named ERTS, looking for diamonds. However, Elliot is along for the sole purpose of introducing his friend Amy to the wild. Here's the catch: Amy is a gorilla, an extremely intelligent one capable of using sign language to great effect. Also along for the ride is Karen Ross, an appropriately chilling character who's brilliant in the head but icy in the heart.Naturally things aren't that easy for Ross, Amy and Elliot once they arrive along the titular river, and the harsh realities of jungle expeditions (mosquitoes, angry hippos) mix with the fictional ones that are invented for the sake of the story (or are they invented? Crichton seems to ask sometimes). Congo swaps the dinosaurs ofJurassic Parkfor a missing link of ferocious gorillas. And man, with Crichton at the helm, they're MUCH scarier than they appear in the campy film adaption.Congo is something of a beach read for Michael's fans. The book winds up tasting a bit like a sugary trail mix. It's not super-sustaining, but it sure goes down easy. B+"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I had mixed feelings about Congo: I very much enjoyed the parts of the book relating to the university gorilla, Amy, and the mysterious gorilla-like creature that was wiping out every human expedition into the area, but the rest of the book seemed forced, especially the mountain doing its thing. The whole set-up with a super-duper industrial espionage cum exploration cum research corporation that can go anywhere and do everything at a moments notice was a bit silly. And of course there were other consortia in a race to find a rare blue diamond which supposedly would revolutionize the computer industry (I'm still waiting to see this put into play).Crichton is a master at extrapolating cutting-edge technology and bringing it to the masses. Nanoparticles was the focus of 'Prey', an entertaining book. Here, Crichton looks at efforts to communicate with large primates, the computer manufacturing industry, modern-day Africa, and the possibility of rapid travel into the remotest parts of the planet (which aren't so remote anymore. I mean they are making a road to the South Pole!).All in all, it held my interest and there was a genuine interest in finding out if there was indeed a new species of primate in the Congo, and what was going to happen to the expedition (particularly to Amy, the gorilla). I'd rate it a 3 and 1/2."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This is a well-written, action-packed adventure novel that keeps the reader turning the pages. Imaginative and entertaining, this novel takes the reader to the Congo, where the ruins of the ancient lost city of Zinj are said to exist.When the camp of a small research expedition near the site of the ruins is destroyed by unknown forces in a matter of minutes with no survivors, a transmission of the ravaged site manages to makes its way back to the expedition's home base in Houston. The viewers, though stunned by the destruction, decide that the show must go on and another expedition is dispatched to the site on a mission of vast importance.This time the expedition is accompanied by a primatologist and Amy, a special gorilla with an ability to sign and a penchant for finger painting. One of her drawing just happens to bear an uncanny resemblance to an ancient drawing of the lost city of Zinj. When the expedition arrives, they will soon discover the meaning of this, much to their detriment.This is a marvelously written thriller, dense with detail and interesting characters, as well as a pervasive sense of dread as the expedition arrives at its ill-fated destination. The author does not fail to deliver an exciting reading experience that will keep the reader riveted."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I am a fan of Michael Crichton since I read \\"Jurassic Park\\" (and, of course, \\"The Lost World\\"). I thought that Spielberg was a Genius when I saw the movie but when I read the book I realized that the true genius behind the story was Michael Crichton. What is good in the movie was copied inch by inch from the book. So I started reading everything I could from Michael Crichton.Congo is just what I was looking for. A really good book, full of action scenes, with a good deal os scientific stuff explaning how everything that is written could have really happened. The characters are amazing and... what more could I say? Read it if you can! It's really great!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"The one thing you can absolutely depend on when you read a book by Dr. Crichton is that you will learn various trivia and assorted interesting facts related to topic at hand. The subject of this particular book is the great apes and their close kinship to humans. Guiding the reader through primate behavior is Amy, a gorilla belonging to a primate researcher. In short, the story is about a quest for buried treasure guarded by a band of apes that have been specially bred by the humans to protect the treasure by single-mindedly killing anyone who comes venturing too close. These are intelligent creatures who appear to adapt and change strategies to best their human adversaries. Amy seems to recognize them as gorillas but refuses to adopt them as one of her own kind (which apparently is normal, for gorillas raised by humans often think of themselves in those terms and look at other gorillas derisively. Although there appears to be a difference here --- Amy is actually afraid of these gorillas.) Alas, many tantalizing questions remain unanswered: were these apes a hybrid of human and gorilla genes? What happens to the humans who bred them? Did the apes kill them? Etc. But regardless, the book is an excellent read. I saw the movie released in the early 1990's based on the book, and am just catching up with the printed version."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This book arrived quickly and in great shape. The story is engaging and certainly shares some of the atmosphere of present day Congo too."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I had been looking for this book which seems to be out of print now. It arrived promptly and in good condition."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Some people are pretty uptight when it comes to a science fiction thriller.I loved this book. It kept me hooked throughout each of my transit rides into the city each day, and did not have one boring moment throughout. My only letdown was that the ending felt a little rushed, and that I would have loved a more suspenseful confrontation with the evil beings right at the end."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Michael Crichton had a unique style of storytelling that, at certain times throughout the book, made \\"Congo\\" sound more like a work of nonfiction than a sci-fi thriller. It has an interesting story that's filled with action and suspense, and it's scattered with a wide variety of informative bits about the advanced technology that's used in the story (some of which is now sorely outdated, but it's still kind of interesting to read about). A group of researchers, with the help of an ape named Amy who's trained to communicate to humans in sign language, go on a long journey into the Congo jungle in search of the lost city of Zinj. This is a very dangerous mission, not just because the group is in a violently unstable country but because of the savage apes living near the ruins of Zinj that viciously killed a recent expedition and destroyed all of their equipment. Congo is an unpredictable novel that has some solid character development as well as an engaging plot. It's filled with action and suspense as the characters strive to find answers to the many questions that arise in regards to Zinj and the apes living in that area.If there's one problem I had with the story, it seemed like there were a little too many coincidences in how the main characters were able to protect themselves from some of the gorilla attacks despite all the issues they were encountering and also how they were able to escape the jungle in the end. It seemed almost as if Crichton wrote himself into a few corners while trying to make the story as suspenseful as possible and ended up struggling to find realistic ways to rescue his characters. It's good enough though that if you don't think too much about it those moments won't bother you. With that in mind, I felt like a more accurate rating for this book should be 4.5 stars, but since that isn't an option I decided to round up because overall this is a very fun and suspenseful book. It's also a quick, easy read, not just because of the story's semi-short length but because of its progressively fast pace. The book becomes so suspenseful while bringing up so many questions that you won't want to stop reading until you find out what happens to the characters in the end and until all those questions have been answered. This is a classic page-turner by Crichton."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"It took a while for me to warm up to this one, but when I did I didn't want to put it down. This is a different kind of reading, not purely literary, to which many are accustomed.In the beginning he got close, too close for some reviewers, to the black hole of boredom, i.e., his extensive instruction on computer technology and the study of gorilla (and monkey) behavior. I believe the the latter was necessary for the story, particulary for those of us with no background knowledge of the subject. The computer technology lesson was probably cutting-edge at the time it was written, today it is old news, but that's not his fault. How could he know in 1980, that in 25 years 7 year old kids would get the same technology for birthday presents.I cannot say for sure where the book reeled me in, but once the actual \\"trip\\" began, I only put it down once - to sleep. The 2nd half of the book is much better,even with his continued gorilla behavior lessons.The story is smart and, eventually, very exciting, and well worth the initial effort. It was intelligently written, by someone who obviously did his homework on several subjects.This was my 2nd Crichton novel, the first being The Great Train Robbery, and I have enjoyed, and been impressed, by both."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I read this book a couple of years before the movie came out, and I have got to say that this novel is head and shoulders above the movie. I loved it!I know that many people have hated the movie, and this novel was incredible! I wish people would give more credit to the writer before the movie studios have a chance to ruin a good script.If you have enjoyed Crichton's previous scripts, you will love this one! Have fun!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I have to admit: I'm now a full-on Michael Crichton junkie, since he and Robin Cook have really nailed the one type of book that I think scares adults consistently, which is the techno-thriller. There's something out there we don't understand... our technology has failed... we're going to have to understand the science before we can destroy it and life can resume as normal. It's a little bit too serious for some, but Crichton makes it palatable. You will need read for depth of characters, as these characters are like animated cutouts motivated entirely by the synopsis of their characters presented at the start of their first appearance in the book, but the scenarios are terrifying and the writing gripping because it is sparse, to the point, and scientifically informed. In this case, the book not only handles mystery well, but makes some pointed investigations into where humans and apes are the same, and where we differ. This may be my favorite Crichton since \\"The Andromeda Strain.\\""},{"Title":"Congo","review":"As an Anthroplogy student I have a particular fondness to this book.

Alhtough superbly written, it did lack some of the technical intricacies of the usual Michael Crichton novel. As far as the book being family friendly, it didn't do too bad either, getting a T-rating from www.evalbooks.com I think the movie got a similar rating."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"\`Congo' is one the most fulfilling of Crichton's novels, giving the reader quite a bit to look forward to. It opens brilliantly with a savage Gorilla attack that leaves members of a research team dead. It's in these first few pages that the reader is hooked, and that continues to work throughout the novel, Michael never giving the reader a reason to put the book down. For those of your who have seen the critically panned film adaptation and have thus decided to steer clear of the novel as a result, I urge you to reconsider. As I have said before, Hollywood just doesn't seem to be able to do Crichton justice. His writing in general screams for the big screen but other than a few golden nuggets (the first Jurassic Park film for starters) Hollywood in general has done nothing but botch Crichton's brilliant work.That said, the book does a much grander job of fleshing out its characters as well as its surroundings. I've come to believe that Crichton can, with a few pen strokes, paint me a much more vivid picture than supplied by the Universal Studios. The plot revolves around a research group sent into the Congo with the purpose of finding diamonds that can help with advancing technology. Yes, Crichton slips in and out of describing in great detail what this all means, and that does mean that we are not only getting grade A science fiction but a science lesson atop it, but it's all good.The action is brilliantly paced, as is the balance of the novel, and it delivers every bit of the mastery we've come to expect from this famed writer. While it's dated, being written in 1980, and the technology may seem a bit, oh I don't know, lame to our current standards of advancement, Crichton still writes with such insistence and determination that it's all forgivable and even entertaining to gage what was considered advanced not to many years ago.Michael Crichton will probably never stop writing, he's just too good at it, but I find with each book that I read (I will admit that I have some catching up to do) that it's his earliest work that entices me the most. \`Congo' was the third novel I read by Crichton and it's one of the few that I remember often. I encourage any fan of science fiction who hasn't yet to give it a try, and any fan of Crichton's latest work who wants to see where it all began, take a wonderful trip back in time with this brilliantly framed jungle adventure that is sure to be an expedition to remember."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Wow. To be honest, I picked up Congo a little skeptically. I had, of course, seen \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"The Lost World\\" but that was the only exposure to the works of Crichton I had ever had. However, I found, that after I began I couldn't quit. It is one of those books that carries an air of raw, savage adventure. I haven't felt like this reading a book since \\"King Solomon's Mines,\\" and that's saying something.My only reason for docking a star from this book is that Crichton sometimes allows his characters to swear and curse, and that never helps a book in my opinion."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"The author did lots of research to produce this great work. Lots of facts. I like that, but TOO MANY. When reading, sometimes I would say things in my head, like \\"Get on with the story already!\\" All those years, names, and events were interesting stuff, but I wanted to read about the \\"actual story\\" more.I've learned more than I wanted about gorillas in this book. Brief education of animal behaviors and visualizaion of what jungles are like combined with actions and advantures. Not bad! I enjoyed reading it.\\"Peter tickle Amy.\\" :)"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This was the book that got me to enjoy reading back in the day. This was also my first Crichton, and I have to say I enjoyed it to the fullest. Easy to read adventure novel."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"If you watch the movie, you will be disappointed. I read this book and enjoyed it. I don't think it was as good as Sphere or Jurassic Park, but it was good nonetheless.The one thing you should understand prior to reading this, is that the movie doesn't depict how good the book is. I didn't enjoy the movie, and am glad that I read the book first.If you like Crighton, take a chance on it. You might just like it."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"While not my personal Crichton favorite, this book is a good read and a page-turner, and it catches your attention like a mousetrap and doesn't let go until you hit the last page. ERTS is a company that secures resources for other companies for manufacturing and such. When an ERTS expedition looking for Boron-coated diamonds is lost under mysterious circumstances in the Congo, a second team is immediately dispatched by Karen Ross, a mathematical prodigy. It consists of Dr. Elliot, an established zoologist and his gorilla, Amy, who understands English and uses sign language. Next is Charles Munro, a former mercenary to the Congo who adds dry logic to the team. From the start, the expedition has problems: a rival group sabotages the ERTS group, two members are held for drug possession, a war in the Congo shorts out their plans for a paradrop over the area, cannibals cause problems, a volcano, and, of course, the menacing gray gorillas. This has been criticized by others, but I found it a compelling plot device, especially why they are trying to kill the team. I also liked the incorporation of the Star Wars program as the reason for looking for the diamonds. If you like other Crichton books like Jurassic Park and Timeline, you will enjoy this book, even though the dated technology brings it down a bit."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I was looking for a horror book at the library last month. When I got Michael Crichton's book into my hands I thought &quot;Is this a fairy tail for childrens or something?&quot; The plot at the first sight seemed to be so childish with &quot;blue diamonds&quot; and &quot;killer apes&quot;. But as I am a big fan of fantasy novels and adventure books I decided to took the challenge. Michael Crichton's suspenseful book caused me terrible nightmares for weekes after I had finished the book. Obviously I'm a kind of person who gets scared and frightened when watching The Blair Witch Project. Well, after all the only big minus is because of the amazingly stubid end. The story could have ended much, much more better. Involving a volcano and its eruption into the end of the story completely spoiled it. But that is only my opinion, someother person would prefer the ending more satisfying than I do."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This book definitely deserves an applaud for many reasons. Michael Crichton did a real great job in changing of how the reader thinks of the book. Before people read, many think of how Congo is a book with a very childish plot, very far-fetched. However, the readers of this book really find out that this book is very far from being far-fetched. It has very informative details on everything that makes it seem very real.Congo is generally about an expedition team who searches for unknown gorilla-alike creatures in the lost city of Zinj. The plot of this story takes place in the 1980s in the middle of nowhere, in the lost world of Congo. Therefore, Crichton really gets the readers attention describing the 1980 atmosphere. He shows how the computers and other technology worked back then. This book also has many imagery scenes where a lot of killing is done. The unknown gorilla-alike creatures turn out to be pretty violent. This book is very action-packed and its suspense is non-stop from the prologue to the end.I give this book a star rating of 4 out 5. That's only one star less than from perfection. I really recommend this book to everyone. Congo should not only be read by people who like science-fiction, but anyone who has the littlest interest in a book filled with mystery, suspense, and action."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Crichton provides us a compelling thriller,with clever action even the characters are average.It can be compared with other novels of Crichton but is not his best work. Those who are interested in Africa will find it an excellent book,with also many details of the technology of 80s.It is a recommended book definitely and too bad that the movie was so bad despite her great special effects."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This Michael Cricton novel is quite gripping. Crichton paints a vivid picture of the many adventurous scenes this group encounters. Whether its the attack of the man eating gorillas, the escape the savages in the congo, the moments when Amy the signing gorilla gets kidnapped, escapes and finds her way back, there is much interesting dialogue. Some of the computer /technical parts are a bit distracting but overall this will keep most audiences interested."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"First time I heard about the book kongo I thought its just another stupid book from michael chrichton but i was mistaken.In fact the book reminds on good old days we have to explore the world without any science or explore somthing new something that will pull down your pants and you would wish your mami was here. So the book as itself is very good but it has that litlle mistake.The red dot of the story is lost somewhere in the middle of the book.And the story is to shalow.But anway you can read it if you want to be tortured."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I found this book a very good book. The Congo was fairly easy to read except for the computer transmissions. I did not like to read the coputer transmissions because half the time I did not under stand what it said. It was a very suspenceful book. I thought that the book was a lot better than the movie. The book goes into a lot more detail. The first half of the book was rather boring though because it was just explaining everything in detail. Like the facts that lead to what is going to happen. The second half was suspenceful, it keeps you on you toes. This made me want to read more."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I thought this book was quite good except for the random rambligns-on of computer and satellite technology and other pointless matters. I thought the characters were for the most part interesting, although I didn't like the ending where Karen Ross goes somewhat insane. Other than that I thought they were pretty well written. I especially like Kahega, Munro, and definetly Amy. I think the book could have done better without the epilogue, which I found dimeaning to the characters and the end of the story although I like the part about Munro being accused of something by some agent and then the agent showing up dead, but thats mostly because I like Munro."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This is a great book and worth looking into do not judge it from the inferior movie. I got into reading all this authors works after I read Jurassic Park. I was very entertained by the story and it kept me on the edge of my seat!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This novel kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I read. Michael Crichton does a good job displaying realism in this realistic science fiction novel. He creates a story in the darkest region of the Congo, near the Lost City of Zinj,where an eight-person expedition dies brutally in a matter of seconds. At the home base back in Houston, supervisors watch a gruesome video transmission of the ill-fated team: dead bodies, tents crushed, and a blurred dark moving image. A new expedition is sent to the Congo. Some are in search for diamonds while a primatologist is taking his gorilla Amy, who knows sign language, back to her home in the Congo. During the expedition they encounter trouble with the native tribes and man-eating gorillas. Many people die and there is a lot of action in this thriller. Life threatening creatures and jungle weather creates a setting which makes this book so entertaining. This book can be compared to &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; Both display great action scenes and interesting stories by the same author. I recommend this book greatly if you are either a science-fiction or suspense thriller fan."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I found myself on vacation with no book...tragic. I remedied this with a copy of Congo.As I read Congo, the story of diamond hunters in, yes, the Congo, I realized how much has changed since 1980. A cutting edge computer thriller, it has references pinball machines, five-inch floppies, 256Kmemory and portable cassette tape players. Yet it was also current, with its talk of DNA testing and the competitive threat of both the Japanese and Chinese in the world markets.Congo has it all: competing international diamond hunters, the Congo, African pygmies, cannibalistic tribes, various warring countries and factions, lost cities of bygone centuries, active volcanoes, sign-language gorillas, geographic history, gorilla history, African and Congo history, a possible new species of gorilla with its own agenda, communications satellites, plane crashes, hot air balloons, and, well I'm sure I'm leaving something out. Michael Crichton's deft writing brings it all together for an enjoyable action romp that works....almost. If anything suffers in the book it is the characters. So much is packed into the story that the characters do not develop, and are almost relegated to following the action, which never ends. The author has to explain a lot to the reader so that we can follow along. He does this as the narrator and often includes it in character dialogue. So much information is presented as dialogue that I get the picture of very educated people, stuck in the Congo with killer gorillas and dead bodies, finally snapping and pummeling each other to the ground yelling, \\"Why are you being so redundant? I KNOW all this stuff!\\" The reader often won't, however, making it important but at times slowing the book down.I wondered how this book could be made into a movie, and on a whim rented the 1995 thriller. The movie works by leaving a lot out (no cannibals, competing groups, and not even one African pygmy, among other things) and by breathing life into the characters and even introducing new ones. It does not do the book justice, but it does do what the book does not; it brings the characters to life.Congo ends with a three-page reference of all the works Crichton studied and referenced in writing the book. It was impressive and shows his ability to take so much and make it work. Before this reference section was an epilogue explaining what happened to the books major characters when the adventure had ended. I found myself less interested in this and more interested in the reference list, as Karen, Peter, Munro and the rest never really impacted me, and were lost in a thriller that has everything but the kitchen sink."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"The film adaptation of this novel was criminal. Do not let that movie turn you off from this fantastic novel (my personal favorite from Crichton). The overall plot is the same: a research team disappears after an apparent attack by gorillas. A second team is dispatched to discover what happened and comes under attack from the same violent gorillas. Like other Crichton novels, this contains a lot of description and explanation of various sciences and technologies that surround the characters. Unfortunately, the technology is dated because of the 1980 publication date. Nevertheless, the action and suspense in this novel are first-rate. This was the first Crichton novel I ever read and it made me a fan instantly. I've read almost every Crichton novel since because of this book. This is one of those books you can't put down until you finish it. When you're done, you just want to read it again."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"If you are going to be at the beach , then Congo is clearly the book for you. Congo is a good old-fashioned jungle adventure yarn. The author, Michael Crichton, was clearly inspired by the adventure stories of H. Rider Haggard but with a slight dose of Conrad. And since this is a Crichton novel, the reader will read about technological ruminations, which provoke Crichton's favorite theme - man meddling with nature when he probably shouldn't.A rescue team, funded (and partially staffed) by a U.S. based technology corporation, is sent to the middle of the Congo area of Africa to determine the mysterious disappearance of a prior team. On their extraordinary journey, they encounter rebellious armed forces of central African nations, fabulous cities with lost treasures, strange tribes tucked away in the forest, cannibalistic groups and some unknown force that appears to kill. Crichton keeps the pace swift so you will keep the pages turning.This book is a delightful read because Crichton delivers on his trademarks. He blends well-researched topics from diverse sciences - Congo covers biology, anthropology, archaeology, as well as descriptions of high-tech equipment (for 1979). Crichton effectively increases the suspense by giving the locations scale and a powerful perspective. The mountains, \\"unending virginal forest\\", and \\"thousands of miles of unexplored territory\\" dwarf his human characters. Finally, Crichton's storytelling gift of framing the story as a true account (along with an extensive bibliography) lends the verisimilitude that so often elevates Crichton's work.You will not be disappointed with this quick read."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"In Houston, Texas, a shocking video from the Congo appears before the eyes of Karen Ross, a scientist of the company ERTS. She sees the campsite of ERTS' current expedition destroyed and its members dead. Karen Ross is sent to the Congo to find out what happened with the help of a primatologist by the name of Peter Elliot, Peter's gorilla that is fluent in sign language, Amy, and an experienced guide named Munro with his crew of porters. Karen discovers that she must race to the Congo against German and Japanese scientists to find a specific diamond that may hold the key to the future, and she is driven to succeed at any cost. They must face bellicose hippos and tribes of fierce cannibals. As the expedition progresses, a vicious new species may tamper with the success of the expedition, and with the crew's lives.I would have to say this is one of Michael Crichton's finest works. The book gives plenty of background information, making it easy to understand the plot and what's going on. After awhile, it is impossible to put the book down for its extravagant details and stunning scenes. The action is well described and sucks you into the book. The characters are very three dimensional and many have such great personalities that make the book's slower parts fun and interesting. One of the most interesting characters would have to be Amy, the gorilla fluent in sign language. She makes even the most fearsome scenes hilarious. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because it is not incisive enough, for it takes about 150 pages for the book to really draw you in.I highly recommend this book, for it is one of the best books I've read in years."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Now I have read nearly all of Michael Crichton's sci-fi novels, and CONGO...is definitely the best out of all of them.

The movie doesn't do it justice, then again since when did a movie ever did a book justice.Congo is about a quest for rare diamonds and then you throw in silverback gorillas, a few competitors , a couple of plane crashes, a bunch of angry hippos, cannibals, explosives, warfare, ancient ruins, a primatologist, a guide, a bunch of guys who speak swahili and one hell of a crazy leader who would jeopardize everyone's life so long as she would get to the diamonds first!!!If you're going to read one novel this lifetime...read PSYCHO.

Because it's a resource that can make nuclear power obsolete, others want it just as badly. When their Congo field team's satellite check-in gets interrupted by the deaths of all its members, apparently at the hands of a band of gorillas behaving in totally atypical fashion, ERTS dispatches supervisor Karen Ross to lead the next attempt. As the 24-year-old mathematics prodigy and her new team fight their way toward a goal they may never reach, her drive to succeed may be what keeps them alive. Or it may just as easily be what finally kills them, too.Joining the ERTS team are primatologist Peter Elliot and Amy, an adolescent gorilla trained by Elliot to communicate using American Sign Language. Ross hopes Amy may make a difference if they encounter the first team's killers, while Elliot has his own agenda. Meanwhile, the Congo's chronic unrest boils over into tribal warfare - and the local volcano threatens to just plain boil over.I picked this book up expecting a \\"not his best\\" effort by one of my favorite authors, after finding the movie version rather - well - hokey. But what came across that way on the screen works fine in Crichton's prose. A wild roller coaster ride! Great fun, and a nice tribute to H. Rider Haggard, too."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This book definitely deserves an applaud for many reasons. Michael Crichton did a real great job in changing of how the reader thinks of the book. Before people read, many think of how Congo is a book with a very childish plot, very far-fetched. However, the readers of this book really find out that this book is very far from being far-fetched. It has very informative details on everything that makes it seem very real.Congo is generally about an expedition team who searches for unknown gorilla-alike creatures in the lost city of Zinj. The plot of this story takes place in the 1980s in the middle of nowhere, in the lost world of Congo. Therefore, Crichton really gets the readers attention describing the 1980 atmosphere. He shows how the computers and other technology worked back then. This book also has many imagery scenes where a lot of killing is done. The unknown gorilla-alike creatures turn out to be pretty violent. This book is very action-packed and its suspense is non-stop from the prologue to the end.I give this book a star rating of 4 out 5. That's only one star less than from perfection. I really recommend this book to everyone. Congo should not only be read by people who like science-fiction, but anyone who has the littlest interest in a book filled with mystery, suspense, and action."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"In the heart of the African rainforest, an exploration team equipped with the latest in scientific technology has set up a camp in the proximity of the city of Zinj, which has been abandoned for hundreds of years. Being in constant video-contact with ERTS headquarters, the team is suddenly seen to be brutally massacred by what turns out an unknown species of gorilla on the monitors in Houston.R. B. Travis, director of Earth Resources Technology Systems, boasts the cynical motto &quot;Some damn thing always goes wrong&quot;, and has therefore been prepared for the worst. Immediately, a recovery team is put together, with further instructions to continue the previous expedition's work. This new crew is joined by Amy, a &quot;civilized&quot; gorilla who possesses the knowledge of sign language, to function as a guide on the haphazard journey into the dark, unexplored depths of the Congo.The heavy research than defines the author's style furnishes Congo with a both realistic and informative plot. But since this book is primarily a thriller, Crichton doesn't allow the suspense to be smothered by dry schoolbook facts for a moment, and one can therefore anticipate a page-turner difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo is the story of an expedition going into the Congo rainforest to find a special type of diamond to further computer technology. This book is fast paced, Interesting and has a pretty solid ending. One thing that I noticed is that I was so into the book that I didn't even realize that the last page was 10 pages away. The Mystery the action. Even a little bit of humor. Defiantly one of Crichton's best after Jurassic Park.

The idea of talking gorillas sounded crazy when I bought this book, but after I finished, the idea seemed likean idea definetely worth looking into.This was also my first Crichton book. It was tense, factual,and fast, just what I was looking for.Amy the Gorilla was a benefit to me. I had never thought of gorillas being gentler than chimps, orwhat I would do in a situation when I would go face to face with a gorilla. This book, being packed with scientific facts, made me wonder:What would I do in the Congo rainforest?

The first being \\"Timeline.\\" It's been quite a few years since I first read that book and I remember enjoying it very much. I failed to see the movie for it and really don't care to, especially now. When the film version of \\"Congo\\" hit the screens a few years ago, I enjoyed it thoroughly. It reminded me of all the old jungle flicks from the golden age of cinema. However, now having read the book, I feel somewhat cheated by its celluloid counterpart. This book is so much more engaging that it really is a shame how the movie fails to do it justice.While the core of the story, a team is sent out to find diamonds key to technological advances and they use a young grad student and his signing gorilla as cover to sneak into Africa, is still there, the book contains elements not even mentioned in the film. We get to know the expedition party a lot better in the book. We also have a lot more conflicts and meetings with the locals such as Pygmies, Kigani, and General Muguru and his men. Also, the gray gorillas are given a nice and complete treatment. I felt like I knew them better in this book than most of the human characters in the film.The film added quite a few things. For one, the gorilla, Amy, doesn't wander around in a boxy sign translator. Only Peter Elliot joins the group's escapade to the Congo, not his assistant as in the movie. The grisly death of the first team is found in the movie, but the book mentions nothing of Dr. Karen Ross having any type of relationship with one of the original team's members. In fact, she comes across as very frigid and uninterested in finding a boyfriend in the jungle. Tim Curry's character, while funny in the film, is non-existent here.The book moves at a very quick pace. Even when Crichton goes off on a class lecture about gorilla behavior or the advanced (for 1980) state of communications, he still manages to hold the reader's attention.Overall, this is a wonderful jungle thriller. If you enjoy authors such as Clive Cussler, you're sure to enjoy Crichton. His writing is intelligent, fun, and easy to digest even though it's full of factual information that, in textbook form, would be wretchedly boring.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"the gorillas are a different story.This 1980 thriller from Michael Crichton (ANDROMEDA STRAIN, JURASSIC PARK) draws on the author's background in anthropology. A company that uses high tech methods of research is seeking diamonds in Zaire. When they lose contact with their on site team under very mysterious circumstances a second team is hastily assmebled in an effort to beat a rival organization to the site. This second team is lead by a untried young woman whose expertise is the technology, an experienced jungle guide with a shady past, an anthropologist and Amy, a young gorilla. So why include an anthropologist and a gorilla in a geological survey? The previous team was sending their daily report via satellite uplink when suddenly communication was disrupted, the last image on broadcast was a closeup of a gorilla peering into the camera.As is typical of Crichton novels there is a lot of science involved leading to many long passages laying the groundword for the reader. These do not make for exciting reading but Crichton more than makes up for that in the action scenes as the team races from Houston to Tangier then across Africa to Zaire in search of a lost city on the slopes of a volcano. The characters are rather one-dimensional, Amy is the most fully realized. The plot is a bit thin, and rather predictable. The predictablity is due in part to the observations of what various characters would say about the events later, thereby revealing who would survive the events.This is not one of Crichton's best but it is still a good read, if the reader is willing to overlook a few holes in the plot and just go along for the ride. As is often the case with Crichton's work the reader will be left wonder where fact leaves off and fantasy begins. There is a bibliography at the end which will give the reader a starting place for a little research. Also the cutting edge technology described is now rather obviously thirty years out of date."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I have read three Crichton novels: Jurassic Park, Timeline, and Disclosure, and have generally enjoyed them as compelling, fast moving, and thought provoking. They invariably involve a scientific (or legal, in the case of Disclosure) concept that is extrapolated to create a gripping story, despite somewhat flat characters. Congo, however, was a disappointment. While he builds on two scientific concepts--animal communiciations and evolution--the story fails to grip as it should, pushing him to add some additional conflicts just to maintain some suspense. And while they seemed forced, they might have provided for a satisfying story if only all of the loose ends were resolved at the end. But they weren't, leaving me with a hollow feeling. My recommendation for a reader who has never read Crichton to try Jurassic Park or Disclosure. For those who have, avoid this one."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I read the book some time ago, but I remember not being too impressed with this one. Chrichton's books usually have some sort of science development that make the story interesting, and, what was it computers and communications in this one?

It's enough to make you wonder if we're talking about the same Michael Crichton.It wasn't the dated technology that put me off -- there was a time when I too thought 256K was a lot of RAM -- it was the... unthinkingness of the novel. F'rinstance: the satellite link has enough bandwidth for video, but not for voice -- an un-overlookable gaffe for a science-fiction writer. And later in the book our intrepid adventurers discover a mine-shaft in a cliff face with gem stones sticking out of the walls not ten feet from the entrance -- as if anyone would keep digging when he could just pluck the gems out of the dirt. Flubs like that stop a story cold.And *then* (SPOILER WARNING!) after all this hoo-haw, the monsters turn out to be gorillias who hit folks in the head with rocks. No, they don't throw the rocks with deadly accuracy; neither do they set up clever ambushes. They just walk up to people and bash them. And for all their space age, motion-sensing gatling-guns, our heroes just can't seem to deal with that.

Amy a gorilla is being thought sign language by Elliot has started to draw strange drawings of an old forgotten city. Houston decides to send a new team to the Congo to investigate and find what the other team died trying to find before all heal brakes loose. I think that Michael, the author, wanted its readers to help save the rainforest because there are species of animals and plants that we haven't discovered.

But if you expect the whole book to deal with these gorillas, you will be way off the mark, 'cos Crichton talks about these gorillas only in the last third of the book or so, and even then he is not very convincing in arousing suspense and fear in the reader as he did in Jurassic Park and Lost World.

Munro is a brave English hunter settled in Tangier who leads the expedition, and is a strong character. Also included in this story is a lost city - Zinj, Crichton not describing it in much detail.

It is actually one of the worst adaptations in history, despite they had a good writer. A cast of caracters with different interests enters the dark and deadly Congo. Karen Ross is the most interesting of all. At the beggining one can't like her because she is cold and reserved, but then the reader starts rooting for her. She is under too much pressure to accomplish a mission with a goal that can be seen as greedy and evil. But she states that's part of her job. If her company doesn't do it, then they are finished, she says. Such indifference is hardly punished in the end. I like her because she isn't the stereotypical Good Girl-Sarah Harding-Ellie Sattler-Linda Hamilton-Michael Crichton rude macho heroine. She is just a computer expert like any other and has a very selfish behavior. Anyway, the reader later realizes all the characters are in it for fame and fortune (Peter Elliot is concerned of what to wear when the new species he has discovered is revealed.) The plot intelligently integrates all the different characters into the adventure, another weakness in the movie, in which Karen stupidly goes to the Congo to seek her ex-fiancee and even trusts that the company is funding the whole expedition only to seek him and not the diamonds. Looks like it's a new tendence to put characters in the wild seeking their lost love interest in movie adaptations (The Lost World). The ending is visually great and terrifying, however the epilogue is not very satisfying.

However, I do believe that Crichton, unlike in his other novels, gives his characters sufficient motivation to keep the reader interested in them as well as his plot.

There is less character development than in most of his novels. At some points the book is exciting, then you go into a 2 chapter discussion on medical history, ape history, or what have you. During these discussion points, there is no dialogue, no excitement, and no character interaction. Beside these points, the book can be suspenseful and very fun to read. The plot is complex and will keep you wondering about what will occur in the Lost City of Zinj.Synopsis: An expedition to the Congo is a failure. The entire archaeologist party has been murdered by a mysterious gray apelike creature. Scientists at a laboratory in Houston have watched the video transmission of this, and plan to send in another expedition to investigate the occurance. A scientist named Elliot and his specially trained gorilla, Amy, are also involved in the new expedition plan. While on their way to the Congo, the members of the expedition encounter other hazards, including the kidnapping of Amy. What goes on when the party reaches Zinj is far more eventful and terrifying than anything that has happened in the book so far.Readers of this very slow novel require patience, which I do not have. Only recommended for hardcore fans of Michael Crichton."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo is another of Michael Crichton's wonderful masterpieces. It is a brilliant mixture of suspense, action, and unthinkable horrors. This book kept me busy, reading page after page, never wanting to stop. Michael Crichton's realistic jungle setting and descriptions greatly enhanced the feeling of suspense and thrill. At the climax in the book, my hands were sweating and my heart was thumping against my chest.This book hurls readers deep into the depths of the Congo Jungle and the ruins of the Lost City of Zinj, where they came upon an ill fated field expedition. All the men were brutally killed and the camp destroyed in a matter of minutes. Back in Houston, the project directors watched the gruesome satellite transmission. In the midst of the ruined camp, they saw a dark, blurry, hulking figure prowling near the bodies. All the men had died the same way; their skulls were crushed. After minimal investigation, the company sent another expedition to the Congo Jungle, plunging the field expedition into the terrible unknowns of the Congo Jungle.Congo is another must read for the books written by Michael Crichton. He has an extraordinary way of writing a book that draws people's attention. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy adventure stories. Many parts of the book take place in a eerie twilight setting where the surrounding jungle seems to be vibrant and mysterious. In addition, if you want an extra surge of thrill, read the book at night, alone, and in a quiet room."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo was the fourth Crichton book I've read (Rising Sun, Timeline, Disclosure) and although an interesting read I felt that the excitement level at the end of the novel (i.e. the last 100 pages) was lacking. The detail of primate studyies a found to be very captivating but I put the book down after the last page hoping for something more. However, all in all this was a good book and should serve as a nice, quick read."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"In _Congo_, an expedition team was found brutally murdered by a gorrila like animal. This was caught on a video transmission. Just before the creature breaks the video camera, it is caught on tape.Taking no time, another expedition team is set out to get a special type of diamonds at the Lost City of Zinj. Karen Ross is put in charge of the expedition, along with with Peter Elliot and his &quot;talking&quot; gorilla Amy.This is another page-turner by Crichton. I highly recommend this enthralling read."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Before reading this, I finished JURASSIC PARK, and, believe me, they both seem pretty different. Don't get me wrong, though- they're both absolutely fabulous.This is mainly about a lost city called 'Zinj' that was a really prosperous and ancient diamond mine in the Congo. Though it had been lost for years, a sort of artifact-hunting American company used technology to find the location. They immediately form a team to go and get it before the rival company finds the diamonds first. Why are these diamonds, that are supposed to be laced with impurities, so desirable? It turns out that these so-called 'blue diamonds' is one of the key factors to the making of super fast- and expensive- computers. Whichever computer company gets these diamonds will have a monopoly on the market for about the next five years- which makes the buyers extra and specially intent ($$$$$$$$$$) to get 'em.But, the team has a bit of a problem. The eight crew members mysteriously were murdered on-site. Video footage of the site shows that the attacker was a black figure that looks exactly like a gorilla.And that's one of the reasons why Amy, a super-smart gorilla that knows-and has conversations- in sign language is recruited for the ride. She had recently been having nightmares of the city, because that was where her mother had been murdered- in exactly the same way that the researchers had.So they set off for the city, prepared for whatever the monster may be...One thing that you have to love about Crichton books is that they're so incredibly scientific. At the beginning, anything can be possible, from aliens to yetis to monsters, but in the end, the REAL scary thing is that it really seems possible. I was a total Crichton fan after reading just one of his books; they all rock, this one included. Even if you're a bit wary about reading a book that sounds so centered around a monkey, go for it. you'll be surprised."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I enjoyed this one alot. Chrichton always has a way of catching and keeping my interests. Having nearly the whole first half of the book on a close race/time schedual, really had me reading fast. And it was packed with primate facts containing everything from studies on chimps to morals on animal testing. Being a reader of adventure stories, I think he could have spent a bit more time having the team explore the ruins of the lost city, and some of the technical equipment was a bit outdated, but you have to remember when it was written. Over all, I thought it was just lots of fun, staying true to Chrichton's style of mixing fact and fiction, with very imaginated plots."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I've only read one crichton book but this is byfar the best book ive read in my life."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This is a good start. As many point out, the older technology is fun to come across periodically but I didn't find it distracting at all.What I enjoyed most was the gradual reveal of the puzzle behind everything in this book. The quest for blue diamonds is more than a bit farfetched but if you enjoy technical mysteries, it is done better here than in some of Lincon/Preston books such as 'Relic' &amp; 'Thunderhead', two books that are very Crichton-esque in their reading. 'Rising Sun' has a better mystery at its core than this book but it lacks the overall fun that can be found here."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"If you are looking for a good book, you will find one in &quot;Congo&quot;. But I didnt find that it was a big page turner, Not until the end at least. Amy the gorrilla is a wonderful creation my MC, and she even makes you laugh more than a few times in the book. But I think that he talked about Amy a bit much. People purchase this book expecting it to be all about huge killer grey gorillas, and its not. It is more about searching for diamonds and the gorilla Amy than anything. It was a good book, but not what I expected it to be."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This was one of the first Crichton books I ever read. If you look at every book that was turned into a movie over the past 20 years, Congo the book has to be one of the top three in terms of \\"how much better the book was than the movie.\\" I was very disappointed by this movie after reading the book.Michael T.

The subject matter/plot was boring."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"The plot line was written well, along with the charater discriptions and overall flow to the story. UNFORTUNATELY there seems to be a misunderstanding within the cover about if the author is part of the story or not. One paragraph he will be talking in the 1st person then the next paragraph its in the 3rd person. I was confused but definately a good book to read."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo by Michael Chrichton further shows what a great author Chrichton really is. The story is fast paced, scientifically accurate, and well researched. The only drawback to this story is that it is not as close to home as some of his other stories (excluding Eaters of the Dead).The story revolves around a company called ERTS trying to find blue boron diamonds in a lost city in the African wilderness. An 8 man crew of geologists have already been filmed brutally murdered by some unknown cause (some researchers believe an unknown species of gorilla). A new team is sent out that involves two PhDs, a guide, a few porters, and of course a talking gorilla neamed Amy. Well she uses sign language. After a dangerous journey to the site, the crew discovers that the lost city if filled with nocternal gorillas that were trained as killers.Crichton does an excellant job making a story as odd as this, believeable and even enjoyable.This book was written in 1980 and some of the technology is a little dated. However this does not take anything from the book. The author does make a couple of predictions that are considered off the wall today, but how would he know.I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to be entertained by a \\"techno-thriller\\" such as this. Although this book is not quite as \\"tech-y\\" as some of Chrichton's other books."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This was another great novel by Michael Crichton. This book starts out quick with the killing of the eight group members, then it slows down to introduce the characters including a gorilla that understands sign language. The gorilla will help them out in the end... They will find some other stuff that they didn't expect to come across including diamonds and the terror that took the lives of the first group of members.Once the story gets going though, you can't stop reading it, you'll never want to put it down. There is a lots of twist and turns that will suprise you. If you enjoy a good science fiction then you will enjoy both the technology and the story. If you don't enjoy science fiction, if you can see past the hubble in the beginning with the systems, you will still enjoy this story. It's a good book for everyone."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Diamonds have held man's fascination from antiquity. Though its brilliance and hardness are widely known, its electrical properties are not. Michael Crichton uses a quest for blue diamonds to unleash an action-packed piece.In Crichton's Congo, Earth Resources Technology Services, sends an expedition team to search for elusive diamonds in a war-torn and ape-infested central Africa. This first team ends up dead, and another is sent to reprise the mission.Karen Ross, a computer programmer; Peter Eliott, a primatologist; Amy, a gorilla; and Munro, a mercenary non grata, make the trip into the jungle, hoping to defeat a similar conquest by a rival consortium. When Ross reaches the mysterious Zinj and meets the custodians of this lost city, she realizes that though diamonds are a woman's best friend, with some friend's there are no need for enemies.This is a suspense-filled novel with a tight plot driven by science. Crichton cannot be accused of shoddy research. Congo is replete with technical jargon and scientific explanations, ranging from Primatology and Language Functions to Computer Programming and animal mistreatment. His digression on laboratory animals was enlightening (I was introduced to 'Taxonomic discrimination'); RSPCA and ASPCA closely resemble the modern-day PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.In some respect, the science is a bit ambitious and dated, nonetheless, this is a book worth reading with a movie worth watching."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"After an expedition team, and its camp, is wiped out, perhaps by strange apes, in the dark jungle of the Congo, another team is quickly assembled to finish the mission -- finding the blue diamonds in a long lost city. A gorilla researcher and his gorilla \\"Amy\\" are tapped to join the mission. Michael Crichton is a very good story teller and this book is very well researched. To enjoy \\"Congo\\" however requires some suspension of critical analysis of the plot and the intellectual capability of Amy. This book is cotton candy with exactly no nutritional value. For a summer beach read, this book hits the mark. Crichton's misty jungle is full of hazards that would turn back all but the most single minded explorers. I was hooked within the first few chapters and I finished the book in short order. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I have read many books but none have stood out in my mind as well as Congo has. Michael Crichton has out done himself this book is great. Elliot, Ross, and Amy travel to the Congo in search of industrial grade blue diamonds. They run into a new species of gorilla and from there the story gets much more interesting. Overall it's a great book."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I am giving this book three stars because, while it is entertaining, and far better than a lot of books by other authors, for Michael Crichton, it just isn't up to snuff. If I were going to rate it just based on his other work, with no comparison to other authors, I would give it only one star-- maybe even only half a star. However, compared with alot of the drek that gets published these days and even makes the best seller lists, this book is still a heck of a lot better than most."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"One of Crichton's most interesting books. This book starts out with a 8 person field expedition dies brutally in a matter of seconds. At HQ, Karen Ross watches the gruesome videotape. Dead bodies, tents crushed and torn, and a moving dark image. Everyone else goes into the jungle of Africa for The Lost City Of Zinj which, unfortunately, is guarded by man eating gorillas that killed Amy's mother. Amy is the expeditions \\"talking\\" gorilla who talks with sign language. Eventually,a volcano erupts and the expedition goes home just in time."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I could never get into this book, I'm a big Crichton fan, but this is nowhere near his best.

The movie was bad the book was worse!!

I almost wish I'd left it at the airport.When my wife asked me if I liked the book, I told her I could write better than this guy. Now I'm in theprocess of proving it.Congo has a good amount of research behind it, and it shows. Crichton has a knack for finding detailsand attempting to weave them into a story. But by the time you finish the book do you really care whathappened to the characters (other than the ape)"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Cong Vintage is An oldie buit a goodie..... I had forgotten a lot of the story line even after previously reading the book and watching the movie."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This was the second book of Crichton's that I have read, the first being Jurassic Park, and as of now this has become my favorite book of his. Crichton does a great job of balancing story with technical aspects, the pace never slows down and from the moment I read the first chapter I could not put it down. If you are familiar with Crichton's work I highly recommend this one, it's a fantastic read and I think anyone will get hooked on it right away. Of course if you are not familiar with his work then I suggest give this book a try and you might become a fan of Crichton's as well!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Travelers entering a mysterious, exotic, and dangerous territory will make for a fun story if done right, and this Crichton manages to do. Now, this is a little unfair, considering these predictions written circa 1979, 1980, but here are a couple of rather dates quotes from the novel:\\"this country will go to war over Zaire before we go to war over any Arab oil state.\\"Two Iraq wars and a Libya war, and a lot of drones later this probably sounds silly, especially since millions died in the Congolese civil war and the US did nothing. But the US was heavily involved, on a covert level, in the Congo during the 1960's.\\"Experts anticipated that by 1990 there would actually be one billion computers--most of them linked by communication networks to other computers. Such networks didn't exist, and might even be theoretically impossible (A 1975 study by the Hanover Institute concluded there was insufficient metal in the earth's crust to construct the necessary computer transmission lines.)\\"Now, I doubt the one billion mark was reached until the 2000's but I think we can safely say there are more than a billion computers in use today and the the earth's crust hasn't been depleted of metal.I'm not using these predictions to attack the novel. I actually admire them. They're not vague, hazy Nostradamus BS predictions. They're so precisely wrong that they're almost prescient."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Great book,the movie did a good job,since this was an oldone cassett only I had to order two to get a good one,but it was worth."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo is a great book that i loved reading all the way to the end. The explanation reds \\"deep in the heart of the darkest region of the Congo, near the legendary ruins of the lost city of zinj, an eight person expedition dies mysteriously and brutally in a matter of minutes.\\" That is only the beginning of the description. Its an exciting book with a lot of action and tons of exciting scenes where i couldn't put the book down. Overall, its a an exciting read with a lot of fun for everyone suspense."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Much of the book is about fantasy computer technology, which is dated by modern standards, making the messages look silly.

Elliot's sign-language female gorilla supports the effort."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"One of the BEST books I have ever read!! Michael Crichton's novels take into a totally differnet zone. It only took me three days to read this and it would have been less if I did not have things to take care of! This novel is great and full of wonderful facts and quotations. This novel shows great example of utilizing research."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Michael Crichton is one of my favorite authors and Congo just didn't get me involved like many of his other novels. The focus seemed to be more technology oriented (interesting though) than focusing on the characters or the suspense aspects of many of his other novels. One of my favorites is &quot;The Great Train Robbery.&quot;"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"It is a well-written novel about a team of American scientists that go to the Congo rainforest to investigate strange and unexplained happenings. It is full of extravagant detail. Each page is full of excitement and suspense. With each chapter, a new explosion of adventure occurred. There was always someting exciting happening so the novel was never boring. I even enjoyed the prologue! I urge you to read this marvelous novel by the author Michael Crichton, also author of well knownnovels such as 'Jurrasic Park' and 'The Lost World'."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I saw the ovie before i read the bok, the movie was OK, but it made me want to read this masterpeice of a novel. I really liked all the conversatons with that small comuter with the shortened words (For example 'TUF LUK' funny, FUNny, FUNNY!!!) I thought the book was MUCH BETTER then the movie, even if the movie had Bruce Campbell in it. So the next time you want to read about a jungle expedition, you have two choices, watch the really stupid Chef Boy Ar Dee commercial, or read this book. I suggest reading the book."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I have read almost all of the books by this superb author. I liked all of them. I saw the movie for Congo and I kinda assumed that the book would be remotely like it. NOPE. Well, I guess a bit. The book was too educational. If I wanted to learn about gorillas and stuff, I would ask my biology teacher. But I guess that's the point of books like these : if they didn't exist, we would never learn about gorillas and stuff. My only complaint is the ending, I waited the WHOLE story to get to the gripping and amazing ending like in all his other books. When I finished it last night, I was sorely dissapointed. Well, I guess all books can't be as good as others."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Darn floor. Big bite. So the apes can talk. But who among us would ever pick up Crichton's books to use them for research? This book provides exactly what one would expect: an entertaining, fast-paced story that is based on what is perhaps an outlandish theory. But isn't that what Crichton does best? If you like his other novels, you'll probably like this one."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This is again Michael Crichton at his best. I think he did a wonderful job at portraying two different peoples lives at one time. It shows where technology has gone and will still go. It also shows how far humans have come and may still go in communicating with another species. A definite page turner. It's one of those books you like so much you don't want it to end but you still want to find out what happens at the end of the book. I definitely recommend this book to just about everybody."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"The book was pretty good but it felt a little too clumpy, more like a screenplay than a book. I liked Eaters of the Dead better. There was so much fact proofs that this book took me about a week to read when I read Eaters of the Dead in one day. I did liked Amy and how she and her trainer communicated with the grey gorillas so they would not get pummeled to death by their heavy hands holding some heavy paddles."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"this was the first michael crichton book i had ever read, and i really enjoyed it. the language crichton used made the story believable and exciting. there is a bit of lull in the middle section, but the story is worth it. i also recommend reading Sphere"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"When I began the book, it started off with a great opening and I was excited. But after the beginning, the book slowed down, and had a few bright sopts for about 200 pages. It picked up near the end and the suspense began building and i read the remanider in an hour or so, but when I got to the last page, I was pretty dissapointed, hence my 3 star rating. Another thing I dissliked was a lot of scientific junk that made the book boring, then again if you read it in 1980 when it was first published, it might have been more fascinating. So it had bright spots, but for the most part it was slow-moving."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I loved Congo. The characters where cool. The plot could have been better. I thought the gorrilas using paddles to kill people was pretty fakey and there where a few minor flaws in reserch. Other than that I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. If you liked Jurassic Park, buy Congo."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Who in the world but Michael Crichton would write a book about talking gorillas, with 65 references in the back for further reading? \\"Congo\\" is a lightning-fast-paced techno-adventure story about an expedition to the lost city of Zinj, deep in the darkest heart of Africa. Two rival teams are racing to be first on the site, where lies a fabulous treasure of boron diamonds that are going to change the world as we know it. One team is made up of a greedy conglomerate (Germans and Japanese, wouldn't you know); the other is headed by a brilliant but cold-blooded young scientist named Karen Ross who is accompanied by an eccentric adventurer, a primatologist named Peter Elliot, and Peter's laboratory subject, a mountain gorilla named Amy. Amy has been the cause of concern among animal rights activists who feel she is being mistreated (actually, many humans don't have it as good as Amy), so Peter wants to get her out of the country and back to her natural habitat. The race to get to the diamonds first involves encounters with rampaging hippos, a murderous tribe of cannibals, and sneaky doings by the rival team who briefly drug and kidnap Amy. But what they find once they reach the site is not only diamonds, but something so unimagined and terrifying that it doesn't even have a name. Suffice to say, it's able to create all kinds of mayhem before the book reaches its climax.Like all his other books, \\"Congo\\" suffers from one-dimensional characters, and Crichton has an infuriating habit of referring to females in their twenties as \\"girls\\" (would he call a 24 year old male a \\"boy\\"?). But in Amy, Crichton has come up with a winner. Amy is more of a personality than any human in the book. She's bright (she has a vocabulary of 600 signs and can say whatever she wants to), she's funny, she's very much a lady (she loves lipstick and she's choosy about the colors of the sweaters she wears); she has a temperamental side (she sulks and pouts when things don't go her way), she loves Peter and she's insanely jealous of his lady friends. The action and adventure zip right along, but Amy is what makes this book such a fun read."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Like \\"Jurassic Park\\", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters.My reasons for such an accusation:1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling.2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.)3. The book's ending is utterly terrible.4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Congo","review":".....have time to write a review. hehe"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I was searching for a &quot;light&quot; but entertaining book to read, and somehow, I decided to pick Congo. Bad mistake. The introduction was promising, I thought it would have some &quot;realism&quot;, as the author made me believe (he even included more than two pages of references, such as Scientific American and...(yes) Rolling Stone). Big lie. The math is shameful, clearly Crichton has no idea what he's talking about (just as the &quot;chaos&quot; theory in Jurassic Park), and other details of the book reveal his careless &quot;research&quot; (like the emeralds in Bolivia!). But these are just irrelevant details if you are looking for a novel, of course. What was really bothering was Crichton hypocrisy: in the introduction he wrote about the misconceptions about Zaire (Congo) and Africa and its people, but before the page 50 he made all the misconceptions at least twice. That's shameful, really."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Crushed skulls and bodies lay everywhere in the destroyed expedition camp. A grainy shape is seen on tape and it resembles a gray gorilla but gorillas aren't gray. What could have caused this carnage thought ERTs employee Karen Ross. The secret may lie in a gorilla with a 620 sign vocabulary. All the action can be found in Michael Crightons Congo.With the first expedition team dead they plan to send out a new team in less than three days. Karen Ross the captain of the team is determined to get success on this mission. With Peter Elliot and gorilla Amy they must take more supplies. As they get deeper into the Congo Amy starts acting differently. She runs off and returns late at night.What is going on and why are the gorillas attacking? How did those gray gorillas come anyway? So many questions and all will be answered in Michael Crightons Congo."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"As of this review I've read several of Michael Crichton's works, and I would have to say that Congo is not one of his best. However, weaker for Crichton is better than most and it's still a very entertaining read. Since Congo was written in 1980 it doesn't represent the mature author that we see in his latter works: Sphere, Jurassic Park, Disclosure, and Timeline. This book seems to have a slower pace, and never really hooked me like the others. I didn't have the urge to stay up until 2am to finish this book like I did with Disclosure.What I love about Crichton is the variety of places, and experiences he brings to each novel. This time you will be going on a trip deep into the jungles of the Congo where many expeditions have gone but none have comeback. This is a typical Crichton page turner, and is thoroughly enjoyable however I felt it lacked the normal ending momentum that I've come to expect from this fine author. He diverts the reader's attention a few times in the last 20 pages that get in the way of the story, and slows the momentum. Maybe it's just me, but at the end of the book I want to know what is going to happen to the main characters, and I'm not that interested in diversions into Senate Subcommittee meetings, and an academic theory on earthquakes. Even though the information was useful the timing was not.On another note, the computer technology in this book is very outdated. But this actually enhances the book in my eyes, and made it more enjoyable. It's a cool reminder of how far we've come technologically, and actually serves as a time capsule. I have a cheap flash card that has 4 times the memory of the highly advanced computers in this book!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"From almost the very begining you know the main characters are going to survive. You keeping reading things like \\"Ross later stated that...\\" and \\"When asked about it later, Elliot said...\\" so you know they live to tell about it. Where's the suspense in that? Half of the story was technical stuff or historical stuff, which was only slightly relevant to the story. And you didn't really get into any action until the last quarter of the book (the rest talks about the journey there, which is only mildly suspenseful). And even then the action doesn't last for more than maybe 1 page. The gorillas attack a couple of times, the volcano errupts and some natives attack.One thing I did like was the parts with the signing gorilla."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This book rocked!!! I can't say how much I loved it!!! It just beat out Jurassic Park as Crichton's best. It was also a million times better than the movie. Nail biting suspense and great action. I thought The Terminal Man [was bad]!!! and same with The Lost World ( no offense). Best book ever.Travis Robinson..."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I thought that the book Congo by Micheal Crichton was reaally good.It was adout that this boss sends a group of people into theregion of the Congo.He sends a person named Karen Ross to find one of the people who went to the Congo and got lost.Also to find a diamond what the other had to bring back.Also a person named Peter Elliot goes with his Gorrilla named Amy who knows sign language and with some other people.When they get there they find a lost city where these gorrillas live.Karen Ross thinks that the gorrillas might have killed one of the people who worked with her.The people then go back to lost city were they find a room filled with diamonds.Then the gorrillas show up and now they have to find a way.I thought that Congo was a very interesting book.There were no boring parts in the book.I would recommand this book to teens up to adult."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"From the first few pages to the (next to the) last pages, this book is one of few books which genuinely held my interest the entire time. I love the way that the book is divided into chapters by the days that they spent there. Amy (the gorilla) made it even more of a wonderful book, throwing in occasional humorous remarks. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"If you are going to read a Michael Crichton book for te first time,don't read this. It might leave a bad immpression. Nothing against this book, I mean,it was well written and all, but it certainly isn't his absolute best. Although it is rather close. It is very well-written and all, but anyone who says it's his best...I don't think so. But it still has avery good plot. It is VERY suspenseful. If you liked the movie,you'll like it in a book form MUCH better. But still, if you're looking for a good Michael Crichton first,don't read this. Read Airframe, or Jurassic Park,or Sphere. But do yourself a favor and don't read this. It's defenintly noy his best. But it's still pretty good. It's good to read AFTER Jurassic Park.

That was the good part. The next few hundred pages is like an instruction book on how to travel to the Congo. The last 20 pages were good, though. So, If you like to be bored, or if you are just wanting to know how to travel to the Congo, pick up this book. Otherwise, leave it right where you found it."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I've read a few novels by Michael Crichton, and CONGO is easily the weakest of the bunch. The plot of this book isn't particularly interesting (killer Gorillas in the African rainforest?) and the characters are bland and one-dimensional. The only truly likable protagonist is Amy, the gorilla that can do sign-language. It's a bad sign when the only character you care for in a novel is non-human.As with any Crichton book, there's a lot of interesting factual information contained in CONGO. But Chrichton makes little effort to integrate this data into the story. Instead, he does an information dump every 10-15 pages or so, which stops the story dead in its tracks. It also doesn't help that most of the technology in this book is dramatically dated (no big surprise, since it was written in 1980). The result is a slow-paced, largely uninvolving reading experience.In short, I didn't feel much excitement or suspense reading CONGO. My advice is to skip this novel, and try Crichton's far superior later work, like SPHERE. You might also want to consider the work of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, who write similar types of thillers."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"A Review by BrendanMichael Crichton has done it again, he wrote a bestselling book once more. If you liked Jurassic park 1+2 you'll love Congo.in the depths of the jungle in Africa, people have been mysteriously killed by some unknown animal. When one scientist discovers and ape is having bad and unnormal dreams he decides to find out what they are. This book is full of adventure and excitement. If you want to know the rest pick up a copy at your local library.There are so many things Michael Crichton did perfect in this book, but there were a few he could of left out. About 1/3 of the story talks about things we didn't know existed, like all that scientific junk. Do we really care about that? We want the blood and gore{well a lot of us do}.What he did do well on is the detail and explaining the confusing points. This was a good book and very interesting.I would recommend this book to readers that like blood and gore. I would also recommend this book to people that like science and mathematics. This book is very good and there are always part that include all readers."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Whereas the book and the movie is similar they are not alike at all. The book is sooooooo much better."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I don't see zero in the rating chart"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"THIS is an author who writes &quot;literature&quot; according to Amazon's pre-publicity for Crichton's Timeline. Ha!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I was finishing Congo the day before the movie came out in 1995 I was thrilled. The book was so compelling, taut and one of those stereotypically good Chrichton novels. That's what I love about his work. His characters are not usually that well fleshed out but the business of his storyline and plot typically fascinates me.So, I took the next day off and treated myself to one of the worst movies I have ever seen... The movie adaptation of this great book."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Having previously read all of Michael Crichton's published fiction as well as some of his non-fiction, I approached this novel with some disdain, knowing it would be the last Crichton book I would read until he puts a new one out. However, the high quality helped erase these feelings somewhat. This is one of Crichton's better books. The suspense is absolutely non-stop; I was glued to my proverbial chair. I lost count of how many times I said, \\"I'm just gonna read one more page...\\" and then ended up reading for another hour. It's that hard to put down, and it's hard not to be thinking about the book and its characters whenever you're not reading. As with most Crichton works, the plot relies heavily on technology and technical discussions, and since it was published twenty years ago, it is a little outdated in some respects (256K memory modules!). On the other hand, I learned a LOT about gorillas and the Congo and other things. The weird thing is, I've seen this bashed a lot of places, even by fans. I don't understand this. This is not Crichton's best but still has all the elements that make classic Crichton (suspense, technical babble, realistic plot), so I don't see how anyone could fail to like it if they like other Crichton books. If you are a fan, I suggest you pick this up."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I actually wondered whether this was the same writer who gave us the fantastic Sphere and Jurassic Park. Congo is really something better left to airport bookstores. The basic story is that a group of scientists complete with an intelligent ape which can sign, travels to the Congo to investigate odd goings-on. At least, that's what we're lead to believe.Instead, the plot meanders around, often going into completely irrelevent sections on computer programming and terrorist activity which has nothing whatsoever to do with the story. The gorilla, Amy, is actually quite annoying rather than cute and the whole idea is a bit unlikely. Finally we meet the nemesis of the Congo - and then everything falls flat. It's not particularly scary and to be honest, it's difficult to care about the characters. The movie didn't do much for this book, granted, but to be honest, it couldn't have made it worse."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Judith Ivy is the worst actress that ever was, and her only contribution to any form of culture is to single-handedly close down any TV show or play she's ever been in, so low sales of the taped version of COngo is guaranteed. Buy this tape if you want to suffer through hours of an affected Southern drawl that makes this Southerner flinch- her only talent is making one vowel into an entire sentence. Read the book or get something who can talk to read it for you."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"As I was reading this ludicrous book, I actually burst out laughing at the description of the hybrid apes bashing people's heads using the implements as described in the book. Images of the 3 Stooges actually crept into my head. One of Crichton's worst; in fact, one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. I kept finding elements that were later to appear in Jurassic Park (the book), so it's almost like he was practicing in this one. The movie was a complete turkey; the best part is listening to Tim Curry's accent changing throughout the movie. Tim can do much better; he must have needed the money to agree to appear in that piece of garbage.....I think the fact that you can now purchase this book for $.01 speaks more about how awful it really is then anything else I can add."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Michael Crichton mixes fact with fiction to produce another great book. In this book an eight-person exploration team is brutally murdered. A second team is sent to investigate, including a primatologist and Amy, a gorilla who understands sign language. They discover the diamonds they are looking for, and slowly discover the reason the other team died so violently.A definite page-turner, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"The character and plot development are reasonable, but Crichton is unable to pull it all together in the end. The idea that they actually found what they were looking for, but suddenly it was beyond human reach forever? Come on! There are 5 mile deep gold mines in South Africa. How is 700 feet of basalt and ash going to stop progress? By the way, the rift volcanics are the wrong kind for diamonds - they are more likely to destroy the diamonds with their high heat flow than create them. The book, for all its references, is loaded with technical flaws, not the least of which is the description of the solar flare, where the view of it somehow miraculously precedes its effects. Got news for you Michael - ALL light travels at the same speed.With all the amazingly coincidences, (700 year old lost city discovered, then lost forever immediately, solar flare of the century, volcanic eruption of the century, revolution, and new specie of gorilla) one would think some effort might be made to tie all these events together. But these events are merely waded through by the protagonists without any analysis via their 256K computer.I'm amazed Tarzan or Godzilla didn't show up.Anyway, good action in the middle. Disappointed in the end."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This is actually my favorite fiction title, and to be fair, I read it before computers really took off so the technical details interested me quite a bit and didn't seem contrasting to current technology. Anyway, I loved this book, with it's intriguing plotline that really keeps you guessing until the very end. Heck, if you figured out the whole story without finishing the book, bravo to you because you must be really damned sharp.It might be a little difficult to understand some of the passages especially when Crichton decides to truncate all the words in the satallite transmissions for the sake of what would now be &quot;bandwidth&quot;, but with a little thinking it can be accomplished.Overall it's still one sweet book and definitely worth a read. I found this much more riveting than Jurassic Park or The Lost World."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"First off, If your looking for brainless blood thirsty gorillas rent the 1995 film version, if your looking action, technical details, with mostly cardboard characters keep reading.Review:I have to say I have mixed feelings about this novel. Some parts were fantastically exciting while many other parts went into dull technical descriptions of early 80s communications technology. With painstakingly intricate detail Crichton elaborated on how basic text messages were sent back in the day. This can be a double edge sword, I think people who enjoy reading technical details about the past may find this stimulating but for me these parts of the novel read like a dated computer science text book.Crichton also packed the novel full of exciting information on gorillas and other primates. I knew primates were intelligent, but I suppose I was ignorant on how intelligent they are. Then again Crichton blended fact with fiction so well I wasn't sure if he was presenting truthful facts or pulling them straight out of his a-- eh, Harvard educated mind. Either way it grabbed my attention and held it.(**Minor Spoilers below**)There was a great build up to get to the mysterious gorillas foreshadowed in the beginning of the novel but I felt a bit cheated with the Gray Gorillas in the novel's climax. I didn't feel like there was enough carnage or information about them. It seemed like every night in The Lost City of Zinj the gorillas repetitively and expectedly attacked the camp. It got old fast and felt contrived.(major SPOILERS below)This might sound terrible but I really wanted Karen Ross to die. I felt she deserved to die. She had been cold and callous the whole novel and I felt no emotional attachment to her. When Crichton isn't busy describing her as a frigid b*tch he officially tells us about a computer report that describes her as intellectually arrogant, domineering, insensitive, among other atrocities of human character. I thought Crichton was preparing to kill her off in the novel's finale when she naively arms a mine with explosives beneath a stirring volcano. She insists this won't activate the volcano, and the other characters warn her not to but then Amy the talking Gorilla conveniently scapegoats the situation by blowing up the volcano herself (with Ross egging her on). This is when I expect her to get skull crushed or sprayed with lava, but no she manages to wipe out the entire species of Gray Gorilla, destroy the Lost City of Zinj (along with the diamonds) and then lives happily ever after by changing jobs and getting married. WTF.I liked Elliot Ross but I felt bad for him by the end of the novel. It was mentioned in the beginning of the novel his professional reputation was on the line because he was falsely accused of abusing Amy. Later when he discovered the Gray Gorilla, or Gorilla Elliotensis, I thought he was going to redeem himself through his new discovery but no Karen Ross blows them all to smithereens. Furthermore its revealed that his life project, The Make Amy Learn Sign Language Program, or whatever it was called is disbanded and Amy is freed to the jungle. In the fine print on the page its revealed that Amy has a new born, but when Elliot gets closer she zip lines into the woods with her baby. Yeah, nice to see you too Amy. I guess some would argue thats gorilla behavior, but Elliot basically raised Amy as his child and I felt he deserved a better ending.There was also tons of disposable characters that tagged along basically waiting to be killed. In my copy of the novel on pg.257 Mulewe and Akari are found dead in the morning. After reading this I promptly thought, WHO? Oh yeah.. those foreign guys..."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo is a middle-of-the-road Crichton novel in my opinion which is still pretty good as far as fiction goes. This time, he takes us to Africa to investigate what could be a dangerous primitive species captured on video. It has some creepy moments that are memorable and is a bit closer to horror than some of the other Crichton books I've read, but I didn't enjoy this one as much. I have forgotten a lot of it by now and that is never a good sign if you read a novel and forget it. Still, I read constantly and it has been a while since I read this. I remember enjoying it though and I want to read all of Crichton's work eventually so this was one step further on that fictionally educational path."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"a god awful boring book TMI best describes this book for me got a history lesson on every aspect of this book . not nearly scary enough to even get my BP up read more than 3 qtrs of book for one semi chilling chapter a HUGE YAWN very very boring"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I was suprised in Michael Crichton that he would actually write something so crumby. A five year old could understand the plot of this story with killer gorillas. Plus this story had no character development at all. I mean the characters weren't changed after what had happened to them in the jungle. I also think the ending was very cheesey how they walked away with out a scratch. Well, besides the guys that did die in the city of Zinj. The people that made it out were all losers. Those people were the ones I thought would have died in Zinj. Over all this book was pretty bad for being written by such a great author."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"It appears youngsters love this book. I bought the paperback for a flight thinking it was a recent Crichton release I somehow missed. Within a few pages it became clear from the out-of-date technology that it was written years before - and the copyright date confirms it. Within a very few more pages it became clear why it had not been previously released, and should have stayed that way. But just like the ape in the story, money talks. A triumph of profit over art."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This book was probably the best Michael Crichton book I have ever read. I wonder if the other apes besides Amy actually existed in real life. I had no clue that technology like voice recognition existed in the 80's. You would have to be an idiot to risk blowing yourself up just to get some diamonds. The silverback gorillas were a lot like the dog in The Mask in the way that they can use tools. I doubt that a satellite could send out jamming signals all the way from space to sea level. The death count of 7 people was especially high for a Michael Crichton book. I think that it's impossible that a person could do fractions when they were only 2 years old. My favorite character was Amy because she had more common sense than some of the other characters. I want to see the movie, even though everyone tells me it isn't very good. I think that this should be a required book instead the boring ones that the school picks out."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This book had a lot of compelling action. It was sometimes interupted by alot of unrelated topics that were just there to show that michael knew what he was talking about. It was still a good book that held my interest untill the end. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys the thrill of a jungle adventure."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I couldn't even get half way through it. Bland characters, unrealistic plot. With too much dated, unnecessary and boring information. The gorilla, Amy, was not even realistic. He made her out to be more intelligent and more capable at signing than happens in reality. I am supposed to believe that the first time Amy was shown a watermelon she signed \\"water fruit\\" combining the two signs all on her own? Really?What is this, written for third graders?Also, the reality is modern weapons could easily wipe out any apes alive, killer or not. Ludicrous plot. I have concluded this author is a bit overhyped and overrated."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"The search for a special kind of diamond in the Congo uncovers a lost civilization overlorded by murderous Great White Apes with nearly humanlike intelligence. Crichton's mishmash of high adventure, industrial intrigue, and terrifying threat is entertaining, but in the end disposable - the events seeming to have little effect on the characters. Not highly recommended."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"'Thrilling, Fascinating, Dazzling'. These are three words that the book does not even come close to. This book will put you to sleep. With a middle section all research and getting ready for a trip, the book was more effective than Valium. I like the movie better than the novel. Needs a lot more action in the movie than the book. If you watch the movie and then read you would expect a lot more from it. To sum it up I hated this book. Was no action in the story. For example, if this had been a real life situation the gorillas would have attacked the archeologists and scientists. They would have danger at every corner. A lion would,come at them or some other terrifying beast. I would also expect them battling tribes. They did not even accomplish getting the jewels, which is what they set out to do in the first place. I thought that scientists would stop at nothing to get what they wanted. For example, when they had the jewels in their possession, the volcanic eruption frightened them so much that they fled from the area, without taking the jewels with them. The whole book, they did nothing, but argue with each other. The only good part of the book is when they get on a boat and the water gets rough giving the crew a wild ride for their lives. I couldn't understand why they did not get the jewels. Maybe because they weren't well organized or its because maybe they weren't prepared the possibility of not finding the jewels. Most of the time the people in the book fought over the jewels but ended up not taking them when they finally left the Congo. If they were well prepared for what lie ahead for them, I think they would have met more problems head on and would have made their journey a lot more successful. I imagined the gorillas playing a much bigger part than what they did. I expected a lot more with the gorillas that they would try to kill the other characters and for the characters to try to escape life and death situations. That would make the book a lot more exciting and enjoyable to read. The gorilla Amy who was supposed to be so smart with all her signs was the most pathetic character I have ever read about. The whole time she was worried about Peter not liking her and how she was &quot;good gorilla&quot;. When she came back at the end, however, with her baby, she ran from him like a complete stranger. The man who had raised her and taught her the human language was treated as if she had never seen him before in her life. I know that any #1 best selling author could perform much higher than this lame novel. From the name Congo and all the quotes on the front cover I was expecting a gut-wrenching thriller. Somebody wrote that Crichton was the Doctor of suspense, but all he could do is cure insomnia. This book did not reach my literary expectations because if the lack of detail when the gorillas killed the tribes of people. I expected a lot more on-the-edge-of-your-seat action, however, that was not what happened. Instead the book did the exact opposite which was put me too sleep. If I ever had to read this book again, I would need two copies, one for me and one for the guy holding the gun to my head.Stafford High School Student, Grade 12"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Unfortunately, as it usually happens, someone took a good book and butchered it to make a movie. The attempted to make it more pleasing to a wider audience, and in turn changed one of the major characters in the book, but changing her from the driven corporate ladder climber (book version), to a former CIA agent. The CIA agent thing, got really annoying really fast in the movie. They should have left her alone, it was much more believable.Anyway, back to the book. The book follows a team of explorers looking for blue Herkimer (sp) diamonds needed for their companies communications systems. They inadvertently discover a lost city that has been reclaimed by the jungle, before being brutally killed. The company sends a second team in to find out what happened to the first team, and to secure the diamonds.The team ultimately discovers that the cities former inhabitants used trained gorillas to protect the diamond mines from theft.

A few months later, he wrote me a reply and said that the only real advanced tech he knew of was Japanese A.I. software for mountain-climbing. Once in a while, I like to re-read it.

I recomend This book for anyone who likes action and who especially likes gorrilas!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo is definetly one of Michael Crichtons best novels. I liked the book because the plot moves swiftly and the characters are developed well. A great deal of emotions and personalities are expressed in this novel. Some of the emotions are greed and fear. I also enjoyed Congo because the characters discussed technology extinsivly along with the logic and philosiphy of the other characters actions.The best part of this novel occured right before the climax. Karen Ross, a main character and the leader of the expidition they were on, was starting to put the puzzle together of where the diamonds that she sought were, and what hazards guarded them. Meanwhile Colonel Monroe, the expiditions guide, was trying to defend against future problems and keep Karen Ross out of trouble. When they found the carcuss fo a dead ape tha was previously uknown to man the pace of the book started to speed up and the bloody climax started.This novel also has a large collection of story elements. One of the many elements was the books theme. The theme went along with the thought that greed won't always cause weath but will often cause disaster. An example of this is when Karen Ross tries to blow up and abandound diamond mine to get to the diamonds. The result is that she dosen't get any diamonds and the unstable volcanic Mt. Mukenou explodes. Another aspect was the setting. The setting was in the remote and mostly unexplored by civalized man Congo rainforest.

The book gets you involved with more of the characters and such. I'd recommend this book to those Michael Crichton fans who haven't read it because its a good book but not the best, its still worth reading though so read it."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Did you know that there is a facutal basis for the talking Gorilla in this story? Michael Crichton repeatedly puts the 'sci' in sci-fi. In &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, he clearly described genetic research and genetic engineering, and in &quot;Congo&quot;, he gives us some pretty realistic descriptions of linguistic research with primates, satellites and imaging technology, and the dangers of central Africa.The book is SO much better than the movie. Why? First, the book is actually faster paced. In addition, the descriptions of how things work adds a depth to the book that just can't exist on screen. Finally, watching the movie has led me to the conclusion that the character descriptions in the book are indispensable. Crichton's narrative style is so polished and fluid, and is really what makes this book worth reading.If you've never seen the movie--good! Read the book. If you have seen the movie, my condolences. But still--read the book."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"In the heart of the African jungle, near the ruins of the lost city of Zinj, an ERTS research team disappears, leaving only broken images of a strange gorilla like creature behind. Through their technology, Earth Resources Technology Services clears the satellite picture to reveal a strange, gorilla-like beast destroying the camp site and the members of the team.In San Fransico, Peter Elliot is training his highly intelligent gorilla named Amy. Amy has a vocabulary of 620 signs, and has begun to finger paint images that look like the legendary Zinj. A back-up team is sent in to finish the job of the murdered researchers. Led by Karen Ross, the team brings Amy along to provide the team with a slight edge on their Euro-Japanese competitors. The ERTS team calculates to the minute the correct jouney that will enable them to beat out their competitors. Finding the diamonds could mean billions of dollars in profit, and the discovery of the ruins of Zinj would be the greatest archiological find in history. But entering the deep jungle could mean death.In a race through the African jungles for the rare diamonds, the team ends up with more than they bargained for. They slowly begin to realize what might have happened to the previous team. They encounter more attacks and struggle for their own lives.Although the story is full of technological terminology, it is actually not very hard to follow at all. And if one can look past the &quot;advanced&quot; technology of the 1980s, he/she will find this book highly intense and compelling. This thriller is hard to put down, and, as expected, does a much better job than the movie."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo was one of the first Michael Crichton books I read. I remember thinking - Killer monkeys are cool. Congo was much more than cool killer monkeys though.

Congo is a highly entertaining read bursting with the authentic science Crichton was always known for."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This novel is set deep into the contintent of Africa, in many different areas. There are many different characters in this novel. The most important character i have focused on is a zoologist named Peter Elliot. He lives in California and is head of a study called Project Amy. Project Amy is a study devoted to a single female gorilla named (ironically) Amy. Amy is a gorilla who is learning sign language. Her vocabulary is over 600 words. After about 4 years of being studied, Amy starts having dreams. She refers to them as her &quot;sleep box&quot;. She was using the word &quot;box&quot;, referring to the television. She started to have bad dreams and Peter could not get through to her. Finally he decided to let her try finger painting. She responded to that idea immediatly, and started to draw pictures of the jungle. She referred to her pictures as &quot;old houses&quot; and &quot;bad houses&quot;. Another character in the story is Karen Ross, a young and beautiful scientist. A research team from Karen's company stationed in the Congo was killed. The video footage sent back revealed what looked like to be a gorilla attack. Karen calls for Elliot, and together, with Amy, they go to the Congo to find out not only what killed the researchers, but to bring Amy home. In the Congo, they face many problems such as killer hippoes, a new species of violent gorilla, and a huge erupting volcano. The final chapter is amazing, you'll have to read it for yourself. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes adventure novels, and to animal lovers.

The similarities to what was described in Crichton's book are notable.Cite is from BBC Science News 12 Oct 2004 (based on an article in New Scientist):\\"Primatologist Shelly Williams is thought to be the only scientist to have seen the apes.During her visit to DR Congo two years ago, she says she captured them on video and located their nests.She describes her encounter with them: \\"Four suddenly came rushing out of the bush towards me,\\" she told New Scientist.\\"If this had been a bluff charge, they would have been screaming to intimidate us. These guys were quiet. And they were huge. They were coming in for the kill.

The locals say they are very deadly, hunt cooperatively and silently, and will kill lions.That doesn't mean they talk -- just thought Crichton's research abilities should be commemorated with some clips from this discovery."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"As with all of Michael Crichton's famous books, Congo is an epic science fiction novel that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The suspense and adventure are exhilarating as you read each page all the way to the end. This novel ranks at the top with such Crichton favorites as Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, and Airframe. Truly a masterpiece of writing as we dive into a lost city to find diamonds only to discover that there is horrifying events taking place there. An expedition is sent to find out what happened to a previous team only to find troubles of their own. A gorilla named Amy is connected as she draws pictures of the very lost city that houses precious diamonds but a brutal secret.The novel begins with the brutal killing of a team that was sent by a corporation to find diamonds in a lost city in the African rain forest of Congo. This team had discovered this lost city of Zinj and had also discovered a rare group of grey haired gorillas that were responsible for the murders of the team. Karen Ross is charged with finding out the truth of the expedition, by launching her own. While finding out the truth, she is also to bring back these valuable diamond deposits for further use by Earth Resource Technology Services Inc. She employs a mercenary to lead the team to the lost city including Amy, a trained gorilla who has been painting pictures of the long lost city of Zinj. There is competition for these diamonds from rivaling countries so time is of the essence, but the team encounters problems along the way including plane crashes, civil wars, and dangerous creatures of the jungle.Ross's team does finally reach the lost city and finds the previous camp in ruins. The team loses contact with base camp back in Houston and an attack ensues on the team by these massive grey gorillas. The battle ends and a few of the gorillas are killed and examined as they do not look like real gorillas. They are of a gorilla-human hybrid as they resemble a human in size and shape. Even more peculiar, the gorillas are much more aggressive than their counterparts and are partially nocturnal as they attacked the team at night. The team decides to learn more about these gorillas and find that they were bread to protect the ruins by the ancient inhabitants of Zinj. They were to protect the diamonds of which Karen Ross is so desperate to attain.With the help of Amy, Ross is able to decipher what the grey haired gorillas are trying to communicate. Messages revealed that the inhabitants did not want the team there and that they should move away from the lost city. Suddenly, the gorillas leave the city and diamonds. An eruption of a nearby volcano suddenly puts the team on alert as the explosives placed by Ross seemed to accelerate the explosion. Now, the team fights for their lives to get out of the lost city. They manage to find a hot air balloon and escape. Amy was able to be put back in the wild and the mercenary that lead the expedition, Munro, was able to confiscate some of these diamonds and later re-sell them to a company for use in revolutionary new computer software.So often with Crichton's books he brings a thrilling and fascinating view in to the world of science fiction. Each page was entertainment and suspense and it didn't stop until the end. The book seemed real as Crichton infused originality, technology, history, and drama in the book. This novel is sure to keep you engaged as you can't put it down. It grabs you from the first page until the last."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I saw the movie CONGO and thought it was horrible, but since the source books are usually better than the movies made from them, and I have also read and enjoyed several Michael Crichton books, I bought CONGO. What a waste of money and time. I finished it but only to see how bad it was going to get. In that, I was not disappointed. The ending was absurd, as was everything that came before it.The idea that these diamond hunters could lug so much equipment, even with a small host of African porters, for so many days through the jungle is only eclipsed in stupidity by their choice, and apparent foreknowledge, of the equipment.I mean, what diamond hunter traveling to a dead and abandoned city in the middle of the jungle would not think to bring an electrified portable fence AND tripod mounted machine-guns that tracked laser pointers? Half a dozen rifles would have worked just as well and weighed a lot less. And how many generators and batteries did these guys carry to supply all that electricity?My advice is skip the book and the movie. Both are terrible."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This book is very good and very graphic. I liked it though. When I heard the movie was bad I decided not to watch it (even though I have had several chances.) :]"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"While Amy doesn't wear a backpack that converts her sign language into words in this book...wait...this novel doesn't treat people like they are idiots. It is truly a great read. Do yourself a favor and skim the 70s science explanations and instead marvel at this oustanding story."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"My favorite part was discovering the massive primeval forest thru Michael Crichton's Congo. He wonderfully weaves the classic story of greed and corruption for riches that have and still do draw the powers of the world to risk all for treasure always at the expense of and the changing of lives and souls."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I have read 2 of Michael Crichton's novels, &quot;Congo&quot; and &quot;Sphere&quot;.Michael Critchton is a wonderful author. It is obvious that he has a brilliant and creative mind. He has a strong grasp of scientific fact and potential which he uses to devise incredibly intricate tales that keep you reading.However, he doesn't seem to know how to end a book to save his life. In &quot;Congo&quot;, he lays out a key premise that is captivating and thought-provoking. It exists thematically throughout subplots and exposition and character development so imagine my dismay when this fundamental premise is disposed of in a single paragraph through a convenient twist of fate.When I came to that paragraph, I literally threw the book across the room and yelled in absolute disgust. I am convinced Mr. Critchton must have just received an advance from his publisher for a new book or got bored. Given his talent and skill, I can think of no other reason for this book's pathetically unsatisfying ending nor for the &quot;You've got to be kidding!&quot; ending of &quot;Sphere&quot;."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I like monkeys just as much as the next guy but I was disappointed with the number of pages it took to get to the good part. Usually Crichton writes a great first chapter then he goes into explanation then the last 50 pages are awesome. In ''Congo\\" only the middle was almost no explanation it was just boring.On the positive side monkeys are cool.On the negative side it was kind of boring."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"If you think that when you read this book you will know something about Congo you are wrong, this book explains electronics, volcanoes, weather, etc, about Congo you will read about 20 pages, the descriptions of all the procedures are really boring and if you are not on that field you will not understand, maybe it was a real story, may be not, I really think not."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I have never read a Michael Crichton book before now. Congo is the first. I give it 2 stars...for story, as it was highly entertaining, enough so that I read all 310 pages in a day, something I don't normally do.But with this book it was easy. The story IS indeed interesting...a slaughtered Congo expedition team, a fragmented surveilance video giving enough evidence to suspect animal involvement, and a replacement team being sent in to gather facts, and complete the mission of the original team, along with an ASL speaking gorilla, Amy.The book takes many twists along the way, as the American team races against the 'Consortium' team, a German-Japanese spoiler troop coveting the same prize as the Americans. But the consortium is a 'phantom menace' in this novel, as the only threat is the one that we read about, they never actually 'appear' in the novel.Where the book fails is this: The characters are very two, if not one dimensional...save for Peter Elliot, the gorilla's trainer...and the gorilla, Amy. They provide not only comic relief, but a brief glimpse that the others in this novel are supposed to be actual humans. Karen Ross, the hot-headed, brilliant research team leader, Munro, the quasi-mercenary jungle guide, and the rest of the troop never, ever flesh out as characters, making them forgettable, and unsympathetic when danger hits the group...and the endless stream of facts and figures, that really have no bearing on the plot, which Crichton feels compelled to lace every chapter with. They neither drive the story along, nor illuminate anything about the characters really, and are merely filler. I found myself recognizing them early on, like a mention of the largest solar flare of 1979 in conjuction with a solar incident making a satellite connection impossible, and ultimately began to skip over entire paragraphs, or even pages of the book. It's not that I don't enjoy learning, but this is a thriller novel, not a textbook. Perhaps Crichton should write in both genres, as he apparently has enough subject matter in his mind for both.Again, this is an entertaining read, if not an indepth one. But having seen other translations of Crichton novels onto the big screen, I find that I am FAR more entertained by his work in that medium, rather than the written word."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I seem to be in the minority in not liking this book at all, I was highly impressed by the likes of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, but this book seems to have all the same pitfalls of those with non of the pluses. The technological detail was highly boring (as with JP), I do love imaginative technology in sci-fi, like 2001 for instance, but that is seemlessly coupled with a thrilling story, this is like a textbook in places. As with all Michael Chriton books I have read, the characterisation is weak to non-existant, and unfortunately the storyline isn't elaborated enough to make it interesting. The huge potential of these apes, a relic of a brutal past civilisation is squandered in favour of a cheap horror thrill. I would not recommend this book"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I agree with the reviewer from New York. I can't claim I noticed any of these glaring errors myself, or would understand them if I did, but apparently they are there so I'll say my bit and leave. All these errors would be at least partially pardoned if this was a good novel. It's not. Somehow I managed to get through it, but it's not good. It's terrible. Too long. Awful. DULL. So there's TWO reasons not to read it. Why bother when there's so many better Crichton thrillers on the market? Go read &quot;Airframe&quot; or &quot;The Lost World&quot;!"},{"Title":"Congo","review":"An expedition in the Congo has disappeared and the disappearance appears to be associated with the attack of an unknown species of primates. A new expedition is sent to uncover the mystery. With this new expedition is a female gorilla who has been trained in sign language and can communicate with her trainers. In their search, the scientists find a famous lost and protected city. The science and technology described in the book is not difficult to understand or comprehend. Unfortunately, communication research with primates has not progressed as much as Dr. Crighton and primatologists would have liked since the publication of this book. Perhaps the next decade will prove to be more fruitful."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Congo was the first Michael Crichton novel I read, and I just could never get into it. So since it was Crichton's first that I had read, I read it again. No good. The book is way too informational. Crichton should have focused more on the gorillas and the jungle. None of the characters were interesting, so I really didn't feel anything when they died. Too bad after all the good Crichton's this really could have been something."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"The reason that this is a terrible book is that the first part is excellent but the end is lame. I was very much into the characters and the plot, but in the end the entire climax was analogous to &quot;And then the hero woke up.&quot;Please don't waste you time on this book."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I have read all of Michael's books, and I was embarassed for him on this one.

It is the best book that Michael Crichton ever wrote that is why I gave this book five stars. It is about a team of people who go looking for a giant ape like creature who lives deep in the jungles of Africa. The book has chills and thrills about their adventures in the Jungle of Africa.It is very sad in some parts where the team gets eaten by the ape. The book has a very good and strong plot with a very descriptive setting in the jungle.If you like action adventure and suspense books with a little blood and gore in it then this is the book for you. I recommended this book because it is full of suspense and I really like action, adventure and/or suspense books and movies."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Dr. Crichton is very good at making his works of fiction seem real. His characters, especially those of Congo, are fully developed. Amy was a very interesting character. Go out and read this book, and avoid the movie at all costs."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"I found the 70's technology, which the author wrote about with such awe, a little confusing considering I'm 16 and wouldn't have even heard of much that was mentioned, but the science was pretty accurate and well described. The characterization was a little thin, but I've come to expect that from Crichton, and his stunning use of science and theory makes up for it. The Gorilla who speaks sign language was very intriguing and you always wish to know more about just how it thinks. A good book."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"After reading Jurassic Park &amp; loving it, I decided to read another Crichtion book. Congo starts off slow, but later on picks up and becomes quite interesting. My problem with the book is Crichtion uses too much scientific mumbo jumbo, that might start to bore some people. It sure did me."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Deep in the heart of the darkest region of the Congo rainforest, near the legendary ruins of the lost city of Zinj. An eight person field expedition dies mysteriously in a brutaully matter of minutes."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"Before, I always thought if there is a book and a movie of the same story, why read the book? Watch the movie, save more time, no brain power needed and you don't have to worry about falling asleep and losing your page. I have always thought that way, and I was never into books that much. But after reading the Congo novel, I think differently now. In the book, there are so many more expressions and emotions that actors never achieve. Writing is so much more descriptive, even better than a real picture. At first I watched the movie a few years back, and just a few months ago I read the book. I always reccommend the book over the movie now. If you're really into technical stuff and adventure, then this is a book I gurantee you'll enjoy. I admit at first the story was kind of slow, but when the adventure begins the jungles of Congo, you will feel like you're actually inside the book with the other characters. If you have watched the movie already, don't despair because the ending is not like the movie's. Also there are the little details to it that make it rise above the movie. It is always easier to write about something than to act it out. If you like having a picture inside your mind all the time, I would strongly reccommend this book. Now of course this book has its faults or else I wouldn't give this book only four stars! The only complaint I have about Congo is that the beginning of the book was sort of boring, too much planning for the quest was involved. If Michael Crichton would have included the essentials, then the book would have been a five star book. Having said that, you decide whether you would enjoy this book or not. I reccommend this book if you haven't seen the movie yet. Read the book first. And for those of you who have already seen the movie, try comparing the differences of the book and the movie. You decide which one made you sit at the edge of your seat more. Try to find the paperback cover of Congo, mysterious and at the same time compiling."},{"Title":"Congo","review":"This book is good for a person who does't like to read like me.

It works best as a historical record of the traditions, techniques, and lore of Inuit and Cree peoples that enable them to live simply and comfortably in harsh climes. To that end, it is a reverent and important book. The book's weakness is the implicit message that the cold-dwelling hand crafters of wooden snowshoes are morally superior to the poor urban dweller trying to live a balanced life by juggling work and children with occasional forays into the woods or up the mountains, on aluminum Sherpas, clothed in fleece and Gortex. The Conovers, who live in a walled tent in Maine and are respected wilderness guides, seem not to understand that their chosen lifestyle is possible only because most choose not to live it. For readers who are truly considering a move to or extended travel in far northern territories, &quot;A Snowwalker's Companion&quot; is unique and indispensible. Most winter adventurers, though, must satisfy their love of the outdoors with day mountain hikes or backpacks of several days duration. For them, a book such as &quot;Winterwise, A Backpacker's Guide,&quot; by John M.

Being an advanced computer user, at first I was dubious how much I would actually learn from the class. This book pleasantly surprised me. It goes through the basics of Windows XP Pro, MS Word, Excel, Access, and PowerPoint 2003. The book itself is well laid out, with plenty of screenshots to supplement text instructions. It also gives plenty of projects at the end of each chapter to test out your new skills.The introduction to Windows is designed for someone who has never touched a computer before, but the sections on MS Office have proven useful. I just finished the section on Word, and a lot of the stuff in there I knew already, but there were some features and shortcuts that I had not previously known about. The layout of each chapter makes it easy to scan what each section covers, so skipping content that you already know is effortless.My only complaint is that the book is very Microsoft-centric. When talking about web browsers it does not mention Firefox or any alternative browsers, and when talking about media players it only focuses on Windows Media Player. I suppose that's good for the novice computer user, as having too many choices of software can be confusing when one doesn't even know how to use a computer. However, once a user becomes comfortable with a certain piece of software, s/he is unlikely to switch to a different one. In future editions I would at least like to see an appendix included that explains popular alternatives to software such as Internet Explorer (Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc.) and Windows Media Player (Winamp, JetAudio, etc.).To sum up: great book, easy to read, contains lots of useful information.

Carol Shields has a way of making honouring everyday rituals, conversations and events and presenting them to the reader in a way that makes us savour her characters and stories. Like all Shields' novels, poems and plays, the irresitable Small Cermeonies, leads to contstant searching for more Carol Shields works. To publishers - devout readers want out of print works reprinted!"},{"Title":"Small Ceremonies","review":"This book was an interesting look at how someone goes about discovering who they are later in life. A biographer who can only look at other people's lives through items or other people's writings. Her complaint of not having the chance to actually ever have met her latest subject makes for a nice ending when she lets another writer know what she does about his facade.Carol Shields writing is always clear, concise and tells a touching story. If you haven't read Small Ceremonies or Stone Diaries, you are missing some of the best fiction writing I have experienced in a while."},{"Title":"Small Ceremonies","review":"Having not read any of Shield's more acclaimed works, maybe I shouldn't have started with her first novel. While I can appreciate how well and acurately she portrays day to day life, human nature, and the observational lifestyle of writers, in the end I can't help but be wishing that more had HAPPENED in this novel. In the first half of the book nothing seems to happen at all, and then all the events set up in the second half seem to have no resolution of any kind. I understand that real life is also without specific beginnings and endings, but I can't help but wish for a little structure in fiction. However, it is is saved somewhat by the fact that it's beautifully written. I'd be willing to try her other books."},{"Title":"Small Ceremonies","review":"Carol Shields' won the Pulitzer Prize for \\"The Stone Diaries\\" in 1995. \\"Small Ceremonies\\" was her first novel, written in 1977. This novel and the next are each about one of the two sisters born to a working class Toronto family. The writing is gorgeously poetic, teeming with arresting, but completely accessible, similes and metaphors. Her sensitvity to nuances of character and relationship is both accurate and moving. Most of us never heard of her until \\"The Stone Diaries\\" -- but we should have!"},{"Title":"Small Ceremonies","review":"I ordered this book after seeing the reviews but, not having read any of the authors previous books. I found it dry, not at all engaging and almost silly in content. As someone else mentioned...maybe I should have started with her first novel and moved forward. I was so bored that I found myself dwelling on the four grammatical errors I came across. Happy it was less than $5, including shipping!"},{"Title":"Small Ceremonies","review":"Pulitzer Prize winning Carol Shields presents a most haunting personal reality in \\"Small Ceremonies.\\"Her protagonist's train-of-consciousness reflections about her experiences are written in the first person and present tense, and bring this amusing character into sharp focus as she copes with her eccentric husband, her family and her career.The result is a thought provoking read to which all of us can relate, for these 'small ceremonies' enter into our lives too, and all of us have our own way to consider them.It is the unusual way that daily life is presented, and the clever commentary upon it, that is so delightful in Small Ceremonies, and makes it such a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Small Ceremonies","review":"I have not yet read anything by Carol Shields that I have not liked, so this book was no exception in that regard. As always, her characters are flawed, and likeable more because of that than anything else. Judith Gill, the main character in this book finds herself looking at her life in an almost bewildered way. She knows she should be happy, but wonders if she truly is. Shields has injected the novel with her usual dose of satire on academia, but one of the most wonderful things is how she pokes fun at herself here. One of the characters, a successful fiction writer keeps a terrible secret - I don't want to give anything away here, let me leave it at: Carol Shields was born in the US!"},{"Title":"Small Ceremonies","review":"Carol Shields welcomes us in her first novel to the Ontario home of Judith Gill, and the table is set for a wonderful read. Shields's prose is tight and flows on humor, descriptive genius and observations that qualify as wisdom for any age. Lots goes on in this somewhat messy, subversive house: biographer and frustrated novelist Judith spins a tale of rude surprises, unexpected joys and everyday living over a 12 month period, laced with the anxious stuff of families. Husband Martin,academic and expert on \\"Paradise Lost\\"; teenage daughter Meredith, like her mother a \\"repository of innocence and knowledge\\"; and son Richard, 12 and \\"sour with love.\\" The Gills in Shields's hands are enough to keep the novel charged, but visitors add to the flow: fellow-authors, academics, best friends, family and in-laws. Judith considers herself a prying spy; she ferrets for nuggets of enlightenment from those around her,and the results are wry and wise comments on life's long list of ironies. Shield's narrative entertains and delights with the ease of a life-long runner out for a jog; she lets her characters get lost in living, to enjoy the hilly and strenuous course. At the end of Small Ceremonies, after being enchanted by a maturing Judith and her eye for people and her faith in them, I knew more about life than when I began. Shields is an accessible author, somewhat quirky and without airs, a Canadian who keeps pace with Margaret Atwood and Alice Munro by being this person you'd really would have liked to have met."},{"Title":"Clarissa Strachan's Young Event Horse: Buying, Breaking, Training, Competing","review":"With good humor, Strachan takes the reader through the selection, backing and early flatwork with a young event prospect. She then covers her method of introducing fences and XC obstacles. The book also covers basic fitness work and preparing a youngster for its first competition. A nice book, written with evident care for the development of young horses."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"I am not too familiar with CAmeron's writing but she is obviously successful in her own right. I bought it as an aspiring writer and had to make myself finish it. Thought it was trite and slow and after finishing and working at it I got some stuff out of it but boy does it require work."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"Julia Cameron is a fine writer and has been a valuable inspiration to many writers of all ages and degrees of development. Her famous book 'THE ARTIST'S WAY' has been absorbed in classrooms of literature and in lonely dens of minds bumping on writer's block. She has always afforded straightforward, tutorial advice that defined the path the young artist should follow to realize success.It is therefore with some concern that LETTERS TO A YOUNG ARTIST: BUILDING A LIFE IN ART seems less supportive and more self-indulgently punitive than one would expect from this author. Perhaps it is the manner in which the book is formatTed. Cameron states in the beginning of this slim book that she has condensed (?homogenized) emails from her readers and students and has placed them in the form of responses to queries, each addressing \\"X\\" as the writer. There is some humor here and some instruction, but the lines of response to questions about state of mind, about philosophy, and need for nuRturing tend to veer more toward the caustic end of the spectrum.In other words this book seems out of sync with Cameron's previous writings and for those who are looking for more solid pointers or tactics to approach - whether literarily or spiritually - then returning to the author's other books is recommended. Grady Harp, April 05"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"Having had the pleasure of meeting and taking creativity classes with Ms. Cameron, I have been thrilled with how vividly and honestly this book conveys her loving, disciplined, no-nonsense demeanor. Her advice is focused and while it does go over ground she has covered previously, this book comes at the landscape from a new and refreshing angle. Again, Julia points the way for an artist to be both productive and sane, living a full and meaningful life. I am glad I bought my own copy since I found myself flagging page after page of her kind wisdom."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"This little book is wonderful. It's tone isn't especially coddling (though if you are familiar with the Author's work, that should be no surprise), though it is plenty gentle, and actually quite replete with encouragement. It is the perfect summarization of what Cameron has presented us with over the years, and an excellent reminder that our climb up one hill inevitably brings us to the foot of another, that the reward for living our truth is indeed in the journey itself. A fantastic treat."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"The last time I cried when I turned the final page of a book was Natalie Goldberg's \\"Writing Down the Bones.\\" Julia Cameron's \\"Letters to a Young Artist\\" is quite different than Goldberg's work.... But the emotion was the same. \\"I was having so much fun \`being with you', Julia - please don't stop now!\\"I am a long-term fan of Julia Cameron. The first time I read \\"The Artist's Way\\" it was because so many of my coaching clients were fans. The one thing about that book that bothered me was what I perceived as Cameron's whiny voice. I have really enjoyed watching her evolve through her follow-up books - and her tone shifting along the way.In \\"Letters\\" her ton shifts from the beginning of the letters to \\"X\\" as she goes along. I liken her tone to Simon Cowell of American Idol... because she tells the truth without any sugar coating... so it might make some readers angry.My recommendation is to look underneath those first appearances of temperament - and read the incredible truths which pour out of these pages - nearly every page of my copy is underlined and dog eared.Listen: \\"Making art takes guts. Choosing to be vulnerable and exposed rather that safely blocked is a risky venture. The ultimate reward, however, is truly great art.\\" (p. 9)\\"Cultivate an attitude of expectancy, for it's expectancy that keeps us alert and optimisti. Attention and optimism are necessary to the long haul.\\" (pg. 61).\\"Art is a spiritual calling, and like any vocation it is subject to the dark night of the soul.\\" P. 94\\"There is one trick to setting goals, I think. And that is to always leave enough breathing room for the divine to enter.\\" (p. 138)Now you can see why I cried. This book is absolutely incredible and has been my almost constant companion, always open, since I read it the first time. It is literally packed with thoughts to prompt both my writing and my creative process.This is a book which would make Rainer Rilke proud - I get the feeling he would suggest we live the questions this book evokes - not judge the book on its tone, instead allow the truths within to take us on a journey through our days."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"First, let me say that I'm a huge Julia Cameron fan. I ordered this book as soon as I saw it here. However, I was very disappointed. Julia takes on the persona of an aging old man who's writing letters to a very stereotypical, hip, cynical young artist. Unfortunately, Julia does not channel gruff old men well. It's very disconcerting to have her \\"voice\\" switch back and forth between a very forced \\"gruff old man\\" tone, and then have the real Julia accidentally seep out with gushing over flowers, colors, baking, and following one's heart. I wish she'd have just written with her own warm, encouraging \\"Julia\\" voice...the one all her fans love and enjoy. In trying to sound like a hardened old writer, she comes across as very unsympathetic, sarcastic, and demeaning. Not what we usually expect when seeking advice from Julia. (And the advice offered was a watered down version of what you can get in much better form from \\"Artist's Way\\" or \\"Right to Write\\"). Borrow this from the library if you want to read it...it's not one you'll mark up or want to read again and again like some of her others."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"Cameron opens up her private letters to aspiring artists using her experience, wit, humor, and extensive wisdom gained from the many dues paid in her life. This is a nuts and bolts reply coming from a Hollywood insider whose been in the trenches and experienced the best and worst of the professional artist lifestyle. Cameron gives the harsh reality and breaks apart the myth of a lyrical existence. Art and commerce are a strange and deadly brew in L.A. - and Cameron gives her raw honest look at the life art can and can't offer."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"This writer (I'd never even heard of her) belittles and demoralizes her imaginary correspondant to the point that any useful or inspiring energy is lost (if it's there at all, it's hard to tell). I pray no actual student of writing or art ever has this woman as a teacher. Cameron is interested in Cameron, asserting her aggressive will, shoving her hideous personality down the reader's throat. She sounds like one of these barking dogs from a cable news debate."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"The advice in this book is stellar. If you are a real artist, you will recognize your own voice, doubts and desires."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"another distillation of the salient points of julia cameron's The Artist's Way, this is a good book for anyone who's not going to read any of the others. a primer of sorts, this rilke rip off is inspirational in it's \\"teachy\\" way...julia is still julia, and the poetry and accidental wisdom of the rilke \\"letters to a young poet\\" is far superior. still, they are two different things, books, texts and neither benefits from any confusing comparison.cameron continues, predictably, to hold up the morning pages, artist's date and weekly walk as tenants of her faith. she continues to offer insight from her personal and professional experience. there is not much that is new here--but there is plenty of support in this book for her original teaching, which continues to be supportive of artists of all kinds in a kinds in her companionable way.she supposes an actual correspondence with a penitent male artist--handling in her letters to him the issues of relationships vs. art, sex vs. art, talking about art vs. art, high art vs. making art, addiction vs. art, sobriety vs. art, slow and steady vs. indulgent moods and art making, etc. in her answers, which are all we, as readers, are privy too, she encapsulates the artist's way with a practiced expertise.as i read all things cameron, i felt a bit of a let down for the lack of new revelations. i was annoyed with the whiny artist correspondent, and found him predictably arrogant, angry, indulgent and useless. i wished she had supposed a woman art maker--or a colleague or peer. but that is where the new possibilities lie, i suppose.while tempted by the brilliance of rilke's original text, cameron strives to re-iterate her how-to knowledge in a form that disappoints. it seems a rote response to the questions one knows she's been asked a million times. it seems a surface diagnosis. it seems a skimming of the cliches of artmaking.still, i love her. i read her every word. i collect each new encapsulation of the franchise and recommend her heartily."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Artist: Building a Life in Art","review":"I can hardly see the author (or her letter-writing character), perched on so high a post, talking down to the lowly young artist. \\"Letters to a Young Artist\\" may serve well to discourage if not batter the fledgling artist before he or she has even had a chance to find their own voice and style. Those less fledgling may simply toss it with some degree of disgust at the arrogance and cliche treatment of the artistic process. It's not so much that there isn't the occasional grain of truth in the advice given, as that the occasional grain is lost in its tone and cavalier treatment.This collection of letters is too obviously constructed for a book and is not an authentic exchange with an authentic questioner. Indeed, author Julia Cameron makes it clear these letters are a hodge podge of those she says she receives from fans, a conglomerate of questions and wonderings, seeking guidance and inspiration.\\"Dear X\\" is the salutation heading up this collection of fabricated letters. That alone rather puts one off as lacking in authenticity (or semblence of), abundant only in added chill. How much better to give a letter writer a name, a voice, a persona that would come alive for the book reader. More often than not, the letters begin with a weakly disguised \\"you write that...\\" as segue for the missing letter in the exchange. It would have been far more fascinating to have been able to read both sides to this conversation.Cameron's style (she takes on the voice of an elderly male writer, which in itself lacks authenticity and leaves me wondering - why?) is brash and bullying. Her advice, what there is of it, is so obvious that it offers little value. Mostly, it reads like one long brag perhaps constructed only of hot air (only the dissatisfied are bullies?). Here and there, inexplicably interspersed with literary advice, is advice for the lovelorn. Again, why?This effort pales in comparison to similar efforts to offer beginning writers a hand up, done brilliantly, and I suggest those searching for such will find much more satisfaction, advice, and encouragement in Annie Dillard's \\"The Writing Life,\\" Rainer Marie Rilke's \\"Letters to a Young Poet,\\" Joyce Carol Oates' \\"The Faith of a Writer,\\" Anne Lamott's \\"Bird by Bird,\\" Stephen King's \\"On Writing,\\" or a long list of others."},{"Title":"Dictionary of word origins (Littlefield, Adams quality paperbacks)","review":"This is quite an interesting book! There will probably never be another book like this! Fun because of the adventurous stories behind the words. Funny because the cross-referencing is... well, unusual. For example, you'll look up 'centigrade' and it will tell you to look under 'congress'! Other examples include: 'glass' =&gt; 'electricity'; 'pectoral' =&gt; 'parrot'; 'scratch' =&gt; 'knick-knack'; 'town' =&gt; 'villain'; and my favorite 'ventriloquism' =&gt; 'necromancy'! But that's just the beginning! There are even more... And then we have the Appendices. Appendix I is &quot;Doublets&quot; which are &quot;words that have arrived in our language by different routes from the same source.&quot; This list is very useful especially for English students. Next we have Appendix II: Words From Names. These are common, every-day words that originate from proper nouns. For example: Did you know that the word 'coach' (as in a carriage pulled by a team of horses) comes from the Hungarian town Kocs where they were first used? Or did you know that 'dollar' comes from Joachimsthal, Germany where silver was mined? Or did you know that the yellow-colored shrub known as 'forsythia' was named for British royal gardener William Forsyth (1737-1804) who brought them home from a trip to China? And many other fascinating origins! This brings us to the last part of the book Appendix III: Given Names, Their Sources and Meanings. Any lover of words will love this section. Appendix III gives us the origins of nearly 1000 given names. For example: Did you know that the name Ichabod means &quot;God hath departed&quot; in Hebrew? Or that Jennifer is Gaelic for &quot;white wave&quot;? Or that Xerxes is Persian for &quot;lion king&quot;?

Pablo is the supervillian Yucky Man, who slimes everything in sight, while Tyrone is Dr. Shrinky, who shrinks objects and foes. These \\"supervillians\\" want to capture the Key to the World that is hidden in the Tower of Power.But not so fast! Two superheroes are there to stop them!

The direct-to-DVD release BIONICLE: Mask of Light is set between issues #14 and #15.That said, I must say BIONICLE is one of the most unique comic series I have ever seen. The original premise was intriuging, a fantasy epic set on a tropical island inhabited by a race of warriors who honored powerful \\"Kanohi\\" masks as sacred and who fought against an evil spirit referred to simply as \\"the Makuta\\". The amount of care put into the series was apparent, as LEGO even used real ancient island peoples' terms for their incredibly complex mythology.After the franchise became a booming success, LEGO decided to give it another year. In the six-part \\"Bohrok Saga\\", the Toa- heroes who the islanders, who became known as \\"Matoran\\" after Lego got into legal trouble for the original term- fight a species of Alien-meets-Borgs in a series which was entertaining, but no where near as blow-you-away as the original storyline.That was when the series bombed. TOA NUVA?! BOHROK-KAL?! WTF! If you do decide to purchase this graphic novel, I advise you to rip these pages out and burn them. You won't have to undergo the excruciating pain of reading them.Fortunately, the ongoing comic series redeemed itself with its conclusive issues, which tie in and out and of the movie, Mask of Light. The final line sets the stage for BIONICLE's recent Metru Nui: City of Legends series, and the BIONICLE 2 film."},{"Title":"Goddesses Calendar: 2001","review":"Inspired artwork, as many of us have come to expect from Susan--deliciously rich imagery with enough leeway for the viewer to make the image their own."},{"Title":"Finding Answers in U.S. Census Records","review":"Utterly basic, nothing a high school student couldn't figure out from looking at the documents."},{"Title":"Finding Answers in U.S. Census Records","review":"This book explains about reading and comprehending the information that is in the census records.

How anyone can slight the conclusions of informed students like the writer after reading the same exact history of the shunning of hobbyists for the \\"learned professors\\" only approach detailed here is nuts. It is readily apparent that cultures in contact with one another exchanged ideas on everything which is why these \\"keys\\" or translation guides exist in the first place that have allowed us to reconstruct dead languages and writing systems. To say such ingenious systems were only logograms or only syllabic or pictograms seems quite ridiculous given the vast array of cultural similarities in archaeology. This book is awesome. I am using it to further my understanding of ancient mythology and thought it would be dull and centered largely on language itself but to the contrary it gives an excellent historical perspective that has allowed me to confirm L.A. Waddell's findings on the connection between Thor, Induru and the Turans which he states directly without providing a reference to what he was looking at or how he drew that conclusion!Hittite \\"Tarhun\\" for instance as their \\"storm god\\" is identical to Turan, Duran, Induru, Tor, Thor (Sumerian Dur-An) \\"heavenly god\\" giving you perspective on the Trojans as Hittites which when coupled with the Linear B translation chart on pg. 118 then compared with the Hittite cuneiform block back on pg 91 shows you that Hittite logogrammic cuneiform is actually rudimentary Minoan Linear B, the Linear B being a hieratic (in cursive) form of Hittite. Now I got that from reading this book and never would have made this connection without Mr. Robinson's easy-to-understand explanations. Sure enough a quick internet search just now on this shows that current scholastic study on the subject is proving my \\"leaping\\" judgment true. These leaps of inspiration are why we are able to figure out dead languages and ancient history in the first place. This book is a fantastic primer for beginners."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"This book gives the basic history of the dicyphering of a number of ancient scripts. It has some nice photos and illustrations. It is not a dictionary or an encyclopedia by any means. It covered the mainstream ancient scripts such as Cuneform and Egyptian, but barely touched on the more ancient,esoteric and mysterious scripts such as ,Neolithic pictographic, Sumerian pictographic, ancient Greek linear A, and the Indus valley scripts. I would have enjoyed it more if it push the envelope a little more."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"An excellent introduction for people looking for a good overview of writing systems. The content is succinct and the large number of illustrations and pictures make it easy to understand and grasp the concepts."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"If nothing else mattered, the lush photography of this book would bring it to the forefront of efforts to describe the history of written communications. Unfortunately, while it is extremely well written by an informed author, it has more in common with a text book than a real history. I cannot argue with most of the facts in the book, but I could argue with some of the conclusions. When authors, no matter how talented, no matter how well-informed, speak ex cathedra (my spelling here may well indicate the part of alphabetic writing which is decidedly not phonetic, in English, at least), especially when relentlessly advocating a particular point of view in a controversy, generally I am inclined to ignore them. A glance through the bibliography, though, shows that Robinson is quite willing to give a casual reader enough sources to spend many hours learning what is known of the history of scripts, and writing.All in all, I would say this book is an excellent way to spark an interest in the subject."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"As other reviewers have indicated, this book is beautifully illustrated, and it presents a great overview of the world's earliest writing systems and our attempts to understand them. If that is your interest, I cannot recommend a better introductory book.On the other hand, if you wish to understand the relationship of writing to language, you may be led astray by the author's neglect of linguistic fundamentals.The introduction of pictograms and proto-writing is useful. It tells most of what is theorized about the evolution of early language-based writing systems. However, the discussion of rebuses and logographs simply distracts the reader by mixing apples and oranges, namely language-based writing systems versus symbols and puzzles.The author states that &quot;English, French or German could be written in almost any script,&quot; but this obscures the fact that these languages adapted their common root -- the Roman alphabet -- differently to better support each language's unique phonetic structure. Similarly, how (or why) did our English orthography became fixed to now-extinct pronunciations? This you will not learn. Modern English is simply &quot;less phonetic&quot; than Finnish.Of course, European writing is less novel than Japanese, Hangul or Cherokee, so the bulk of the discussion of modern writing systems focuses on the exotics. Unfortunately this is the subject area where the author is most dependent on the opinions of biased experts. For example, he bases much of his analysis of Japanese writing on J. Marshall Unger's attack on Japan's long-defunct 5th Generation computing debacle. The author relates the difficulty of the Japanese writing system to high suicide rates among juveniles during 1955-58, and tosses out unsupported gems like &quot;It looks likely that the need for computerization must one day lead to the abandonment of kanji in electronic data processing, if not in other areas of Japanese life.&quot;Again, the Western bias of the author (even selecting a Japanese movie poster about &quot;Crint Eastwood&quot; to illustrate a point!) enables him to make a very dubious claim: that even among readers of Japanese and Chinese, written symbols lack semantic content unless the reader can read the word out loud.This argument is critical to his thesis that writing systems connect exclusively to the phonetic components of language, not to syntactic or semantic components. Ideographs persist merely to help the hapless speakers of Asian languages sort out their homphones. The thesis is wrong, and the supporting argument is severely ethnocentric.In short, this is a great introductory history, but a lightweight analysis of writing as a linguistic phenomenon. Because of the book's focus on the history of writing, its historical merits outweigh its intellectual deficits; but please don't start an argument with a linguist or a native speaker of a non-European language based on what you've read in this book."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"A richly illustrated nontechnical introduction to the history of writing. The author briefly touches upon the relationship between language and script and the challenges involved in the classification of writing systems but the bulk of the book is on presenting different families of scripts and accounts of thier development. The sections on extinct writing, such as cuneiform, and on undeciphered scripts were interesting but the book's chief attribute are the illustrations of alphabets, inscriptions, and glyphs, many of which are interpreted for the reader. A similar volume for the more linguistically inclined is &quot;A History of Writing&quot; by Steven Robert Fischer. The author, himself not without contraversy, provides the technical precision that is lacking in Robinson's book and has lots of examples of scripts as well."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"I notice as I write these words that I am taking part in a rather recent venture - the passage and preservation of information through symbols. Naturally, these were originally pictures and over time these evolved into the various scripts we now call alphabets.This is a good overview of the various worldwide systems used today and in the past. He explains that ALL scripts are a mixture of phonetic and semantic signs - it's only the degree that differs. There is a historical review of hieroglyphs and the origins of writing, then a discussion of the evolution of writing and finally a look at the present and the future where, surprisingly, semantic notation is making a comeback. The book is lavishly ilustrated with charts, photographs and maps."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"I have always been fascinated with writing systems. This led me to learn to read 8 different languages before I realized it was the writing that interested me much more than the laguages themselves. That is why I am split in my perception of this book. It does an outstanding job of introducing many concepts in a good manner and provides wonderful examples but it is very shallow. That means, I suppose, that it is likely to appeal to more people who want just an \\"executive summary\\" instead of being faced with the prospect of actually learning the scripts. In providing the introduction, this book does a magnificent job and whets the appitite for more."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"My major reading interest these days concerns ancient history (co-incidentally) recorded in writing at the time. This era starts then with Sumeria and leads chronologically, but not directly, from there. Sumeria, Babylon, Egypt, Mayas, Incas, Indus, and so on are all included. Excluded, to some extent (because they're better known) are Greece and Rome.I have read books by David Rohl, Graham Hancock, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert Bauval, Michael Coe, Philip Graham, Alan Alford, D.S.Allan, Christopher Dunn, Mark Lehner, Von Daniken, Adrian Gilbert. Some of these my be considered by &quot;fringe&quot; authors (don't forget Velikovsky!), Others are very definitely &quot;establishment&quot;. I do not (necessarily ) agree with their conclusions and extract only their facts!But ... &quot;The Story of Writing&quot;, WOW, what a book! It ties in so absolutely perfectly with where my interests lie! I thought that it would but be a child's story of writing (it was bought sight unseen). Far from it. It is an excellent thorough primer for a serious student. The book leads in with an extensive examination of what writing must do; i.e. transfer spoken word and ideas to another person. The writing is but the medium. The explanations throughout are clear and easily understood. Small translation exercises are sneaked in at odd places to keep the reader's involvement.Developments of the different writing schemes are outlined (there is not space for much more!) Their interrelation, or lack thereof, is illustrated. Egyptian hieroglyphics are meticulously explained. The Japanese written language is analysed; how difficult it must be to have to know three levels of writing in order to fully understand! The Mayan calendar wheels and picto- to syllabic translations and meaning are well illustrated and explained. Development of the writing schemes and alphabets into their use for different languages are shown. Counting methods and schemes in cuneiform for different product or produce show complications inherent in proto-systems including a lack of a zero!Lots and lots of fascinating detail! Stories of intrepid adventurers (Rawlinson) and scholars (Champollion and Ventris) who risked life, limb and/or reputation to discover and reveal the transliterations and meanings of hitherto unknown scripts. Chance finds and collaboration; scholars building on scholars' discoveries. Missing links found. &quot;Insufficient data&quot; for Phaistos and Indus and others; no Inca writing, destroyed libraries (Mayan and Alexandrian).Occasional breakthroughs in the development of writing occur where dictatorial or imperial decree forces a change for simplification. Sadly, from a pure ease of learning and use, alphabets (or, more correctly, writing systems) suffer from traditional conservative (or religious)interests. How easy would it not be to be able to read Japanese or Chinese or Arabic or Russian in Roman letters! ... and what a loss to the beauty of the languages! Writing is primarily a method of communication, not illustration. However (and the author barely touches on the subject) the use of the many and various fonts would put some of the art back into writing.The illustrations are, of course, superb. One lack of the book (very tongue in cheek this!) is a full set (semi-matt 8 x 10 colour) of the key points or styles of writing (Rosetta, Behistun) and those beautiful samples of calligraphy illustrating cuneiform, hieroglyphics, Narmer (both sides), Phaistos (both sides),Mayan calender, and so on (available on special mail order!). All with complete transliterations and translations, of course.The only omission I could find in the discussion on Sumerian cuneiform was an explanation of the &quot;syllabification&quot; (my word) the authors such as Rohl and Sitchin use for god-names such as EN.LIL etc.The author has missed out on one very important use of pictograms. In our South African industrial society with 40% illiteracy and 11 official languages, pictograms are essential!Overall, a marvellous read and a valuable reference for my research!"},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"This book, as someone else has said, is strong on graphics and history, weak on linguistics and the relationship between writing and language.I was astounded by the page on Sign Languages and the claim that&quot;...they are *not* independent of speech; every successful system, such as American Sign Language ... is based on a spoken language. (Thus an ASL user cannot communicate with a Chinese Sign Language user.)&quot;No &quot;thus&quot; about it, they are different languages, and an ASL user cannot communicate with a *British* SL user either, but *can* communicate quite well with a French SL user. The speech-based sign languages, such as Signed English, are cumbersome hearing-invented codes that SL users hate. This page makes no mention of fingerspelling nor the notation of SLs, where SL and writing DO meet, nor indeed any mention of SL users, Deaf people.It is top-heavy with the decypherment of ancient scripts, and - even allowing for the avoidance of ethnocentrism - very weak on our own Roman alphabet. If, for example, there is anything about cursive script, italics, serifs or non-Chinese typewriters, I missed it.If you're interested in any of its strong topics, it's quite good (assuming the SL page is an isolated lapse), but as a comprehensive survey of how we store our utterences, it's a bit of a grab bag."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"How did writing evolve? How do we decipher the extinct languages? What are the connections between sound, symbol and script? If these questions interest you, you will love this book.In a fascinating and delightful narrative, Andrew Robinson discusses the major writing systems in the world from the ancient hieroglyphs to the current alphabet based scripts. Over 355 illustrations bring to life the different writing formats and the accompanying explanations make the book a joy to read. Robinson's coverage of the history of decipherment of the extinct languages brings a distinct thrill to the subject.The book is organized into three parts (1) How writing works - starting with Rosetta stone discovery and its decipherment and ending with how proto writing and clay tablets developed (2) Extinct writing - starting with the Cuneiform in Mesopotamia, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Greek Linear B, Mayan Glyphs and ending with the Undeciphered scripts such as Indus script and Linear A (3) Living Writing - starting with the first alphabet, old Greek, Latin, Arabic and Indian scripts and ending with the Chinese and Japanese writing.Egyptian Hieroglyphs is so elegantly explained that I could actually write my name in Hieroglyphs by the time I went through it. Other highlights are the writing of runes, cherokee alphabet, reading the bones and impact of the latest discoveries on our knowledge of the history of writing."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"This book is a marvel. It should be read in conjunction with Sampson's 'Writing Systems'. Sampson's book is a bit heavier on the linguistics of writing systems, whereas Robinson's book is stronger on historic details. Unlike Sampson's, the Robinson book is also a lovely production that does NOT necessarily have to be read in a mostly linear way. It has the many 'hypertext' details--photos, illustrations, timelines, etc--that make (by way of comparison) Crystal's 'Encyclopedia of English' and 'Encyclopedia of Language' so wonderful to navigate through in various ways.If you read Sampson's book along with Robinson's book, at least two things will most likely happen: (1) you will know more about writing systems as linguistic and cultural phenomena than most of the population and (2) you may well know more about writing systems than most professional linguists do.This also is another one of those accessible titles (like Sampson, like much of what Crystal writes and edits) that will go a long way to help produce more enlightened language awareness in education. I highly recommend it to teachers of language or literacy since it can only add to their professional knowledge."},{"Title":"The Story of Writing (Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & Pictograms)","review":"This book is very usefull for my porposes, easy to reed a very good pictures and graphics for consulting,The format it is just for me and there are notes and information of great value, for instance I live in Chile and Easter Island is a chilean territory, I have the plasure to find here a reference with picture about the similarity of some caracters on the Rongo Rongo writed tablets, yet not interpreted, to some ones in Mohenjo Dharo in Pakistan.For me a text about history of writing must be esencially on pictures or images.So easy to get through evolution and roots of writing in history.Great value.Eduardo."},{"Title":"The Desperate Game (Guinevere Jones, Book 1)","review":"The four books in Jayne Ann Krentz's Guinevere Jones series (written under her Jayne Castle pseudonym) are some of her hardest to find titles. The first is The Desperate Game.\\"If you like Moonlighting... If Remington Steele turns you on...\\" That's part of the presentation of this series, and it does have a bit of that feel to it. A really fun book, vintage JAK.Guinevere Jones, owner of small temp agency Camelot Services is not amused when she's approached by fellow small-businessowner Zacariah Justis. Zac has just opened his security consulting agency, and he's investigating some disappearing shipments for computer company StarrTech. Gwen had done a bit of temping there herself a few months earlier, and Zac blackmails her into going back and being her inside \\"man\\", using the knowledge that while working at StarrTech, she'd done some massaging of the companies benefits program and taken it for some $2,000.As Zac and Guinevere work together to find out what's going on (or rather, Zac works both at finding out and at trying to keep Gwen from doing some investigating of her own into the fate of one of the programmers, who seems to have disappeared), they realize they may have more in common that they thought at first.Oh, this was great! I was a bit leery when I started it because I've been burnt by some old JAKs, but Zac is fortunately not one of the old horrible alphas she sometimes wrote in the 80s. He's an alpha, yes, but he's an ok guy. I think he actually reminded me of of the hero from Smoke in Mirrors, Thomas, a guy who knows he's not very exciting or sophisticated, with a solemn, serious manner and a sense of humour that takes a bit of getting used to.And Guinevere is cool, too. I liked how she's this sensible, proactive small businesswoman, who's more than a match for Zac. I was, however, a bit bothered by her gothic heroine tendencies. Like the gothic heroines of old, she's fond of getting herself into dangerous situations for no reason, even when Zac, who really is the expert in the investigative area, has told her to stay put. And her explorations tend to backfire and not help, but hinder the investigation. Still, she didn't irritate me enough to be a real bother.The romance was great, but you really should start reading this knowing that what you'll get here is just the beginning of a relationship. If I had no way of getting the other books, it would have pissed me off, but since I've got all of them and I *know* that the romance will continue there, it didn't bother me at all. Anyway, it's quite a nice beginning. JAK gets the chemistry right, and I liked how being with Gwen assuages Zac's loneliness and sense of being disconnected from the world.I also very much enjoyed the humour. There are plenty of running jokes throughout the book, like about different management styles, and about Guinevere constantly cadging free lunches from Zac, and Zac being a \\"frog\\", and that kind of thing, and I thought JAK had the perfect touch with it. None of the jokes got old, and they remained funny until the end.I was really intrigued by the glimpse into the world of computer games in the 80s. This is important: you have to know when you start reading this that it was written in 1986, so it's best to approach it as a kind of period piece, and not expect it to be completely contemporary. I had lots of fun with this. I'm sure for the people who read it at the time this would have felt impossibly cutting edge and modern, but well, what I imagined when I pictured the Elf Hunt game were the graphics from the games I was playing... well, not at the time, because 20 years ago my country, Uruguay, was at least 10 years behind the US in that area, so in 1986 all I was doing with my Spectrum computer was playing with Logo and loading a really basic Scrabble game through my cassette player, but maybe 10 years later? Stuff like Laura Bow or the early King's Quests? And that would be more quaint than cutting edge right now, of course!Anyway, that was a fun element, as was the the whole role of the game, Elf Hunt, in the suspense subplot. Not particularly believable, but fun.I can't wait to read the rest of the series, to see what it's like. The next three books are:The Chilling DeceptionThe Sinister TouchThe Fatal Fortune"},{"Title":"The Desperate Game (Guinevere Jones, Book 1)","review":"This is the first book in the Jayne Castle(Jayne Ann Krentz) Guinevere Jones series. Gwen Jones owns a temporary employment agency. Zac Justis run Free Enterprise Security Inc. He's investigating lost equipment shipments for a firm that she worked for and wants her help to find out who the culprit is. She's got personal reasons for hating StarrTech and it's owner. The two agree to work together and soon realize they want to share more than business! I really enjoyed the relationship between Gwen and Zac. Because this is a 4 book series, things develop slowly and the mystery/who-dun-it is the focus with the romance slightly(but not too far) in the background. As in many other romances, the hero and heroine are wary of each other and admitting their feelings. I enjoyed the banter between the characters and liked the fact that they were both struggling small business owners who needed to work for a living.

He's extremely cheap and just doesn't strike me as someone I would EVER want to hook up with. Gwen is a spineless woman who continually makes excuses for his rough treatment and cruel jabs at her and her character. At first she has some gumption, but it quickly disappears for no good reason other than they slept together.

This collection of his essays (unfortunately for us, his last) shows his sharp wit and and infallible crap-detector working at top form.He shows a wonderful sense of outrage at prying newspeople who want to air someone's private grief to sell more cars, or mutual funds, or whatever their sponsors are hawking. Likewise, he takes telvision news to task for its lynch mob mentality towards Richard Jewell the suspected (and later exonerated) Olympic Games bomber in Atlanta.Through the years covered by the columns, he chronicles the sad decline of television news into mere sensationalism, where apparently only celebrities can make news and facts must never get in the way of ratings.He has great fun puncturing TV's pretension too, as in when he records a that program no longer goes into \\"reruns.\\" According to the networks, it has an \\"encore episode.\\" He suggests the next level of hype should be \\"pre-seen\\" episodes.Commenting on how shallow and staged the presidential debates are, he suggests the president of the United States often comes across merely as \\"America's Anchorman.\\"He retired just over a year ago and we are the poorer for it. Here is a collection of essays for people who like their martinis dry, their Op Ed columns slightly acidic, and their vision 20-20.

I had the privilege of attending Mr. Rosenberg's book signing last night, and of hearing him speak about the impact of 24-hour cable news, the blurring of opinion and news, and how the proliferation of reality shows (and therefore, the necessity for him to review them) was a factor in his retiring from the L.A. Times. (He is now a professor of journalistic ethics at the University of Southern California.) Having read his columns for all 25 years they appeared in the Times, I feel that a terrible void now exists in the area of TV criticism. Mr. Rosenberg is not coy, mean, or disingenuous in his writing: his style and content are absolutely crisp, thoughtful, intelligent, and right on the mark. As far as I'm concerned, he can write many more books like this one: please, Howard, mine your columns (all my clippings are faded); and help us navigate through the minefield of current TV, too."},{"Title":"New Muffin","review":"I have this book in paperback and will definately be buying this ebook version.

Microbrewery beers were an oddity & the more discerning drinker had to search a bit to find them(much like latte's & espresso in the \\"olden\\" days). Now, it is a historical reference piece which will (possibly) bring a beery little tear to the eyes of those whole lived through the early '80's \\"microbrewery revolution\\". There are very few of the brewers named in this book still independent, owned by the founders, or even in business. Red Hook, Grants, Bridgeport, & others have had large chunks bought by giant beer factories or beverage combines. Even Mendocino Brewing, the direct offspring of California's first micro(New Albion of Sonoma) has been bought by foreign investors, although it has retained its personality and quality. The Snake River Brewery of Notus, Idaho, Horseshoe Bay Brewing and Mountain Ales of the Vancouver area, Victoria Royale Tradition, Cartwright of Portland, and Kufner of Monroe, Wa. have all vanished into the mists of brewing history. Smith & Reilly, one of the first operations to have lager produced by a large brewer, was at first produced by Blitz(now defunct), then by Olympia, which was a Miller brewery(and produced Rainier, Oly's arch-rival) and is now defunct, and then died a quiet, unlamented death. Cartwright holds the distinction of being the first Northwest \\"boutique\\" brewer to go out of business. Kufnerbrau VERY deservedly vanished, to leave dusty pallets of yeasty swill still fermenting in the dark recesses of beer distributors who have also vanished from the scene.Kufnerbrau, like Chico's Saxon Brewery and the Redding Brewery of the late 1980's brought us micro-fans down to Earth, hammering us over the head, screaming \\"Just because a brewery is small doesn't mean it's any good!\\". Regional brewers Rainier, Lucky, Heidelberg, & Blitz-Weinhard have all been killed by the \\"big\\" boys. Red Hook's original \\"banana\\" beer & Kemper's \\"blueberry\\" beer are but vague olfactory hints, like a whiff of Hai Karate or Jade East found on that old Nehru jacket. However, John Mitchell of BC's Horseshoe Bay Brewing begat Spinnakers of Victoria, which begat Noggins in Seattle, which begat Maritime Pacific, & indirectly begat Humboldt Brewery, Swan's Hotel Brewery, & Howe Sound Brewing.As I started this review, I was primed to stick one in Vinnie's beady brown eye, but I thought of all the beer that has gone under the bridge since this first came out, & as I wrote this review, I realized this actually was an important work at its time. If brewing history interests you, this is one to have, for the seminal days when the epicentre of the microbrewery movement was the Pacific Northwest."},{"Title":"Dash & Dart","review":"This was a great read.

The setting is something like everything Neil Gaiman has ever written, plus the later Books of Magic (Timothy Hunter). But even that's not the limit.The style of gaming is truly interactive - both the players and the game-master work together to craft the story, with both setting in limits and ideas to the setting. Your character is important to the setting, and without what you put into it, no story will happen.This book changes how games are played, in a good way, and its very design encourages a more cooperative spirit than most previous games. I give this a really high recommendation."},{"Title":"Deliria: Faerie Tales for a New Millennium","review":"\\"The best way to find Faerie is not to walk but to sing,\\" writes Phil Brucato in this beautiful and poetic book that deconstructs the line separating Pagan spirituality from role-playing games. A large and gorgeous book, this is a colorful excursion into a mysterious world that is just around the corner, if not closer to you than you are to yourself. Let me make a confession up front: I am not a gamer (role-playing or otherwise), and so although I've had a review copy of this book for some time now, I've resisted writing about it, thinking I'm not qualified to do so. But as soon as I took just enough of a glance into the book to be beguiled by its enchantments, I knew I needed to give it my enthusiastic endorsement, not because of its quality as a gaming manual (more knowledgeable critics have already done as much), but because of its shimmering and ever-so-mysterious way of continually beckoning its readers to look for the weird places that exist just beyond the corner of the eye-and, once a connection with such a faerie-portal is made, to actually allow it to work its irrevocable magic on our lives. This book is many things: postmodern narrative, gaming instruction manual, art gallery, and extended meditation on the creative process. Like a fine old Irish shanachie, Brucato never settles for revealing his treasures in a simple and straightforward manner; instead, he buries subtle and tantalizing clues to what he's really about in odd and off-center moments in his text. What emerges is a profound and meaningful exposition of the alternating glories and horrors of the Faerie realm, and our complicity as human beings in creating, preserving, and ultimately destroying the energies and impacts of magic in our lives. It could be argued that there is no such thing as \\"Pagan theology\\" since Paganism is a path of experience, not dogma. But if we dare to believe that theology emerges out of stories and myths and dreams, then this lovely and darkly mysterious work just might be an eloquent work of Pagan theology for our time...masquerading as an RPG."},{"Title":"Deliria: Faerie Tales for a New Millennium","review":"This book is gorgeous to look at, and absolutely full of information on the genre,as well as three playable systems to cater to any roleplayers needs.I love the genre because it's open,the possiblities for &quot;sagas&quot; (or stories) are endless.The CDrom is about as long as the book, with music and a virtual card draw machine,if you are using the card based rules, not to mention a gallery of all the wonderful art from the book.This game would be ideal for people who enjoy the works of Neil Gaiman,Charles De lint, Storm Constantine, or The Grimm brothersIf you have been looking for a elegant system with a rich storyline, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Deliria: Faerie Tales for a New Millennium","review":"I haven't yet gotten the chance to play Deliria, but the book is fantastic, for the most part.The artwork is an amazing variety of tradition drawing and painting as well as photos and computer graphic art.The writing is also very good, though, for those (like myself) who are familiar with either White Wolf's World of Darkness or with Neil Gaiman's books (Neverwhere in particular), much of it will feel familiar. Of course, Brucato did significant work on Mage: the Ascension, so the similarity between the views of magic between the two games should be unsurprising (though the game systems are quite different).My complaints about the book (which are why it gets 4 stars instead of 5):1) The organization (first 4 chapters are setting, last 3 are system) at first seems to make sense. But, as I read it I realized it has a negative impact on the narrative. So, the end feels extremely anticlimactic. Sure, it's an RPG book, so ending with a bunch of tables for difficulties for magic effect shouldn't be surprising. But, I had gotten accustomed to Brucato's narrative style, so the end (which was purely a matter of structure) felt like a let down. Probably would have been less noticeable if the book had been less narrative. So, this says both good and bad things about the book.2) There are SEVERAL unclear places/errors. So, be sure to download the Compact Patch from the Laughing Pan website (www.laughingpan.com). It provides essentially clarification and correction of things that were very confusing in the Prime Codex.Overall, a great book that presents an exciting setting and a promising set of systems. I can't wait to be able to try it out myself!"},{"Title":"Deliria: Faerie Tales for a New Millennium","review":"This is a combination of two posts that I wrote about Deliria, originally posted at The Gamecrafters' Guild (http://www.gamecrafters.net).I just finished reading Phil Brucato's Deliria, and I have mixed feelings. The first three chapters are all setting and atmosphere, and they're completely awesome. Brocato uses a lyrical style throughout that's almost conversational, almost poetical, and very, very appealing. The ideas presented are really cool; the whole thing is basically a presentation of faerie tales in modern times, talking about how traditional archetypes have updated themselves (in some cases), and how the faerie realm fits into our modern world of magnets and miracles. Those first three chapters are just cool, in a way that few other products are.Once he got into the mechanics of the game, my interest started to wan a little bit, though. It's not that the mechanics are bad; quite the contrary. They seem easy to learn, simple and fast to use, and they make use of a really cool card-driven core mechanic that I find very appealing. They're described well, even if the descriptions are a bit stream-of-consciousness and out of order. The problem is in the tone.I just can't shake the feeling that Brucato thinks he knows the right way to game. While he's describing the mechanics, he frequently makes derisive references to mechanics like hit points and \\"push-button spellcasting\\", references which are clearly aimed at popular RPGs like D&D; and even White Wolf's games. He doesn't describe his mechanics and play style as being different, as they are; he describes them as being better, on a higher level than those lesser mechanics. He doesn't use those words, but the implication is clear, at least in my mind. Now, I'll be the first one to say that mechanics like hit points (or reasonable facsimiles thereof), or D&D;'s Vancian spell system (or White Wolf's system of Disciplines/Gifts/Whatevers) are far from perfect. They have their problems, and they're not right for everyone. I happen to think they work well for the games that they're a part of, but I also recognize that that is my opinion, and I recognize that \\"push-button spellcasting\\" wouldn't jive with a setting like Deliria, where magic is supposed to be fundamentally mysterious and unpredictable. Not only that but, to his credit, Brucato has created a very cool system of largely story-driven magic, with few mechanical aspects, that (if handled correctly by the GM and the players) would probably succeed in preserving the mystery of magic within the game.However, I find the frequent jabs at other systems to be in extremely poor form. An RPG should be a game first and foremost, and should never be a forum for airing the author's personal agenda (that's what blogs are for, right?). If he doesn't like D&D;, that's fine; more power to him. His need to be different from D&D; probably made Deliria a better game in the long run. But let's try to keep the name calling to a minimum, shall we?Now, I said that the mechanics of the game were cool, and they are. They seem to be easy to learn and they seem to lend themselves to fast play, and they certainly support the setting. The only real problem I have is with the Vitality trait. On the surface, Vitality looks like hit points (though Brucato repeatedly tells us that they're more than mere hit points) in that they are points that measure how close you are to dying. What's kind of wonky, to me, is how you lose and regain Vitality. When you're injured enough to lose Vitality, you don't lose a number of Vitality points, you lose a fraction of your overall Vitality score. So, the higher your Vitality, the more Vitality points you lose when you're injured. Further, you recover Vitality over time based on your Spirit score at a fixed rate, so the more Vitality you have, the longer it takes to recover. Does anyone else see the problem here? Brucato says that a person with a higher Vitality is more alive than one with a low Vitality, but let's look at an example:Bob has Body 5, Mind 5, Spirit 5, for Vitality 15. Joe has Body 2, Mind 2, Spirit 5 for Vitality 9. They both take the exact same injury, one that reduces their Vitality scores by 1/2. Bob now has 7 Vitality left, while Joe has 4. Now, each day Bob and Joe each recover Vitality equal to their Spirit score; this means that it will take Joe one day to recover his Vitality, while it will take two days for Bob. So, their injuries affect them in the exact same way, but the character with the lower Vitality recovers quicker. Does anyone else think that it seems like a disadvantage to have a high Vitality? This is compounded by the fact that there doesn't really seem to be any other advantage to having a high Vitality. You can share and steal Vitality, and I can get behind doing so from a story standpoint, but from a mechanics standpoint I'm not sure there's much incentive to do so. You can also spend all but one of your Vitality to automatically succeed on an action but again, the guy with the higher score gets hosed by that one.What really confuses me is that Brucato already has a very cool, elegant system of narrative injury in the game, whereby injuries are largely story elements with very few hard-coded mechanical effects. The danger of this is that it means that you die when the GM says that it's narratively appropriate for you to do so, but this can be mitigated by playing with a good GM. To me, this system makes Vitality a bit superfluous. Also, the concept of sharing Vitality or stealing Vitality could easily be handled entirely by story elements (as injuries are), or by the temporary reduction or exchange of Body, Mind, or Spirit points. Personally, I have suspicions that Vitality is only in the game because Brucato needed a third Heart Grace (already having Deliria and Fortune), and couldn't think of everything else. This wouldn't be a bad thing if he hadn't made the trait so utterly useless by trying to make it different from hit points.Now, I really, really don't want you to get the impression that I didn't like the book. I did. Overall, it was very, very good. However, these are the two major things that really bugged me while I was reading it, and I just needed to air my criticisms. I hope that they're taken in the spirit that they're intended: as me wanting a really good book to be even better."},{"Title":"Deliria: Faerie Tales for a New Millennium","review":"I've been roleplaying for ages it seems. I've seen systems come and go. This is one that I hope, I truly hope, will stay around for time to come. Deliria is not a hack and slash game, so if you want D20 dungeon hopping style, this isn't for you. However, if you are a \\"storytelling\\" kind of gamer and GM, then you'll love this. The world setting is not as precise and specific as, say, Mage or Vampire, but, that can work with what you find. You can modulate the world as much as you want, defining this and that area, while having realistic characters to march through the happenings. The system itself is fairly easy to get use to if you are use to storytelling style of systems that are out there. It has its own unique flavor, but you will get a hang of it quite quickly. The artwork in the book is beautiful, simply charming. All in all, I think that if you enjoy more of a thinking man's (or woman's) style of play and worldsystem, then this is the best one out there for you."},{"Title":"Deliria: Faerie Tales for a New Millennium","review":"I was very impressed by the production value of this game. The artwork and printing are first rate. I really like the game premise that a fantasy world exists just beyond our notice in the \\"real\\" world. I also like the fact that the game emphasizes the storytelling aspects of roleplaying over hack and slash tabletop combat. The only complaint I have is that the rules seem overly complicated. There are other systems out there that provide for strong roleplaying that keep things much simpler. Still the book is gorgeous and fun to read."},{"Title":"Deliria: Faerie Tales for a New Millennium","review":"The art is bad, the language is repetitive and the tone is often patronizing. The worst part is the inconsistency in the text, like they didn't find anybody to proofread it. On one page they claim a certain type of faerie has 3 to 5 guises, and a few pages later they list them as having 1 to 3. They can't seem to decide what certain terminology mean, using it both contradictory ways in one paragraph on one notable occasion.So if I think it's so bad, why am I giving it three stars? Simple. Some of the ideas are incredible and very creative, and it has given me a lot of inspiration for a campaign."},{"Title":"Bound for Bliss (Close to Home)","review":"This author continues to impress with her flawless, smooth writing style. Kristine Rolofson's BOUND FOR BLISS is a delightful road romance that I devoured in one sitting. The pacing is brilliant and it seems, to this reader, the author had as much fun writing BOUND FOR BLISS as I had reading it. A cramped station wagon, blistering hot weather, small children, and limited funds. Been there -- done that! Thanks Kristine Rolofson for the memories.Mini Synopsis:Jessica Whalen was trying to survive. How pathetic. She felt terrible; she was leaving her home and friends, and traveling straight into an uncertain future. She didn't know where she was going, but she knew she had to be strong. She was so tired of coping with everything by herself. Now a stranger stood near her car. He looked resentful. Did he regret signing on as her traveling companion? Did the idea of traveling several thousand miles in her twenty-year-old station wagon seem that unappealing? Jess moved toward him with stubborn determination.Henry Myles preferred to be alone and now he was in a packed station wagon with a red-nose crying woman, two sniffling kids, and an overly-heated bird. What the hell was he doing? Protecting his grandfather!! However, as the miles slipped away, Henry came to realize Jessica Whalen was no gold-digging floozy trying to con some money out of a rich old man. More likely, his grandfather had used her to get Henry to give up his workaholic tendencies. \\"Live a Little\\" were his grandfather's favorite words!A couple of weeks together in a car and something was between them. All the uncomfortable awkwardness was long gone and in its place, a wonderful friendship developed. Sigh, three years was a long time to be alone, but Jess was not going to fall into bed and make mad, passionate love to the man . . . even if he was great-looking. She was a mother. Ok, a lonely, single mother and yes, she liked being held and kissed, but it was the joyless thought of the 'morning after' that got in her way! Henry Myles would break her heart; 'staying' had not been mentioned!What the hell was he going to do? Something was definitely between them! But, a wonderful friendship and some incredible sex did not add up to a lifetime of commitment. His life was too busy! He spent too many long hours at the office! Ok, she was good for him and yes, life was more fun with her in it! But could he offer, her and her little family, a better life . . . with him solidly in it?Reviewer's Comments:BOUND FOR BLISS is, quite simply, an appealing novel. Kristine Rolofson weaves an engaging story based on friendship, understanding, and growing love. From the very beginning, the happily-ever-after outcome is a foregone conclusion, but Rolofson holds her reader's interest with some very pleasing charm.For this reader, Kristine Rolofson has proven to be an entertaining find indeed. So as the winter nights draw in, why not experience for the first time, or rediscover, this very special Harlequin author?Note: BOUND FOR BLISS, could this be a link in Rolofson's Montana Matchmakers series. No! It seems the only thing shared is the noun bliss! The 'bliss' in BOUND FOR BLISS represents \\"extreme happiness.\\" The 'bliss' in Rolofson's 'Montana Matchmakers series' represents the town of \\"Bliss, Montana.\\"Grade: B+Status: charming page-turnerSensuality: warmMaryGrace Meloche."},{"Title":"Bound for Bliss (Close to Home)","review":"The back of the book says:Hunky Henry Myles wanted to make sure that beautiful single mom Jess Whalen left town for good.

Compared to other Schaum's books, Financial Management by Shim and Siegel merits a rating of between 3 and 3 1/2.Four chapters covering topics of Risk Return & Valuation, Capital Budgeting, Capital Budgeting Under Risk, and Cost of Capital were excellent. Other chapters were also well written. The problem sets solidified concepts and were a pleasure to work through.The authors present the material in a straight forward and easy to understand manner. They provide numerous examples of how to apply the concepts which are truly beneficial.My main complaint is that there are dozens of errors throughout the book, which indicate sloppy proofreading. This can potentially frustrate readers new to the field of financial management. Calculation errors (!), misapplication of formulas (Do vs. D1) and mislabeling of charts (time lines / cash flows) were particularly frustrating and can be confusing.I welcome the authors to contact me if they plan to release an updated edition (this book copyrighted 1998). I'll be glad to share with them the errors (at least I think they are!) I found.It would also have been nice if the authors utilized financial calculators for some of the TVM (time value of money) applications and indicated the keystrokes. A break-out box showing the steps on a Texas Instrument BA-II or HP12-C (two popular financial calculators) would be helpful.In sum, Financial Management is a very readable book.

Though it is written with families in mind and can be geared up or down, I found that it is a bit much for younger students, and you should definitely wait until your oldest is in 3rd and up to dive in as a family.The 35 lessons are designed to be completed at a rate of around 1/week and the book includes coloring pages, printables, hands-on activity ideas, memory verses, supplemental reading lists, recipes, and a lot more. Each unit includes a test as well and the coloring pages for each unit are really spectacular. The main topics covered include: Biology Basics, Plants in God's World, Birds of the Earth, Mammals in the Wild, The Human Factor, Reptiles All Around, Insects High and Low, and Water Creatures.Bright Ideas Press has also put together a downloadable bundle of all the printable sheets (a separate purchase) which is awesome! That is such a boon to me - much simpler than scanning each page I need in order to get a copy out of the book.Like other titles published by Bright Ideas Press, Christian Kids Explore Biology is written by a real homeschooling mom, and as a result - it's realistic! I hope I don't come across as slacker-mom here, but this curriculum is pretty balanced - it has straight forward teaching sessions twice a week leaving room for additional readings, delight-driven studies, and hands-on activities. It doesn't micro-manage your entire science schedule for you (though it is slightly scripted and you can just open it and read the main content to your children.If you want everything and the kitchen sink in a science program, this one isn't for you - it covers the basics succinctly, in a timely fashion without bogging down or drowning you in detail - that leaves room for flexibility and your own expansions if you want to add them. Otherwise, it's a good core program that gets the job done from a creation-based perspective."},{"Title":"Christian Kids Explore Biology","review":"I am using this book for homeschooling at kindergartener, first grader, and fourth grader. I find that the units have something for all three levels. The younger two enjoy the activities and seem to grasp most of the concepts, and the oldest is learning the vocabulary along with the units.This book comes from a creationist perspective without being over-the-top weird and preachy. I am a Christian, but am turned off by books or curricula that over-use Christ's name, almost to the point of irreverence. This book has a clear stance, yet doesn't dwell on that at the exclusion of real science.

Satire is not my favorite form of humor, so it took me a few essays to get &quot;into the swing&quot; of the book, but I can say that once I came around to the appropriate frame of reference, I quite enjoyed the book. When reading this book, you must also remember that it was originally published in 1910; the humorous themes of the essays have aged well, but some of the settings have not.As I read the essays, I kept having the nagging thought that the author's style reminded me of a contemporary author. Once I reached the &quot;How to Make a Million Dollars&quot; essay, it hit me: I would not hesitate to call Stephen Leacock the Dave Barry (Miami columnist and author) of the early 1900s. They both have the same sort of perverse logic to their points of view.

His light-hearted, bubbly diction impressed me all the way through the novel. Each short story was unique and had true-to-life situations and entertaining characters to whom readers of all ages can relate. His stories are full of good advice for everyone from the socially elite, eager-to-please teenager to the hard-working businessman to the overprotective father. Leacock exaggerates in many of his sketches, but that aspect of each story fits in perfectly with the separate ideas he presents. I recommend this novel to anyone who agrees that life should be lived to the absolute fullest, taking all chances and having a good time. As Stephen Leacock says, &quot;Eat what you want. Eat lots of it. Yes, eat too much of it. Eat till you can just stagger across the room with it and prop it up against the sofa.&quot; (Leacock Literary 31)"},{"Title":"LITERARY LAPSES: My Financial Career; Lord Oxhead's Secret; Boarding House Geometry; The Awful Fate of Melpomenus Jones; A Christmas Letter; How to Make a Million Dollars; How to Live to be 200; How to Avoid Getting Married; How to be a Doctor","review":"A truly wonderful collection of pieces, ranging from silly to savage, by the Canadian equivalent of Robert Benchley. I say Robert Benchley because, like Benchley, Leacock has a wide range of interests that include poking fun at himself (the first essay, where he makes a fool of himself opening a bank account, is a classic for a reason), poking fun at social trends (the then-new fitness craze, the then-new obsession with doctors and medicine), and--at his best--sheer lunacy. (Like Benchley, he will launch into storytelling mode in order to mock entire types of stories--such as one about a nobleman's secret, which builds up the suspense and then ends with no one caring about the secret after all.) While some of his obsessions have dated, these pieces are almost perfectly constructed: they are all very short and efficient so as not to wear out their welcome. And from a construction point of view, not a line is out of place, not a single joke feels less than perfectly aimed. It's truly impressive and wonderful; humor collections this strong are rare. If you like the writers of the Algonquin Round Table, his Canadian equivalent is also their equal.

He translated the Bible as though he believed it we're the Word of God,not as today's so called scholars who don't even believe we have it anymore.Tyndale believed the Bible could be reliably translated into the English, unlike many modern captains of head knowledge who claim only the Greek can reveal the deeper things. This also was one of the many false claims of the Catholics;that being that the original language (Latin) could not be reliably translated into EnglishTyndale never sought to produce a sect to follow him as Calvin and Luther, yet he did more damage to Rome's heresies that both men combined simply by loosing the Word from the dead Latin language, (Tyndale used Erasmus's Greek) and the Papists.William gave his life for what he believed, being murdered by both the Catholics and the English Church,which was being controlled by Henry VIII.However, William stands vindicated by God and history and they condemned.History vindicates William Tyndale, his translation being read by more people that any written work in the history of the world,seeing that his words we're 80 to 90 percent carried over to the Authorized King James Version.This being a fact for which William was never given proper credit..."},{"Title":"Tyndale's New Testament","review":"I purchased the hardcover edition and I must say it is far superior in size and quality to the paperback (I have both).

I was completely impressed with the work, Daniell retained the idea of Olde English, with more current English spelling, quite a fete.Interestingly, you will also read a quick history of Tyndale's life and desire to have the common man have the scriptures in his hand. What punctuates this work is where Tyndale's work stops. At his death, he had competed much of the Old Testament.An interesting factoid that Daniell shares it that Tyndale gave us the English word for the term we use as Passover. For the Bible student, this is interesting because Pasha is translated throughout the whole NT of Tyndale's as Easter (the modern term used for Pasha today in the Greek language.)Many do not know that this work is really the foundation and much of the superstructure for what would become the KJV. Daniell tells us in other places that the KJV is 87% from Tyndale's work, where Tyndale left us a legacy.To complete your Bible collection, to understand the work of a man whose life was constantly in peril until his ultimate murder, to be inspired by another set of eyes and ears on the early text types, you must get the Tyndale Old and New Testament that David Daniell has compiled.

The main reason I like the Tyndale Bible is that it's translation is more accurate than even that in the King James Version, I know because I have spent the summer next to Greek and Hebrew dictionaries and concordances studying various translations of the bible.

For Christians, or for those interested in religious studies, Tyndale's inspired work has a clarity and purity unmatched even by the King James Bible--to which I previously looked for my personal readings, and which is three-quarters Tyndale (the other quarter not necessarily an improvement). In my career, on the other hand, I make my living from language and have gone again and again to the cadences and powerful forms of the Authorized Version--now I will go directly to Tyndale, and regret only that it took me half my life to read his rendering. His language shaped our own, down to the present day, just as his passion for the Word shaped our religious practice. There is no finer source for the study of English as we write it and revere it. This is, at the risk of too secular a characterization, the ultimate writer's handbook. Tyndale was martyred for his belief--for his words--and this reprint, with updated spelling, makes his most important work widely available again.

I believe what makes older English harder to read is the older spelling and type. With Mr. Daniell's updating of the spelling, I believe Tyndall's New Testament is more readable than the King James Version (KJV). Additionally, Tyndall's wording seems simplier than the KJV and is in more in keeping with modern translations.

Apart from the translation there are Tyndale's prefaces: to the whole New Testament, and to the book of Romans, and a few other very short prefaces. The preface to Romans is largely a translation of Luther's preface, but he expands on it in a few places to give a few very profound insights of his own. In his preface to the New Testament (written later, I believe) he describes in brief a view of repentance and faith that lays some weight on our side of the covenant and departs from the simul justus et peccator of Luther. Agree or no, this is not a scholarly translation which says \\"here is the text in English; make of it what you will\\" - Tyndale's coherent understanding of the message of the New Testament and his desire to make this message known are what is behind his excellence of language."},{"Title":"Tyndale's New Testament","review":"Until I read this book, I had no idea that the KJV Bible was largely a plagiarism of Tyndale's work.

Stalin, who had a minimal understanding of the vagaries of electoral politics as practiced by his wartime allies) were astonished to see Winston Churchill replaced by the Labor Party's Clement Atlee. After all, in many European and American minds Churchill was esteemed as the personification of the spirit of resistance to the menacing early victories of Hitler's armies and was thought be the indispensable diplomatic link between the Anglo-American and the Russian sides of the alliance. To this way of thinking the man who had shepherded his nation through the war might be thought to be the man who should lead it during the difficult post-war negotiations. But not so in Britain, where, a scant two months after VE day, there was a strong expectation that he would lose the Premiership, based on an even stronger desire of war-weary Britons for long-deferred changes in social and economic life that were unlikely to be introduced or advocated by a Conservative like Churchill.And, in the broader context of what his countrymen (including his fellow politicians) knew of Churchill's career before the Second World War, this reversal of fortune in 1945 was not surprising. It is this \\"unknown Churchill\\" (unknown to the outside world) who is the subject of R.R. James's biography - the Churchill who rose and fell through a succession of middling and high offices and who was often the contentious odd man out in each of the parties he belonged to (Conservative, Liberal, and Conservative in that order). While touching unavoidably on Churchill's personality and fixed ideas (ebullient, erratic, self-centered, grandiose at times, broadly tolerant socially and culturally while skeptical of many democratic political trends, a booster of British Imperialism once and forever), James writes primarily of Churchill's political life, pointing out that the man conceived himself as a lifelong professional politician, a calling of which he was proud. Churchill's other achievements - soldier-adventurer, author (as journalist, novelist, and historian), amateur painter and mason - were products of his need to support himself in a certain style or were undertaken as avocations that allowed him to relax or let off steam.His colleagues knew that The Great Statesman of 1940-45 was a final efflorescence of the always diligent and often \\"rogue\\" politician of 1900-1939. During the last ten years of this period, while a Parliamentarian capable of organizing a small but dedicated group of co-believers and dissenters, he was often an isolated voice crying in the wilderness, ignored by Baldwin's, then Chamberlain's factions within the Conservative Party. This was true for many areas of domestic and foreign policy, and not just for his warnings about the increasing danger of Hitler. (Like many European conservatives, Churchill had earlier made the judgment that Hitler was an able representative of Germany's justifiable resentments about the Versailles treaty and the order it had established, and that once these problems had been addressed, Hitler could and would be brought into the fold of normal European diplomacy and politics; he got over this illusion by 1938.)At this point it will be useful to list the ministerial and sub-ministerial positions held by Churchill between 1905 (his thirty-first year of life and his fifth year as an MP) and 1929: (1) Undersecretary of State for the Colonial Office. (2) President of the Board of Trade. (3) Home Secretary. (4) First Lord of the Admiralty. (5) Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. (6) Minister of Munitions. (7) Secretary of State for War and Air. (8) Secretary of State for the Dominions and Colonies. (9) Chancellor of the Exchequer.His three \\"military\\" offices (4, 6, and 7 above) embraced the years of the First World War and its immediate aftermath. The Duchy of Lancaster office was a meaningless one, meant to be a temporary place-holder for Churchill within Lloyd George's wartime coalition government after Churchill had been tarnished by the failed Gallipoli offensive, a black mark that followed him throughout his career, though, as James argues, he was hardly alone responsible for the operation's failures (better advance planning and inter-service co-ordination by the commanding officers, better logistics, and some more resolute decisions by naval officers at the outset would have improved the chances of the offensive's success).James's notion of Churchill's failures during these years is based on an evaluation of just how well he performed in the most important of these offices. As the Admiralty's First Lord he was thought to be a good infighter for funds and modernized equipment, but, given the necessity of co-operation with high-ranking career officers, he was too opinionated and peremptory to run things smoothly. And the Gallipoli gambit was in fact his special contribution to the war's strategy in 1915. It was a complete failure with an attendant high casualty rate, and even if it had been a military success, it is difficult to understand how it would have improved the Allies' situation on either of the main infantry fronts in France and Russia/Galicia. Churchill tried to revive this idea of \\"attacking the Central Powers through their soft underbelly\\" during the Second World War, and this too resulted in only a very modest (and costly) success on the Italian peninsula.As Secretary of State for War and Air during the 1920s Churchill accepted the arguments of post-war insufficiency of funds and public support in order to preside over a military organization that limped along with outdated equipment and ideas. James considers this part of his career to have resulted in placing the UK's military potential at an acknowledged low ebb that influenced its cautious continental policy during the early 1930s. As Secretary of State for the Dominions and Colonies Churchill was obsessed with one thing and one thing only - the maintenance of the status quo in India, which he held to be the jewel in the Imperial Crown even as evidence was mounting that tight colonial control of India was yielding a net economic loss. Churchill held for standing fast in the face of growing public sentiment (which included many Conservatives) that there should be a move toward more participation of Indians in managing their own destiny, with an eye toward eventual full independence (or Dominion status if Indians found that attractive). As Chancellor of the Exchequer during the years 1925-29 Churchill was, again, diligent, yet amateurish and dependent on expert advice that seldom deviated from the received ideas of the era. He made no significant policy decisions that took into account the structural problems of the British economy or that anticipated the coming Crash. James can't fault him for this debacle, but also can't discern Churchill doing anything other than \\"treading water\\" in order to stay in the political game by virtue of holding a high office which would keep him in the eye of the public and on the minds of his own Party's leadership (and, throughout the book, James notes that several generations of this leadership thought Churchill brilliant and dynamic while also erratic and what might be called \\"fundamentally ungrounded\\", a man with no strong intellectual commitments or core beliefs beyond political success).It is on this very point - Churchill's \\"political character\\" - that James's case about the nature of Churchill's performance during the years from 1900 to 1939 rests. To start with, James takes us back to the pre-1900 period in order to examine the roots of Churchill's ambitions. Churchill's father, Randolph, had a meteoric career in parliamentary politics. Like his son was to do, he led a splinter group within the Conservative party (the so-called \\"Tory democrats\\"), although he never left the party fold, nor was he was ejected from it. In fact his flamboyance on the Irish \\"home rule\\" issue (he was opposed to any concessions or compromises on behalf of the Irish and their parliamentary patrons, making Gladstone his special target) thrust him into a party leadership position as well as high office as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1886. By the end of that year he had resigned over an internal Conservative Cabinet dispute concerning his prerogatives and presumed authority over military and naval budgets - while assuming his peers and colleagues would be made to dance his tune, it was he who entered the political wilderness for the rest of his brief life. Those colleagues thought him brilliant but unbalanced to the point where his actions were incomprehensible. Basically Lord Randolph ignored his son, who idolized him and who wrote an idealizing biography of his father early in his own career. Churchill's mother, the wealthy American heiress Jenny Jerome, a big spender, socializer and something of a vamp, also ignored him, leaving him in the care of a nanny for whom he held an immense lifelong affection. Churchill also idolized and idealized his remiss mother, and this refusal to criticize his upbringing or to denigrate his parents (as parents) tells us a great deal about the man, especially about his inner resilience, his independence of mind, and his highly personal code of honor, a code that required personal loyalty in both directions (to him and from him, and hierarchically omnidirectional).It was his independence of mind and a total commitment to political life that caught the attention of the political establishment(many of his colleagues thought his intensity resulted from a desire to duplicate his father's successes while eradicating all memory of his failures). This aspect of Churchill's character fascinated and sometimes frightened or put off the more placid political players who were his peers. It was also independence of mind that led many to believe that Churchill needed to constantly draw attention to himself, by creating \\"splinter\\" positions, often to the detriment of party unity. In the period of his marginalization (1930-39) Churchill was famous for his sharp and witty journalistic assaults on various MPs and office holders and equally famous for his grand oratory in the House of Commons. James is especially shrewd in his considerations of Churchill as speechmaker. Everyone of a certain age thinks fondly of Churchill's WWII oratory, with its steady, pulsing cadences of short powerful verbs and its overtones of majesty in defiance and exhortation. But during the 1930s his speeches - always written and well rehearsed, as James notes, making them suitable for publication as well as for pronouncement - often raised a yawn or an eyebrow in the House of Commons, where his oratory had been heard for thirty years. Or, as James would have it, it takes a specific set of background political conditions (including real fears and real expectations, not perfunctory or merely rhetorical ones), knowledge of the speaker and his character, and an audience mentally and emotionally prepared to receive certain tidings (be they glad or bad) in order to create a \\"great speech\\" or one that resonates over time. This was demonstrably not the case for many of Churchill's parliamentary speeches during the 1930s, to which other MPs responded with \\"there he goes again on one of his hobbyhorses, good old Winston\\", or words and thoughts to that effect. Once again, to the wider world that always thinks of Churchill in the context of the events of 1940 to 1945, this is an \\"unknown Churchill\\", and a Churchill tinged by repeated tactical failures,in this case, failures to move the party leadership in his direction or even to ignite a debate on topics of interest to him. When the diplomatic situation changed so drastically to Britain's disadvantage after the fall of 1938, the conditions for (and prospects of) the revival of Churchill's career (and the power of his oratory) changed as well.Churchill sought the highest political prize (the office of Prime Minister) throughout his life - he made no bones about it from the 1910s onward, and his fellow MPs were well aware of his ambition. He first approached his goal, as it were, through the magic of Liberal-Conservative coalition politics and the good graces of Lloyd George and even Arthur Balfour, pushed along by powerful men who were his allies, but was denied it as a result of his own performance in other ministerial offices. His private life was held somewhat against him too (his strong family attachments were viewed as admirable, but his friendships with various colorful characters from all walks of life and his incessant \\"money-grubbing\\" journalism and popular history-writing were viewed as dubious by the \\"conservative establishment\\" and hurt his case when it came to building intra-party support). And the fact that he jumped parties twice was also held against him and was considered to be the unanswerable portion of all accusations of opportunism, undermining his ultimate prospects in both parties. And then, of course, in May of 1939 everything changed, and many of his thitherto perceived flaws became great assets.As James sees it, Churchill's career failures of the 1900-1939 period resulted from a number of choices gone wrong and misjudgments of the political context, and he is willing to put some of the responsibility on Churchill's colleagues and the temper of the times as well as on Churchill himself. James is \\"firm but fair\\" and would, I assume, be the first to admit that the glory years of 1940-1945 stand out all the more given the trajectory of Churchill's earlier life in politics (he did not exactly cover himself with glory during his second premiership of 1951-55, but then again neither did his political opponents). The book was published in 1970, five years after Churchill's death and during the earliest spate of Churchill biographies that were generally adulatory. It should be noted that throughout the lifelong effort at \\"autobiographical history\\" written by Churchill himself, those episodes deemed as either failures or false moves by others were not ignored by Churchill, but their origins and consequences were treated gingerly and equivocally in order to preserve a decent opinion of himself. James's book can only be interpreted as \\"revisionist\\" in the sense of compiling a more complete picture of a man who should be known for both achievements and failures spanning a 55-year long political career that coincided with a treacherous and turbulent period of history."},{"Title":"Estimation of standing stock of oysters in the James River, Virginia, using commercial fishing records (Special report in applied marine science and ocean engineering)","review":"An excellent analysis of Churchill's life, based on the premise that if his career had ended in 1939, it would have been a litany of failure, failure, failure. James's book starts with a thumbnail sketch of Churchill's father (another spectacular failure), then traces Winston's march through the first half of the 20th century. He bolted from one parliamentary caucus to another, making enemies in all corners; he sent thousands to their deaths at the Dardanelles fiasco; eventually, he was outcast and ignored through most of the 1930's. James writes in fine style, though it is sometimes a little too aloof, preventing a closer relationship between the reader and Churchill. However, the book is an excellent overall look at the Churchill most people don't focus on (ie. his first FORTY YEARS in parliament). Worth getting if you can find it."},{"Title":"Science: Internet Scavenger Hunts (Internet Made Easy)","review":"I bought this as a summer enrichment book between 6th and 7th grade for my son. Overall, its a very good book. He responds better to the more humorous line of scholastic books so this one felt a bit too much like school to him to really *take* to with a whole heart.In school there is an expectaion that the children already know how to search and my son did not. They are getting research projects in early grades...4th in my sons case and probably younger with no real concept of how to find information. This book is a good way to start to learn how to find information. It isnt exactly what I thought it would be...in that where to find the information is on a sholastic web page clearly labeled at the top of every exercise.... that said..its a start.Children are very computer savvy in alot of ways but I have seen my son try to research a science project and get very frustrated. When trying to find information on dolphin eyesight...it occured to him to list dolphin eyesight but not marine eyesight, dolphin sight, porpoise, dolphin vision, dolphin anatomy....just for example...I think that this book could have been a bit more helpful in this light. However I will say that the book clearly states it helps *get kids web-savvy* not improve their search ability... that was my interpretation. The other thing is that the children are always directed to a sholastic web page which is noce for safty issues.I wish this felt more like a game than it does... It feels a bit too much like school for my son to really *enjoy* in a summer-time sense... I think he has found it to be helpful even if he wasn't overly excited (in a fun sense) about the time he spent doing it."},{"Title":"Now My Eyes Have Seen You: Images of Creation and Evil in the Book of Job (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"This book takes a strong Historical-critical approach to the book of Job. It is well written and enlightening. The contrast he shows between the cannanite gods and YHWH really open up the text and the theology of the book of Job. The book does not really address the problem of pain and suffering because Job does not address it. The Author shows a meaninful connection between the soverngity of God and the hurt in life."},{"Title":"Now My Eyes Have Seen You: Images of Creation and Evil in the Book of Job (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"From the back of the book:Few biblical texts are more daunting, and yet more fascinating, than the book of Job-and few have been the subject of such diverse interpretation. For the author, the mystery of God's ways and the appalling evil and suffering in the world are at the heart of Job's significant contribution to the canon of Scripture. This study offers a holistic reading of Job, with particular reference to its depiction of creation and evil, and finds significant clues to its meaning in the striking imagery it uses. The author takes seriously the literary and artistic integrity of the book of Job, as well as its theological profundity. He concludes that it is not so much about suffering per se as about creation, providence, and knowing God, and how-in the crucible of suffering-these are to be understood. He encourages readers to listen to this remarkable literature, to be moved by it, and to see its progress from shrieking protest to repentance and vision."},{"Title":"A history of mechanical inventions (Beacon PB 84)","review":"This is a wonderfully through review of mechanical technology through the ages.

It had been a while since I took chemistry and this provides so much practice that it brings it all together. The examcrackers text itself is succint though i feel it reviews all the basics. Most people struggle with the stoichiometry section in berkeley review but I did this before using berkeley's chemistry and it made that section one of my best sections.The chapters in this book correspond with the chapters in the EK books. I did every other question the first go around and then when i came back i did the evens. I like that it provides explanation for the questions. Sometimes, I learned concepts from the short little explanations. When i took kaplans test, it showed that while physics was a weak point, I did well in the physical sciences section because my chemistry compensated for it. The MCAT is passage based and while this book isn't, it's great for learning the basics and learning to do the quick math that'll earn you some quick points on test day. But do yourself a favor and get another book with passages, either princeton or berkeley review so you can work on pacing yourself through passages.Good luck."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Chemistry","review":"I really, truly hated the EK 1001 series, and this book is no exception.

Often times they are little more than test taking strategies, \\"Use 'Roman Numeral' problems to you advantage. Since answer I is in all the choices, it has to be right.\\" It is not hard to go back to your chem text book or the exam krackers chem book to review, but it would be nice for the authors to succinctly answer the question, and show why the other answers are wrong.

Despite this, I found the most success with this package. I was using Kaplan originally. But I found their material to be way too convoluted and not directed to the essential things that needed to be learned. Perfect example: EK flat out tells you what formulas you will either need to know or disregard for the MCAT. Kaplan throws all of the material at you without being specific about what is critical to know. Furthermore, even in their most recent editions, Kaplan books are STILL including material that hasn't been tested on the MCAT for over five years. Huge waste of time. EK is completely up to date. I don't honestly feel that I learned anything that I didn't need to know with EK. Kaplan, on the other hand, gave me an overwhelming amount of unnecessary information.The thing about this set is that you can use the books in junction with the 1001 Question series that they sell. I recommend the Chemistry and Physics for sure. I didn't use the biology, as I heard that there were some inaccuracies here and there. Then again, biological sciences was my worst section so maybe I should have.The reason I recommend this all so strongly is because it makes for a very easy and coherent study strategy to follow. It actually makes the studying enjoyable because you are tangibly rewarded as you make your way through the 1001 Questions and correctly answer the problems.Pretty simple:I would start to read a chapter in the appropriate section (i.e. physics - mirrors and lenses). Then, after reading a few subsections of the chapter, I would go to the 1001 Physics Questions book and just do all of the problems up to that point. The material from the lecture books follow the same order as the questions in the 1001 Q's books. In the back of the 1001 Q's book, they explain in detail WHY the chosen solution was correct or false. I would check my answers after each problem to make sure I was understanding the concepts.I'm not a tremendous student, nor do I have the best study habits.But, by breaking the material down into subsections and doing a wide variety of problems associated with the concepts I was learning, I was able to make forward progress through the material while truly cementing the formulas and concepts in my mind. For me, this was most easily achieved by doing the 1001 Questions combined with the lecture material presented in the EK package.Physical Sciences was my strongest section. I hadn't taken a physics or chemistry class in over five years. I got an 11 using purely the routine I listed above, nothing else."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Chemistry","review":"These 1001 questions books along with the Audio Osmosis and their MCAT study package raised my MCAT score 4 points after I bombed the first one trying to study with Kaplan.

I bought this book 5 weeks ago, and I feel much more confident about the material on the MCAT. Get this book for practice and drilling of concepts. If you don't know the material- DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!! Like said above, review the material elsewhere, but if you wanna perfect your concepts get this book. Make sure you review the concept, though, before doing the problems. It's the general rule of thumb, that if you know the concept decently, and If you do problems (which this book has loads and loads, for example, there are 200 problems devoted JUST to acids and bases), then you will master the concept. I have improved my physical sciences scores now to a 12 up from a 9 in just 3 weeks. Granted, I worked very hard, but if you put your heart into this book, and really learn each and every one of these 1001 questions inside and out, meaning you learn why every answer choice is wrong, and why choices is correct, and also if you can give yourself problems just like the problems in the book, then there is absolutely no reason to not perform well on the Physical sciences test. Everyone says how the MCAT test is a thinking test is a valid statement for every section except for the physical sciences section. Only thinking you'll have to do is read and understand the passage (which, say if the passage is about magnetism, and you understand magnetism like thet back of your hand, is a joke), the rest of the test is simple math calculations and concepts. Good luck pre-meds-don't lose faith in yourself-the MCAT's are extremely difficult, but they are also predictable, and most importantly, conquerable."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Chemistry","review":"To get into Med school after 15yrs in business I took my Organic Chem series over again, studied Exam Kracker's 101 series until I knew the books cold, listened to EK's Audio Osmosis about 10 times while communiting then took several full length practice tests.Going in I thought I'd be taking it a 2nd time so I wasn't too stressed. Afterwards, I was even more sure I would be re-taking it. However, I managed a 30 (straight 10's) so I know anyone can.Bottom line, MCAT is not about knowing a ton of details (unlike Step 1). Know the basics like EK teaches so you can apply the concepts anyway they ask the question. Then practice, practice and pracitce some more (yes, especially the essays). It will help cement the concepts in, but more importantly give you confidence.My personal belief is reduced stress and being on top of your game test day are more important than which study aid you use. That said, EK's focused and yet whimsical style was perfect for me to go through it over and over until I knew it cold."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Chemistry","review":"Buy this book if you feel that you are weak in certain areas of chemistry.The most problem-intensive concepts in MCAT Chemistry are solubilities and acid-base reactions. This book will make sure that you know what you're doing when given a Ksp, Ka, Kb, and any other combination. It is far too easy to read the equation for Ksp or Ka and think you know how to do those problems-- often, a student has no idea why equations are the way they are and just plug and chug. The MCAT will burn you if you don't understand why equations work the way they do, especially with solubilities and acid-base.Great practice problems to test limiting reagents, reaction rates, Le Chatelier's principle, electrolysis. What I did for the MCAT was to study the concepts in chemistry that required problem-solving with this book. Try to skip the conceptuals question-- often, your own chemistry book can you teach concepts better than questions here, which usually operates on your knowledge of miniscule facts. Pay attention to what your instructors say are important-- do not do Vp questions, do not do phase diagrams. Often, the practice problems in your review textbooks is sufficient enough and you do not need to do practice problems for those.I did all 1001 questions for MCAT Physics THREE TIMES and I understood all those questions. I kept a notebook that detailed explanation for all the problems that stumped me. I went on the message board countless times. And while I knew MCAT Physics backwards and forwards, the amount of work I put in versus the amount of information that I actually needed for the MCAT was around 30%. In other words, doing all the problems meticulously will get you nowhere! You will waste valuable study time. Find your weakness and focus on those. Other things, you should just know without extensive practice.For example, what is the difference between the second and third row of the periodic table? The third row non-metal elements can have five bonds while the second row can only have four. This is a typical MCAT style question, and while a book like 1001 Chemistry will ask a large number of periodical tendencies question, this will probably be the only one that shows up on the test!Study smart. Solubility, Acid-Base, and Electrolysis are the big subjects. Know how to do limiting reagents and stoichiometry.

This book sealed the deal. It is very detailed in terms of explanations and if you don't understand the first couple of problems, by the end of the section YOU UNDERSTAND. It's just so many problems that you have no choice but to finally GET IT when you're done."},{"Title":"Carrier 03: Armageddon Mode","review":"I had the chance to read this book first, for me it was the first in the series and let me tell you it\`s the best for the action and the story.You can predict the outcome but not the way things will happen.

The action was enthralling and having read all the carrier books I find this to be the best one EVER. The battles are exceptional, the characters engaging and the scenario itself seemed plausable. Great job. I think the Carrier series would translate exceptionally well to a ongoing TV series. Hollywood...Give us a real Navy Drama with Politics & Action"},{"Title":"Carrier 03: Armageddon Mode","review":"Definitly the first one to read, if not the only one. Action packed and really good at keeping the pages turning. The scenario is more interesting then his books with conflicts against the \\"Big Bad Russkies\\". Douglass has more depth in both the American and Indian characters in the novel and is very descriptive in the weapons systems and tactics.The battle scenes are exciting. A couple of surprises here and there. Most of the action happens in the foreground except for at the end when some seemingly major events happen with a \\"by-the-way\\" attitude with an after the fact account. (An entire carrier battle group sunk!) After this book Douglass seems to sleep through the rest of the series as they turn VERY predictable and cliche with lots indestructable heros that never seem to run out of ammo or bad jockular dialogue. Tombstone Magruder must must think he's in the wrong place at the wrong time every single time the U.S. Navy fires a shot. Why doesn't he retire? Read this one though."},{"Title":"Black Culture and the Harlem Renaissance","review":"From the close of the 19th century, when the first pre-Renaissance writers began to be published for the dominating white readers, to the Depression era that marked the demise of the movement, Cary D. Wintz analyzes the emergence of the Harlem Renaissance as the attempt of black writers to come to terms with the social issues of the 1920s-1930s through their writing.Being his approach both literary and social, he does not neglect the different positions of politics and philosophers, highlighting the non-unanimity of views on the goals the participants should aim at and the ensuing strains arising from within the movement.Wintz sublty depicts an intertwining net of relationships: black community and its literature, black artists and their target, black prot&eacute;g&eacute;s and white patrons, black authors and white publishing houses, emphasising that it was this sheer interplay between the black intelligentsia and the white community that kept alive the vitality of the movement, despite the inevitable disagreements among the participants. Notwithstanding the fact that the Harlem Renaissance was led by a \\"loose coalition\\" of intellectuals, Wintz detects its \\"uniqueness\\" and bound in the \\"shared undertaking\\" of those same intellectuals who became aware of creating a \\"revolution in American literature\\".Wintz's particular ability is of investigating the Harlem Renaissance in all its nuances, including in his portrayal both the remote rise of the movement, with the analysis of the impact on the white-dominated scene of major black writers such as Chestnutt and Dunbar, the reasons of its fall and its effects on the following generations of writers, besides the accurate report of the hey-day of the movement.Special attention must be drawn on the sources consulted by the critic. As a matter of fact, most of the correspondence exchanged among the participants is scattered all over the United States, kept in several Libraries, Centers and Collections. Therefore, the consultations of such sources underline a work of precision and refinement and an attempt of restoring the live voices of the Renaissance makers.As a student and researcher on the topic of the Harlem Renaissance, I found this book exceptionally useful, detailed and clear. The author's style is straight-to-the-point and pragmatic. He wisely avoids any overlapping digression to the main subject matter and makes the reader understand his outlooks with clear images. I warmly recommend this text to any reader who feels like enriching his / her knowledge about this enlighting phase of American literature!"},{"Title":"The All Souls' Waiting Room","review":"In the 1930s, 40s, and 50s the Summerhill School of A.S. Neill and the writings of psychoanalyst/natural scientist Wilhelm Reich led a great many Americans to try raising their children in a more \\"self-regulating\\" manner. Wright was one of those children, and her tale is profoundly moving from beginning to end, as a celebration of what was good in ideas about self-regulation as well as a cautionary tale of how those ideas were abused. For, indeed, many adults, well-intentioned but not sufficiently aware of their own problems and need to control their children, used such ideas as yet one more tool to unconsciously impose their own will upon kids. (Similarly, many of the \\"Summerhill schools\\" that started up in the US in the 1960s only to fizzle out or worse, seem to have done as much harm as good for some of the kids who went to them.)This has left the impression with a lot of today's generation of parents that such \\"free school\\" or \\"Free child\\" ideas are muddle-headed nonsense, one of the legacies of the crazy, irresponsible Sixties that is better off forgotten. Paki Wright's brave book, though dealing in a remarkably frank way with the mistakes made by the adults around her, does not seek any such simple formula for dismissing the truly important things she got from how she was raised. We watch her move through her adolescent phase of blaming the adult world, on into the maturity that recognizes their shortcomings as well as their sincere intentions and the truly valuable strengths they helped cultivate in her.As a fascinating insider's view into one group of admirers of Reich, the book gives remarkable new insight into the struggle between Reich's work and the United States government that set out to brutally crush it. With the government-sponsored Nazi-like burning of Reich's books in 1956, and the imprisonment and killing of Reich in 1957, the child Wright watches as many of the adults in her world go down in that shipwreck. And then, like Peter Reich in his BOOK OF DREAMS, she has to grow up and make sense of the terrible events she witnessed and was part of."},{"Title":"The All Souls' Waiting Room","review":"\\"The All Souls Waiting room\\" is a book about the nineteen-fifties that has relevance for contemporary America: a gung-ho government and a suicidal adolescent. Written with wit and style, it's an eye-and-heart opener."},{"Title":"The All Souls' Waiting Room","review":"Thank you, Ms. Wright, for this beautiful story! I could not put The All-Souls' Waiting Room down and devoured it in a weekend. While the story takes place in the 1950's/60's and reflects social culture of that time, the book's overall message is timeless. We are truly victims of victims. With this understanding, can we forgive? Can we not just survive, but live, love and move forward? Is there comfort in the fact there is a much, much larger spiritual picture? The All-Souls' Waiting Room is a \\"must read!\\" Love you, Paki S. Wright!!!"},{"Title":"The All Souls' Waiting Room","review":"The storyline of The All Souls' Waiting Room is a frank and eye-opening look into the child-rearing techniques of Wilhelm Reich as interpreted by the adults who raised a now young-adult and suicidal Johnnine, the main character of the book. As a child of the 1950s when parents ruled and children had no recourse, I immediately connected with Johnnine's story and the results of the perhaps well-intended but spirit-damaging way of growing up that was inflicted upon her.Wright draws vivid imagery with her words, allowing the reader to experience her story in great depth. Her style and hard-hitting honesty made this my summer's \\"couldn't put it down\\" read. Moments of humor do well to offset the grim details of the main character's childhood, which could otherwise be difficult to take in.I loved this quirky, sobering and well-written book...makes me hope for more - both a continuation of Johnnine's story and anything else Wright wants to share. Her website - bohemianbuddhistreview.com - features a great collection of her current musings and never fails to give me a smile and something to think about. But it's like trying to fill up on appetizers when I'm hankering for an entree...bring it on!"},{"Title":"The All Souls' Waiting Room","review":"Paki Wright has an extraordinary story to tell, and chooses an equally extraordinary way of telling it--as a post-suicidal teenager reviewing her life on a jerky eight-millimeter film screened in a celestial copy of Sigmund Freud's office.Her caregivers, disciples of Dr. Wilhelm Reich, neglect her in the name of self-regulation and abuse her in the name of sexual non-repression. I am not going to give away the plot, but will reveal that the end is uplifting, and that there is laughter along the way. I appreciate the insider's view of Reich and his followers, and of the avant-garde life in New York City in the 1940's and 50's. A fascinating, gut-wrenching, fast-moving read!"},{"Title":"The All Souls' Waiting Room","review":"Through an attempted suicide, Ms. Wright recounts with extraordinary insight into her growth from infancy to childhood to womanhood.

The best read I've had in a long time."},{"Title":"WATERLESS MOUNTAIN","review":"Younger Brother, an eight-year-old growing Navaho boy, and his uncle live in a rocky, hot, dry land called The Waterless Mountain, because there are no springs coming out of the mountain. Uncle taught Younger Brother about his family. Uncle was a very smart man, so he was thought to be a Medicine Man. Even the whites held Uncle in high regard. The white men, are called Big Men because of their smartness, power, and their size. Uncle also taught Younger Brother about the Special people known as the people of the sky, heavens, and Earth. This had inspired Younger Brother to go to the west, but since he was still only eight, he could not go. Three years later Younger Brother, now eleven, rides to the wide west by himself.This was a great book about Navahos and their special powers they believe they hold inside of them. This is a great book for people who like adventure and mysteries. Even though my teacher made me read this, right from the beginning, I was fascinated by the way the author brought my attention to the difference between are lives today and the lives of the Indians in the year 1924. The ideal reader for this book would be a sixth to eighth student."},{"Title":"WATERLESS MOUNTAIN","review":"This novel won the 1932 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. It is the story of a young Navajo boy in the 1920s who wishes to become a medicine man like his Uncle. The book is filled with the fables of the old Navajos and descriptions of some of their ceremonies. I agree with the 1998 reviewer from Washington, D.C., that the comments made by the Horn Book seem a little too harsh. Apparently, there was a great interest in Navajo culture at this time in the U.S. The 1930 winner of the Pulitzer Prize in fiction was &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; by Oliver La Farge. But, the Horn Book probably doesn't care for that book either!"},{"Title":"WATERLESS MOUNTAIN","review":"I do not agree with the review given by Horn. This is a gentle story told with compassion and respect. It does not degrade the Dine nor their culture. Laura Armer respected the Dine and, in turn, was respected by them. They called her &quot;the woman who wears turquiose&quot; (she wore turquiose long before it was popular to do so) and &quot;hard-working woman.&quot; This story can be appreciated by children who have secret places and are in awe of the beauty and wonder of nature. There is a magic quality to it that supports many children's belief in the mystical realms. I read it to my son when he was seven and we both loved it. I think it might even encourage some to find out more about the Dine people and their culture and beliefs. I suppose the reaction of the Dine characters when they are in the city could be taken as demeaning by those looking for that particular view. However, these people's lives were based on relating, daily, to important life issues, not the non-essential elements that abound in city living and the art/museum world culture - this could make them appear simple. Yet, if the situation were reversed, and the people from the urbanized world were put on the Dine reservation, especially in the 1930's, they would appear awkward, superficial, and &quot;illiterate&quot; in the ways of survival. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"WATERLESS MOUNTAIN","review":"I read this for a college course on children's literature, so I'm not exactly a part of the book's target audience, but I find the snarky review above unjustified. God help the poor pitiful humans in the 1930s for not being politically correct enough to please the Horn Book's reviewing staff. And I guess religious values and a respect for nature is now to be dismissed pejoratively as &quot;mysticism.&quot;I thought the book was an interesting read, if, sure, a bit dated. It's all the more interesting because the life it depicts -- life on the Navajo Res before the coming of paved roads, is slipping away from living memory."},{"Title":"WATERLESS MOUNTAIN","review":"I exchanged about a hundred letters with Armer before her death. From her unpublished manuscripts I edited 10 chapters of her Navajoland adventures for Desert Magazine. These chapters were then published as &quot;In Navajoland.&quot; She shared many mystical insights with me and a credo which I cherish: &quot;I will walk with fate / And thus compel / The jade to go my way. / A jackal falling down a well said, / &quot;Here I camp today.&quot; I have in my living room the large canvas Armer painted called &quot;The Shepherdess,&quot; a scene described in one of her books. I welcome any comment on Armer."},{"Title":"WATERLESS MOUNTAIN","review":"This 1932 Newbery Medal award winner was really a good story about a Navajo boy and his family. The title was misleading and it turned out to be something totalling different than I expected. The book is so rich in descriptions of the Navajo culture and the characters are so likeable. This is not a book that would be on anyone's radar because of it's age. I sought the book out because I am trying to read all the Newbery award winners for which I am glad - otherwise I would have missed this treasure."},{"Title":"WATERLESS MOUNTAIN","review":"This gentle story of Younger Brother, an Indian boy and his coming of age touched my heart. His thirst to uncover the mysteries of the earth and connect with his fore fathers (\\"the ancients\\") by learning all the ancient songs, customs and ceremonies in his quest to become a medicine man, made for a truly unforgetable story. I must say that initially I found the prose wearisome, however after I allowed myself to get into the rhythm of the book, I was able to appreciate it for the history it afforded. I applaud the author Laura Adams Armer who must have spent many hours researching the ancient Indian traditions and customs. Younger Brother grows up a bit as he leaves the familiarity of his home and strikes out on his own to find \\"the wide water\\". During his journey west, he encounters people unlike any he has ever known, those who would dare attempt to steal his pony, and those who would dare disturb an ancient burial ground, just to obtain a piece of pottery. The realization that all is not always beautiful is a revelation to him as he has always been able to find beauty everywhere he looks. I would recommend this book to any adult who enjoys history (Indian history or otherwise), or to a mature youth who would be able to appreciate it for its background on Indian culture. Those youth who typically enjoy a more fast paced read, would undoubtedly find this gentle tale not to their taste."},{"Title":"WATERLESS MOUNTAIN","review":"This is the coming-of-age novel of a young Navaho boy, Younger Brother, as he learns the world of his people and learns the secrets of his tribe's wiseman and learns the ways of the larger world.

Let me tell you. Not many, because it is such a daunting read, written as it is in difficult-to-assimilate Victorian English, and rather long to boot. Dr. Sheldon's version keeps Darwin's original chapters, so all the topics are covered. Except where a modern reader might be confused, he preserves Darwin's immaculately composed text, but he selects only those examples which are neccessary to convey Darwin's ideas. Darwin went overboard with his examples; Sheldon has kept them within reasonable bounds. After reading this book, with its modest 220 pages, you will have read Darwin in the original, and you will have informed knowledge of &quot;The Origin Of Species, as it was presented in 1859. If only this version had been available when I tried to study biology!"},{"Title":"Revolution and Renewal","review":"As someone who has heard Tony Campolo speak many times, and as someone who doesn't enjoy reading, this book opened my eyes. It only took me 2 days to read this book. I couldn't put it down. Tony Campolo obviously cares for the inner city missions of Camden and Philadelphia. This book is a great example of how Christians need to respond to the poor and the inner city people. This book will touch your heart with the stories by Bruce Main of his experiences in Camden adn so forth. This is a must have book for any person entering the mission field. Eastern College is very lucky to have a man like Tony Campolo to teach there. As a student at Eastern, I am blessed to have heard this man encourage the students and faculty to reach out to the people of Camden and Philadelphia. This book makes you look in depth at your life and walk with Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Revolution and Renewal","review":"For those who really want to do something, or need to be encouraged to do something to help the Kingdom of God be manifest in the city, this book is for you. It is practical, and most importantly, hopeful. Campolo uses his own ministry and experiences, as well as other unrelated ministries (for example, Minneapolis; Ripon, New York; Costa Mesa, CA; and the Dominican Republic) as prototypes for what can be done in inner cities. He is honest in not promising that every ministry he mentions can be replicated; but since Campolo gives so many specific, practical suggestions on how to carry out the ideas and programs presented, people will hopefully catch a vision and be encouraged to give some of them a try.Campolo's love and care for those in the inner city is contagious. He believes that one of God's main concerns is for the poor and oppressed, as evidenced in Jesus' first public words in Luke 4:18-19. Campolo challenges all of us to champion the needs of those who lack the basic necessities of life. He challenges the churches who have much, to partner with those who have little. And he challenges all of us to love Jesus through loving others, especially the poor and oppressed. But his ideas are not only about others helping the poor. He also believes in empowering people to help themselves (for example, see Ch. 7 on neighborhood meetings). If you want to do something to help God's will to be done on earth as it is in heaven, read this helpful and hopeful book."},{"Title":"Revolution and Renewal","review":"Seriously, you do. As a pastor in a downtown, semi-urban setting for over a decade, I found this book to be an essential one in my library. The chapters are organized around practical, Christian solutions to urban problems. There is advice on how to plan a town meeting, how to structure prayer ministry, how to better utilize church space for economic development and so on. But it's not a dry read! Dr. Campolo peppers his practical advice with stories of where and how this has worked. And in the beginning of the book, there are many stories by Bruce Main about his ministry in downtown Camden, NJ. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Revolution and Renewal","review":"Revolution and Renewal: How Churches are Saving Our CitiesThis book shows the depths of Campolo's and Main's love for the city, even if it is for cities like Camden, NJ, a place that American's consider extremely dirty and violent.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"Revolution and Renewal","review":"Tony Campolo had a name that carried a lot of good will with me. I came to this book having long heard of Campolo. I had heard his sound bite wisdom flashed across my television over the years. I was excited to pick up this book and read it. It promised to be something interesting - and very likely useful to my ministry.Sadly, the book was more than a disappointment. Campolo used this book as a printed infomercial for his own ministry. Over and over again he crows about his successes and shamelessly promotes his ministry as exemplary - while doing nothing to take seriously HOW one translates a model of ministry from one place and situation to another. He says so many things that, on the surface, sound appealing. Like a politician, he is skilled at ladling out catch phrases that are like candy to the ear. But...which fall apart when you really look at them.Some of his most offensive suggestions include the inference that the poor should essentially be satisfied and thankful with what they get economically. Having a future that dead-ends at McDonalds is the hand God dealt, so stop bellyaching. He heaps blame on people who suffer, and readily gets their oppressors off the hook by saying it's a good thing to be rich and enjoy it (with no responsibility attached??).As a scholar of Wesleyanism and Methodism, i take particular offence at his intentional misquoting of John Wesley. He notes that Wesley said that one should 'earn all you can and save all you can' (note that Wesley meant be frugal with what you have when he said 'save' - not store up, as we think of its meaning) - while omitting that the purpose of this was to GIVE all you can! Here, Campolo is caught in a gross misrepresentation of Wesley, essentially editing his words to make him say what Campolo wishes he had said! Shame!!I also was shocked by the suggestion that entrepreneurial Christians should look into the possibility of getting on the privatization bandwagon and contract with the government to run Christian prisons!The whole book is a gross accommodation to much that is the WORST about our society. It may read sweetly for those who see ministry to the poor of the inner city as a ministry of condescension. But, i see nothing of Mr. Campolo's upper middle class values in the genuine ministry of compassion of Jesus Christ.Sadly, this book made me lose respect for Mr. Campolo. I wish i could say otherwise."},{"Title":"All About Turkeys","review":"I bought this book for my niece and nephew about 2 years ago and upon reading it myself, I found it to be educational, interesting, and informative.

Yeah, the book has some good ideas but the book perpetuates the \\"spells can solve all your problems\\" myth that Neo-Paganism is so innundated with. I appriciate that she's done her part to explain magic and it's rules, but she does also perpetuate the idea that the Wiccan rede commands us to \\"harm none\\", and the idea that harm none only applies to the realm of actually physically harming an animal or person is rediculous.When it comes down to it, this book is just another book of spells. Spells written by another person are not as useful as the ones you write yourself. For me, the bottom line is that it's good for ideas if you're learning how to write your own spells, but books of spells like these are for those who aren't dedicated enough to realize that Wicca isn't some cheap parlor game that will solve all your problems if you light a candle and chant a few words."},{"Title":"Emergency Magic!: 150 Spells for Surviving the Worst-Case Scenario","review":"I, personally am quite tired of \\"Wiccan Authors\\" who on one hand spout the Rede, \\"and if it harm none,,,,,\\" and on the other show no balance between Female and Male and figure that manipulation is OK. Well if it is then manipulation should work both ways. When so many \\"love\\" spells start with \\"the target must be a male\\" or \\"The initiator of the spell, the one who wishes to reap the benefits, must be female.\\" There seems to be a definate sexist bias here. Perhaps before some of you manipulative ladies consider using such you might meditate on another part of the Rede: \\" Mind the threefold Law ye should, three times bad and three times good.\\" I picked this up thinking there would be some good solid information about how to deal with emergencies...instead I find this. Ah well, while using manipulation and other less ethical means can work, there is always a way to turn a negative into a positive...and avoid the whammy Karma sends your way. To be fair the author didn't write or invent these spells, but she didn't show a lot of balance in the ones she included either."},{"Title":"Emergency Magic!: 150 Spells for Surviving the Worst-Case Scenario","review":"Nice book with some cute cartoons, but nothing that I tried in it worked for me."},{"Title":"Emergency Magic!: 150 Spells for Surviving the Worst-Case Scenario","review":"I disagree with the reviewer's comment that \\"Witches don't need a book of spells\\" because that is precisely what Witches DO need! The mass majority of so-called Witches & especially Wiccans could not enchant their way out of a wet paper sack with a razor sharp dagger in hand! The reason for this is because the average practitioner is about as ignorant as the author of the book-of-the-month-pagans are when it comes to spells and spellcasting.Personally, I understand how spells are made as I spent years dissecting many of the old charms and spells found in folklore. This is what a Novice SHOULD be doing but does not instead choosing to waste time trying to reinvent the wheel.This is a useful collection of spells (even though I found some to be odd such as \\"Surviving Natural Disasters\\" or \\"Make Your Children Behave In Public\\" but overall quite useful for what is offered. I also enjoyed the way she utilizes natural things to aim and direct a spell's energy toward a particular purpose.Case-in-point with the \\"Increase Business Now\\" where she suggests using sand (she calls it dust) from an anthill with a lodestone and the other two ingredients. The ants is a PERFECT sympathetic item to use beause who in the world work harder and are more dedicated than ants? They're the perfect analogy of a big corporation. Most of the so-called Occult books out there neglect the materials from nature other than herbs, roots, resins & essential oils.Overall I found the materials and the way they're used in this manual to be well balanced and as well thought out.The ONE thing I dislike is her 'ethics' discussion. Cannot understand WHY McWiccans must be forewarned in every book they may touch. Gods this is such rhetorical nonsense and smacks of the same indoctrination on Wiccabes as Xianity does with their young. This is the one thing that kept me from giving this book 5 out of 5 stars.

It is also ideal for the more experienced witch: adepts with a good grasp of the subject looking to expand their magical repertoire.

As in her previous book, Earth Mother Magic, Judika mixes an original blend of old and new techniques to come up with a potent brew that is perfect for today's lifestyle. These rituals require neither an exorbitant amount of financial expense nor a prohibitive amount of time. They are thoroughly modern yet grounded in history. And best of all.... they work!"},{"Title":"Emergency Magic!: 150 Spells for Surviving the Worst-Case Scenario","review":"While I adore to do full rituals, I do not always have the time to spend an evening doing them. And then there is the time, energy and money spent looking for all the items needed!Judika has taken the hard work out of magic, showing us that our mind is our most powerful tool. She has once again taken what is different and alien to some, and had made it easy and simple for everyday life.

If your need is dire,there is a spell here to fit the bill and you can get to it quick.

This a must-have on every practicioner's shelf!"},{"Title":"Emergency Magic!: 150 Spells for Surviving the Worst-Case Scenario","review":"Outstanding! Wonderful! Timely! Much Needed!

We live in a fast pace world, and these spells are not only quick and easy, they WORK!Judika, we are very lucky you came out of your broom closet."},{"Title":"Emergency Magic!: 150 Spells for Surviving the Worst-Case Scenario","review":"I had high hopes for this book, because I liked Illes' other work, The Element Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells (read my review for that), but I found that I was a bit disappointed with this one - mainly because most of the spells in here were in her 5000 Spells book, just expanded. So, if you have 5000 Spells, there's really no need to get this book. I also don't constitute getting a man to love you back as an \\"emergency\\" (one of the spells in this book), and I would never work a spell of that nature. But, Illes is not a Wiccan, so she doesn't adhere to the rules of magic that I do.Overall, I recommend 5000 Spells for the greater variety of ingredients and topics instead."},{"Title":"Emergency Magic!: 150 Spells for Surviving the Worst-Case Scenario","review":"This fascinating book lists four of these emergency situations right on the cover: 1) stop a cheating lover, 2) land a promotion, 3) prevent parking tickets, and 4) fit into your wedding dress.I was excited to start trying these great spells right away. Unfortunately, I'm somewhat dyslexic and instead of correctly doing the above four spells, I got a little mixed up and what happened was my boss got the parking tickets, the lover who was cheating on me got the promotion, and the meter maid who gave my boss the tickets lost the weight and ended up fitting into my wedding dress.Well, don't let my little magical misadventure discourage you, as this book looks to be filled with great spells for all occasions."},{"Title":"Emergency Magic!: 150 Spells for Surviving the Worst-Case Scenario","review":"when i got this book it looked too small to have all the spells that it says it had. the same day i tryed a spells in the book and i saw the spells's ''work'' the same day. over all very very good book you should buy it you never know what scenario you might be in."},{"Title":"Emergency Magic!: 150 Spells for Surviving the Worst-Case Scenario","review":"I don't own the book, but it caught my attention while I was browsing the New Age section in a bookstore nearby, so I spent a few minutes skimming through it. I'm not at all familiar with Wicca, ashamed as I am to admit it, and for someone like me, it was quite interesting (and not hard to follow). I've been contemplating buying it for a few days, which is why I'm here (the bookstore ran out of copies, which is quite a compliment).Yes, I noticed the sexist bias the Doctor talks about, too. I was not, however, knowledgeable (or focused) enough to be able to tell if it was there because the spell wouldn't work if a man used it on a woman (must the writing of a spell be specific down to the gender of the caster and that of the... \\"castee\\"?), or because it seemed unlikely to the author that a guy would want to improve, salvage, or start a relationship.I don't know if using a spell to try and accomplish any of those constitutes \\"manipulation\\". If it does, then that's a pity. A curious point worth making, however, is what the stereotypical female / male (if I'm allowed the sweeping generalization) would usually use manipulation of the opposite sex *for*, and I don't mean by (just) spells. There are plenty of self-help books that employ different tactics based on psychology, communication, body language and even \\"mind control\\".For the woman, the goal (usually) is to \\"manipulate\\" the man she loves into wanting to try and build something lasting and meaningful together. For a man, it's (usually) about \\"manipulating\\" a woman he's attracted to sexually into his bed, the end. (Most self-help books that include NLP or \\"mind control\\" in their titles are geared exclusively towards men with this specific goal in mind - spot her, \\"get her to do anything you want\\", move on to next target.)The profound difference in how constructive / benevolent male and female motives are does not excuse manipulation when it comes from women, but it does provide an amusing pespective."},{"Title":"Radio Production Worktext: Studio and Equipment","review":"If you are considering working in broadcasting, or just have a curiousity about what goes on behind the scenes, then this will give you the feel of broadcasting work. Experience it, and go from there."},{"Title":"Contented among Strangers: Rural German-Speaking Women and Their Families in the Nineteenth-Century Midwest (Statue of Liberty Ellis Island)","review":"The author gives you a real feeling for the lives women emigrating from German speaking countries. It is very informative and quite a good reference.

I found the book \\"Contented Among Strangers\\" by Linda Schelbitzki Pickle to be a great help to me. I recommend it to other genealogists with German ancestry who want to understand more about their female ancestors than just names and dates on a chart."},{"Title":"Contented among Strangers: Rural German-Speaking Women and Their Families in the Nineteenth-Century Midwest (Statue of Liberty Ellis Island)","review":"This is an excellent book! Not only for genealogists, but for anyone wanting a glimpse into the real lives of immigrant women. German women are the subject, but their experiences allow us to see into the feelings of anyone leaving their homeland forever. Some of the experiences of these women read as smoothly as the best fiction writer in spite of numerous references which lend credibility. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"When This Cruel War Is Over","review":"Fleming is trying to write character-driven &quot;literary&quot; historical fiction here, and he oversteps his ability somewhat. The problems and motivations of the characters -- primarily Stapleton, the Union officer torn between two sides; his Rebel and proto-feminist &quot;adventuress&quot; fiancee; and the one-armed Colonel Gentry; are clearly carefully thought out. However, I found the overall premise, that of a giant Copperhead conspiracy to make the Midwest secede from the Union, improbable; though the note at the back of the book says it is historically accurate, I did not find this to ring true. Likewise, Gentry's letters, though supposedly taken from nineteenth century originals, do not sound period. Overall, the author clearly put a good deal of effort into the book, but it is a type of book which requires interesting and fresh use of language to succeed, and this is where he falls short of the mark. The writing here is mundane and somewhat flat, despite efforts at &quot;literary&quot; language. The book is also rather heavy on character interactions and &quot;telling&quot; how characters feel, while comparatively light on real action. The author makes the common error of introducing rather badly recreated historical characters from Davis to Booth. I wouldn't call the book an utter failure, but I found myself getting bored 3/4 of the way through."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"When I was young, every once in a while I met an individual that showed courage in a somewhat unassuming manner. These individuals show a courage that we perceive as defiant and/or ballsy...they had the courage to just be themselves. Just being yourself may not seem courageous, but in highschool when the most important thing is to be accepted by you peers, I think it is the most courageous thing a person can do. I see this trait in the character Noah and even though he sometimes comes off as sarcastic and an intellectual snob, I can't help but admire his courage. I plan to read more of Bart Yates."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I literally did not get out of my chair until I had read this book cover to cover. It's been a long time since a book held my attention that way, and I read almost non-stop."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I read every night before bed. It's relaxing and the only guaranteed quiet time in my busy and generally noise-filled day. The only thing is that whenever I happen upon a really exhilarating read, I don't conk out after half an hour, but stay up at least double that and generally finish the book. That's what happened with Leave Myself Behind by Bart Yates. I was very groggy in the morning, but no matter! It was a great read! It was worth it.Brief Summary: Closeted teen moves from big city to small town, finds secret love, love gets exposed, town goes hate-filled and violently crazy, teens mom goes a little crazy-part of a wonderful side story, intensity, intensity, followed by reflective intensity and then the book ends perfectly. No loose ends, but not everything is settled or answered. Very real.Yates writes in a very captivating way. You end up wondering or caring about every character in the book. The book explores many a tough issue: coming out in a small town, homophobia, date rape, incest, gay bashing, poetry snobs... it's also fun that there is a mystery of a backburner story going on throughout the main story, weaving in and out, keeping you interested, keeping your interest spread out and the timing of the story telling very well-paced.I would recommend this to any gay teen, and to most anyone else. It's a good read. It wasn't in the young adult section of my library because there are a few brief sex scenes, and so, if you're a closeted gay teen, I might extra recommend this book just for the vicarious joy of that!"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I rarely comment on books on Amazon, but I had to comment on this one. I really loved this book. I loved the story. Very entertaining and well written. At times it made me laugh out loud and sometimes it made me want to cry. I loved the main characher and his honest narration of his life. I'll be reading \\"The Brothers Bishop\\" next, and I hope it's as good as this one was."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I read this book after it was handed to me by a friend. Little did I know what to expect, but once I started reading I could not put it down. I finished the book in one day. I found the intrigue, sarcasm, overwhelming confrontations, quirks, and sense of humor with the main characters individuality very refreshing and almost endearing. I just loved the frank and direct openess in this book, with very clever twists and a question of: \\"did I ever say or think things like that about my mother\\"."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Don't look for a synopsis here, just a wholehearted recommendation. I learned about Bart Yates' books from a reader's list on Amazon.com a few days ago. I checked this book out of the library and started to read it when I got home from work in the late afternoon. I didn't get to sleep until 2:00 a.m. the following morning because I could not put the book down. It was a completely unexpected engrossing reading experience for me; I haven't been absorbed in a novel like that in YEARS. I plan on reading it again soon, but more slowly next time. For the first time in a long time I am going to buy a novel (this novel) at full price, just to support the author."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I was unable to put this book down even to eat. I did actually have to sleep, but I picked it up the next morning and finished it by the next afternoon. Now I am desperate for more from this author. Give me a book about Noah and JD having gone to college and either continuing with their relationship or let us know if you want them move on to new college love, but please go easy on the break up. It could also just be easier to keep them together. This is just a fabulous must read."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Bart Yates has been heralded far and wide for creating another Holden Caulfield in the character of Noah York. And it seems pretty clear, in reading \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" that this was intentional. But I'm not buying it. It's far too forced, and Noah falls out of that character far too often for that to be the case. Still, this was a good read. A book that I finished in a single sitting. Something I rarely do.Bart Yates and his mom move to a small town immediately after the death of Bart's father. Bart meets a neighbour boy and in spite of neither of them being Gay, they fall in love. Both boys are plagued by neurotic mothers who are rape victims. And both mothers bore children as a result of their attack. (Isn't that just a little too improbable for you?) The boys, who after having developed an ongoing sexual relationship with each other, still don't think they are Gay. (Again, too improbable for me.) Eventually they are forced out of the closet at their high school, and too predictably, they get taunted and beaten up. On the surface, excluding the bits that seem too ridiculous to believe, this is pretty routine, unexceptional stuff. It's every coming out/coming of age story you've ever heard, all tied up into one (too) precious little bundle. But the writing isn't too bad, and the characters are well developed, and here and there, you find a nugget of warmth and interest that keeps you from tossing the book on the fire.Five stars is too much for this book. Four stars may also be too much. But certainly three makes it seem like I think this is a bad book, and it isn't. It's just a bit too formulaic and a lot too lazy. Yates shows talent, but a complete and total lack of imagination. However, in some ways, he has his finger on the pulse of current themes. So I reluctantly award \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" Four Stars. Maybe somewhere, there are readers less jaded than myself, who will think this book has a value that can surpass what seems to me, to be its obvious banality."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"This one was a very enjoyable read. I have only given it three stars because the one thing that bothered me is that the added mystery - while enjoyable -- made me feel as if the author some how set up and then chickened out on the more adult, difficult aspects of the story - as if he was afraid that we would stop reading and just dismiss it as another coming out tale. Regardless, there is a lot of good stuff here and it is much better than a lot of the gay novels floating around now."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Having read Rainbow Boys, My father's scar, and Raibow high, i find that Leave myself behind for the gifter author bart yates is one of the exceptional narratives about coming out of age and a ver good debut for him. i love the book may be ill write the rest later because i gotta leave........"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I've lost count of how many times I've re-read this book or portions thereof. At one point or another, it has generated every emotion imaginable in me with the most noticable being empathy, delight and compassion. Noah is almost frighteningly wise and yet totally believable. J. D. is every young gay teenager; lost in fear, self-loathing, confusion, ambiquity, and redeemed by the amazing power of unconditional love. Read it and laugh and think and ache and cry and laugh again. I hope Mr. Yates is busy writing more."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I read it in one evening! It's a smart, sexy, emotional and funny exercise in modern teenage angst. I really can't say enough about how good this novel was. Bart Yates is a gifted writer and leaves the reader wanting more, more of his writing and more of his fascinating main character Noah York. Yates has created someone who is instantly likeable and a narrative that is no less than absorbing. There is a significant cross-over appeal with this story that will pull at the heart-strings and tickle the funny-bone of anyone who reads it, regardless of their sexual orientation."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Leave Myself Behind is a book that has many good qualities. It is well written and is a fast paced read. It tells the story of two young men coming to terms with their sexuality. The story is told through the point of view of Noah, a young man who embraces his individuality. His father recently passed away and Noah and his mother move to a small New Hampshire college town to begin a new life. Noah meets J.D., a neighbor, and a quirky friendship begins that develops into first love. The plot has a number of twists and turns, as the characters face many tragic and difficult events. Discussing the many of the details of the book in a review would be a disservice to a potential reader.Bart Yates is a gifted writer, and this novel is an impressive debut. The book's chief strength is the character of Noah. To the reader he is both complex and likeable, and the reader easily connects with this character. People in the novel are not quite sure what to make of Noah, which I believe makes him realistic. I am not certain if I believe that J.D. is developed well enough, but since the story is from the point of view of Noah, and the time span in the novel is relatively short (about four months), this give the novel a somewhat realistic flair. The flaws of the novel are the subplots, namely the events involving Noah and his mother Virginia and J.D. and his dysfunctional family. Too much is going on here and at times it is difficult to follow. Also, too much gets resolved in a short time.One bit of advice for the potential buyer-Do not expect the book to be true to the jacket summary. After reading the summary, I ordered the book expecting to read a book similar to A Boy's Own Story (Edmund White) or The Catcher in the Rye (Salinger).Though the book is of a simialir genre, I am not sure whether this book falls in the same category as far as greatness, though Bart Yates may write such a book in the future. While it is true that Noah is as honest as the main characters in these two great works, I am not certain he will have the same crossover appeal and universal recognition that readers both gay and straight find with the Salinger and White works. If I had purchased the book without reading the jacket flap, my expectations would have been different"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I join the couldn't-put-it-down club on this book. I read it in a gulp on a Saturday afternoon and evening when I should have been doing other things. The plot is compelling (although the wrap-up in the final chapters is a bit swift and tidy) and the voice of the narrator is astounding. The author has a rare ear for natural, plucky dialogue, and words in the mouth of Noah York -- a teenager with a boatload of problems -- are both hilarious and gut-wrenching.I highly recommend this book. It's an entertaining, insightful quick read that's a definite page-turner...just right for Saturday afternoons when a good excuse to avoid lawn duty is needed."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"More and more it seems so difficult to tell a coming of age story that hasn't been said the same way 1000 times before. While at moments, the \\"mysteries\\" in the story seem a bit drawn out, there is so much else worthwhile here. The characters are cookie-cutter types. The story keeps you guessing and interested. And the writing is great. Sure, the central figure seems a tad precocious but it lets him have wonderful lines."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"This is one of those books that I ended up staying up late for. You'll find yourself laughing, on the verge of a tear, and rooting for JD and Noah right to the end. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The only downside was that the whole jars-in-the-walls aspect was never very interesting to me and turned out to not really mean much. An effort was made to loosely tie it all together, but that whole angle could've easily been left out or at least better developed."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I think what makes a great writer is their ability to touch some emotions if not all of them. Bart Yates did just that. Yates causes me to hate, feel sad, and feel love. Love for J.D. and Noah, and out of that love comes Hope. Hope that someday the world will become a place where love like J.D. and Noahs can be allow to live and grow free as it should. Yates most importantly leaves the reader wanting more. Wanting answer to questions like, Will Virginia York remarry? Will J.D. and Noah go off to college together? Will J.D. become a concert pianist and Noah a famous artist? Or will they just buy a small two story building in a historic downtown area, open a gallery, and use the upper floor as living spaces and a studio?"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The characters were honest and sympathetic. I could not put this book down. I cannot wait to read more - please hurry Mr. Yates! This story has not left my mind since I read the last word of the final page. The love story is truly touching as is the relationship between the main character and his mother. I don't want to spoil the book by giving anything away. This book is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"A very well-written book that combines a coming of age tale with a mystery story."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"the best book i've read in ages, couldn't put it down. beautifully written, gripping, painfully honest. literate and sharp, smart and real... left me breathless, gave me hope. if you read just one book this year, make it LEAVE MYSELF BEHIND.

Noah and his mother has moved from Chicago to a small town in New Hampshire. The story is told as if Noah has a secret friend which he keeps talking to - like some small children who have ghost friends.The book is good for bedtime reading. We are not troubled by tons of details we have to remember to understand situations later in the story, and we are not troubled by his history except for rose bits about his farther. So you can always pick up the book, and continue reading without having to reread previous parts of it.The book excels at showing us the inability of some adults to take responsibility of their own problems and history --- to not just let other people pay for them. The adults idiosyncrasies is much more in focus than those of the teenagers. The teenagers are bleak, and their personality doesn't always seem coherent nor developing.The first part of the book is (as it most often is the case) definitely the best and the funniest and the most well thought out. It would have been interesting to change the narrator to the mother, as she from then on is the most colorful and active person. Noah becomes very passive in the story, and mostly lets things happen around him. (&quot;Where The Boys Are&quot; uses this trick to get an otherwise boring story to become rather interesting)."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Lots of secrets in this book, though Noah's is revealed early on. The strength of Yate's writing lies in the use of language even though it means he sometimes gives a more adult vocabulary to teenage Noah than you might expect, even if his mom and dad are academics. (How many 17 year olds know what a &quot;bromide&quot; is?&quot;) There is only one Catcher in the Rye, it's true, but Caulfield was not gay, and did not have to suffer the degree of physical and mental abuse experienced here. Being a teenager is hard. Being a closeted gay teenager is harder, and nearly impossible to understand unless you are gay. Yates's Noah does not have it easy, but does find understanding. If you read this book you might find it, too. Yate's great writing makes the experience worthwhile."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"This is a terrific book. The plot is not original -- gay guy slowly seduces another, they get exposed and tormented, etc., etc. But the quality of the writing is what separates this novel from all of the others. Bart Yates is a true talent who makes his characters not just likeable but loveable. Other reviews have focused on Noah, who is indeed unique, funny and irreverent. But I equally liked JD who I would happily have as a friend and more. The subplot about the house and the mysterious findings therein is eerily similar to Mark Roeder's \\"Keeper of Secrets\\" but Yates' writing is so far superior that this can be overlooked. Buy this book -- or buy two and give one to a friend -- in the hopes that there will be lots more to come from Bart Yates."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"The end actually was as wonderful as every great page of this book. Here's my sorrow: That I have the finished the book and don't have the pleasure to come of reading its pages before I go to bed. This is good writing, a good story and brave characters. It's at the level of Edmund White's early work. Read this book's reviews--it is that good. I await Bart Yates' future work."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"My biggest disappointment about this book is that it ended! So I picked it up and started it again. I grew so attached to the characters as if they were my own family and/or friends. It hit on all of my emotions. It was extremely amusing (lots of great one-liners); disturbing on several fronts (mental illness, gay bashing); very rewarding in seeing some characters come to terms with their issues and frustrating in seeing others continue to hide from theirs; enlightening in watching them grow in their self discoveries; mysterious when they were finding little tidbits of someone's past life; sensual in the love scenes between J.D. and Noah; fulfilling in seeing love conquering ignorance, hatred, and misconception. This story was incredible. I hope there are more to come."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Bart Yates' novel is a &quot;Coming of Age&quot; story. I say that for classification only. This novel deals with many of the standard coming out issues, but also many other issues that normally are not found in print. There have been a few criticisms about the language, but I hardly found it excessive and in fact some books I have read were quite offensive in that respect.I found the characters easy to get to know and in fact almost mesmorizing. Noah is engaging in an honest manner and there is an innocence to J.D. that just tugged at my heart. The only criticism I have, and this is my issue, is that the same or very similar circumstance has happened to three of the characters in this novel, which to say the least is highly unusual at best, but this is fiction and it doesn't have to remain in the true to life mold.I found the novel difficult to put down and I still find myself going back to certain sections to reread. I hope the author might consider a sequel to this novel. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"This is a coming of age novel. Noah is a seventeen year old who moves to a small town with his mum, Virginia. They both suffered the loss of Noah's dad - Virginia's husband- a year before, and this contributed to their decision to move.But the new beginning turns to be quite hard. Noah has to deal with admitting his sexuality, falling in love and getting outed and bullied. Virginia has to deal with dark secrets long buried which are now coming to the surface and threatening her sanity. And in the middle of everything, JD, Noah's love interest, brings his own personal and family drama.It's told in Noah's POV and he has a great voice and is really too clever for his own good! He is an AMAZING character. The relationship between Noah and his mother is as important as the relationship between Noah and JD, maybe more. There is some explicit sex but it's more tender/romantic than erotic.This is a gay contemporary fiction with romantic elements. However, the romantic elements are strong enough to satisfy a reader who is only looking for romance."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I really needed a book like this to read.

The mystery of what is buried in the house plus the blossoming romance between Noah &amp; J.D. made me want to keep going. Also, the writing is very, very funny even though it is a somber story. I found myself laughing out loud several times. The protagonist, Noah, is a lovable smart-ass dealing with a wacky mother, who is hiding a secret. There are many secrets in the book and their unfolding makes the book a page-turner.

Don't mean to get mushy, but some of the scenes between Noah &amp; JD just make my melt, that i literally dropped the book.i can't say enough about this book, but to just buy it. this coming from someone who is picky about what he reads and has the attention of a gnat, i can tell you that this book is a real page turner. you CAN'T put it down--even after you finish it."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I have never read a book in 5 hours before, but this book was so great, so captivating I could not put it down. The relationship with his mother is falling apart, but his relationship with J.D. is flourishing.

The two of them wind up in Oakland-not the famous city, some other Oakland, where Noah helps his mom restore the many-roomed house the two of them share. He's a smart, acidulous, sarcastic young buck with real issues about his sexuality. As the novel begins, he doesn't know if he's gay or not, but matters clear up when he falls violently in love with a classmate at the local high school, J.D., a straight jock with a steady girlfriend.The Yorks discover many Mason jars in the crevices behind the walls and ceilings of their house, and soon they are caught up in the maelstrom of history as both of them, but particularly the mother, flighty, impulsive Virginia York, grow more and more obsessed with the previous owners of the house to whom something mysterious happened way back in the early 1950s.Meanwhile J.D. isn't as straight as he seemed at first and before long Noah is taking JD in his mouth and then grappling with coming out issues. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel, and the story of Noah and J.D. brought me right back to the days when I was seventeen and intensely aware of how gorgeous some of the other guys in school were. When the story sticks with their attraction to each other, and its inevitable consequences in provincial \\"Oakland,\\" the narrative arc is streamlined and crackles with energy. When the book goes Gothic and Twin Peaks, it's not so good. It's one thing to have these weird Mason jars all over the house, but then to find out that one's own mother has her buried secret too, and then on top of that to find out one's boyfriend's mother has a secret which, at bottom, is only a variation on Mom's secret, why it all starts seeming \\"overdone.\\" Both secrets are easily discovered, laughably so, all Noah has to do is ask and two extremely unlikely informants spill everything in a way that would never happen in what we otherwise call; \\"real life.\\" But so great is the power of Bart Yates' writing that we hardly even notice these little improbabilities. He makes you believe in youth and he makes you believe in the power of starting over, and he makes you feel love."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Bart Yates, where have you been hiding? According to the book jacket blurb he is a teacher and a freelance musician. But somewhere along the line Bart Yates learned how to write extraordinarily well. His first novel LEAVE MYSELF BEHIND is not only well written, it is at once hilariously comic, disturbingly sad, achingly profound, and just plain good reading!Noah and his mother Virgina York (a poet) move to New Hampshire from the big city of Chicago when Noah's father has suddenly died. Once transplanted to New England, Noah slowly comes to grips with his sexuality, Virginia as slowly becomes crazed with the house they've purchased since it is the former dwelling of another woman poet and contains mysterious Mason Jars within the walls that unravel an entirely different (and equally entertaining) novel!, and the small town of Oakland, New Hampshire peels away secrets of gay bashing, incest, rape, alcoholism, insanity and any number of bizarre twists.The solid anchor of this book is the language and tone and insight of the narrator - Noah York - who at seventeen has a rich imagination, a wry outlook, a way of thinking and expressing himself that makes all the madness of the dysfunctional world fall into place for us, the readers. This could be called a gay novel, but though it very sensitively and sensuously relates the blossoming of love between Noah and the boy next door J.D. and then incorporates the reality check of being openly gay in a small town highschool, it is much more than that. This novel has many rich and surprising stories and comments on our world today and presents all of this information not in an offensively preachy manner, but in a way that reveals exactly how vulnerable and needy we ALL are when it comes to loving and being loved, being without love and groping for it.Some novels just get to you and this is one. Bart Yates, please write another and another. You have so much innate talent and gift for story telling that it is simply mind boggling! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED reading for just about everyone who loves good books."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Noah York is a 17-year-old Chicago guy who has moved with his widowed mother to a small town in New Hampshire. Superficially, he gets along fine with high school peers, but he is hardly a typical teenager. His mother is a nationally known poet. He has inherited her love of reading and her habit of living inwardly. He continually analyzes his motivations and those of others. Reviewers have compared his speech to that of Holden Caulfield, but that focuses too much on his casual teenage profanity and his tone of sarcasm, while ignoring a far greater self-awareness and sophistication of thought than Salinger's hero ever displayed. His often ironic detachment is directed not only at every person he meets, but toward his own motives and foibles as well. He has the talent, not too common among persons of any age, of despising people who bore or offend him, but in the same breath expressing an understanding for the forces that have caused those benighted souls to become the way they are.Do high school seniors really exist who possess Noah's sensitivities and self-awareness? Are there really kids his age who can immediately identify by title and author an isolated closing sentence that their teacher quotes from a Steinbeck novel? And who, when the teacher asks if they liked the novel, can comment casually that, although parts of it were weak and they found the narrative voice to be too 'chatty,' the quote itself was the 'coolest last line I ever read in any book'? If there are, I wish I'd had one or two of them for friends when I was that age.The book has been described as a gay love story, and the emerging relationship between Noah and J.D., his equally closeted teenaged neighbor, is touchingly portrayed. But the critical relationship of the book is the love-hate bond between Noah and his mother. Like any teenager, he is driven to distraction by the quirks and pretensions he sees in his mother's life. He also is frustrated by his inability to express his deep feelings of love for her, and is overwhelmed by her non-blinking acceptance of her only son's gay orientation and love for J.D.Virginia York's own celebrated life is haunted by memories of a trauma from her childhood. She and her son discover evidence, while renovating their newly-purchased New Hampshire house, of a parallel tragedy in the lives of its former inhabitants. Uncovering this evidence finally hurls Virginia into a psychotic state, and she is driven frantically to demolish the house from within in search of additional clues.Although there is horror hidden within the house, as well as in the past lives of the mothers of both Noah and J.D., and a violent episode of gay bashing that lands both Noah and J.D. in the hospital, the book is often extremely funny. The humor comes from Noah's ability to see life around him from a different, slightly skewed perspective, an ability inherited from his mother the poet. The mother's excessive attacks upon the structure of the house, as well as upon her own body, force for a time her involuntary hospitalization. When she asks her son later, somewhat shyly, if her behavior had really frightened him too much, Noah just shrugs: 'Remember Jack Nicholson in The Shining?'The renovation of the house is perhaps the central motif of the book. The first timid attacks on the flooring and wallboard eventually lead to the virtual demolition of the entire interior as increasingly chilling clues emerge from the walls and floors. A similar deconstruction occurs in the life of Virginia York, as discovery of these clues, one by one, and her increasingly unhinged response to them, allow us to peel away her layers of defenses and spot clues of the events buried in her own childhood. Noah learns with us the secret she has desperately hidden from everyone, including her husband and son, for her entire life.Noah mulls over the facts of his mother's life, and somewhat similar facts in the life of his boyfriend's mother. He suggests that what distinguishes people who never overcome early tragedy from those who do may be their refusal or inability to accept that the shameful or painful trauma has happened and is over, and to learn, as a result, to be open to others about their lives. Once Virginia's 'secret' is revealed and acknowledged, the first hopeful signs appear, suggesting that she may ultimately find peace and happiness for the first time since her husband died.The 'outing' of Noah and J.D., and of their romantic relationship, leads immediately to a physical attack on them by school bullies. In the long run, however, the bullies face criminal prosecution, and Noah and his friend find that some of their school 'friends' draw closer to them, in fact becoming true friends for the first time. As with Virginia, Noah and his friend first find peace with themselves and with their world when they accept a critical fact of their lives, that they are gay, and stop hiding it from others.The story is Noah's, and is told by him in the present tense. Much of the enjoyment in reading the book lies in dwelling for 244 pages within the mind of a bright, literate, funny, often confused, but always searching and analytical young man."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I devoured this book in one sitting. Funny, touching and relatable. The main character is a teenaged boy who discovers the realities of human frailty as well as his sexualtiy, love and the complications that being gay can bring. While he relies on his acidic humor and inate level headedness to hold himself together, his mother, boyfriend, boyfriends parents and a host of others are all losing it. Unlike so many other books that thoroughy entertain but dissapoint in the end, \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" delivers all the way through. Appropriatey titled, we see the main character, who you will certainly root for, grow into a strong, self assured young man whose future, even in the face of adversity is one that we can be satisfied with. I hope that Bart Yates will continue writing books of this caliber and soon!"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"The other reviewers who gave five stars have summarized the many strengths, both literary and emotional, of this novel. I would only like to reinforce what others said about the clarity and authenticity of the narrative voice - the writing transported me back to my teenage years. To readers: BUY THIS BOOK! To Mr. Yates: MORE - SOON - PLEASE!"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"This book was good quick read. It had an interesting plot line that had some interesting turns. However, the book ended too perfectly for me and seemed a bit forced to come out with a happy ending. The book seemed to come to an almost too perfect ending. However, it was still a good read and suggest it to anybody who enjoys this genre of books."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"This is a book one finishes in a short time because it is hard to put it down. It is written from the prospective of a teen aged boy. This is a boy of 17 going on 71. I have been put off by the covers of books with youthful faces. I expected such covers to be tales of the young for the young. Such is not the case with this book. What is young and what has been around for a while is not as easily parsed at first glance as one may think. I found much in this book that reminded me that one does not have to have many years pass before one is in the midst of the battle to be ones self and begins to pay the difference tax. The tension between a perceptive young person and those trying to bend his youth toward a model the youth never sought makes for an interesting thriller. Read it. I think you will like it."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Bart Yates writes a poignant and somewhat believable account of the Noah York, a seventeen-year-old high school student who falls in love with his neighbor, J.D. Noah's mother is a bucketful of dysfunction, but she must be as an accomplished poet. While she's at times permissive and at others psychotic, Noah must navigate the waters of his adolescence without losing his own sanity, or losing his life. Though Yates writes with style and insight, there are a few places where the boundaries of believability are stretched thin...yet, he manages to avoid stepping completely past those points and does so without coming across as schmaltzy or trite. It's been a long while since I've read a novel with a gay central character that hasn't covered the same ground that everyone else has. \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" is that break-through novel."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I don't know what it is about the way Yates writes - but I become obsessed with the characters and story and just hate putting the book down. I recently read Brothers Bishop and felt the same. Right now I feel sad because I finished the book and fear I will not find anything as engrossing any time soon. This is not a typical coming of age novel - the characters are well developed and the story is one that any reader would enjoy! Keep on writing Mr. Yates!"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"We have seen so many coming-out novels published in the past few years that one could say it's starting to be overdone, but this new novel about 17 year old Noah, is very effective and shows great originality. There are so many issues going on in the lives of these well-developed characters, that it takes a while to grasp it all, but you will, and it's quite a story from the beginning to end.Noah, a closeted gay teenager, is dealing with his father's death, his adjustment to living in rural New Hampshire after moving from urban Chicago, and his mother's growing madness as she discovers a terrible dark secret in the new house as she finds mason jar after mason jar between the walls filled with letters, poems, and other strange things while renovating the house. On top of all this, Noah's blossoming love for his new neighbor, J.D., a handsome 16 year-old, creates more issues as well. J.D. is living a horrific home life, with an alcoholic father and a bigoted mother. Yes, there's much, much more to this story. You'll have to discover the rest for yourself. Yates has the creative touch to explore all these issues, and many more not mentioned, and still bring it all together in the end.If you want an honest, intelligent, well-crafted story to read, this is the book for you. Yates is a fine writer, who has a great future ahead of him. This is a book to really get absorbed in, and forget the world around you for a while. Spend some time with these dysfunctional families, and your own life will take on a whole new light. Highly recommended!Joe Hanssen"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Whoever compared this book to Catcher in the Rye was right on the money. Bart Yate's Noah York, is witty, insightful, opinionated and wonderfully sarcastic. His narrative is never dull and the story unfolds with ease.I liked Noah immediately, and loved J.D just as much when he came on the scene. Both boys will pull at your heart strings with this riveting tale of coming of age in a world that won't accept you for who you are. Noah's grief over his father was poignant, it showed how hard it really is to lose someone you love and to have your life so drastically changed at the drop of the hat. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes a good story. Noah is definitely right up there with Holden Caufiield as a literary character not to be forgotten"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"Not since Joseph Olshan's \\"The Nightswimmer\\" have I been so totally and thoroughly engrossed in a gay fiction book.The protagonist in this novel, Noah York, clearly has the voice of the author's life experiences but with the comical and \\"reality bites\\" point-of-view of a 17-year old boy.At times funny, at times poignant, and even psychotic, this simple story about a boy and his mom and the twists and turns their lives take after the death of the father/husband is just plain beautiful. As Noah comes to terms with his father's death, his sexuality, his mother's mental illness and the intolerance of his peers, we are treated to his witty and highly insightful interpretations of what it means to be a human being in a complicated world.I cannot recommend this book highly enough - it's well-written, has deep and richly-drawn characters, and a main character that will keep you engaged as he goes on his journey of being a boy yet becoming a man. I'd give it 10 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"You might have read the other reviews \\"about\\" this book--the story of a 17-year-old gay man finding his way in the world. The story is extremely well constructed and the voice of the narrator is sheer perfection. I think this is better than Edmund White and even on a level of the breathtaking writing of Charles Frazier (\\"Cold Mountain\\"). The voice, the narrator of the novel, comes through crystal-clear.Case in point: the main character does not describe his looks until page 78. He doesn't reveal he's gay until several dozen pages in the book. The characters unfold so organically to the story that it all meshes beautifully. It's engrossing, involving, and poignant. Bart Yates is the type of writer whom I will follow--I will watch for his name and look for his books for years to come. His talent shines through and makes a premium novel."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"This is an incredibly engaging novel. Some may find the subject matter difficult; I found it refreshingly honest. Much like Mark Kendrick's \\"Desert Sons,\\" \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" is direct and realistic in exploring the highs and lows of young gay men coming to terms with their emotions and their sexuality while they're in the midst of surviving abuse within their dysfunctional families. Unlike \\"Running With Scissors,\\" which seeks to shock and sarcastically amuse in its account of adolescent turmoil, \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" never loses focus on finding ways to survive, heal, and even flourish in spite of the odds (not that there isn't any sarcasm coming from Noah, the narrator -- but he's not consumed by irony). I highly recommend this book to lovers of gay literature, mystery (yes, there's a mystery happening in here, too), and all who know what it's like to find yourself as a teenager who has to become their own parent when the biological parents don't do the job."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"What a great book. Excellent writer that really knows how to bring a character to life. This is probably one of the best books that I've read!! Bart Yates has found a reader for life!"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"This book was truly a great read. What struck me the most about this story was that the characters were your average, everyday person. They were not flamboyantly gay, nor were they overly masculine to the point of disbelief. They simply were who they were, and I felt that that particular feature mad this book stand out from the others that I have read in the past several years. And of course the sarcasm and out-there senses of humor simply added to the book. I couldn't put it down untill I finished, and even laughed out. A refreshing novel."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"The dust jacket swears that this is a debut novel for Bart Yates, but I've now read the book twice (in a couple of days) and I have trouble believing that so fine a piece of work is not the follow on to many previous works. The plot, characterization, dialogue, comedy, tragedy, pathos, fear, shock, etc., all point to maturity and insight by this author. The major characters (even the ones you're not supposed to like) are well developed and human. Beware: Noah will steal your heart and will not give it back. I ached to have the chance to raise a kid like Noah. I'm not sure that he and his boyfriend, J.D., are right enough with each other to make it work for a lifetime, but after all they go through together in this novel, I suspect that they build a strong enough relationship to give it a go. The romance between the boys is deeply touching: in one scene, Noah sits on his porch and sees J.D. coming toward him; the author's description of the reactions of both boys when J.D. sees his honey will take your breath away. The sex scenes are not graphic or gratuitous, but they are sufficient to contribute to the development of the plot. This is one of the best novels I've read in a long time and I look forward to more books from Yates. I DO wish he'd do a sequel to this one and show how the boys are getting along about 10-12 years in their futures. Strongly recommend for anyone into romance; see no reason why older teenagers wouldn't benefit from reading this one."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time. The narrator (Noah) had me cracking up throughout the whole book even when dealing with some very serious topics. He's a total smart ass and yet he knows, even at 17, that he doesn't know it all. That's what makes him so endearing. He talks in a way that made me feel like I was standing next to him rather than reading his narration. The development of the relationship between Noah and his neighbor (J.D.) was beautiful, innocent and very powerful. They are already in love by the time they have their first physically-intimate experience, which makes their love so innocent and real. Noah's mother is also a great character that gave me lots of laughs. Even when she throws a knife at her son's head, Noah finds the humor of the situation without minimizing how serious her actions were. I think that's a real talent to be able to make the reader laugh even during serious times, if that makes any sense. I wish I was a better reviewer so I could just make everyone read this book, it truly is excellent, beautiful, touching, and for me it was a real page turner. I think I'll miss Noah now that I've finished the book. In fact I think I've fallen in love with another fictional character - Damn!"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"There aren't that many books that I don't want to end. This is definitely one of them. Yates manages to make what is the bleedingly obvious to some (but certainly not the majority) into revelatory moments, with incisive writing about humanity with all its foibles.I know I will read this again, and will be telling all I know to read it too. They can get their own copies - mine is staying with me :-)Do not be mistaken. This is not 'Gay Fiction'. This is a book for everybody, male or female, gay or straight.I'm looking forward to reading The Brothers Bishop and The Distance Between Us. If they are anywhere near as good as this I will be a happy man."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I bought this book months ago, but I always delayed to read it since I had the idea that it was sad and difficult, and if I have to spend my mind in a book, at least I want in the end to be happy. But I was wrong... Oh yes, the book is difficult, almost tragic in some part, but it's not sad, and I'm very happy to have read it and I will recommend it to everyone who wants to end a book with a tender smile on his face. Mind you, the book has not a pink glasses perspective on the world, but it still has hope in it.Noah is a really good character, but he is not the only protagonist of this book: he shares the role with the other young boy J.D., but also with his mother Virginia, and in a way, also with Donna and Tom, J.D.'s parents. And so I would like to start my post speaking of Virginia: she is the classical strong woman who built a shield around her to not face a dramatic and long buried secret in her past. She managed to find a piece of serenity with her husband, probably a more simple and quite man than her, even less clever, but able to give her the stability she needed. Noah had never seen his parents in intimate behavior, but he felt the positive energy between them, he knew that his family was an haven from the world, a place where he could grow and be the man he wanted to be without fear of rejection. But that haven was destroyed when his father suddenly passed away, and the other plate who balanced his mother disappears.Now Virginia drags Noah to live in a small town, but it's not the cultural shock who Noah would expect. In a way, the small town way of life replace that safe haven, and the disorientation Noah would probably had in the city, is avoided with this moving in an old Victorian house that needs a lot of work to be inhabitable and in this way distracts Noah from his own problems. And another distraction arrives from J.D., the new neighbor a year young than Noah. It's strange, Noah is way too clever than J.D., and he is also older, but when J.D. enters the scene, he always takes the role of the leader, the one who always seems to be more aware and adult. Even with his parents J.D. has a way too adult behavior for his own age, he is comprehensive and respectful, even if they have obviously a lot of problem and if J.D. will continue to live with them will end in a very bad way.This is obviously a coming of age story, both of Noah and J.D., but in a way also of both their mothers, who need to make pacts with their past to not ruin the future of their son. But it's also a love story between Noah and J.D., and even if dealt with tenderness and the right dose of eroticism for a young adult book, it's nevertheless a very sweet and satisfying love story. It evolves in a way that maybe makes Noah and J.D. face some decisions before time, but it's right, since also in their personal life they are facing events that no one at that age should face: and since the world asks them to be adult, it's right that also in their sexual life they are adult."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"I don't know exactly what I was expecting from this novel, but it delivered a lot more than I was anticipating.From all the reviews comparing it to The Catcher In The Rye, I was expecting a classic, gay take on the bildungsroman. In a lot of ways, it's nothing like that, since I wouldn't say the main character discovers himself so much as discovers others around him. But that's not a bad thing.A lot of plot, which reads on paper like a Eugene O'Neill play, would almost be ludicrous if Yates didn't have such a keen ear for dialog and the ability to create likable characters."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"You gotta read Leave Myself Behind! This story is simply unforgettable and will be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone who has read other gay fiction novels.Bart Yates has created a main character that is like none I have ever experienced as a reader!

I had never heard anything about it, and I was a little apprehensive to drop the cash with nothing but the blurb on the back to assure me that it would be a good read. This afternoon I closed the book, and all I can say is, it was money well spent.Noah's character is achingly real. He narrates the book with a straight-forward talk and critical observations on life. His maturity is clear, but he remains a teenager none-the-less.The only thing that I would say is that I wish this book was not categorized as Gay Fiction. Not because it isn't an amazing story of a great gay romance, but because so many people will skip right over that section of the book store and never discover the mystery of the Mason jars or experience the love shared between J.D. and Noah."},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","review":"It's one of the best books i've ever read.

The main character, Noah, is a rather annoying young man who rather exemplifies the sort of crass and inappropriate nature of so many of today's youth (I know what you are all thinking, but I'm actually only 27; so these inconsiderate and often downright rude adolecents were, and unfortunately still are, my peers). Anyway, back to the book...There were several endearing qualities to Mr. Yates's writing style (some beautiful descriptions, some poignant prose, and several just plain hilarious &quot;zingers&quot;). There were also some moments when it felt like perhaps the main purpose of Noah was to be the voice to express some of the author's own unexpressed feelings and prejudices. Overall, an enjoyable read, but certainly no &quot;Catcher in the Rye!&quot;"},{"Title":"Flight of the Intruder","review":"Steven Coonts takes every would be fighter pilot on a ride not soon forgotten.

The structure of the novel encourages repeated reads; it's loop-like and suggestive, and yet pared down to the bare minimum prose-wise. Esther Allen's translation is good but she definitely does not have Paul Bowles' talent at wringing out both clarity and allusiveness from Rosa's texts; this is the only weak point in an otherwise excellent book. It won't be a big seller, but it should be. New Directions deserves credit for bringing more of Rosa's unique fiction to English-only audiences. Hopefully, more is on the way..."},{"Title":"The Good Cripple","review":"This sparsely written novella appears to be fairly straightforward on the surface. The indolent 20ish son of a wealthy Guatemalan is kidnapped and held ransom by a criminal gang. When his father doesn't pay up after they send a toe, they cut the son's foot off and send it to his girlfriend. The father pays up, but the gang's plan doesn't totally work out... The son is eventually released and spends the next decade moving around the world with his wife, seeking happiness. Then, one day, he sees one of his kidnapper/mutilators. Will he seek revenge or won't he?Rosa attempts to liven up this simple tale by tweaking the structure. The book begins with a 15 page &quot;Part One &quot; which itself starts with one of the kidnappers having just met with his victim some eleven years after the event. Chronologically, this should come at the end, and I'm not sure why Rosa swapped this around, other than to try and inject a little more tension into the narrative. Part Two starts with the kidnapping and proceeds from there to catch up to Part One. Which is not to say Rosa explains everything. A few important items go unexplained, for example, who is the lawyer in Part One? And did the father receive the toe or not?More importantly, what does it all mean? Is the victim's decision regarding revenge meant to have some larger meaning in the context of Guatemalan or Central American politics or society? If so, what is that meaning? Or perhaps his actions (or lack thereof) are in some way meant to be emblematic of Central American elites in general? The publishers imply a deep allegory at work in the book, but I'm still waiting to discover what it is. I should mention that I have little background knowledge of Guatemala or the region, which may explain my not getting it. Or maybe there's nothing to get... In any event, the writing is simple, sparse (or as the publisher would have it, &quot;muscular&quot;), and quite readable."},{"Title":"The Good Cripple","review":"This slim volume continues Rodrigo Rey Rosa's list of excellent works. He excells at exploring human nature, especially as embodied in Latin American men; he explores in spare language and direct plot. In The Good Cripple several threads weave in and out of focus in fascinating interplay. Who is more crippled by a kidnapping many years ago - the kidnapping victim who lost a foot or the kidnapper who lives in fear of discovery and gained nothing of the ransom money? Who is the least macho - the kidnapper who couldn't kill the hostage or the hostage who years later has no desire to kill the kidnapper? The plot circles in many aspects - travel, hotels, whores, children ... - and in those circles the reader becomes entranced at the laying open of human fragility (and ability to continue on). Equally telling is which relationships allow the expression of the fragility and which require a \\"brave front.\\"This is another volume that reaffirms my fondness for Rey Rosa."},{"Title":"The Life of Saint Paul","review":"Read this book in one setting after visiting St. Paul's Bassilica in Rome.

His popularity led him to compose a large body of instructional etudes and studies. As opposed to other composers of his time that also produced instructional material, Sor wrote first for musicality, second for instruction -- these pieces are therefore very approachable for the beginning guiarist, yet stand on their own musically.Because these pieces are musically interesting, several CD compilations containing the various Opuses in this book are available from online merchants; search for Fernando Sor and you are sure to find them with a bit of effort. For me at least, it is very valuable to be able to hear what a work sounds like before I sit down and try to learn it.Fingerings follow those recommended by Sor with some adjustments. In some cases, I have found need to alter the recommendations but overall the annotations are well-placed and very helpful.One of the best features of this compilation is that the book is spiral bound, it lays nice and flat on a music stand without need for clips to hold the pages down -- I wish all music books were published this way, it is so much easier to work with.I've been playing from this exact book for several years and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment. For a few years, it (along with Giuliani's Exercises) comprised the bulk of my classical music training under the supervision of a teacher."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Complete Sor Studies for Guitar","review":"Every time I open this book I get another rush of appreciation for Fernando Sor, and another glimpse of his brilliance. The man knew what he was doing. These \\"studies\\" do a wonderful job of developing competent classical guitar playing, but he also was a genius composer. These tunes are beautiful and many worth playing in recitals.No. 4 is a great study. The guitarist has to play in the key of C minor which has 3 flats to keep up with, plus the rhythmic challenge is superb. Again, Sor clearly knew what he was trying to accomplish with this piece. I love playing this piece myself just to keep my counting and flat-reading in condition. I don't necessarily think that this book progresses consistently from easy to more difficult pieces (imho), as some easier pieces come after some some rather difficult pieces. But nonetheless, this book is a treasure trove of delightful and very technically helpful, pieces. I teach classical guitar and will suggest this book to my students.All pieces are printed VERY clearly on quality paper, and are extremely well notated giving very good fingering suggestions. There is NO TAB so you will have to be able to read standard notation. The book is spiral bound so it easily stays open on the music stand - really love that!I use this book mainly to practice my sight-reading skills, but have found some jewels that I will commit to memory because they are so beautiful. I am very pleased with this book."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Complete Sor Studies for Guitar","review":"Grimes has complied an excellent and usable resource for classical guitarists.

Unlike other study books that concentrate on repeats of specific techniques, the study book incorporates studies that are melodic and classical and entertaining. It is a refreshing 'other' way to develop guitar skills. For the pure technical aspects that do not necessarily incorporate song style melodies, I also have Carcassi's complete methods for the guitar. It's good that I purchased them both together as I like to alternate between them during my practise sessions."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Complete Sor Studies for Guitar","review":"This is indeed a must have for classical guitar players.

As every classical guitarist knows, Sor was one of the greatest composers of music for the guitar. Even his simple etudes (the ones I can actually play) are both fun and interesting to play as well as for others to listen to, and each one contains valuable, practical, guitaristic challenges for the aspiring beginner.My only complaint about this book and it is a serious one, is that it should have spiral binding. I'll probably go somewhere and have it done as it absolutely won't stay open unless other books hold down the edges of the pages.So, it's 5 stars for Sor, 2 stars for the lack of spiral binding, and I guess that makes 4 stars."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Complete Sor Studies for Guitar","review":"I purchased this book when I started to casually learn the guitar. I play the viola, so I have a basic knowledge of how string instruments work, which certainly helped me when navigating through these studies.I worked a little out of a mel bay book to learn the basic fingerings in first position and all that stuff, then i started working out of this book and found it really fun and useful.One thing I love about this book is that from the very first etude, you are playing real, beautiful music. No boring studies or \\"hot cross buns\\" type pieces that are frequently found in beginning books. The studies are ordered from easiest to hardest, so each piece added a little more challenge than the last. I haven't worked through the whole book yet (which would take years to master), but I've made my way through the first several pieces w/ relative ease. I was surprised that I could actually play some of these pieces so easily! I think that the way they are ordered makes it really easy to make small technical improvements. Next thing you know, you're actually playing beautiful classical guitar pieces, and it doesn't seem daunting at all!The book gives fingering numbers for the left hand, which helped w/ shifting and knowing what position to be in. The only thing that was harder for me was that there are no right hand fingering numbers (although with a little common sense and basic knowledge of right hand principles, you can do pretty well without much assistance). Luckily for me, my dad is a classical guitarist, so I had a (mostly) willing helper at my disposal.Because of the progressive sequencing of these pieces and the fact that they have a high degree of musical merit, these pieces are a real joy to learn and practice. If you've never touched a guitar before, you should start in a more basic book (Mel Bay books are good). Once you've got a basic understand of how the guitar is played, this book is a great place to explore and increase your technique and have fun in the process!"},{"Title":"Mel Bay Complete Sor Studies for Guitar","review":"This compilation is organized by Opus and provides a complete set of the Sor studies. It is easy to navigate if you are familiar with the organization of these works or read Grimes' brief introduction. The spiral binding is a huge asset missing in so many music books.

However, to Guillim, this was based on hard evidence -- very much a modern stance on such topics.The book was being revised and published up to 100 years after Guillim's death. Later editions have many more sections and illustrations.

Unfortunately, I am not one of those people.The story is about Phaedra and Zephir. She is an heiress who will inherit land passed on by her father when she turns 20. Zephir is a man who wants part of her land because - while trespassing on her land - discovers gold in \\"them thar hills\\". The twist is that her three cousins will get the land if she is not on the island when she turns 20. So they make a deal with Zephir that - along with that small piece of land - he must take Phaedra off the island practically selling her to him and - he agrees! I don't know about you my fellow Hopeful Romantics but that sure doesn't sound like love to me!I guess the parts that bothered me were - besides its predictability - she doesn't get upset or truly acknowledge the fact that Zephir was just as guilty as her cousins. And, with all her fierce independence Zephir seems to only \\"humor\\" her. Also, Phaedra and Zephir were to \\"perfect\\" in appearance and personalilty. I was surprised that dirt would dare touch them and the flowing hair thing - hers and his - got a bit old. The bad guys weren't very bad and the voodoo thing seemed like a last minute thing to through in. I wish the writer would have made Phaedra a bit older then maybe I'd have been able to believe that a woman would have been able to handle the fact that she'd been kidnapped and taken to a far off land better.There were some good things about the book. Even with all I've written, there were times when I felt they truly loved one another. The love scenes were enticing though sometimes they seem to happen at the strangest times and there were parts that kept me intrigued. I liked some of the side characters and wish they could have been better developed.If you like the \\"he-man\\" type then you will enjoy this book.

The book uses algebraic geometry of curves throughout, instead of using the so-called 'Lefschetz principle' as done in older texts like Serge Lang's. Using general theorems of algebraic geometry instead of explicit polynomial calculation simplifies discussion, and at the same time paved the way for the reader towards the higher dimensional version of elliptic curves --- abelian varieties, whose geometry and arithmetic predate much of modern number theory research.After preliminary chapters on the underlying geometry of elliptic curves, the book take up its main aim -- proving the Mordell-Weil theorem, in chapter 8. The Mordell-Weil theorem states that the group of rational points over a number field is finitely generated, and finding the rank of this finitely generated abelian group effectively is subject to much current research (c.f. the Birch Swinnerton-dyer conjecture).The proof of Mordell-Weil theorem in this book is standard: one first establishes the weak version: E(F)/m E(F) for any integer m &gt;1 , is a finite group. To prove this one has to know basic algebraic number theory, Kummer theory, and some Galois cohomology. For those who are not familiar with Galos cohomology, the author has provided an appendix on Galois cohomology, which should contain all that 's needed.To deduce the full Mordell-Weil from the weak one, one establishes an important device: the theory of heights on elliptic curves. The height of a point is roughly a kind of norm, which measures the arithmetic complexity of the point (i.e. set of rational points with height bounded is finite) . The height function come with a whole family, but there's a canonical one , the so-called Neron-Tate height, which actually is a quadratic form on the algebraic points of the elliptic curve. After establishing the property of this height, one nearly trivially deduce that the rational points must be finitely generated.The heights on elliptic curves and abelian varieties contain lots of (conjectured) information about the arithmetic of the varieties. One readily realise this when one look at the BSD conjecture, the Gross-Zagier formula, and various Diophantine approximation type conjecture (e.g. Vojta's) .Therefore it's worth spending time to study the theory of height. Unfortunately the author develop just that amount of theory to prove the Mordell-Weil theorem. For those who want furhter information , one can look at the book &quot;Introduction to Diophantine Geometry&quot; by M. Hindry and Silverman. But to really go to the heart of the matter, one must learn the intrinsic formulation of height by Arakelov (so-called Arakelov theory), as witnessed in Faltings' work on this subject.The Final two chapters are: Chapter 9 on integral points, Chapter 10 on computation of the weak Mordell-Weil group. Superficially, these 2 chapters are of completely different style: the theory of integral points employ classical Diophantine approximation technique, such as Roth's theorem and Baker's transcendence theory; while the theory of rational points (i.e. the structure of the Mordell-Weil group) employs the theoy of principal homogeneous space, Galois cohomology to measure failure of Hasse's principle, etc. As J. Tate had remarked in a 1974 article 'The theory of integral points on elliptic curves involves completely diffrent concepts (from rational points) and that we mention it only in passing...'. The situation now changed completely. The classical style of Diopahntine approximation, is employed by Vojta, Faltings, Bombieri to prove even stronger version of Mordell conjecture, which is about finitebess of rational points! The proof is much more elementary when compared to Falting's original proof. One can look at the book 'Diophantine approximation and abelian varieties' by Edihoxen and Everste for an introduction to this revival of the subject.But now back to this book written in 1986, the most importanr result of chapter 9 is Siegel 's theorem: finiteness of integral points on hyperelliptic curves, with application to the establishment of the Shafarevich conjecture of elliptic curves: finiteness of isomorphism class of elliptic curves with good reduction outside finite set of primes. (Note: the general Shafarevich conjecture lies at the heart of Faltings' original proof of the Mordell conjecture!). While Chapter 10 is an introduction to the Galois cohomology methos of calculating the weak Mordell -Weil group. Both theories and numerical examples are richly presented. In particular the important Selmer groups and Tate-Shafarevich group are introduced.Finding the 'size' of these two groups is subject to much current research. For example, bounding the size of a certain Selmer group lies at the heart of Wiles' proof of the semistable case of Shimura-Taniyama conjecture( hence Fermat). This is indeed a very rich subject. For further information, one must studt further Galois chomology, arithmetic duality, Iwasawa theory, and finally Euler system.Overall, I think this book will appeal to anyone who want to know how to apply algebriac geometry to study Diophantine problems."},{"Title":"The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves (Graduate Texts in Mathematics) (v. 106)","review":"The theory of elliptic curves has to rank as one of the most fascinating fields in all of mathematics. Being around for almost two centuries, elliptic curves are finding myriads of applications, including cryptography, superstring theory, and computer imaging. The author does a brilliant job of organizing and explaining the theory in this book. Although the book requires a thorough understanding of algebraic geometry and modern algebra, the book is packed full of insights without sacrificing mathematical rigor. This is rare in most textbooks on modern mathematics. Numerous exercises exist at the end of each chapter, which allow readers to test their understanding of the subject as well as giving extensions to the main results in the text. The author reserves the cases of elliptic curves in characteristics 2 and 3 to the appendix. This may be disappointing for those reading the book for cryptographic applications of elliptic curves, but it does prepare one for further reading on the subject. By far the best chapter in the book is Chapter 10 on computing the Mordell-Weil group as the author does a nice job of detailing the relevant constructions. This book is well worth the time and effort required to study, and could serve well in an actual class on the subject. The author does have a follow-up book called \\"Advanced Topics in the Theory of Elliptic Curves\\" for those who need further stimulation in this intriguing and important field of mathematics.Addendum to review, Dec 12, 2009:The second edition of this book respects the same quality as the first.The new chapter on the algorithmic aspects of elliptic curves reflects the importance of elliptic curve cryptography since the appearance of the first edition and can be viewed as a warm-up for the study of cryptography over general Abelian varieties and for a study of group schemes. The author mentions group schemes when he discusses Lenstra's algorithm for elliptic curve factorization: the need for elliptic curves over rings Z/NZ when N is composite, and in the case of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem where there is a need for an \\"elliptic scheme\\", i.e. an elliptic curve over Z/p^2Z, where p is prime and greater than or equal to 3. The reader will get a taste of one of the algorithms for computing the Weil pairing and its generalization the Tate-Lichtenbaum pairing. By some specialists in cryptography, the latter is considered to be a pairing that makes up for the deficiencies in the Weil pairing, namely that the Weil pairing is skew-symmetric. The author proves the nondegeneracy of the Tate-Litchtenbaum pairing in this chapter. Both the Weyl and Tate-Litchtenbaum pairings can be viewed in the more abstract, general framework of arithmetic duality theory and arithmetic geometry if one is willing to learn the appropriate techniques from Galois cohomology. In this framework the Tate-Litchtenbaum pairing for a (principally polarized) Abelian variety relates its Mordell-Weil group, its first cohomology group, and its Brauer group. For the author the value of the Tate-Litchtenbaum pairing over the Weil pairing is that the Miller algorithm for the Tate-Litchtenbaum pairing is twice as efficient as the Weil pairing. Included also in this chapter is a brief discussion of elliptic divisibility sequences (but delegated to the exercises), and references are given for their generalization in what are now called \\"elliptic nets\\", the latter of which is a recent development, and so it remains to be seen how much impact it will have on the computation of pairings."},{"Title":"The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves (Graduate Texts in Mathematics) (v. 106)","review":"This is a superbly written introduction to elliptic curves. I like the straight-forward language. I dread the stiff elaborations, one finds in some german books with awkward idioms etc..I found it fascinating, how the elements of general theory, explicit formulae and geometric ideas (the group law on an elliptic curve is constructed via means of geometry) are interwoven.However, if you want to get a glimpse of such fundamental theorems like the Mordell-Weil theorem, you will need a solid understanding of the basics of algebraic number theory.Also, if the author tells you \\"it is clear\\", it may take you two or three pages of your own thoughts and scribblings to actually see, why it is \\"clear\\". Sometimes it really is clear, but sometimes he might be referring to basic results from algebraic number theory. For example in VIII.$1 Proposition 1.6, a field is constructed, which is unramified outside a certain set of places of the number field K. The notion \\"It is clear .... is unramified if and only if ord_v(a) = 0 ...\\" had me puzzled for a while, until it dawned on me, that I needed a certain separability criterium for the polynomial to show what was needed.All in all, still a great book."},{"Title":"Hunting for Sustainability in Tropical Forests","review":"This book examines the potential for sustainable hunting in tropical rainforests. It's an important question, since these forests face the threat of being cut down, their wildlife hunting out of existence, and their people turned into urban slum-dwellers. Though the editors give it the old college try, however, this book doesn't really succeed in telling us how to improve the prospects for sustainable hunting in such cases, to say nothing of dealing with the external threats such as deforestation, global warming, and urbanization and industrialization.The introduction is really very good, and usefully explores the key question of sustainable hunting. The authors are very careful to think about analytical categories and definitions, and they make a strong case that we need to consider the social context of hunting: traditional hunting versus hunting with modern technology, sport hunting versus hunting out of necessity, and subsistence hunting versus commercial hunting.The conclusion, also written by the editors, also makes a very helpful contribution. The core of the conclusion summarizes in about 50 points the main conclusions of the contributors. These are organized by categories such as the social-cultural, institutional, and economic influences on sustainable hunting in tropical forests.Unfortunately, what makes the conclusion helpful is what weakens the book as a whole. It lacks a strong analytical framework or theory, which forces the authors to cobble everything together at the end. It consists overwhelmingly of single cases, with no apparent attention to case selection issues. The authors of each chapter give no evidence of having read the other chapters, even those on the same topic. The editors work valiantly to summarize the findings, but these are pure summaries of facts not attempts to bring them together and make sense of the patterns.The book also does not make many concessions to other scholars who don't do the same kind of work, whether biological or economic modeling for example. The book is very ethnographic and anthropological in its sensibility, even in those chapters written by biologists. In addition, most of the chapters are not very policy oriented, despite the apparent focus of the book. (In fairness, some studies of the Congo explicitly consider possible policy responses, as do a few other chapters.)In sum, I was impressed by the editors' written contributions but it's evident that they were unable to whip their contributors into shape. There are a *lot* of contributors - - 1000 pages spread among 25 chapters - - so that makes much of the book a long slog in details about this or that forest scattered around the world."},{"Title":"Hunting for Sustainability in Tropical Forests","review":"For anyone interested in wildlife conservation and habitat destruction - this book is a must read!

Author Jim Makula's manual for sales trainers demonstrates an accurate, complete understanding of the sales process and the sales professional's mindset. His training manual comes with sample class agendas, worksheets, training exercises and even an enclosed CD with Power Point slides. Although it is not especially strong on training people to overcome objections or close sales, the practical advice it offers particularly on attitude and networking is otherwise dead-on. We recommend this book to every sales trainer. It won't transform your staff into Brian Tracy and Zig Ziglar clones, but it will help you create a more professional, skilled sales force. And that should be worth a lot to your firm's bottom line."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"I encourage you to buy and read this book. It's a source of reason, enlightenment, passion, love. It's meaningful, revealing. I read it in a few days, subtracting time to my other activities. Each time it has been difficult to stop reading and close the book. If you are going to read only one book this year, choose this one.This book is focused on a few, fundamental, issues (excerpts are between \\"quotation marks\\").1 - It explains that advertising works. Most people think they are not influenced by advertising. But advertising works best precisely because people don't think it works on them.\\"If you are like most people, you think that advertising has no influence on you. This is what advertisers want you to believe. But, if that were true, why would companies spend over $200 billion a year on advertising? Why would they be willing to spend over $250,000 to produce an average television commercial and another $250,000 to air it? If they want to broadcast their commercial during the Super Bowl, they will gladly spend over a million dollars to produce it and over one and a half million to air it. After all, they might have the kind of success that Victoria's Secret did during the 1999 Super Bowl. When they paraded bra-and-panty-clad models across TV screens for a mere thirty seconds, one million people turned away from the game to log on to the Website promoted in the ad. No influence?\\"2 - It makes you understand that the message mass media and advertising repeat us moment by moment (\\"The average American is exposed to at least three thousand ads every day\\") is that happiness comes from products. Alas, products are only things: no matter how much we love them, they won't love us back. By the way, didn't you ask why - in the car commercials - there are all those cars entering tunnels?We are sold models impossible to follow - and just wrong. But effortlessly advertised: you are made up to think they're true. Thus, a sense of strain comes. I think that many problems our society faces (high divorce rate, violence, alcoholism, drugs) come from this split. I'm a pharmacist: it's amazing how many tranquilizers I sell every day.3 - It lets you to realize that advertising often turns people into objects.\\"It is becoming clearer that this objectification has consequences, one of which is the effect that it has on sexuality and desire. Sex in advertising and the media is often criticized from a puritanical perspective - there's too much of it, it's too blatant, it will encourage kids to be promiscuous, and so forth. But sex in advertising has far more to do with trivializing sex than promoting it, with narcissism than with promiscuity, with consuming than with connecting. The problem is not that it is sinful, but that it is synthetic and cynical. (...) We never see eroticized images of older people, imperfect people, people with disabilities. The gods have sex, the rest of us watch - and judge our own imperfect sex lives against the fantasy of constant desire and sexual fulfilment portrayed in the media. (...) We can never measure up. Inevitably, this affects our self-images and radically distorts reality. \\"You have the right to remain sexy\\", says an ad featuring a beautiful young woman, her legs spread wide, but the subtext is \\"only if you look like this\\". And she is an object - available, exposed, essentially passive. She has the right to remain sexy, but not the right to be actively sexual.\\"4 - Did you know that we are a product? Mass media sell us to advertisers.\\"Make no mistake: The primary purpose of the mass media is to sell audiences to advertisers. We are the product. Although people are much more sophisticated about advertising now than even a few years ago, most are still shocked to learn this.\\"\\"Through focus groups and depth interviews, psychological researchers can zero in on very specific target audiences - and their leaders. \\"Buy this 24-year-old and get all his friends absolutely free\\", proclaims an ad for MTV directed to advertisers. MTV presents itself publicly as a place for rebels and nonconformists. Behind the scenes, however, it tells potential advertisers that its viewers are lemmings who will buy whatever they are told to buy.\\"5 - I think this book is also valuable because it re-states the ethical principle that there are no shortcuts to riches, no shortcuts to happiness. There are no free lunches.\\"Today the promise is that we can change our lives instantly, effortlessly - by winning the lottery, selecting the right mutual fund, having a fashion makeover, losing weight, having tighter abs, buying the right car or soft drink. It is this belief that such transformation is possible that drives us to keep dieting, to buy more stuff, to read fashion magazines that give us the same information over and over again.\\""},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"I loved this book when it was originally published at Deadly Persuasion.

It is fascinating to watch her meticulous, brilliant, even-handed exploration into the world of advertising. Her cogent remarks on the psychology of advertising bring a rare glimpse into previously unchartered waters. Having been a long-time fan of her films, it was also a distinct pleasure to read about her own personal and professional development in the first chapter as it was affected by the products advertisers insist we need to be fulfilled. Those interested in psychology, sociology, communication/cultural studies, and feminism should ensure this book is read and kept forefront on the bookshelf. It would be ideal as a college text as well."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":".In our culture of product placements, \\"ambient\\" advertising (ie sticker ads on fruit peels, cars wrapped in company logos) and \\"tie ins\\" between just about every form of entertainment and commerce, this book does an amazing job of looking at how commercial forces shape definitions of 'normal', 'beautiful' etc.I found Can't Buy My Love (which is written by Jean Kilbourne, NOT Mary Pipher) packed with interesting, relevant, easy-to-digest content that was both fascinating (companies spend over a half a million dollars to produce commercials aired during the Superbowl?!) and maddening (the real reason some companies seem suddenly to support a minority group, ie teens, the gay community etc, is that they seem them as an emerging market)--but I guess the maddening part is good because it lays bare how the media operate and how we're subjected to their sophisticated selling strategies whether we want to be or not .I had no idea how much I *didn't* know about media and marketing until I read this book.... and having read some of the other titles mentioned by other reviewes, I think Kilbourne's book does a superior job explaining how the media (and manufacturers who hire them) affect nearly every aspect of our daily lives...and what we can do about it.."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"Fantastic analysis and documentation. Proves that just like the empty slogans of \\"freedom\\" and \\"justice\\", in so called \\"advanced societies\\", woman's liberation is reduced to a slogan to sell products and held subservient to the economic aims of the \\"sellers\\" of such liberation. Exposes the ulterior motives of the corporate elite and their advertising propaganda network and the false consciousness they produce to control women and people around the world- the connections and extensions can easily be worked out by all thinking readers.

I was shocked to learn that America is one of the few countries to allow advertising directed at kids and after reading this book, I know why it is outlawed in most places. Throughout this well developed and researched book, I found myself shocked and stunned -- and that's not easy to do to me.Everyone should take a look at this book. The insidious nature of advertising is made apparent and if you think you aren't impacted by advertising then you truly should read this book. Fascinating and frightening."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"Can't Buy My Love is an extraordinary book, insightful, critical, and without a doubt, an eye-opener. This book should be required reading by all Americans! Personally, it has played a pivotal role in my life. I would say I'm your average American citizen. I grew up in New York, immersed in the typical American culture. I watched plenty of television and movies and thus was exposed to an endless array of advertisements. As most people, I didn't think that my thoughts and actions were influenced by these advertisements. But after reading this book, I clearly saw how the messages and images of the media had a huge impact in my life. Until I read this book, I was sort of unconscious of this influence. I just went shopping as though it was a ritual and followed the mainstream culture. I went out drinking and pretended to have a good time while engaged in superficial conversations in loud smoky bars. Essentially, this book brought me to many realizations and my mentality started to shift for the better. I started to see things for what they are. Jean Kilbourne does an excellent job of analyzing numerous ads and clearly demonstrates the manipulation and false promises imbedded within these cleverly designed ads. Corporations spend millions of dollars on advertising and psychological research. As the targets of these ads, we as citizens need to be critical thinkers and media literate. In this day and age, we need to have an understanding of how the media industry works and in particular, the advertising industry, which constantly bombards us with messages on how we should live our lives and what is considered \\"normal.\\" I highly, highly recommend this book. It's clear, concise, understandable, and will definitely have a positive impact in your life. I especially recommend this book to teenagers, who unfortunately have become the victims of massive amounts of advertisements. Profit-driven corporations have taken advantage of young impressionable minds and for that reason, I urge you to pick up a copy of this book for yourself and someone you care about! This one book was able to jump start a transformation in my life. I promise you won't regret reading it!"},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"There is no greater expert on the subject of how aggressive marketing can degrade the quality of a culture than Jean Kilbourne. As a writer, filmmaker, and internationally recognized expert on advertising, addiction, and women's issues, it has been estimated that she has given lectures at roughly half the universities and colleges in the U.S. Her unique talent is her ability to see and expose the underlying strategies and tools employed by purveyors of all manner of goods to persuade us--methods that seem all the more shocking when we actually see them. Her book Deadly Persuasion, which has also been published under the title Can't Buy My Love, is a fascinating study of the power of the ubiquitous ads that surround us in our every waking moment.(Before I go on, I'll point out that to oppose the manner in which much modern advertising is performed is not to oppose a healthy capitalistic economy, a system that quite clearly has worked better than any other. This is not a diatribe against the availability of every imaginable trifle, or the competition amongst companies to market a more useful product. It is rather about certain methods that advertisers continue to use that have, Kilbourne asserts, a negative effect on the way we interact and the way we view ourselves, others, and material goods. It is about devaluing the currency of genuine human contact.)The book considers advertisements in magazines as television, and considers a number of different kinds of campaigns in dedicated chapters. There are individual discussions on alcohol marketing, the auto industry, food, tobacco, and the exploitation of human relationships.\\"Advertising encourages us not only to objectify each other but also to feel that our most significant relationships are with the products we buy.\\" Kilbourne states in her introduction. \\"Although we like to think of advertising as unimportant, it is in fact the most important aspect of the mass media. It is the point.\\" She goes on to show how a key goal is to make us insecure about our present lives, for example, as is done in the ubiquitous women's magazines that juxtapose images of cheesecakes or pies on the cover with articles on weight loss tips and images of skinny models inside. After all, \\"people who feel empty make great consumers.\\"\\"Advertising... twists the notion that we can recreate ourselves - not through dedicated work, but merely by purchasing the right product... [It] often sells a great deal more than products. It sells values, images, and concepts of love and sexuality, romance, success, and perhaps most important, normalcy... we are surrounded by hundred, thousands of messages every day that link our deepest emotions to products, that objectify people and trivialize our most heartfelt moments and relationships.\\"To give some examples of the objectification she cites, I'll just mention the commodity that receives perhaps the most lavish attention from Madison Avenue: the automobile. Kilbourne devotes an early chapter to the subject of car advertising (Can an engine pump the valves in your heart?), and through a series of oddly similar examples, shows how many ad campaigns aim to humanize their machines: \\"Rekindle the romance\\"; \\"If anyone should ask, go ahead and show them your pride and joy\\" (this under a picture of a wallet showing two photographs - one of a couple of children and the family dog, the other a Honda); \\"We don't sell cars, we merely facilitate love connections\\"; \\"Stylish, responsive, fun-if it were a man you'd marry it\\"; \\"Drive the new Paseo, fall in love\\"; \\"She loves her new Mustang. Oh, and whatshisname too\\"; \\"A change from you high-maintenance relationship\\"; \\"It's not a car, its an aphrodesiac\\"; \\"What makes you happy? Is it the sparkle in a lover's smile? Or the warmth of a goodnight kiss? But could it be a car?\\";\\"While some cars can hug the road, very few can actually seduce it.\\" And so on. Kilbourne does more than list these and countless other examples: she deconstructs them and their implications.Another troubling issue that the book addresses is the pernicious effect of advertising that is directly aimed at children. This is even more troubling in light of studies that show that young children don't differentiate between the shows and the advertisements. The chapter on children led me to wonder how much of our national drug-abuse problem among teens is stoked by the way advertising is generally presented. While certainly the causes are many and varied, I think about my own typical childhood, growing up with hours of television every day. And the ads are still relentlessly telling us that purchasing a product makes wonderful things happen: a man opens a soda and a marching band explodes out of his TV into his room; the interior of an SUV becomes a landscape with waterfalls; wearing the right brand of jeans causes your world to shift into a nighttime city scene where a lovely brunette looks at you longingly. It seems quite rare anymore to see to a commercial anymore where use of a produce does not result in some kind of supernatural effect. Perhaps in the process of growing up, when we come to realize that the implicit, fantastical promises of the ads are not true - perhaps this adds to the appeal of drugs that can help make the world seem as magical as we thought it would be?In short, if you've ever wondered how advertisers try to manipulate us, and what the consequences of the onslaught of false promises might be, I highly recommend Kilbourne's fascinating book. You will not look at your TV the same again, and you'll likely come to agree with the author's observation that \\"advertising and religion share a belief in transformation and transcendance... [but] in the world of advertising, enlightenment is achieved instantly by buying material goods.\\" And that although one may \\"love\\" their possessions, they cannot love one back."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"Kilbourne writes about the psychology of mass marketing, which is something she detests and refuses to let go of. Her remarks are often cloyingly accurate--that mass marketing turns people in addicts, disconnects people from genuine and authentic feeling, substitutes objects for people, turns people into objects, and values consumerism above community. Given that mass advertising is the water that we fishies swim in (nearly a zillion ads by the time we are ten years old), it's a pretty depressing and gives me a quasi-paranoid headache.In contrast to another reviewer, however, I did not think Kilbourne was in the least bit funny. Angry--and she has enough to be angry about, every day, ranging from TV to magazines--but no, not funny.Nevertheless, she writes very well and convincingly. This bitter pill gets 4*'s."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"I bought this book for part of a book club reading list. And to be honest I just never really got behind the authors argument. In my opinion she was a bit over zealous about the great evils and impact of advertising, and she was never really able to convince me (the reader) to side with her opinion. Instead I just thought she was over-reacting and that she didn't have enough research/data to support her arguments. But then again I was reading this as part of a book club and even from the beginning this topic was never really in my area of interest so I may have been tougher on it then someone more interested in the perils of advertising."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"Jean Kilbourne has a great premise for \\"Can't Buy My Love\\": that corporations and the media use advertising to manipulate our emotions. And, throughout the book, she makes several insightful points about this phenomenon. However, Kilbourne's personal agenda, lack of self-awareness, humorless writing, and faulty interpretations quickly negate any good this book could do.Kilbourne obviously has personal issues with cigarettes, alcohol, and sex/relationships. Unfortunately, she allows her subjectivity to color her writing, making \\"Can't Buy My Love\\" less thoughtful analysis and more personal diatribe. Kilbourne comes across as bitter, vindictive, and--most importantly in a book of this type--more full of opinions than of facts and research.Many of Kilbourne's interpretations of various advertisements are faulty; she likes to \\"reach\\" with her interpretations, and in several cases, it's obvious that she has completely misread. Even more damaging to her case, Kilbourne rarely supports her own interpretations with any sources or even with any true commentary. Rather, she shows a picture of an ad and offers only a paragraph or two of her own interpretation before moving on. The book often feels unorganized and disconnected, especially when Kilbourne inserts a rant that is only vaguely related to the ads she's discussing--or even to advertising itself.What really destroys the book, in my opinion, is Kilbourne's almost complete lack of humor. She doesn't recognize obvious humor or satire in certain advertisements, and she rarely lightens her vitriolic tone. She comes across as bitter, angry, and a little insane.I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants an academic look at how advertising affects our emotions and behavior. Rather, you should read Stephen Kline's \\"Social Communication in Advertising: Persons, Products, and Images of Well-Being\\" or Judith Williamson's \\"Decoding Advertisements.\\""},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"Advertising affects everyone whether they realize it or not. Each people are being exposed to thousands of ads. Writer Jean Kilbourne is a perfect example. Like Jean Kilbourne, and millions like her have become so used to ads they've learned to cope with different advertisement strategies. This leads to the obsession with material objects and the desire to have them. Businesses don't care about the consumer; they only care about consumption and how it can be increased. This book will change your whole perspective on advertising and how you choose to let it affect you.Jean Kilbourne shares her experiences in growing up and going along with the trends, staying with the flock trying to make other people happy. Jean Kilbourne used bad habits, forced upon by her by ads, as liberators to dull her pain and sorrow. She then realizes what advertising has done to her, and what the affects are on America's Youth. Ads put enormous pressure on teens to look like models, party, smoke, and to be as artificial as possible. This book portrays the dangers to exposure of advertising in America's culture. This is centered solely on the need of material possessions and the manipulation for desire of unpractical belongings.Jean Kilboune examines the fact that advertising exploits sex to sell products. She also discusses that \\"romance and rebellion are the two main themes in car ads.\\" She then ventures into the controversy of \\"falling in love with food,\\" Which talks about how food is consumed in comfort and once again exploited by sex. As well as discussing \\"People's dependency on substances, being viewed as the very thing that keeps them going, instead of the very thing that kills them.\\" These are just a sample of references and comparisons made in the book. After reading Can't Buy My Love, my outlook has drastically changed about the effects on media in today's world. The plethora of advertising strategies will astonish you as well as prepare you for the pollutants of advertising in American culture. Never again will you look at the same way."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"I am a big fan of Jean Kilbourne and her work.

Some of the ads she talks about are included in the book which is nice."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"This book is a critical review of the approach advertisers use to promote their products. The author presents the attractive messages provided, and then goes on to describe the intended and actual effect of product use. A crucial conclusion provided in each chapter is the potential addiction of adopting the various services offered with the purchase of each product. This book is of great value to the individual reader as well as to college-level students, in that it provides a healthy approach to critically reviewing items considered for purchase. Readers are thus enabled to make consumer expenditures in terms of informed judgments, rather than from momentary impulses."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"This book's ideas need to reach more people. It seems we're inundated with stories of child molesters, drug pushers, and other threats to us and our children; but the 200 billion dollars spent by the junk food makers, pharmaceutical pushers, military recruiters and others to colonize the hearts and minds of our kids is often overlooked. Sadly, many of those who are learning to look critically at the commercial media are often more privileged economically. Maybe we can find ways to reach out to other sectors of our society through letters to editors, calls to talk radio, writing on message boards and so forth. Also, there are additional resources that we can use to share perspectives to help protect people (kids and adults) from the psychological warfare of Big Business. I'd recommend DVDs like \\"Deadly Persuasion\\" from the Media Education Foundation, which is an expose of tobacco and alcohol advertising presented by Jean Kilbourne. There is also the award-winning film called \\"The Corporation\\" available from Amazon. Subscriptions to \\"Adbusters\\" and \\"New Moon\\" are also very helpful outreach tools."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"this book provides an abundance of information regarding advertising's effect in american culture, and throughout the world. the author mainly focuses on alcohol, tobacco advertising and how it creates an environment which supports addiction. she goes on to discuss addictions, abuse, eating-disorder and the relation to advertising. this book is extremely informative (as it's bibliography is over 30 pages) and eye-opneing; however, it becomes almost unbearably repetitive."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"A very galvanizing narrative. And important for the American conscience ... as Europe has been noticing this kind of encroaching manipulation for some time.

Advertising is everywhere, from billboards and posters to clothing to shop windows. It is an inconvenient truth that we are indeed affected by advertising and commercialism, even if we don't believe it.This book is as much a psychology book as a sociology book. Using examples, statistics, interviews, and her own life experience, Kilbourne covers the connections between advertising and addiction. Ads talk directly to addicts in an attempt to make the addiction look like normal and accepted behavior. She addresses how we reach for material things in a futile attempt to find comfort. In an over-consumerist society that is destroying the planet, advertising encourages us to consume more and more and to replace interconnectedness, relations, and communication with material things. A car doesn't argue with you, so it's easier to buy a car than to communicate with people.Can't Buy My Love is a very important book for all Americans to read, so that they will be able to see advertising with a critical and conscious eye and not be fooled. It will also enable Americans to protect their children from the conditioning that advertisers, including those of the tobacco and alcohol industries, consciously attempt."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"I like the book.

I will admit that I did not understand some of the concepts at age 16, but Kilbourne certainly started to open my eyes to the way that advertizing and the cutural enviroment views people in general, and now, at the age of 19 when I go back over the topics, I see that her reflections are very acurate of the enviroment in which I judge myself. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE, and especially to teens, so that they can realize how our self-image is affected and manipulated so that we will be more suceptable to addictions. This is one of the best reads I have had in a very long time."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"As Kilborne suggests, advertising is responsible for fanning the flames of nicotine addiction, alcoholism, violence, &amp; female submissiveness through the powers of imagery and proliferation.Kilborne claims that these advertisers, in their efforts to generate revenue, (sometimes inadvertantly) design ads that subliminaly create a collective consciousness that affects our ideas about relationships, sex, and the male/female dynamic. In this new world, cars take the place of partners, food substitutes intimacy, and alcohol becomes a best friend._Can't Buy My Love_ artfully combines the intellectual punch of a well-researched thesis with the heart and conversational tone of a personal narrative. This makes for easy, insightful reading. (Case and point: I read it in one day -- in one sitting.)At times this book is hard to read. I winced countless times, recalling many of these advertisements (Many are pictured in the book), wondering how much I had/have been affected by them. Even more chilling is the realization that, as time goes on, we are continually bombarded with more and more advertising -- saturating our subconsious, and perhaps peppering our behaviors.If you've ever needed a cigarette to relax, longed for the comfort of a cocktail, or craved ice cream but still felt you need to lose those &quot;extra 15 pounds,&quot; you should read this book.Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"I didn't think ads affected me in any way, until I've read this book. It talks about the strategies ads do to sell their products. This includes making women appear as sexual objects and how ads teach men to treat women as objects. And How this affects our society. Don't think it does? Oh it certainly does!This is the truth about ads. The harsh truth is ads don't care about you or your well being or how we treat women or men, they just want to catch our attention so that the product will sell. Its disgusting but its the truth, how we're so used to the messages that ads give us that we think that what their telling us is the truth.When in fact its all lies! The reviewer below is right, you'll never look at ads the same way after reading this. The writer doesn't try to be funny, but is angry and has a right to be. Its disgusting the way ads depict women as objects, I feel so sad for women everywhere that are exploited by the ads.This book will open your eyes and tell you the truth about ads."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"My title says it all.

Ads after ad is thrown onto the stage, summed up in fifty words or less, and subsequently denounced as \\"harmful\\" to society. The reasons for this pronouncement vary wildly and are almost never backed by supporting evidence. What we get are impressions, not reasoned thought.This is unfortunate because advertising is an arena that deserves some investigation. Unfortunately, you won't find that here. Instead, you have something almost as bombastic as the alcohol ads the author attacks. There are no interviews with the artists, photographers, script writers, producers, or manufacturers of the ads that are reviewed, nor of the products they represent. There is no investigation into the market research behind the ads. There is virtually NO evidence allowed except for the author's own assumptions.It also becomes apparant about half way through the book that the author has more at issue with the products being advertised than the advertising itself. Close to 1/3 of the book is spent exploring just cigarette and alcohol ads. The author's attitude about these products borders on abolitionism, the main thrust of her argument being not that that advertising is harmful so much as that the products advertised are inherently diabolical and lead to self destruction. Whatever one may think about these products, this is absolutely not the place for this discussion.Not everything about this book is bad. The opening chapter, in which it is explained that the mass media exists for the purpose of fueling advertising, is excellent.

However, I listened to an interview with her on NPR yesterday. Anyway, what really caught my attention and what I wanted to share with you was at the end of the interview she was asked what her idea of a beautiful child is. There wasn't a transcript available on the web site, but they did have audio, so I transcribed it the best that I could. Here is her answer:&quot;A child who's radiant, who's happy, who's civilized but not repressed, who's curious and full of a sense of wonder and adventure, who's confident, loves to engage in conversation and activities and basically feels that her body is powerful and wonderful and can do great things for her, and that her mind opens her up to endless possibilities.&quot;Now that does sound beautiful!"},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"Jean Kilbourne has some important points to make in this book. Yet, thanks to her ability to use similar tactics of the ad industry to get her own agenda across, the inclination is to believe her rhetoric as much as her opponent's (i.e. the 'bad' ad industry). Were 'bad habits' and other disorders truly 'forced upon her by ads' when she was young? And do they explain her own modus operandi now? Ads certainly may appeal to our own personal myths, aspirations and be useful tools to promote our own denial and insecurities. But their role as tools or mediums should not be confused with the actual agent or culprit in initiating and continuiung deception and denial. Thus, reading her book gave me the impression that Kilbourne was still struggling -- trying to find her own way out of an all encompassing cosmetic world in which she actually, deep down secretively, believes too literally."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"Mini- ReviewIn review of the book I'm reading Can't Buy My Love is about advertising. It doesn't discriminate women as much as I thought it would. It discriminates the advertising world. Jean Kilbourne, (the author) talks about how advertising influences all different kinds of people: blacks, whites, males, females, adults, and children.Jean Kilbourne really goes in depth with the way she portrays the advertising world. People spend millions of dollars trying to get their commercials on T.V. \\" You can love it without getting your heart broken.\\" Some company probably paid a lot of money just to get that quote on T.V., or in a magazine.This is the only book I've read in a long time, I really enjoyed it.Can't Buy My Love is an informative book about the advertising world."},{"Title":"Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel","review":"This is a book that could have been and should have been alot better but suffers from the author's insistence on us taking her word for much of her analysis rather than providing footnotes and actual quotes and documentation to support her assertions. Someone with as much access to these pricey advertising journals should have been able to put together something with much more depth than this shallow \\"alcohol and cigarette ads are bad and they are bad because alcohol and smoking hurts people\\" outlook. She also beats us over the head almost nonstop with passages about how women are helpless victims and men are bloodthirsty, sex crazed, alcoholic villains. How many times have we heard this before. The book is overflowing with bias and even though her bias is correct in the case of the dangers of alcohol being dangerous or smoking being dangerous we really don't need a constant lecture to remind us redundantly of their dangers. The author also commits the mistake of mentioning Vance Packard's masterpiece \\"The Hidden Persuaders\\" which is in my opinion the best book to date on the subject of the advertising industry's deceptive tactics. She mentions The Hidden Persuaders but doesn't seem to have gathered any wisdom from the book on how to keep your own bias out of the book as much as possible while trying to analyze the subject matter to allow the reader to come to their own conclusion. The author dishonestly tosses a bunch of articles and book titles in the index in the back of the book as if this will excuse her from not caring to even attempt to list the title of the studies she claims to have gotten her statistics from in the main body of the book. So for the reasons above I give the book 2 stars.

Here is an example from the book its woman talking she dressed very sexy and says, \\"Until I find a real man, I'll settle for a real smoke\\".

The Cambridge Companion to American Judaism is a comprehensive survey that attempts to cover Judaism as a religion in the United States rather than Jewishness as an ethnicity in this country. The title of this volume thus requires a word of explanation. In popular usage today, Judaism usually implies a broad sociological approach to the subject of Jewish life and culture, while the term Jewish religion suggests a more specific concern with beliefs and practices that are somehow associated with a supernatural reality. Although this collection uses the more general term in its title, its focus is on American Jewish religious phenomena. It is, however, an appropriate title, I believe, because the volume's essays describe a quite inclusive Jewish religious experience in America. This includes aspects that frequently have been neglected or ignored or are understood as outside the purview of religion by a largely Christian America, which sometimes draws different and more impenetrable boundaries between the sacred and the secular. Understanding the subject in such broad terms, one can see that Jewish religion in America means much more than just religious ritual or belief. Contributors also discuss the sociology, psychology, theology, and history of American Judaism. A number of essays concentrate on the culture of American Judaism, including musical, artistic, and literary expressions.Perhaps, though, any division between what is and isn't religious in a Jewish context is perpetually negotiable, and this problem of placing barriers gestures to the elusiveness of Jewish identity in general. Nathan Glazer writes in this volume that to characterize present-day \\"Jewishness\\" is not an easy task. It is not easy because of the myriad, heterogeneous ways that Jews in America understand their relationship with their religion. Even within the denominational categories of Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist, and Orthodox, there is great diversity among individuals. Speaking in quite general terms, one can say that most American Jews understand Jewish tradition as cosmopolitan and universalistic. They see Judaism as pragmatic rather than ideological, utilitarian rather than theological, and rationalrather than mystical. Many in this group see their practice of Judaism as an all-encompassing pursuit, determining not only religious ritual but also ethical behavior. Another sizable group sees the specifics of Judaism as playing a crucial but more limited role in their lives, believing that their commitment to universal ethical causes derives from their core Judaic values - even if they do not frequently articulate these values in a synagogue or temple. These Jews see liberalism as applied Judaism, identifying Judaism with liberal social causes. However, in recent years, even among this group there has been a pronounced move toward greater ritualism as well. The essays in this collection attempt to analyze various aspects of this American Judaism, a term that - as we shall see - does offer some tentative unity to a religious people with tremendous diversity.There are a variety of perspectives in the American Jewish community that are reflected in attitudes toward specific questions dealing with personal and communal Jewish identity today, such as patrilineal descent, Outreach, the role of the non-Jew in the synagogue, rabbinic officiation at mixed-marriage ceremonies, the ordainment of women, and gay and lesbian participation in the synagogue. All of these issues are being heatedly debated within and across the different denominations (also referred to as movements, streams, or even wings). In addition to these strictly \\"religious issues,\\" there are also debates on social and political issues that affect American society as a whole. It is not possible to say that American Judaism has a particular position on abortion, capital punishment, euthanasia, or homosexual rights. Many of the denominations have taken official stands on some of these issues, but in most cases there are minorities even within those streams who believe that their religion holds a different view.The most passionately debated question is whether Judaism can survive in an open American society that has, since the 1950s, become increasingly tolerant toward Jews. Since the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) found that American Jews were intermarrying at a rate of 52 percent, there has been a frantic debate in the American Jewish community: Is Judaism in danger of disappearing in the United States? Some of the optimistic contributors to this volume support the transformation argument: Contemporary American Judaism is not vanishing but is rather transforming itself. These individuals believe that it is essential to look at what is happening in a more sophisticated way and not restrict one's perspective to outdated criteria. Many American Jews are creating new ways of \\"doing Jewish,\\" blending their own traditions with non-Jewish family rituals favored by spouses or embracing a syncretic creation of American culture and Judaism. Because of all of these changes, one must look in new places to find new approaches.The pessimists feel that the majority of American Jews have lost all interest in Judaism, and many others have only nominal links. These individuals believe that their future as a people is threatened and only a \\"return to tradition\\" can reverse the radical decline. These pessimists argue that low levels of synagogue affiliation, high rates of intermarriage, low levels of Jewish literacy, and weak commitments to ritual observance are undermining Jewish continuity.Another debate centers on the future makeup of the American Jewish community. Some contributors accept the polarization argument that there will be two completely separate Jewish communities in the near future - the Orthodox and the non-Orthodox. The two groups have less in common and have less contact with one another than ever before. They disagree not only on how Judaism should be practiced but also on the very definition of who is a Jew. Without some consensus on such a basic question, the pessimists believe that American Judaism will split into two separate sects. The optimists hope that some common ground can still be found.So that we can better understand and contextualize these questions and issues that occupy the American Jewish community, this book is divided into two sections.Part I provides three historical overviews of American Judaism. Eli Faber deals with the period from 1654, when the first Jews arrived in New Amsterdam, up to 1880, when the mass immigration from Eastern Europe was about to begin. Faber reports that some colonial Jews posed for portraits without head coverings, violated the Sabbath laws, and even ate pork, particularly when they were traveling. A small percentage even married out of the faith. Others were highly observant and followed Jewish law scrupulously. The main difference between then and now was that all five synagogues founded before the Revolution followed Orthodox Sephardic custom. How-ever, American Judaism changed dramatically in the years during and immediately after the Civil War. Faber writes that \\"the impulse to change Judaism in America surged between 1860 and 1870.\\" Reforms were introduced, including mixed seating, the elimination of the head covering for men, and the use of an organ. New prayer books were edited that eliminated certain theological concepts that were now found objectionable.Lloyd P. Gartner describes the \\"reshaping\\" of American Judaism from the late nineteenth century until after World War II. The large-scale Eastern European immigration completely changed American Judaism. Hundreds of small Orthodox synagogues were created in mostly urban neighborhoods. Many people attended Orthodox synagogues because that was what they were comfortable with, but they refused to follow the Halacha strictly, despite the many sermons preached by Orthodox rabbis. Gartner reports that the immigrant congregations reached their peak during the World War I period and then began to decline slowly. New, larger, and more affluent congregations were established. English replaced Yiddish, and American ways replaced European Jewish customs and practices.In the postwar period, large numbers left the urban neighborhoods for the suburbs. As I describe in my chapter, a Jewish civil religion developed that stressed loyalty to both the United States and to the Jewish people. Levels of anti-Semitism declined, and Jews became fully integrated into American society. They felt a great deal of pressure to express their Jewishness religiously rather than ethnically, and hundreds of suburban synagogues were soon built. The Conservative movement became the largest American Jewish de-nomination, and the Orthodox denomination continued to decline. However, this pattern began to reverse in the 1970s. Orthodoxy began a remarkable revival, spurred on by the missionizing done by the Baal Teshuva movement among other Jews. Lubavitch (also called Chabad) sent emissaries to hundreds of Jewish communities around the country and the world. Among the non-Orthodox, the Reform movement grew, which was due in large measure to the joining of many intermarried couples.Part II, the bulk of the volume, deals with essential topics in contemporary American Judaism. This Themes and Concepts section is subdivided into Religious Culture and Institutional Practice, Identity and Community, Living in America, and Jewish Art in America. It has essays on religious belief and behavior, structures and institutions, and patterns and stages. Consider-able attention is devoted to the Jewish civil religion, Judaism and democracy, and the essence of American Judaism, as protean as it may be. Other writers focus on gender roles, life-cycle rituals, interfaith dialogue, and religious economics. Particularly innovative are the essays that focus on American Judaism broadly conceived. Mark Kligman explains the role that music plays in American Judaism and Matthew Baigell describes the visual arts. Murray Baumgarten talks about \\"American Midrash,\\" by which he means the new American Jewish literature that focuses on Judaic story lines.The final essay by Bruce Phillips is a separate subsection entitled \\"Present and Future Tense: American Judaism in the Twenty-First Century.\\" The volume then concludes with an afterword written by Jonathan Sarna.There are certain ideas and concepts that are essential for understanding the essays. Let us begin with the two defining events of twentieth-century Jewish history."},{"Title":"A rational theology as taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints,","review":"As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, my bishop recommended this book to me when a non-member friend and his questions caused me to doubt the rationality behind my religious beliefs. My friend would ask many questions about the church which I could answer on my own but then he'd want me to justify the answer with either biblical references or with examples from historical theologies. Reading this book helped me understand why the LDS church beliefs make sense. It's perfect for those who need to hear the logical reasoning behind this religion. I found Widtsoe's writing different and somewhat difficult. It's definitely not leisurely reading but once you are comfortable with his writing technique, it becomes very insightful. He leaves out the biased side (since he was a member himself) and explains why the LDS church is a rational theology. I love this book and ended up buying it!"},{"Title":"A rational theology as taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints,","review":"This overview book expounds many of the doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, along the line of &quot;Gospel Principles,&quot; and is a very good read, considering Elder Widtsoe was an emigrant form Norway. He covers the basics, but as President Hinckley has said, we learn by repetition. For those who are a fan of Widtsoe, this is an essential addition to their library.The only drawback being that it is was designed for used in priesthood meetings, so it is not designed for non-Saints. For anyone interesting in \\"first contact\\" with the Latter-day Saints, I would recommend reading \\"The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ,\\" or \\"Standing for Something\\" by Gordon B. Hinckley, the current world leader of the Church. Don't drink below the horses, including myself!It should be noted that Brother Widtsoe comes from the point of view of a chemist and describes our theology in terms of rationality and a science. C. S. Lewis warned about &quot;Christianity And,&quot; (Screwtape Letters, chapter 25) such as &quot;Christianity and Pacifism,&quot; or &quot;Christianity and Vegetarianism,&quot; the problem being that we are diluting the Gospel and rewriting it in the light of our own hobbies or profession.True, our theology is rational and can stand the scrutiny of a Thomas Aquinas or a Jesse Ventura, but it is not the product of a test-tube or a syllogism. In other words, Joseph Smith didn't get our religion from re-shuffling verses of the bible, or just deep thinking or pondering, but he got revelations. He said, &quot;I have got all the truth which the Christian world possessed, and an independent revelation in the bargain, and God will bear me off triumphant.&quot; (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 376)Despite this one point, would recommend this book for a new member learning, a non-member curious, or an old member wanting to review basics. C. S. Lewis also said that we should alternate between reading old books, and new books, since the old ones have stood the test of time, whereas the new books, such as \\"Believing Christ,\\" or John Bytheway books are still on trial. I'm not saying the are bad, but that there is a verdict of history associated with \\"Jesus the Christ,\\" or \\"Mormon Doctrine\\" that these striplings do not yet have."},{"Title":"A rational theology as taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints,","review":"This book appears to be a manual used in Sunday school classes taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Still, I found it to be a nice \\"refresher\\" course, written in an accesible style. The book would probably be best for an outsider--that is, someone unfamiliar with the religion who wanted to learn more.

And I am an atheist...Catholics are coming from all over the world to celebrate the old Latin mass at an obscure spot in Ireland. Some see it as a religious revival. Some see it as a sign of the endurance of &quot;hard core&quot; Catholicism. However, the Pope, and other modern highly place ecumenical figures, see it as trouble. A rebellion against the new, populist church, and a flagrant disobedience.A young, modern, American priest is sent to deal with these old-style upstarts. But can he help but share the genuine sincerity of the isolated monks - living in utmost modesty on the Island of Muck - who have innocently begun the furor? And it comes down to belief in miracles versus the mundane need for the common good. The brash young American priest comes hard up against the solid old Abbot of Muck. Dependable, honest within and without, the Abbot is the only one that knows that his faith is a tenuous thing.The facts of the plot matter little. The excellent character portrayals, and the understanding of the internal workings of such different minds is uniquely Moore. As only he can, he makes the anguish of the Abbot your own, and brings you with him through the trials of his decision.Outstanding."},{"Title":"Catholics","review":"Catholics is a slim, simply written novel that raises good questions on faith, Catholic-Christianity, obedience and all the things that are all the core tenets of the Catholic Church. Set in the future, the Fourth Vatican Council has gotten rid of private confession, clerical attire, the Latin Mass and all the primaries that one would associate with a Catholic identity. Yet, in the nether reaches off the Irish coast, there is a monastery-Muck Abbey-whose monks are not following the rules of law, as laid down by the pope and the curia at the Vatican. They are gentle rebels who are refusing to comply, because they believe in the traditional mysteries that have gone back aeons, laws and values laid down by God through Jesus Christ to His disciples. The monks are innocent practitioners of the beautiful, old ways of mystery, and because they refuse to cut the cord of the truth, as they believe it to be, they become, inadvertently (I believe) thorns in the you-know-what of the Vatican oligarchy. Because of that, they develop an international following, parishioners themselves who can't quite digest the lack of mystery, as established by the Fourth Vatican Council. The new rules seem too politically correct, extolling the ideology of secularization and relativism. The higher-ups are becoming more and more attracted to intense ecumenicalism as well, wanting to merge Buddhism with Catholicism, in effect, erasing its roots, the \\"Rock\\" that Jesus Christ told Peter the church would be built upon. For the nameless parishioners in this novel who are true readers of the Bible (God's Word willed to humanity), the radical changes are too extreme to be accepted, and thus, disobedience is a logical and intellectual act to embark upon. But because they are a flock-God's children-the Church has a role to see that they are not being led astray. And according to the Vatican, because the monks at Muck Abbey are not heeding the rabid new changes, they are hence, leading the flock astray. To rectify the issue, Fr. James Kinsella is dispatched to the abbey to reeducate the lot of them. Modern and free thinking, Fr. Kinsella is the embodiment of the \\"new\\" Catholic, a man who sees the mystery of prayer and sin as superstitious nonsense (he'd probably make a good Devil's Advocate) that is antiquated and best to be trounced upon when it is burgeoning. Though he is not a mean spirited man in any way, to me, he is a condescending intellectual who is a careerist who wants to climb the church ladder to something better. However, the best way to do that is to do the drudgery work that probably no one else wants to do. With that, he'll get promoted. On the opposite side of the spectrum, there is Tomas O'Malley, the abbot of Muck Abbey; he is gentle, fatherly, wizened and a man in a very difficult position. And his actions will have a wider impact that are too big to fully understand, for if he complies with the church hierarchy, it will look as if he's abandoning the mystery and superstition of life and the things that happen within its confines for political religiosity. If he defies the church, will he and his band of traditional monks be seen as martyrs to Catholic orthodoxy or minions of evil because they are not in tandem with a Church that God is passionate about? In dealing with this, Fr. O'Malley is also coping with his own doubts and privations; the religious passions are just not there. He is a robot going through the motions of things, and something needs to be triggered within himself. How appropriate that his name is Tomas, for he really comes off as the Doubting Thomas. One can not put off the battle between the two warring factions as the ultimate test from God, and that is how it must be seen; obedience is paramount, and for me that really is undigestible. I would probably tell Fr. Kinsella to go where the sun don't shine, but that is not a true manifestation of faith in this case, and that is why this book is so gloriously frustrating. It begs you to ask the question, What would you do? Christianity is hard! It asks for commitment through thick and thin (even if you don't agree). It challenges you to the core of what you think you really are versus what you truly are. I won't reveal the ending, but the truth is best spoken by Fr. O'Malley when he says, \\"Prayer is the only miracle. We pray. If our words become prayer, God will come.\\" Page 132. Catholic or not, that is one truth that can never ever be altered."},{"Title":"Catholics","review":"This book, made into a motion picture in the seventies, is a tale set in the near future when the Catholic Faith is hijacked by some sort of modern syncretistic hyper-social justice hierarchy. Indeed, from one who has lived through some of the most drastic changes in the Catholic Faith during the last forty years I can say the book is a well written modern prophecy. It's a great story of what happens when authority is used to destroy the most substantial truths of The Faith. It is a great narrative on how authority, which is highly regarded by Catholics, is used to destroy ultimate authority in the Church. In the end the struggle between the traditional truths and the new modern way, in a small monastery on a deserted island, is ended by an act of administrative authority. It's a sad commentary of what people in charge of things, especially the Church, can become when they lose their faith and become ecclesiastical mechanics. The story has everything in it which actually has happened - the liberation movement, ecumenical actions being end in themselves, a denial of the priesthood and finally a denial of the real presence in the Holy Eucharist. In many ways it is a prophecy of horrible things to come for the Catholic Church - the truth is that the future is now."},{"Title":"Catholics","review":"This is my favorite Brian Moore work.

I think it is a good novel by a talented author."},{"Title":"Catholics","review":"Brian Moore ,in this short book,actually just a novella,presents an interesting look at the Catholic Church.It was published in 1972 and is still an interesting read.In reading this book,one must keep in mind that it was writted shortly after Vatican 2 Council that took place between 1961 and 1965.the purpose of the Council was to review the \\"situation\\" of the Church at its present time, and to make changes in religious practices,traditions,liturgy and whatever else ,should become instilled it the practice of faith ,and ceremonies;to bring things more up to date and relevant with the present.It was not simply a new set of rules proposed by just the Pope;but a long series of thoughtful considerstions by many Cardinals, other theologians, etc.In other words,it was not in any way,any change to the basic beliefs and faith;but rather changes in the ways and rituals,etc in the manner in which the faith was to be practiced.As a lay Catholic,that's the way I saw it and as far as I am concerned ,the way most Catholics saw it.If one reads anything about the Catholic Church,things continually changed over the past 2000 years,and most of the changes reflected society during those times ,but there was never any changes in the beliefs of faith ,simply in its ritual and practice.A couple of examples would be that of priests not marrying,eating meat on Fridays,what types of clothes religious leaders wear,the hymn and prayers that are said,etc.As a matter of fact these things seem to be more of an issue to non practioners of the faith than those within it,at least in my experience.The issues that the author writes this novella around ,and the predictions he makes are more about personalities and how they react and adjust to changes;and are common when any changes are introduced within an organization.Some will want to take changes,even expand on them, and run wild;while others will cling to tradition and drag their feet and resist all changes.The language in which the Mass is offered ,is a major change,but as a matter of faith,it is irrelevant.To consider this book as one of substantial prophecy is a stretch of the imagination.While attendance at Mass has fallen off in some countries such as Ireland,and in parts of Canada,such as Quebec;those changes were little if any due to Vatican II or the imaginary Vatican IV as suggested.The practice of religion with different denominations of Christianity has changed many ways in the Western world and will continue in the future as it has in the past.So ,in the end,this book is an interesting read in how people react to change,and while it shows the emotional side of the reaction to change;one shouldn't read any more into it than that."},{"Title":"Catholics","review":"==== SPOILER ALERT! ====The irony in this short novel is that the views of the Abbot and of the visiting Fr. Kinsella are the same. We just don't know it at first. Kinsella is a product of the new age without a belief in the miracle of the Mass, while the Abbot represents the old tired world that lost its faith in the miraculous. It's almost as if the Abbot were relieved to have the orders from Kinsella as an excuse to stop the traditional Masses his monks have been saying.Ultimately, the Abbot would have been obedient even without the visit, so the premise of the novel isn't very strong. (Though perhaps we can assume his superiors had doubts about his obedience.) However, the visit to the abbey allows all the characters to interact and bring out their various perspectives and fears. The height of the work is the thoughtful conversation between the Abbot and Kinsella in the evening after dinner. The talk has a tension created by the mystery of where each man actually stands, and what each will do in the end. But despite the tension, the two men are always cordial, even warm, with each other.In the end, the only \\"presence\\" of God that the monks can be sure of is that which occurs while they pray. On first reading, this seems a frightening prospect, as indicated by the concerns of the traditionalist \\"triumvirate\\" of Fathers Manus, Walter, and Matthew. But then we must realize that if prayer doesn't work, then there is nothing to the sacraments; so prayer is the foundation of the sacraments and the first step toward the presence of God among us."},{"Title":"Catholics","review":"This book is a short but vivid sketch depicting a situation in the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council which so swiftly and profoundly altered liturgical, ritual and spiritual life of the faithful that many of them - both among a hierarchy and common priests, monks and laymen - were thrown into confusion. However, these changes were positively necessary in order not to clone the former mistakes of negation of the modern world reality that several centuries ago had led to appearance of 'that righteous prig nailing in Wittenberg his defiance to the church doors' who reformed the Church and the history of humankind. The novella does not pretend to a wide scope of theological problems, the characters of cynical church 'generals' are rather schematic and satirical, but the delineation of different kinds of catholics - new 'enlightened' libertarian generation, old generation who preserved their faith and also the hesitating type of believer who is loosing his/her faith - and their intricate interrelations in Time of Spiritual Troubles is really excellent."},{"Title":"Catholics","review":"A well written book. Very thought provoking, even if you are not a Catholic."},{"Title":"Alexandria: City of Memory","review":"I have read this fascinating book and cannot do better than to offer this review which appeared on January 4th 2005 in The Times Literary Supplement:'Michael Haag's dazzling new book, Alexandria: City of memory, has two aims, both admirably achieved: to construct a political and social history covering a half century or so - roughly 1915 to 1960 - within the larger period of what he calls \\"the heyday of cosmopolitan Alexandria\\"; and to display the resulting version of this cosmopolitan Alexandria to us through the lives and works of some of those who have left written or verbal records. ...'The written record used by Haag includes Cavafy, of course, as well as E. M. Forster and Lawrence Durrell, all three of whom not only wrote extensively about their Alexandrian experience, but also participated in significant social networks. It might be supposed that this ground has been adequately covered by the multitude of specialized studies that already exist on the individual authors, or by Jane Lagoudis Pinchin's excellent literary study Alexandria Still: Forster, Durrell, and Cavafy (1977). However, much of Haag's material, even when he deals with such major figures, is new, has never been published before, and is thus anecdotal in the original sense of the word. ...'Haag is at his most brilliant when he deals with Lawrence Durrell, on whom he is now perhaps the world's leading expert. Durrell's reputation rests almost entirely on the Alexandria Quartet (1962), which arose from his experience in Alexandria during the Second World War. Neither of the two full-length biographies of him, however, is in any way adequate to this subject. On one level, Haag's treatment of Alexandria itself during the war provides a parallel to that of Cairo by Artemis Cooper in her splendid Cairo in the War (1989); on another, it answers several questions specifically raised by the Quartet and explains what lay behind its genesis better than anyone else has yet done. The personality of Eve Cohen, the first of Durrell's two beautiful Alexandrian Jewish wives and the obvious inspiration for Justine, is crucial here; and Haag not only interviewed her extensively, but travelled with her back to Alexandria to revisit the sites that figured in her life during the War.'"},{"Title":"Alexandria: City of Memory","review":"Alexandria. When I first got this book and leafed through it briefly I decided it was a lovely coffee table book and not much more. I could be forgiven this error of judgment because the photos are really attractive. When I opened it again some while later I realized that my first assessment had been a colossal mistake. The text is extremely well-written and Michael Haag's stunningly knowledgeable exploration of the city's social, cultural and political life between the world wars offers three major centers of gravity dealing with the lives and work of the literary figures Constantine Cavafy, E.M. Forster, and Lawrence Durrell, each of whom had radical connections with Alexandria, and in the configuration of whose esthetic the city played a determining role. In addition there are countless points of secondary reference (people, places, historical figures) enriching the stories of these three giants of twentieth-century literature, especially in their individual and highly peculiar relation to the city and in what each believed the city had done for (and to) him. For Forster Alexandria meant emancipation from his domineering mother and from the corrosive mores of middle-class Britain. It also meant love - with a bus driver who had to be coaxed into bed but was never really good at it. Haag gives some profound insights on Forster's character and on what might be taken as a significant strain of unkindness, perhaps even hypocrisy, in the novelist (see p. 103). Caavafy, impoverished survivor of a once-wealthy family of cotton brokers, viewed his native city as a repository of myths and images and sexual encounters expressing the various realms of meaning he so successfully converted into world-class poetry. (Some of Edmund Keeley's books on Greek poetry go further into all that.) And finally, Lawrence Durrell endowed Alexandria with a quasi-mystical persona that figures prominently and profoundly in his still-important \\"Quartet.\\"Intercalated with the stories of these important literati, there are excursuses to history ancient and modern, architecture, politics and diplomacy. There is also a fascinating cast of secondary, mostly bon vivant characters, Alexandrians and expatriates, who give elegant dinner parties and balls (the ones that inspired some of the more riveting moments in Durrell's great opus), engage in shimmering conversations over long boozy lunches, and hop, most of them, into bed with whomever strikes their fancy or whose fancy they strike. Many of these people are also quite talented and creative. Alexandria's foreign communities, later destroyed by what the author correctly calls Nasser's puritanical socialism, were the real heart and soul of the city in the period covered here. There were Greeks, lots of them, and they were very prosperous, reasonably well educated and very socially conscious. The Italians were victims of occupational polarity: they were either high-class architects or lowly construction workers. They were responsible for most of the buildings, some beautiful,some ugly, in the city. There were also assorted Frenchmen, Britons, Jews (who got involved in everything and did everything well), and even (Jasper Brinton most notable among them) some few Americans.Michael Haag's writing style is strong, vigorous and unmistakably masculine. Yet he manages to convey many scenes and situations of Alexandrian life with striking esthetic refinement and great evocative power, especially as he explores his three major figures' central artistic ideas and literary dispositions and show how they relate to history, political power - and love.Alexandria was not, of course, the center of the world between the world wars. Nor was it where \\"big\\" history was being made during that period. But isn't it marvelous to have a book like this one that tells us so much about the world contained within the city and about the people who contributed to its history?"},{"Title":"Alexandria: City of Memory","review":"Michael Haag has taken on a challenge few historians would accept: he has recreated a solid history of a city shrouded in mystery since its inception or formation by Alexander the Great. And while much is known about Alexandria through novels and movies and war ruminations and social epithets and other sources that border on mythology, this amazingly fascinating city has undergone so many changes since Alexander's time, each new set of inhabitants has destroyed the remnants of the previous owners, leaving us with only isolated antiquities and memories as passed on by word of mouth and fleeting letters. The occupations by the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs, the Egyptians, the Italians and the Jews have smoldered in a cauldron of secrecy until the present.Haag takes us by the hand and the head and accompanies us on this myriad excursion of exploration of ALEXANDRIA: CITY OF MEMORY by wisely emphasizing the writings of three of our greatest artists - Constantine Cavafy, Lawrence Durrell (of the famous 'Alexandria Quartet') and E.M. Forster (best known for his novels including 'Howard's End'). It is primarily through the eyes of these exciting writers that Haag has gathered information from their own novels and poems, interviews, letters, and articles about these famous inhabitants of Alexandria who from before World War I through World War II documented the romance of the city as well as the intense social and political life that nurtured the cosmopolitan importance of this amazing place.Haag is at his best when he is relying on the writings from these three men, documents which reveal the wide range of sexuality so compatible with the city (Cavafy and Forster are each discussed extensively regarding their same sex lifestyles and confidantes, and Durrell is outlined by the several wives and mistresses he had). Weaving these men's lives and influences through the changing governments and attitudes of the city and its populace makes for fascinating reading.When Haag ventures into the lives of the purely political and commercial giants of the city through the years, the writing becomes less interesting, though equally informative. In the end, while there are many pages of information that merely begin to slow the reader's concentration and interest, ALEXANDRIA: CITY OF MEMORY is a superb book of history and biography of a place that has heretofore eluded scholars. An additional positive aspect is Haag's use of many photographs of the city from all eras. Recommended for the patient but inquisitive reader. Grady Harp, September 05"},{"Title":"Alexandria: City of Memory","review":"Of the triumvirate of Alexandrian literary giants of the early twentieth century - Constantine Cavafy, E. M. Forster, and Lawrence Durrell - Cavafy is perhaps the guardian spirit. His poetry provides the capstone to Forster's Alexandria: A History and a Guide, and is present both as invoked persona (\\"the old poet of the city\\") and fictionalized character (Balthazar) in Durrell's Alexandria Quartet. Cavafy's presence also haunts Michael Haag's evocative Alexandria: City of Memory. Though the book focuses on the Alexandria of Forster and Durrell, the photograph of Cavafy's melancholy face seems to stare through every page, and his poem \\"The City,\\" used as epigraph, imbues the text with nostalgia. The image Haag describes of Cavafy at twilight opening or closing shutters, \\"adjusting the fall of light on his guests,\\" aptly describes Haag's approach to his material, illuminating the sojourns of Forster and Durrell in this city.Both Forster and Durrell were cast into Alexandria by wars: Forster came as a Red Cross \\"searcher\\" in World War I, interviewing wounded soldiers to ascertain the whereabouts of the missing; Durrell fled the Nazi invasion of Greece. In Alexandria both found the loves that, if not the most inspiring of happiness, nevertheless provided the foundation for some of their greatest writing.Forster fell in love with a tram conductor, Mohammed al Adl, and their tenuous, fraught relationship is movingly recounted in Forster's long \\"letter,\\" never sent, and continued after Mohammed's death at twenty-three from consumption. Their relationship, transformed, underlies Forster's acclaimed A Passage to India, informing both Dr. Aziz's friendship with Fielding, and the misunderstandings between Aziz and Adela Quested. Perhaps the most strangely stirring image in Haag's book is the tattered photograph of Mohammed that Forster kept with him to the end of his life, preserved only because he had taped a tram ticket to the reverse side.The eponymous central character of Durrell's Justine is based on his second wife, the Alexandrian Jew Eve Cohen. They met at a party, where she terrified and entranced Durrell with her voluble eagerness and puckish beauty. Eve was involved with an Austrian Jew who didn't feel he could trust her, and Durrell had recently ended his first marriage, so they initially discussed their difficult love lives. But when Eve left her family, it was to Durrell that she turned; they were soon lovers, and then married. Their relationship, lopsided, passionate, scarred by violence, is evoked in Haag's book through Durrell's letters, the memories of friends, and interviews with Eve Durrell.A host of minor characters fills out the book, which is assiduously researched, lucidly written, and accompanied by a trove of photographs that bring to life this fleeting, fascinating epoch of Alexandria's history."},{"Title":"Alexandria: City of Memory","review":"An interested reader will acquire sharp insights into the lives of three important authors (I confess--none of whose books I have read) connected to the city founded by Alexander the Great. Perhaps more importantly, one will be given glimpses of the social and political background to a fascinating three or four decades. Cotton, Zionism, Greece's role in the region, Rommel and his desert campaign, the British lion's reach, the rise of Egyptian nationalism, and the worldly inhabitants of a multicultural, usually tolerant, and historically special Mediterranean port city are all here. Michael Haag has written an extremely intelligent book on the end of a particular era."},{"Title":"Alexandria: City of Memory","review":"I quite liked this book. It's an interesting approach to E.M. Forster, C. Cavafy, and Lawrence Durrell and their time in Alexandria.

It doesn't pretend to be a comprehensive guidebook on all aspects of cruising, but is rather an indepth examination of the true essentials. Just about any topic you can think of is covered, with new and insiteful thoughts on what works and what doesn't, as well as how to make cruising less technical, less expensive, less dependant on the chandlery and shore-side services in general. If you want in your heart to set off without a radio, without an engine, without radar, Loran, GPS, pressure showers or a microwave, and have been looking for very good reasons for doing so, then this is your book. Not only are these ideas mentioned in detail, but you'll see that lots of people sail a long way with very little fuss and expense, and have a wonderful, safe, and fulfilling time doing it. The yachting industry depends heavily on your feeling helpless, underequipped and in danger unless you buy one of their new (fill in the blank...radar, EPIRB, etc.), and Sensible Cruising will innoculate you against that bug, allowing you to make rational decisions about what is necessary and what is decidedly not.

She does have her flaws and these should be in a well-balanced biography. She is, after all, a human being and not a goddess."},{"Title":"Psychoboys","review":"The ridiculous name-dropping and mimicry of this novella drew my ire on every page. Leave out the dozens of floundering allusions (literary, cinematic, and musical) and there is practically nothing approaching original, unless you consider the story itself -- a blatantly Burroughs-esque nightmare of barbituares, coprophilia, and trannies -- original. Marshall even conjures up sad doppelgangers of Nico and Patti Smith, and makes a jesting attempt to channel Shakespeare. It's talentless imitation and no good.Spelling and grammatical errors also abound, and the book's thankfully scant 114 pages are double-spaced, seemingly in an effort to look sizable and worthy for publishing. Ultimately, 'Psychoboys' smacks of an amateur writer who somehow doesn't realize it's all been done more artfully before: by de Sade, Ballard, and Burroughs, for starters."},{"Title":"A journal of a tour in the Congo Free State,","review":"Published in 1905, this book is the journal of a journey by foot, train, canoe and steamer through the Belgium Congo. At the time the Congo Free State was in transition from a corporately-owned colony (controlled by the King of Belgium) to an official colony controlled by the Belgium nation.While Belgium was establishing its style of rule over much of the Congo, great parts were still controlled by private companies. A world-wide condemnation was underway, critical of alleged cruelties towards the native Africans. Tthe author notes this criticism, but observes that as a guest of the colony he may not have been able to observe all that was happening.The author does not delve into politics, but primarily makes notes of his observations of the terrain and the people. It is a kind of travelog. I find it interesting to note the peculiarities of the observer as he describes the peculiarities of the observed. After all, his observations were through the filter of his European culture.Even if you are not interested in African history, you will enjoy the descriptions of the lands and peoples during a time of great transition. It is a short read and well worth the time."},{"Title":"Batman Archives, Vol. 5 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"As World War II came to an end, the creators of Batman continued to tell entertaining stories. Actually, those two events weren't really related. Batman and Robin were not a place to find too much in New Deal social relevance, like Superman, nor was it a place for super-heroes to smack around Axis types. It was simply good, old-fashioned, two-fisted adventuring over the course of \\"Detective Comics\\" nos. 103-119.Which isn't to say that Batman didn't have a conscience. In \\"Coaltown, U.S.A.\\", Batman and Robin help a coal mining town deal with the mine's cruel and greedy owner. It's a bit heavy handed, but makes its point fairly well. But it also makes one realize that perhaps Batman wasn't so well-suited to such stories.On the other hand, the three Joker stories are just about pitch perfect, as the Joker at this point was far more interested in building an audacious reputation than in actual mayhem. He usually patterned his crimes around games, puzzles, and clues. Naturally, after being a few steps behind for most of the story, Batman and Robin triumph in the final reel, and send the Joker off to jail.It also fascinating to see how much science fiction was grafted onto Batman this early on. To the modern reader, used to Batman as a relatively down-to-earth character, the notion of Batman and Robin time-traveling via hypnosis to pal around with Robin Hood will seem incredibly strange. On the other hand, Batman battling it out with a ghost in a library will perfectly consistant.Given that the archives are quickly approaching 1948, the generally accepted end date of the golden age of super-hero comics, I wonder if DC will be calling it a day, or will they keep going into the fifties, when the sci-fi elements took over completely, and the remaining darkness vanished until the late sixties. I'll probably still get them regardless."},{"Title":"Pennsylvania Snacks","review":"Pennsylvania Snacks\\" is a treasure . . . for parents, for grandparents, and for adults of all ages who enjoy offbeat activities.For an outing, if you take kids to the movies, and they may remember it for months.

It's been more than one hundred years since Huck Finn was first published, since that time there's been very little improvement in man's character.We still see the same things: theft, dishonesty, riots, war, slavery, child abuse, superstition, hypocrisy, murder, and fear! Though pessimistic, Twain does see some good in man's character, just not much.Since the writing of this book, we've seen the abolishment of slavery (which I think was the reason for Twain writing this story), though we are still fighting the stigma of the prejudices caused by it!We've got all same character flaws, and the best we can say for ourselves is that we still have some of the same redeeming characteristics that Huck had: Loyalty, friendship, sincerity, and love. These may not be much, but they are enough for hope for the future.These are the things that can help us to grow and progress, as Huck did.

He certainly opened his first notebook on the subject in 1837, and the idea of natural selection as the mechanism of evolutionary change came to him, after reading Malthus, in 1838.In 1842 he wrote what he called the \\"pencil sketch of my species theory\\", and in 1844 he wrote a fuller and more polished version, which he wanted published in the event of his death. These two essays are reproduced in this excellent book. They show that all the key ideas that Darwin made public in 1859 in \\"On the Origin of Species\\" had already been developed by him much earlier.Anyone who is tempted to take seriously the ridiculous conspiracy theory which claims that Darwin stole the theory of natural selection from Alfred Russel Wallace should read this book. Wallace certainly deserves credit for independently coming up with the same idea, but Wallace himself was always happy to play second fiddle to Darwin. For example, in 1908 Wallace made a speech to the Linnaean Society in which he explicitly defended Darwin's priority, pointing out that \\"...the idea occurred to Darwin in October 1838, nearly twenty years earlier than to myself (in February 1858); and that during the whole of that twenty years he had been laboriously collecting evidence...\\"Darwin seems to have delayed publishing for two reasons. Firstly, he wanted to establish himself as a serious scientist and to accumulate a mass of evidence in support of the theory before going into print. And secondly, he was nervous of the trouble it would stir up, especially in the pre-1850 period when social upheavals and Chartist radicals were associated with the idea of evolution.This book also shows that an error that Darwin made can also be traced back to these two early essays. Despite coming up with natural selection as the mechanism for evolution, Darwin mistakenly gave a subsidiary role to the Lamarckian idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. There are a few Lamarckian lapses in \\"On the Origin of Species\\"; and \\"The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals\\", for example, is full of them.Here in the 1844 essay Darwin writes: \\"There is reason to believe that when long exercise has given to certain muscles great development, or disuse has lessened them, that such development is also inherited.\\"But why should we expect Darwin's thinking to be perfect? Nothing was known of modern genetics at that time. Darwin is one of my heroes; but he is a flawed hero, and that makes him all the more appealing.Finally, we can even trace back to the 1842 sketch, almost word-for-word, the well-known ending of \\"On the Origin of Species\\". The 1842 version is:\\"There is a simple grandeur in the view of life with its powers of growth, assimilation and reproduction, being originally breathed into matter under one or a few forms, and that whilst this our planet has gone circling on according to fixed laws, and land and water, in a cycle of change, have gone on replacing each other, that from so simple an origin, through the process of gradual selection of infinitesimal changes, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been evolved.\\"Phil Webster(England)"},{"Title":"Mott's Illustrated Catalog of Victorian Plumbing Fixtures for Bathrooms and Kitchens","review":"Motts victorian plumbing fixtures book is a very neat book to read about early plumbing fixtures for your kitchen &amp; bathroom.

As the survivors of the PANAY rowed ashore in their lifeboats, they were shot at from Japanese ground troops. The incident was a footnote in the Japanese battle for Nanking. Nor was this the only attack against a neutral power during the aptly named Rape of Nanking.Sadly, many have forgotten this event. The Panay Incident by Hamilton Darby Perry is an extremely well written popular history of the event. Based primarily on interviews of this event, it is, perhaps, the only book still available, if not still in print.The only critique that I have of this excellent book is that it fails to footnote the interviews and other sources of information. As a popular history, lack of such academic details are probably not a true failing, but as the only book on the event it is disheartening to think how difficult it might be to reconstruct the research for a more rigorous study.There are many things to learn from this event. First, the Japanese were greatly concerned about a \\"Remember the Maine\\" reaction. They engaged in a government sponsored (as opposed to government supported) letter writing campaign that showed great tact and skill in manipulating popular opinion in the United States. Second, the reaction of the American people to the event was amazing. Rather than the rage that would accompany Pearl Harbor, most Americans - about 75% in one Pew poll - questioned exactly what we were doing in China that was worth American lives and if it was possible to get businesses and missionaries out before they pulled the United States into a meaningless land war in Asia. Third, the level of technology in 1937 was far from what the U S, and even Japan for that matter, could bring to bear in 1945. Biplanes and radio communications that routinely failed for up to 36 hours were the norm.This is an excellent book about an understudied event. Many historians have disregarded the Panay incident because it had no effect on either Japanese or American strategies or policies. However, if one looks at Japanese strategy starting with the Sino-Japanese War through 1945, this event is an important marker as the level of violence and the need to dominate the Asian mainland continued to grow."},{"Title":"The Panay incident;: Prelude to Pearl Harbor","review":"I am halfway through this book dealing with an incident that took place some 4 years before Pearl Harbor: the deliberate sinking of an American gunboat in China by Japanese fighter planes.

This is a very well-written account about an almost forgotten incident in US history."},{"Title":"America and Political Islam: Clash of Cultures or Clash of Interests?","review":"Overall Reaction:Simply put, this is the most lucid work on the political Middle East and \\"the way it is, how it got there, and what to do about it\\" that I have seen. I understood everything Mr. Gerges had to say and could not help but be persuaded by his understated style and crystalline presentation. Written with respect for his reader (he never speaks patronizingly) he so clearly elucidates his points with well presented examples that the book becomes not only a compelling written account of his thought, but an excellent reference work. One does not need to absorb the whole book in order to arrive at valuable insight, although a thorough reading is recommended. In addition to the many keen observations he makes, he gives suggestions, clear, concrete suggestions, as to what to do with the problems outlined. I find this refreshing. Many books I have read recently project a good deal of frustration (although probably deserved) while others focus on what has gone wrong or been done wrong. Mr. Gerges collects his points of reference, tells us their histories and creates a map as to where things can be taken and put into order. Mr. Gerges presents his compelling reasoning along with a great deal of information (both in the text and in his extensive footnoting) all captured in a clear, calm approach.How I will use this book in my further studies:It is useful as a reference book as specific issues can easily be extracted for argument. I intend on both referring to this work in my writing with politicians and to keep up on Mr. Gerges's work to see what new insights he provides.The book's main points:We (the polled majority of the US at least since the Iranian Revolution in 1981) still hold the Arab Muslim in a negative stereotype as violent and Islam as a \\"hostile culture\\". He demonstrates that the US has never had a consistent policy, show of policy, thought process or self-knowledge of the Middle East. The west keeps reacting as if it were dealing with a (possibly) trained lion, in awe of its beauty, happy it has not jumped on us yet, and holding a gun at the ready in case it does. The west has never welcomed the Mid-East as a full member of modern society, it seems. As to our prejudices, he rightly points out the undeserved knee jerk reaction after the Oklahoma City bombing where numerous attacks on \\"Mid Easterners\\" were reported immediately after that bombing.US Officials deny there is tie between media presentation, news and US Policy. I think there is ample evidence available that pretty well challenges that assumption especially when you look at the cumulative effect of media-news as well as media-entertainment on popular assumptions. Gary Sick's given quote: \\"We are all prisoners of our own cultural assumptions \\" is particularly to the point here, but it begs the question, \\"If we are prisoners, who is holding the key that will free us from mis-information?\\"The book was written before the current situations, but his assessment of how we formerly backed the leaders we are now bombing when they were fighting the Soviet Union, and many other such observations, is still enlightening and relevant.The Middle East, oddly, seems to be the Swamp of Politics. Wherever we step, there are bogs and tangled roots and mire and muck. If so, it is a swamp we have helped create. We have seemingly never dealt honestly with the Mid East and so we keep finding ourselves caught up in a matted tangle of former policies and legacies. We have been ambiguous at best and harmful (kindly put) to the development of good ongoing relations between the west and Middle East. It is as if we do not expect them to notice that we do not like or trust them very much, except for their oil. One of our ambassadors even said, \\"Islam is a conquering religion threatening the American way of life \\" although that Ambassador did stress that most US policy makers did not share his view.The west views the Middle East as backward. The west cannot seem to get its head around the reality of a clerically dominated regime. We do handle the idea of the Pope, though. Maybe this is because the army of His Eminence is small.Mr. Gerges points out the continual duplicity of governments: What they create, what they portray and what they are willing to do to keep the truth of one from another is the unfortunate, resource-consuming, status quo. It seems that one of the most pervasive issues the western world must learn to deal with is its confusion over how a people can live with a different cultural base of reference then the western model.His brilliant step-by-step analysis of the unique histories of many of the Middle Eastern nations and their potentials (for benefice and for ill) is particularly well laid out. The Middle East is a region, but also a collection of countries. He gives us good access points into the machinery of the way things are so we can at least have the option and chance to do what we can for the best interest of all involved.It is my conclusion that the oft-used political phrase of \\"clash of cultures\\" is not accurate. However, because of this book, I see it as much more of a clash of wills and belief in the right of one way to exist over, as opposed to along side of, others. Differing cultures can co-exist, but the will to be dominant, to have one's \\"ways\\" proved correct is what cannot be sustained. This book by Fawaz A. Gerges is at least an offered tool to help correct and improve the situation.GregRobin SmithRedHorse &amp; Ridire Reviewsrobin@knightstour.orgPlease write me if you wish the whole review (including page # references)"},{"Title":"America and Political Islam: Clash of Cultures or Clash of Interests?","review":"Although published in 1999 toward the end of the Clinton presidency, America and Political Islam sheds a lot of light on the attack on the twin towers in 2001. Focussing on U.S. foreign policy toward various aspects of the Islamic resurgence and how it has changed both through time and in different places puts recent events into a broader context that is sorely missing from many analyses. The book's investigation begins with the Iranian Revolution and covers four presidencies: Carter, Reagan, Bush I, and Clinton.It tackles head on the climate after the end of the Cold War, noting that an over-easy replacement of the \\"red menace\\" of Communism with the \\"green menace\\" of Islam explains surprisingly much. It also tackles the tendency to conflate the \\"Iran problem\\" with the \\"Islam problem\\" which has often led to inappropriate responses to current situations.The largest contribution the book makes is in sketching out how much U.S. foreign policy is constrained by Congress and public opinion. Our presidential administrations would probably have made much more nuanced, relevant, and accomodationist responses to various situations related to Islam if they had not been cornered by powerful congressmen with simplistic black and white views of the world. A secondary contribution is pointing out the very many places where the U.S. in dealing with Islam says one thing but does something different."},{"Title":"America and Political Islam: Clash of Cultures or Clash of Interests?","review":"This book analyzes how America reacts to Islamic political parties. It is an interesting book, but not without some slight shortcomings.- The title is misleading. This is not a book about political Islam at all. Only a book about how the US interacts with Islamic political parties and movements. The difference? Going in the other direction, the motivation of Muslims in interacting with the US are not covered much at all.- There isn't much critical analysis of what Islam might have done to provoke US hostility. For example, only one paragraph mentions in that, yes, female US voters may very well resent the perceived treatment of women.- Very little coverage of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Granted, Pakistan and Afghanistan became subjects of interest after 9/11, but the US tacit acceptance of Saudi Arabia's seriously messed up government should have been included. Neither is there much coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflicts and its impact on US policy.- This is a very dry, academic book. Not much in there is going to be really news to the informed layman, but it does review the facts and interpret them. On the other hand, if you aren't familiar with Middle East affairs already, this book will not hold your hand much.- The author often theorizes that, if only Muslims achieved material wealth, the religious intolerance displayed by some would magically disappear and they would all become tolerant. That is certainly possible, but unproven. The US is quite wealthy, yet the hardcore Christian ideology displayed by some of its citizens makes non-American Westerners quite uneasy. Religious tolerance and wealth go well together, but do not have to co-exist.OK, for the good points:- Dispassionately analyzes both the official statements of the US government and the actual acts by the government. Basically, the US, pre-2001, is caught between 2 urges. First a certain sympathy for disenfranchised Middle Easterners and a desire to avoid needlessly antagonizing Muslims. Second, an instinctive distrust of popular movement that might topple its allies. The closer the ally, the more the US will back repressive governments. This being illustrated by the case study of Egypt (which is a close ally w.o oil) vs. Algeria (a remote concern, even with its oil reserves).- As it is written before 9/11, it gives a sense of what was going before our current troubles and the book is much more neutral than what has followed.- A good reminder that prudent US administrations might be more accommodating towards non-violent Islamic parties, even at the cost of taking a harder line towards its allies. Basically, unconditionally propping up unpopular governments can blow up in your face - witness Iran. And the world really does need successful, tolerant Muslim countries with governments who care about their citizens.- Turkey is used as a reminder that moderate Islam is not an oxymoron. Turkey is not without its human rights flaws, but Muslim parties have not initiated past Turkish repressions.- Iran is also taken as a test study and the lack of useful US engagement with that country is much deplored. Yet, the author fails to note that the Iran was in flagrant violation of civilized behavior between nation states over centuries when it came to not respecting diplomatic immunity. Normally, the first step towards normalization is opening embassies. So how does one deal with a country with Iran's recent history? For all that, US policy seems unproductive, well on par with its relations with Cuba."},{"Title":"America and Political Islam: Clash of Cultures or Clash of Interests?","review":"Even though written in '99, this is great background analysis for the lay person on Islam versus \\"The West\\" even today.

However, two crayons are excluded throughout the book--purple and blue. These colors are never mentioned in the text although the illustrations depict blue standing off to the side looking sad, and purple moping in the crayon box. After each color has been shown the plan for him, they all dance and are happy, because the creator has a plan for them. Then the attention turns to blue. &quot;Blue was sad because he thought the creator had forgotten him. But it was blue who forgot to trust the creator, for the creator said...'Blue, I have saved you for last. You will be the color of the sea... and of the sky that covers all.' And Blue was happy because the creator had a plan for blue. All of the colors were happy.&quot; This concludes the book, and purple never leaves the box. So, I owned this book as a child and I really thought the creator had no use for purple. I mean he actually says, &quot;Blue I saved you for last&quot; so that's the end of that right? Some of my friends tell me that the book is supposed to teach children to make that leap of faith and assume that the creator has a plan for purple that will be realized soon sometime in the near future, but I think this book is much too ambiguous for children.

Not only are the various Classical sources fully present, but the post-Classical life of Cleopatra is well represented, as found, for example in Chaucer Shakespeare, and Dryden. The views of female authors on Cleopatra, such as and Charlotte Bronte are represented. The \\"Egyptomania\\" of the nineteenth century ( e.g. Shelly's Ozymandias), Cleopatra in the Arabic tradition (including a passage in which Octavian dies, bitten by snake, soon after he learns of Cleopatra's death) and Afrocentric views of Cleopatra, and more modern Cleopatras, such as that of Barbara Chase-Riboud, are also represented. These passages are given brief introductions which provide the necessary context. There are also illustrations and even maps and genealogical tables. And because this book grew out of course Dr. Jones helped develop at Bryn Mawr, it is structured so as to be useful, not only for courses in Cleopatra or the Augustan Age, but for a wide variety of courses in Classics and the Classical tradition.

The evolution of her story is also an interesting read. My only problems with the book came from the charts and maps at the end. The Ptolemaic family tree, though abbreviated, is also inaccurate.

There are some great story source books (e.g. THE STORYTELLERS SOURCEBOOK (s) of Margeret Macdonald) out there, but we needed one from the Jewish world of stories. Many of these other source books are incomplete when it comes to finding Jewish stories for all ages.This is an outstanding and very easy resource to use. I especially like the \\"age appropriate\\" index (\\"Appendix: Story Recommendations for All Ages\\") apparatus. And having a title index and a subject index, not to mention organizing the stories under topic headings in the first place makes this book a very helpful resource for storytellers, teachers and parents (and/or anyone just looking for good Jewish stories for reading or listening).The brief one paragraph descriptions are just great! They include enough about the story that if you have another version or know the story, they serve as excellent outlines or brief reminders of the stories for purposes of telling. They are well written and include enough about the story to give a good idea if you want to find it and do more with it.This is also an excellent bibliogrpahy and after each story, she includes a little section \\"How Else This Story is Told\\", which includes a sampling of other versions and where they can be found.One small caveat or nitpick there: I would have liked to have had more reference material for classic rabbinic (E.g. The Talmud) sources when availible in the section \\"How Else This Story is Told\\". For example, she doesn't always include the classic rabbinic sources there. And when she does, she just writes, \\"In the Babylonian Talmud\\" or \\"In the Talmud\\". Sharon Barcan Elswit is the head librariain of a Jewish school in Manhattan; surely she could have found these references.However, as I say, it is a nitpick, because you can find these references in many of the sources she DOES list (i.e. if you get one of the books she lists as a source of the story, many of these authors and editors will list exactly where it can be found in the Talmud or classic Midrash), not to mention that with an online serach engine, or a CD-ROM of rabbinic sources (such as Davka's JUDAIC CLASSICS), once you know they are there, they are very easy to find. You can also use THE BOOK OF LEGENDS and/or EIN YAAKOV and look the stories up their indexes and both of these are also availible on CD-ROM.All in all, I am very grateful this book exists and for me as a storyteller and a rabbi, it is well worth the money. I highly recommend it to anyone involved in storytelling, folk culture and Jewish learning for all ages. I look forward to future editions."},{"Title":"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions","review":"&quot;Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions&quot;, by Eric J. Wittenberg, is an important new book on the Gettysburg Campaign. It covers, in much detail and under one cover, the vital cavalry actions which occurred on the southern fields of that battle which so long have remained obscure to most Civil war enthusiasts.This isn't more Gettysburg &quot;fluff&quot; or rehashed stories to sell a book; far from it. &quot;Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions&quot; is a riveting, well-researched narrative of the heroic operations of several of the Union's fastest rising cavalry &quot;stars&quot; at that monumental conflict.While Custer fought on the more well-known &quot;East Cavalry Field&quot; against JEB Stuart, Wesley Merritt and Elon Farnsworth performed no less brilliantly against Southern forces south and west of Little Round Top.In a number of vicious clashes between cavalry and Rebel infantry, Farnsworth displayed unmatched heroism while Merritt gave Mea! de a possible yet fleeting opportunity to damage Lee's army severely after the repulse of Pickett's Charge.Any Civil War cavalry buff will want to read this story. But, for all Gettysburg enthusiasts, it should be considered &quot;required reading&quot; as it fills-in nicely an area of battle historiography which has long been neglected. You can't lose on this one!Theodore C. Mahr. Former National Park Service Historian. Author of: &quot;The Battle of Cedar Creek: Showdown in the Shenandoah...&quot; and forthcoming works on the Cavalry Battles of the Overland Campaign."},{"Title":"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions","review":"Few know that the Gettysburg campaign did not end with the famous Picketts Charge. There was three cavalry actions during or after Picketts Charge. This book vividly describes these three actions. It describes Farnsworth's Charge and a whole chapter on the brave soldier, Elon Farnsworth and the great controversy surrounding his death. It also includes Merritt's Regulars on South Cavalry Field and the Battle of Fairfield."},{"Title":"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions","review":"A great book that dispels the notion that the heroes at Gettysburg are all remembered today. The reader will never forget the description of the ill fated charge led by Farnsworth at the insistence of Justin Kilpatrick. Very easy to read and engrossing."},{"Title":"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions","review":"I picked up Eric Wittenberg's \\"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions\\" half expecting a rehash of the epic fight between George Custer and Jeb Stuart at Rummel's Farm on the 3rd Day of the Battle. Indeed I was humming \\"Garry Owen\\" to myself until I opened the book.Witrenberg gives the reader a fascinating account of the Union cavalry assaults led by Wesley Merritt and Judson \\"Kilcavalry\\" Kilpatrick on the Confederate Left flank at the time of the repulse of Pickett's Charge, and culminating in Kilpatrick's insane decision to send Elon Farnsworth and his brigade to charge across a fenced-in, rocky terrain on the slopes of the Round Tops, a charge that ended in the decimation of the Union cavalry and the heroic death of Farnsworth.The new ground covered here is Wittenberg's strong assertion that if the cavalry had not been sent in piecemeal, Merritt's men charging on foot just west of the Emmitsburg Road, and the doomed charge of Farnsworth towards the Confederates entrenched by the Round Tops, but had been sent in together, the Confederate line would have been turned, and with Union cavalry pouring through, Pickett's retreat might have turned into a full rout of the Army of Northern Virginia - and even the surrender of Lee on the Gettysburg Battlefield. Indeed, as Wittenberg points out, Merritt's charge actually did turn the flank of the Confederate line for a short time, but without support either from Kilpatrick or Union Infantry on the Round Tops it was doomed to fail.Whether or not one buys Wittenberg's premise, he provides the Civil War and particularly Gettysburg student with new insights and food for thought. While Custer's battle with Stuart is very well known, and even Farnsworth's charge merits a few sentences in most Gettysburg histories, the details of Merritt's operations are almost completely unknown.To be sure, this is a slim volume that did not run in a precise chronological narrative. The reader has to switch chapters back and forth to see what Merritt was doing at a particular time, or what Kilpatrick was doing at that same time. Instead Wittenberg had Farnsworth's charge, the climax of the cavalry operations near the beginning of the book, while Merritt's assault, which took place a few hours earlier, is near the end of the book. Good maps, again not in chronological order, and many illustrations hitherto not seen by this reader. Also Wittenberg casts light on the bloody sideshow at Fairfield between the 6th U.S. Cavalry and Confederate cavalry under the irascible \\"Grumble\\" Jones, an affair that ended the killing and capture of the majority of this elite Union unit. Merritt had diluted the potency of his force by sending these men, whose services would have been much more valuable on South Cavalry field, on a foolhardy search for Confederate supply wagons, and instead they ended up running into a Rebel beehive."},{"Title":"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions","review":"Coming into Gettysburg from the south you will find cavalry markers on the roadside, most will drive by eager to get to the \\"good stuff\\" on Cemetery Hill. Very few that stop know about or understand the nasty little action fought in the fields in front of them. On July third, the Union Cavalry face Longstreet's regulars under command of Evander Law. The Union Cavalry probed, pushed and finally attacked the AoNV's right flank in the ill-advised Farnsworth's Charge. This small book covers the almost forgotten battles in this area. Eric J. Wittenberg has given as a readable and informative book on this aspect of the Battle of Gettysburg. Coupled with \\"Protecting the Flank: The Battles for Brinkerhoff' Ridge and East Cavalry Field\\" this book gives one of the most detailed accounts of the Union Cavalry on July 2 - 3, 1863."},{"Title":"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions","review":"I picked up this study of cavalry action at Gettysburg because of an interest in Elon John Farnsworth, and Wittenberg devotes two chapters to the boy general and his ill-fated charge on the third day of battle. But I was pleasantly surprised by the chapter on the battle at south cavalry field, which I knew very little about (the east cavalry field battle usually getting all the attention), and the battle of Fairfield, which I knew absolutely nothing about. After reading about the Fairfield conflict, I immediately hopped in my car and headed toward the village (I live in Gettysburg) to scout out the site.Wittenberg's prose, contrary to the criticism of one of the reviewers here, is fluid and highly readable. I may disagree with some of his conclusions--for example, it's not at all as clear to me as it is to him that Farnsworth didn't commit suicide when he was mortally wounded by Confederate infantry--but I respect his skills as an author and a researcher. He stands in the fine tradition of nonprofessional historians who've done so much fine work on the Civil War.Hopefully, a new printing of Wittenberg's book will see the light of day. Used copies are scarce, and so their prices are generally sky-high and prohibitive.Finally, the line-drawn maps in the book are pretty good--a real plus for readers like myself who don't have especially good imaginations when it comes to visualizing terrain."},{"Title":"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions","review":"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions, Wittenberg, Eric J., Thomas Publications, paperback, 182 pp., photographs, maps, notes, index, 1998, $12.95The cavalry actions at Gettysburg are often reduced to Buford's Federal Cavalry Division defending itself from attacks from Heth's Confederate Division. Some narratives give a nod to the July 3rd cavalry fight, between Gregg and Stuart east of Gettysburg, especially as it relates to the Pickett, Pettigrew, Trimble Charge. Less frequently, the Federal cavalry charge on the Confederate right flank is discussed as a coda to the famed CSA charge on the Federal center. This book focuses upon the Federal cavalry attacks on the Confederate right on July 3rd: Farnsworth's Charge, Merritt's Charge, south of the Big Round Top and Starr's 6th U.S. Cavalry Charge at Fairfield, eight miles into the Confederate rear.A reader who approaches this book as a story of Gettysburg cavalry triva, would be in errror. This work is the story of remarkable and heroic soldiers ordered into unplanned battles that occurred on the Confederate right flank after the Pickett- Pettigrew-Trimble Charge. The outcome of this late afternoon July 3rd fight set in part the tenor of the Federal pursuit on July 5th.The author sets the stage for these climatic and crucial fights: two engagements of Federal cavalry versus Confederate infantry on the Rebel right and one engagement of Federal cavalry versus Confederate cavalry in the Rebel rear. Wiitenberg is thorough and brief in his presentation; the key officers, the terrain, the condition of the troops engaged and their weapons are concisely presented. The conflicts are illustrated with clear, well drawn maps. An ample number of portaits of officers, monuments, farmsteads, and terrain accompany the text. The strategic situation of July 3rd is covered as are the personalities of the leaders. Personal accounts of the battles from the rank and file are generous in number and appropriate the moving the action forward in the book.The laziness of Major General Alfred Pleasanton, commander of the Federal cavalry of the Army of the Potomac is revealed. The rashness of Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick, commander of the 3rd Federal cavalry division is described. The heroic attributes of Brigadier Generals Wesley Merritt and Elon Farnsworth are presented. The question of Farnsworth suicide in order to escape capture is thoroughly grounded in both USA and CSA eyewitness reports. The story of the two troopers who won Medals of Honor at Fairfield leaves this reader asking for recognition for these heroics on this particular battlefield.Infantrymen and artillerymen are not neglected in this book. It is refreshing to have Confederate diarists quoted in describing their enemy's assaults. The bravery of Law's Alabamians, Robertson's Texans, and Anderson's Georgians, supported by CSA artillerymen is equal to their Federal counterparts. Wittenberg's writing style is both clear and concise. No extra information pads the book; no essential information is left out. The book is not a tourguide with maps and designated stops, though it works well as such; the accompanying maps are not vague and the photographs of the monuments allow the reader to use it as a tourguide. This reviewer recommends this book to both the casual reader and those who subscribe to Gettysburg Magazine. It is essential reading for anyone taking the Licensed Battlefield Guide exam."},{"Title":"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions","review":"This book is lacking in length and in depth of analysis. To say this book is 144 pages long is stretching things. The Epilogue ends on page 104; at least 20 pages (a conservative estimate, I think) before this are occupied by maps and/or photos. This leaves only about 85 pages of text. In reality, GETTYSBURG'S FORGOTTEN CAVALRY ACTIONS resembles a lengthy article more than it does a book.

It is hard to read, and offers little reward upon completion. By the time I finished this 200 page book, I no longer cared what happened to the characters.

The characters are compellingly physical-- they do things that real people do, like check their pits for smell, that people in books rarely do. They are polymorphously perverse.

Hicks' ably brings to bear the covenental symbolism Jesus purposefully gives the Lord's Supper. From its relationship to the passover in particular, to the relationship between altar sacrifice and the ensuing table fellowship this book offers much insight into the desire of God for communion with and among His people.* Hicks' historical survey of meals in both the Old and the New Testaments is a highlight of the book and provides the structure for most of it. His exegesis of pertinent passages is accurate, as noted, but the discerning reader will struggle to find examples of ignoring context, inspite of gallantknight's warnings. I find it strange that he would list Hicks' treatment of Acts 2:46 as an example of denying context, when the author's exposition of this verse was based solely on the immediate context. Those who would deny a reference to the Lord's Supper in that particular verse must wrest it from the text to disallow the clear flow of thought and terminology found in verse 42.In this book Hicks' unapologetically presents an image of the Lord's supper that stands in stark dissonance to the practice of most contemporary traditions. This in several ways is a brave move for someone with a heritage in the Restoration Movement, as it invites(?!) criticism like that from gallantknights. Motives impugned and monikers like \\"change-agent\\" cast... (What on earth is \\"change-agent language\\"???? It must have been too subtle for me to pick up!)The strength of this book lies not so much in uniqueness, (more and more scholars acknowledge the early practice of a fellowship-meal Lord's Supper) but in its call for a thorough rethink of firstly the theological foundation of the LS, it's purpose, and how that is reflected in our modern practice, if it is at all.Come to the Table is not without its weaknesses. Dr Hicks, I think, was quite aware of most of them when he penned the preface and detailed its purpose. Some more groundwork for the practice of the early church could have been detailed, but where that was light Hick's leaves a healthy bibliography for further study!"},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper is an interesting treatise concerning the manner in which the Eucharist is observed in modern Christianity. This book takes the reader through a journey from the Scriptural attestation, a brief early Christian witness, and a modern application in 205 short pages. John Mark Hicks' treatment of this debated, diversely observed, and often divisive issue is fair-minded and communicated in a conversing manner. Come to the Table invites the reader to do just that, come and dine with the master, who is host of the table.The Table discussion has long been a controversial subject amongst believers. The debate of trans-substantiation vs. con-substantiation has raged for ages. Zwingli and Luther debated the manner in which the table was conducted and sparked a reformation dialog the carried on for centuries. Is it really that simple? Or is it actually much simpler? Some questions that lack answers normally, receive an admirable treatment in Come to the Table. Some of them include,* What is discerning the body?* What is eating and drinking unworthily?* What is the table of demons and the table of the Lord?I really enjoyed this book for it scriptural substance. Hicks is very purposeful in painting the picture of what the Lord's Table was according to Luke, Acts, and 1 Corinthians. You begin to find yourself seated at table with not only the Lord and his disciples, but also with those whom Paul is addressing in Corinth. Giving data from the Old Covenant, showing more clearly the data of the New, and modernizing our approach for today all come together quite well. I also really enjoyed the audacity that Hicks demonstrates by taking the road less traveled and taking the debate out the picture by stating pretty plainly what scripture is saying.If I could have my druthers with this book, I would opt for a more systematic approach to the topic. I am not sure that it could do the subject justice, but that tends to be my reading preference anyway. Of all the systematic deductions I have read, this book has gone an extra mile by delivering a simple, logical, and plain view without mucking it all up with presuppositions to support.This book was much worth the read and if you are interesting in learning more about the Lord's table, maybe even 'revisioning' it, then this book will get you started. Hicks also provides a bit of a practical application guide for believers or congregations who are currently exploring the topic and looking for an example to kick things off with.Hope you enjoy it, I did!"},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"This is a must read for pastors and congregations alike, who have lost the \\"communion\\" of the \\"Lord's Table\\". Luke says in Acts 2:46 that \\"they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts....\\" Does this sound like the silent, solemn, individualistic celebrations we have in our churches today? John Mark Hicks' reflection in his book is found throughout the First and Second Testaments. As Congregations we need to revisit the original meaning \\"Lord's Supper\\" according to biblical and theological values as found in \\"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper\\" by John Mark Hicks. As a pastor I needed to read the book and so has my congregation.The Reverend Sigmund Podlozny, Jr., MDiv, PastorFaith United Community ChurchDewey, Arizona"},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"Come to the Table is an outstanding treatment of what the scope of Scripture reveals concerning the original purposes of the Lord's Supper. The author sets the Communion meal in the context of other sacred meals that God shared with his people in earlier times and that Jesus shared during his ministry. He also examines the relevant texts from the epistles and puts them in their original context so that the reader is able to hear what the apostle was really getting at. The author interacts with both Scripture and current church practice, comparing and contrasting the two. He writes with great respect for both, yet also with the candor to suggest that current practice needs to be reshaped by Scripture. The book is scholarly and full of careful exploration of biblical passages, yet it is also readily accessible to the average person.For those who realize that, in spite of our good intentions, time and custom often lead us gradually away from the original intent of church practices, Dr. Hicks does the reader a great service in recovering from Scripture the full richness of the Supper as Jesus intended it. That is, Communion was originally a reverent yet celebrative meal in which the participants interacted with each other and shared their joy in Christ's salvation. It was given to the church to deepen our sense of fellowship as we encourage and commune with each other as well as with the Lord who saved us, rather than a time for soberly withdrawing into private meditation. Dr. Hicks also gives a good deal of attention to the fact that the mood of the meal was originally one of expressed joy and deep gratitude in what Jesus accomplished more than a sorrowful and guilt-ridden recounting of the agony that we caused him.Dr. Hicks concedes that many believers will resist the message of this book because they have grown to deeply value the private, deep introspection that they spend in silence with God during Communion. Having such moments is indeed crucial to spiritual life, and it can be relocated into other contexts. But he argues that Jesus' followers should recognize and desire the blessing that he intended for us to receive, and that the early church did receive, in the rich, Christ-centered conversation and interaction at his Table."},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"The strengths of this book are its breadth, readability and pragmatic approach. Hicks looks at the Lord's Supper through several major lenses--biblical, theological, historical, ecclesiastical and practical. His writing style is very lucid and smooth. Perhaps the strongest part of the book comes near the end when Hicks answers several common questions about the Lord's Supper and offers several practial suggestions and ideas for implementing appropriate changes. The only weakness of the book is that it is not particularly concise, particularly in the early chapters. Overall, this book offers virtually everything one could expect from an author on the subject in less than 200 pages."},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"My church (Church of Christ) went through a two-month long series of sermons using this book as a guide and framework and what came out of it was a reconfiguration of the Supper as a time of fellowship around the table. We have come to appreciate the richness of the Lord's Supper which though a simple meal encapsulates the multi-dimensions and depths of the gospel story. Set in the context of the church's liturgy, the time of Communion takes on a different character each Sunday as a different event of the Christ's story is read and reflected on.John Mark Hicks rightly points us to the focus of the meal as Communion, which is the divine creative intent as well as the eschatological goal of the redemption story. Beginning from the creation narrative through the sacrifices in Israel, the table-fellowships of Jesus, the discussion of the Lord's Supper in Paul's letters and the development of the table in church history, Hicks gives us a grand overview of how the Lord's Supper stands within the rich tradition of God's people, ancient and new, as a central practice that anticipates the perfect communion at the marriage supper of the Lamb.He contends as his central thesis that the 'altar' perspective that has shaped much of Western practice of the Lord's Supper which has tended towards private, penitential introspection should not have overshadowed the 'table' character of the Lord's Supper, which encourages oneness, interaction, hospitality, giving and sharing around a meal. To put it in geometric terms, the vertical orientation of the Lord's Supper should be balanced by the horizontal. Hicks makes the good point that while the cross is the ground for the Lord's Supper, it is the Resurrection that is the focal celebration. We sup at the table not so much to mourn at the foot of the cross, decrying how our sins have brought him there but to celebrate the victory of the Resurrection, as Christ tramples death under his feet!This is not to exclude the place of laments and confession (which should be there as we draw near as a people to the Holy and Sovereign God) but to really see the Lord's Supper as the culmination of worship and the declaration and experience of God's victory in Christ Jesus.I regard this book as an important milestone in the checkered history of the Restoration movement that has traditionally placed much emphasis on the frequency (weekly observance) of the Lord's Supper but has not delved much into its theological meanings or its transformative power. Brother John Mark has given us an invaluable gift with his lucid writing that combines theological depth with helpful practical inputs. Read this judicious book and be welcome to the table of mercy and grace!"},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"I know this looks like just another book you'd read in seminary, but it's not. This book has changed the way my entire church network gathers for Communion and Worship. Hicks takes you through the history of the OT and what it means to commune with God. I'll admit I was super against any other way of communion growing up mainstream evangelical here in Chicago suburbs, but this book makes very clear sense and logic in how God wants it to be.Eye opening. I borrowed this book from a friend, but I've bought one for myself, AND two other friends. Worth owning and reading and sharing!"},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"I was raised Catholic, but at the age of 22 joined a traditional church of Christ. Now at 51 (actually at 48 the transformation began) I have to readjust my understanding once again concerning the Lord's Supper. Thanks in large part to John Mark Hicks. I have read at least a dozen books on the subject over the years, but until I read Hicks my education was incomplete. He gives an excellent understanding of O.T. covenant meals and how this carries into the N.C. Lord's Supper. That it is a community covenant meal where the participants reaffirm their covenant faithfullness to God in Christ Jesus and to one another. That is the long and short of it, but due to grossly misunderstanding in particular I Cor 11, we have come to view the Supper as something purely symbolic. I would challange anyone to read this book (who holds the traditional view of the Supper) and not come away with a completely different view of the Supper. Based on Scripture and taking into account the historical social context of Corinth, Hicks explains I Cor 10 & 11 with clarity and precision without being to wordy. Read it and see, you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"Great book for anyone who has ever questioned why and how we take the Lord's supper and the significance of both."},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"This book is deep yet practical theology that when applied can transform God's people from people of ritual to people renewed by his presence. The theology is insightful and convincing. As an active Baptist note that this book is written from a Church of Christ perspective, and I truly wish it had been written to a broader audience as the theology in this book is solid and needs to be applied in all churches not just Churches of Christ.Having said that though, this book is a must read by all evangelicals who are thinking through the big question of \\"why\\" we do the things we do.Especially useful to church planters who want to see people transformed in the services by God's presence; wanting people to connect with each other in the service in real, theologically rich, and meaningful ways."},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"This indepth study on the Lord's Supper has given me a deeper understanding and love for the covenant meal that Christ has provided for the church. Sitting at The Lord's Table will never be the same again after reading this book. Instead it will be all that Christ has desired it to be."},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","review":"Dr. Hicks makes a very scholary presentation of his views on the Lord's Supper in the church of Christ. However, many of his points are based on Old Testament prescedent and scriptures taken out of context. His use of the word &quot;revision&quot; couldn't be more apt, as he is advocating a revision not only of tradition, but also a revision of the historical interpretation of the of Biblical example of the Lord's Supper and the meaning behind it.His overall survey of information has many factual statements, making it more difficult to discern the &quot;change agent&quot; language and suggestions scattered throughout. Hicks makes very liberal use of the words &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;community&quot;, leading one to wonder just how much he is advocating a change in the church that would lead to resembling the more charismatic evangelical denominations, which would go against what Christ taught in the New Testament.Hicks draws people in with a historical survey of the meals of the Jews in Old Testament times, which is impressively researched and presented fairly accurately. His interpretation of many of the scriptures is just as accurate. However, he uses certain scriptures out of context (like Acts 2:46) to support a flawed premise about the meaning of the Supper itself.Those who read this need to do so with Bibles open, and should be ready to test everything he says against the Truth of scripture."},{"Title":"History of the Indians of Connecticut from the earliest known period to 1850","review":"Very dry for fun reading but great for reports, etc. When I say dry I mean it won't be fun to read just for fun.

I could not put the book down. I was consumed with curiosity throughout the novel. Bravo to Rhonda Empson for a unique approach to life in the 12th Century. I felt as if I was in the midst of the action and was riveted until the very last page. I recommend it to all readers with a sense of compassion."},{"Title":"Only in My Dreams","review":"My favorite genre in romance is time travel. I've just about read every one of them out there. This book was very dichotomous for me. On one hand, I loved the characters Lea and Beyar -- they both had such great qualities in their personalities, and I enjoyed seeing how they would get together. The general storyline was solid -- a girl is thrown back to the 12th century and must adapt to the cultural mores and to Lord Beyar. I liked it enough to read the entire book, because I was curious to see how it would end. Overall, it had the makings of a 5-star book!The other side to this dichotomous book is where it earns the low amount of stars. There were spelling and grammatical errors galore! While reading this story, I grew frustrated that the author did not take more care in editing her work, or have a strong editor to review her work. Some of the spelling errors were just awful! Grammatically, if one is an award-winning author, one should be versed enough to know how commas are used, when words should be capitalized, and know that it is \\"just her and me\\" and not \\"just she and I.\\" The FIRST PAGE of the story had two spelling errors, which tipped me off that I might be starting a potential disappointment. Granted, this might be Empson's first major novel, but that is why more care should have been placed on this potentional masterpiece.Another flaw to the book -- minus the grammar and spelling -- was the lack of curiosity from Lord Beyar about Lea's past. If he were developing such strong feelings for her throughout the book, one would think he would want to know why she spoke differently, why she used slang and did not know any of the standard social customs of the 12th century. As a landowning lord of the 12th century, these men were very protective of their lands and their servants, so it came as quite a surprise that he never seemed to question where she came from (other than the pond where he found her). Furthermore, when Lord Richard disappeared at the end of the story, Beyar just blindly accepted that Lea was from 800 years in the future (no questioning whether she was sane or not) and that Richard was safe. Don't worry, there is a sequel to this book, so I'm not giving anything away.The interaction between Beyar and Lea at the beginning of the book was just downright tacky. Lea sounded like she was using all of her one-liner insults on Beyar, as if she were a comedian on Comedy Central. After a while the barbs became boring, due to the constant \\"machine gun fire\\" of put-downs coming from Lea. Beyar did not really do anything to merit such insults. Instead of Lea being insulting and sarcastic to her rescuer, she should have been more confused, unsure of where she was, and a little scared that she was in a new place with a man who has a big horse and a sharp sword.There were some great moments in this story! That is why it is so hard to give this book less stars than I would like. However, as a versed reader in time travel romances, I cannot help but be frustrated that Empson did not take more care in her book to ensure that it was a top-quality product before releasing it."},{"Title":"Only in My Dreams","review":"It is 1141 when Lord Bayard is surprised to find a drowning woman in a pond. Lea, who entered the pool in the twentieth century is just as surprised to realize Bayard is a knight, horse, sword, medieval dress and all. Thus begin the misguided adventures for modern Lea and medieval Bayard. She meets Richard of the lovely smile, Sara who causes her much jealousy, Logan who claims to be Bayard's father.Captured by the lecherous Logan; Lea is held in a dark, dreary old farmhouse, guarded by thugs and determines to escape. Fearing that Bayard is dead Lea manages to kill Logan, escape the hovel where she has been held and make her way back to the pond where she entered this world. Returning to modern times and her former job as a secretary holds little appeal, however, without Bayard Lea figures life in this world is as bleak. A raging whirlpool is the conduit between the two worlds. Richard and Bayard leap into the water in an effort to rescue Lea. One of them returns to modern times, while the other two remain in an earlier day.I like this type of \`from here to there and back again tale'.In Only In My Dreams Writer Empson has produced an estimable tale filled with dynamic characters, sure fire attention grabbing dialogue, setting and intrigue. The notion that we might be able to move from time to time, space to space is an intriguing one. Some writers are able to pull it off more convincingly than others. Writer Empson's Only In My Dreams is a dandy read.Only In My Dreams is a pleasantly puzzling account at times filled with Lea and her modernistic slang, profanity and reasoning resonating off of Bayard and his medieval methodology, palaver and thinking. The premise might have proven difficult to carry off. Writer Empson pulls it all together with aplomb. Logan is a dastardly fellow, Lea a likeable gal who learns to make the most of situations and Bayard a hero of the old type.All together the book is a fun, entertaining romp to be enjoyed on a lazy afternoon.Reviewed by: molly martin"},{"Title":"Only in My Dreams","review":"Lea Raines makes a wish never realizing that sometimes they do come true...But her knight was nothing like she had imagined.Lord Bayard is a knight during the realm of King Stephan.

It is a board book, so it is safe to read and then hand to the baby. The pictures are taken from, without the longer story, the book by these authors, Stranger in the Woods. The birds and squirrels will likely look just like the ones the baby can see in his own backyard, and who doesn't love a beautiful deer? If you live with no snow, you get a good demonstration of what a snowman is.

The book immediately engaged them. As they listened, the children touched the pages again and again to connect to this source of light.

However he recently stated that the chemicals in marijuana make it too dangerous to be used as medicine. On his program, he strongly cautions against the recreational use of marijuana, occasionally devoting his show to \\"marijuana horror stories\\" and its claimed potential to ruin lives. He has authored a number of other books on various herbal medicine topics under this name. More recently, Savage's books are political in nature and published by WND Books, a partnership between the conservative website WorldNetDaily and Thomas Nelson, a publisher of Christian books.In January 2003 he published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times bestseller list earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The controversial book directs attacks at \\"media bias\\", the \\"dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'\\", gays, and liberals.Critics have faulted Savage for making a number of assertions in the book that he often fails to substantiate with facts or resources. Exacerbating this condition is the fact that the book itself has no index. The book is divided into two- to four-page sections, many of which are near-exact replicas to columns he published on the conservative site NewsMax.com.In January 2004, Savage published his second political book, The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His newest book, Liberalism is a Mental Disorder was released on April 12, 2005. Both of these books contained citations of nearly every assertion made, contrary to \\"The Savage Nation.\\"In January 2006, Savage announced that he would be releasing a new book, The Political Zoo, in mid-March. [8] The book will contain satirical profiles and cartoons of different people in politics as animals in the \\"Political Zoo\\" including one of Savage himself, who will be portrayed as the zookeeper. Savage has remarked that the book will be \\"easier to digest\\" than his previous political books.Books as Michael WeinerPlant a Tree, New York : Collier Books, 1975Bugs in Peanut Butter, Boston : Little, Brown, 1976.Man's Useful Plants, New York: Macmillan. 1976.Earth Medicine, Earth Food, New York : Macmillan Pub.

Michael Savage earned a Bachelor's from Queens College in education and sociology. He taught high school for several years in New York City. Following that, he earned two Master's degrees in ethnobotany and anthropology from the University of Hawaii. He then received a Ph.D. in nutritional ethnomedicine in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley. His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji. Savage spent many years researching botany in the South Pacific, and has a background in alternative medicine. He has stated he was a liberal at one time and never served in the military.Weiner was a friend of openly gay beat poet Allen Ginsberg, offering to arrange readings for Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti in 1972. [2] Some of his letters to Ginsberg are held in Ginsberg's archives and one of those letters describes an encounter with a young Fijian man. [3] Savage denies writing the letter and called it part of a \\"smear campaign\\" by \\"gay fascists\\". [4] Savage also once posed naked for a photograph with Ginsberg while swimming in Fiji. [5] Ferlinghetti views Weiner's reincarnation as Michael Savage as \\"total opportunism,\\" the crowning achievement of someone who was \\"always looking to make a fast buck\\" and \\"always trying to think up new schemes to get famous.\\"Michael Savage began his radio career in 1992 on San Francisco's #1 news/talk radio station KGO, first doing fill in work for other hosts, then getting his own show on the weekend. Two years later he was given a weekday show on KGO's sister station KSFO where he shared airtime with a liberal talk show host. He chose his \\"nom de voix\\" in \\"the Tonga Islands in the 1960s. I stumbled upon the name of a [19th-century] shipwreck who was locally infamous -Charles Savage. His exploits were legendary,\\" he said. \\"So the name was bouncing around in my head.\\" At the time, his slogan was \\"To the right of Rush, and to the left of God.\\" On January 1, 1995 he was given his own show during the drive-time hours. The show quickly became a local hit. In 1999, he came to the attention of the Talk Radio Network.On January 17, 2000 he started doing an additional two hours of radio which was broadcast nationally. For the next eight months, Savage would spend a total of five hours a day just talking. His national experiment was a success, and on September 21, 2000, he stopped doing separate shows, beginning a full three-hour national show. After just one year, he was in 150 markets. By 2003, he was in over 200 markets and is currently the No. 3 radio host in the United States.In June 2003, he had a salary dispute with his flagship station KSFO who refused to renegotiate his contract. He was off the air for three weeks. On July 1, 2003 he began his show on a different station: KNEW in San Francisco. Since that dispute, he speaks badly of KSFO and of \\"Vanity or Pretty Boy\\" Sean Hannity, whose show replaced his on the station. Savage also speaks pejoratively when referencing his fellow talk radio hosts or individuals with whom he disagrees (see List of Michael Savage neologisms).As of 2005, Savage has between 8 million and 10 million listeners per week. This makes his show the third most widely listened to broadcast in the United States.In 1996 he applied to be a dean at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. When he was not granted an interview due to lack of qualifications--less than two years of experience in radio, with a Ph.D. in epidemiology and nutrition science--Savage filed a discrimination lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. The position instead went to China scholar Orville Schell who, according to Weiner, was less qualified than himself.Savage was hired by MSNBC to do a one-hour show starting March 8, 2003. On July 7, a mere four months later, he was fired for making anti-gay remarks in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller \\"East Coast Bob.\\"Savage was doing an \\"Airline Horror Stories\\" piece, when Bob called into his show to talk about undercover security guards smoking in the bathroom. His next words were \\"Half hour into the flight, I need to suggest that Don and Mike should take your show so you can go to the dentist because your teeth are really bad\\". The words after \\"should\\" were bleeped out by a MSNBC exec, which would make one believe that the caller was actually making lewd comments about Savage's sexual orientation. Savage asked if he was a \\"sodomite\\", to which the caller answered \\"yes\\" . Savage then said to the caller: \\"Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig, how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig. You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage, you got nothing better to do today, go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on....no more calls? I don't care about these bums, they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.\\" [6]Before the show was canceled, MSNBC was replaying his show during primetime hours Saturday night; many believe the show would have been canceled even without his comments, and that MSNBC was simply looking for an excuse to dump the program due to pressure from special interest groups. Others point out that MSNBC has had poor programming and ratings performance for a long time and that many talk shows of all different political stripes have come and gone quickly on the network."},{"Title":"Best of the Savage Nation: 1994 - 1998 : Vol. 1","review":"At first glance, Michael Alan Weiner seems like an improbable candidate to be America's angriest, most vicious conservative radio host. Born 60 years ago in the Bronx, Weiner has lived in Northern California for most of his adult life, making a living as an herbalist and nutritionist. He communed with Fijian traditional healers, got married in a rain forest and studied ethno-medicine at the University of California at Berkeley. He swam naked with Allen Ginsberg, dreamed of being the next Lenny Bruce and wrote a rambling novel about a half-mad alter ego. His son's middle name is Goldencloud. For years, he made a name cranking out a pile of books on alternative medicine, recommending bizarre remedies such as using vitamin C to stop AIDS and kicking cocaine with coffee enemas.These days, Weiner's more interested in purging the body politic. Using the pseudonym Michael Savage, he's launched a one-man mission to save America from its enemies at home and abroad, which on any given day includes liberals, gays, academics, the homeless, the Clintons, immigrants, feminists, CNN, the American Civil Liberties Union, Muslims and other minorities. Broadcasting three hours a day, five afternoons a week, from a rented studio in downtown San Francisco, he gives voice to the right wing's darkest fantasies. He muses about launching preemptive nuclear strikes on the Middle East (\\"I wish to God the hatches were open and the missiles were flying!\\"), suggests gunning down illegal immigrants (\\"If we had a government, we'd blow them out of the desert with airplanes!\\"), dreams of dispatching with \\"commies, pinkos and perverts\\" and other undesirables (\\"I say round them up and hang 'em high!\\") and even paraphrases a remark attributed to Nazi leader Hermann Goering (\\"When I hear someone's in the civil rights business, I oil up my AR-15!\\")Woe be unto those who label him racist, sexist or homophobic -- or even worse, threaten his livelihood. When an Oregon group started a boycott of his advertisers last summer, he became downright apoplectic. \\"I'm more powerful than you are, you little hateful nothings!\\" he screeched, before intoning darkly in his trademark New-Yawk accent: \\"I'm gonna warn you again: If you harm me -- and I pray that no harm comes to you -- but I can't guarantee that it won't.\\" Just last week, Savage fumed about the \\"brownshirt groups\\" who dare to criticize him: \\"You stinking rats who hide in the sewers! ... You think I'm going to roll over like a pussy? You're wrong!\\"Such vitriolic ranting is over the top, even by the ever-declining standards of talk-radio decorum. Yet, in this time of war fever and hyperpatriotism, inflammatory rhetoric draws conservative ditto-heads and liberal rubberneckers alike, and that translates into big ratings. Since launching \\"The Savage Nation\\" on San Francisco's KSFO 560 AM more than eight years ago, Savage has gone from being just another right-winger with a big mouth, a hyperinflated ego and a sizable chip on his shoulder to becoming the nation's fifth most-popular talk-radio personality, a host with enough leverage to land Vice President Dick Cheney as a guest. His book, \\"The Savage Nation: Saving America From the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture,\\" has been perched at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for over a month, and now he's slated to get his own program on MSNBC.Michael Weiner's long and circuitous road has taken him from being a scientist and entrepreneur, through stints as a hipster, novelist and aspiring comedian, to becoming the personification of straight white male rage. Today he likes to play up his unconventional career path, to an extent. He's the kind of guy who never lets anyone forget he has a Ph.D. His Web site reminds visitors that he is a \\"World Famous Herbal Expert\\" and the author of 18 books. But just as his gap-toothed grin has been replaced by a row of airbrushed pearly whites on the front cover of his new book, he gives his audience a whitewashed version of his past. The real story is far more interesting, not just for its ironies and contradictions, but for the often disturbing clues it provides about the man now so well known as Michael Savage. He's gone through at least one political makeover. He's turned on old friends, or they've turned on him. If his semi-autobiographical novel is any guide to his own life, he's keeping a few skeletons in his closet.In the end, the picture that emerges from his books, from interviews with past and current associates, and from his radio show is that \\"The Savage Nation\\" is just the latest undertaking of a man who's spent his life trying to get the world to notice him.Savage's office said he was too busy preparing for his TV show to be interviewed for this article. Earlier interview requests by phone and e-mail prompted an irritated phone call from a woman named Janet, who announced that Savage would not speak with me. Asked if she was his wife -- who happens to be named Janet -- she said she was not. \\"I am not affiliated with him,\\" she insisted. \\"I'm just a fan.\\" After a few minutes of testy back and forth, she suggested that it would be unfortunate if my e-mail address and phone number were somehow posted across the Internet.Savage has come a long way since he emceed school assemblies at P.S. 42 in the Bronx. His father, a Russian Jewish immigrant, made a living selling antique bronzes on Orchard Street. An imposing figure who died of a heart attack in the early 1970s, he is the frequent subject of his son's on-air stories. Speaking at a convention sponsored by the trade magazine Radio & Records in March 2001, Savage recalled getting his first lesson in politics -- and cynicism -- from his dad. \\"[H]e explained politics to me very clearly. He said, 'You see, this is how the world works ... In this beautiful country of ours there are two bands of thieves: the Republicans and the Democrats.'\\"Though Savage waxes nostalgic about such father-and-son moments, it appears that his parents were no Ozzie and Harriet. \\"I was raised on neglect, anger, and hate,\\" he writes in \\"The Savage Nation.\\" But growing up with little parental approval or praise was a good thing, he says. \\"Frankly, that's why I'm driven the way I am.\\"Savage, who now decries \\"propaganda about America being the Land of Immigrants,\\" isn't ashamed of his own immigrant parents. However, his Jewish upbringing is strictly taboo. And he often makes Joseph Lieberman, Barbra Streisand and Larry King the butt of stale ethnic jokes. Brad Kava, radio columnist for the San Jose Mercury News and a longtime Savage critic, thinks Savage's ambivalence toward Jews is a misguided attempt to pander to conservative Christians. \\"He's Jewish, but he always acts like he's Christian,\\" he says. In his book \\"The Savage Nation,\\" for example, he complains of an anti-Christian bias in America. When Kava, who is Jewish, \\"outed\\" Savage several years ago, Savage reported him to the Anti-Defamation League. Dr. Robert F. Cathcart, a longtime friend of the talk-show star, speculated in a telephone interview that Savage says little about his background so that he appears more \\"neutral\\" when he discusses Israel or religious topics.Everyone who has ever known Michael Weiner seems to agree that he has always been a big talker. One of his classmates from Jamaica High School in Queens, which Weiner graduated from in 1959, recalls him as a garrulous character: \\"He was on the short side, and he was intense -- a fast talker, and always hatching some scheme or other.\\" \\"The fellow I knew was a natural comic and as reliable as a clock,\\" remembers another classmate, who says the teenage Weiner was \\"non-political.\\" His yearbook page notes his participation in the Chemistry Lab Squad, school government, and the Rifle Squad, presaging his interest in science, politics and firearms.Weiner was also something of a dreamer, and he hoped to follow in the footsteps of his hero, the naturalist Charles Darwin. After getting a biology degree from Queens College, he went as far west -- and as far from home -- as possible, winding up in Oahu, Hawaii, where he earned master's degrees in anthropology and botany from the University of Hawaii. Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, he traveled to Tonga, Fiji and other South Pacific island nations to study traditional herbal medicine. His new wife, Janet, and their young son, Russell Goldencloud, often accompanied him on his travels. Local healers warmly welcomed him, and he became passionately convinced that their expertise could be used to cure modern ailments. Thus began a quest to salvage-- not savage-- this \\"ethnic wisdom\\" before Western influences destroyed it. His research on the sedative kava kava and other Fijian medicinal plants served as the basis for his doctoral work at U.C. Berkeley. His 1978 dissertation, on file in the U.C. Berkeley library, shows his degree was in nutritional ethnomedicine. However, the bio in the back of Savage's book and on his Web site says it was in epidemiology and nutrition science.In 1974, Weiner moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. His family first settled in Fairfax, a sleepy town in Marin County that Michael Savage would lambaste three decades later as \\"un-Fairfax,\\" hometown of \\"Taliban Rat Boy\\" John Walker Lindh. From there, he started making trips into San Francisco to hang around the North Beach literary scene. According to Stephen Schwartz, who was then a left-wing activist and writer, Weiner carried an unusual letter of introduction. \\"He had met Allen Ginsberg in Fiji,\\" he recalls. \\"He had this photograph of himself swimming naked with Ginsberg.\\" Poet and biographer Neeli Cherkovski says Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the owner of City Lights Bookstore, introduced him to Savage in 1976. \\"All I knew was that he was this hip guy who'd been traveling in the South Seas, finding ways to use tropical plants to help end diseases,\\" he recalls. The two became friends. \\"We had a lot of fun times. He's very smart, intelligent and very lively,\\" says Cherkovski, who is now writer-in-residence at San Francisco's New College. Weiner told Cherkovski that he dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce and they talked of doing a comedy routine together.But he didn't make the big splash he had hoped for. Schwartz says Weiner's increasingly bizarre behavior eventually alienated him from the North Beach crowd. \\"After he had been there a while, his personality began to change. He became much more aggressive. He would collar you and demand that you eat with him, listen to him,\\" he says. According to Schwartz, Weiner openly carried a gun and made public scenes when he ran into his former friends and acquaintances. \\"He would come into Cafe Trieste and start yelling at me that I was a nobody and he was a somebody.\\"Today, Savage still has few kind words for his old lefty literary friends. In \\"The Savage Nation,\\" he writes off City Lights as \\"that once-famous communist bookstore\\" and rips into an unnamed beat poet, calling him \\"latrine slime.\\" \\"Now he just screams at us in the streets,\\" sighs Ferlinghetti, who once went to Hawaii with Weiner and his family. He views Weiner's reincarnation as Michael Savage as \\"total opportunism,\\" the crowning achievement of someone who was \\"always looking to make a fast buck\\" and \\"always trying to think up new schemes to get famous.\\"Weiner did have a knack for combining the promise of herbal medicine with good old-fashioned hucksterism. From his home, he started vanity projects such as the Fund for Ethnic Medicine and the Alzheimer's Research Institute, which he plugged on his book jackets and in letters to the New York Times. He concocted feel-good beverages like Tea of Life and Herbal-Seltzer and sold a line of herbal supplements from a Web site called Herbs That Heal. Visitors to the now-defunct site were welcomed with photographs of Weiner collecting herbs in the South Pacific, soulfully soaking in the culture of what Michael Savage belittles as the \\"turd world.\\" The 1992 edition of \\"The Herbal Bible,\\" published by his wife's imprint, Quantum Books, modestly noted that its author was \\"credited with starting the herbal revolution.\\"He was also a prolific writer, churning out 18 titles in 20 years. \\"[D]on't assume for a minute that they were junk books and marginally published,\\" he snaps in \\"The Savage Nation.\\" \\"They weren't. They were top of the line. They were the Rolls-Royce of the field.\\" \\"Earth Medicine -- Earth Foods\\" and \\"Weiner's Herbal\\" are well-respected references and are still cited widely on herbal and homeopathic Web sites. Most of his books, with their glorified lists of plants and their properties, are about as dry as a handful of powdered dogwood root (which, according to Weiner, makes a good tonic for treating fevers). But buried in the details is a sprinkling of flaky affirmations and kooky assertions.For example, in \\"Plant a Tree: a Guide to Regreening America,\\" Weiner wrote dreamily about our \\"plant allies\\" and suggested that every state appoint its own \\"tree czar.\\" \\"Dictators seem to like trees,\\" he ruminated. \\"Who knows what a benevolent, nature-loving tyrant might do for the retreeing of America?\\" In \\"The Way of the Skeptical Nutritionist,\\" he ventured that a person's ideal diet should be determined by his or her ethnicity. \\"Getting Off Cocaine: 30 Days to Freedom\\" promised blow addicts \\"an alternative plan for getting 'high' -- legally and naturally!\\" The treatment involved ingesting a daily cocktail of Sudafed, vitamins C and E, and amino acids, as well as self-administering the occasional coffee enema. \\"Use a good quality coffee,\\" Weiner advised. \\"Not decaffeinated or instant.\\"Michael Savage's homophobic rants against what he calls \\"anal rights\\" were foreshadowed by the 1986 book \\"Maximum Immunity.\\" In it, Weiner glommed onto some of the wilder ideas about AIDS that were circulating at the time. He called for mandatory nationwide AIDS testing and suggested using massive doses of vitamin C to slow down and even reverse the disease's progress. When he was done suggesting cures, he looked for scapegoats. He demanded that gays \\"accept the blame\\" for the rise of AIDS, then grumbled, \\"Those who practice orgiastic sex, with many partners, and use street drugs are not likely to respond to reason.\\"\\"Maximum Immunity\\" also hinted that its author was dealing with some heavy issues of his own. In one passage, Weiner wrote about his decision to take up jogging so that he might avoid his father's untimely fate. Everything went well until he started hearing things. \\"An inner 'voice' began to demand, 'Stop ... I can't take this anymore.'\\" he wrote. Fearing a \\"nervous collapse,\\" Weiner traded his running shoes for a bike and soothed his jangled nerves by curling up on the sofa with a mug of passionflower herbal tea and ingesting \\"megadoses\\" of vitamins. Feeling much better, he concluded: \\"I learned to calm the inner debate that had threatened to drown me in madness!\\"Such extreme mood swings are regular occurrences on \\"The Savage Nation.\\" Even the phrase \\"I can't take this anymore!\\" (usually shouted at full volume) has become a Savage catchphrase. James Hilliard, who produced \\"The Savage Nation\\" at KSFO for nearly three years in the late 1990s, says that talk radio provided Savage with an outlet for his unpredictable temperament. As he recalls, \\"The show was really driven by Michael's mood. At times, he could be very quiet, mellow, low-key, and then be a maniac on the air.\\"This maniacal tendency, and the roiling emotions that fueled it, were laid bare in \\"Vital Signs,\\" Michael Weiner's first and only book of fiction, published in 1983. A collection of confessional, stream-of-consciousness stories, it follows the exploits of Samuel Trueblood, who just happens to be a 40-ish New York Jew, an herbalist and writer with a tumultuous personal life, a substantial assortment of inner demons and a bit of a Napoleon complex. \\"I am physically not tall, but my eyes burn with fire,\\" he states. \\"Two black fires of Hell.\\" Trueblood narrates a series of misadventures, from procuring an illegal backroom abortion for his fianc&eacute;e to beating the stuffing out of an abusive cop.Trueblood describes his life as one long search for inner peace. He blames much of his discontent on his \\"childhood beneath tyranny,\\" during which he was cowed by his bullying father. Trueblood describes how his father mocked him with \\"brutal jokes and chides, 'gentle' kidding: 'You're not a fag, are you Sam?' the little man would say each time the boy dared wear a colorful shirt or flashy trousers.\\" Unable to shake his dead father's disapproving influence, the adult Samuel is tortured by feelings of weakness and inadequacy. \\"I am filled with fears,\\" he admits, \\"nearly all the time feeling I am about to become totally insane.\\"Even after moving to mellow Marin County, becoming a successful herbalist and starting a family, Trueblood remains plagued by his \\"underlying sadness.\\" Not even trusty passionfruit tea can bring him off this bummer. In one passage, he almost loses it in front of his wife and two young children:\\"Inner voice screaming at me for years, first rational, then crazy, telling me to do mad things. Every form of relief tried, painting, psychotherapy, running, diet, vitamins, etc., etc. Almost uncontrollable now. Impulses to stab children, strangers, wife, self with scissors.\\"Eventually, Trueblood seeks solace in chasing skirts. (Though he admits to being drawn to \\"masculine beauty,\\" he confides that \\"I choose to override my desires for men when they swell in me, waiting out the passions like a storm, below decks.\\") While his wife stays home with the kids, he beds a young \\"cockswell\\" with a \\"dykish haircut\\" and skin \\"[s]ofter than that Northern Indian prostitute in Fiji whose covering was as soft as that of my own penis.\\" And so it goes for another 50 pages.No doubt the anti-abortion, anti-gay, pro-family Michael Savage would disapprove of such a perverted excuse for literature, with all its gratuitous references to illegal abortions, repressed homosexuality and shameless philandering. But it's impossible not to notice the similarity between Trueblood, the tormented seeker, and Savage, a man whose \\"inner voice\\" precipitated an existential crisis over jogging. Neeli Cherkovski says that the chapter in \\"Vital Signs\\" about Trueblood's father is based on Weiner's own life, recalling that he went with the author back to the Bronx to see the site of his father's store. But Cherkovski won't speculate about the rest. \\"I think he [Weiner] is a person who had a lot of wild experiences,\\" Cherkovski says. \\"He tested a lot of waters.\\" Even the book's dedication, to Weiner's wife, suggests that he wasn't making everything up: \\"Who would listen to such tales and live with he who lived them but she, the unshakably faithful Janet.\\"For most of the 1970s and 1980s, Weiner focused on curing people's illnesses, not society's ills. \\"For 10 or 15 years, I was the revered herbal doctor,\\" he recollected at the Radio & Records convention. \\"I was Mr. Nice Guy Nutritionist. Nobody knew my politics. I was talking about healing and I'd go to health food conventions and I'd give speeches about vitamins and herbs. Nobody ever saw this as controversial ... They liked me!\\"But beneath the surface, Weiner was becoming more and more conservative. Stephen Schwartz, who went from being a self-described Trotskyite to neoconservative and is now senior policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, says that Weiner was a \\"typical left liberal\\" in the 1970s. Neeli Cherkovski, who is gay, notes that Weiner was not homophobic when they first met. However, he says Weiner's shift rightward coincided with his increasing aversion to gay activism. Robert Cathcart, who's been close to Weiner since the mid-1980s, says he's always known his friend as an outspoken conservative, at least in private.Since Weiner's conservative leanings took a hard right turn, he's complained that he was held back because of his race, gender and political beliefs. He currently gripes that no institute of higher education would hire him, despite his qualifications. \\"I discovered I could not gain a professorship even after applying many times,\\" he writes in \\"The Savage Nation.\\" \\"My crime? I was a white male.\\" The r&eacute;sum&eacute; he has presented over the years tells another story. On air, he's mentioned that he was once affiliated with Harvard. On the back of his books, he has boasted of being a faculty member at U.C. Santa Cruz, a visiting scholar at the Hebrew University School of Pharmacy and a senior research fellow at the University of Heath Sciences at Chicago Medical School. He's also claimed to have done \\"important research\\" for the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. Not bad for someone who's been blacklisted from the ivory tower.The last straw apparently came in 1994, when publishers rejected Weiner's latest manuscript, \\"Immigrants and Epidemics,\\" which contended that infectious diseases such as T.B. were being brought into the U.S. by Southeast Asian immigrants. Fed up, Weiner rented a recording studio in Sausalito and produced a mock talk show with his wife and a couple of buddies playing callers. Michael Savage was born.In his new job, Savage employed all the self-promotional tricks he had picked up while going from Charles Darwin wannabe to world-famous herbal expert. In early 1996, he applied to become dean of the U.C. Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. Unable to appreciate the journalistic qualities of Savage's radio program or his 18 books, his alma mater denied him an interview, instead hiring China scholar and journalist Orville Schell. Savage sued Berkeley with the help of a conservative legal fund started by David Horowitz (who wrote approvingly of the case in Salon), accusing it of discriminating against a conservative in favor of a man he has called a \\"front for the communist Chinese mafia.\\" The case never went to trial. During the run-up to the 2000 election, Savage laid claim to the phrase \\"compassionate conservative,\\" and said he planned to sue George W. Bush for intellectual property theft. Like many of Savage's threats of imminent litigation, this one soon faded away. But sure enough, he had self-published a book called \\"The Compassionate Conservative Speaks\\" in 1995 and, ever the savvy businessman, had trademarked the term in 1998.Even Savage's two kids were swept up in his relentless drive for publicity. His Web site advertised Rockstar, a liver-cleansing beverage marketed by his son that enables its drinkers to \\"party like a rock star.\\" Last spring, Savage told his listeners about a third-grade teacher in San Diego, Calif., who had saved a child from choking, and demanded that the state school superintendent give her an official commendation. \\"If she was a minority teacher and picked up a paper clip on the floor, then a commendation would be in order,\\" he sniped. He neglected to mention that the \\"hero teacher,\\" Rebecca Lin Yops, was in fact his daughter, who had changed her last name after her recent marriage.Armed with his natural loquaciousness and a kill button, Savage's love affair with the sound of his own voice deepened. Obsequious fans obliged him by calling him \\"Doctor Savage,\\" prompting him to expound his theories on how gays and immigrants spread disease and were corrupting the nation. \\"It's the greatest revenge there is, having a talk show,\\" he crowed in \\"The Compassionate Conservative Speaks.\\" And as his rhetoric became ever more grandiose and outrageous, his ratings -- and political clout -- grew. \\"The Savage Nation\\" became the Bay Area's No. 1 drive-time radio program. Savage lunched with Democratic San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and started landing big-name conservative guests such as Benjamin Netanyahu and Vice President Dick Cheney, who, apparently unaware of the show's usual host-centered format, commended Savage for \\"providing a forum where we can have a good discussion.\\"Looking for a way to leverage his newfound influence, Savage founded the Paul Revere Society, a political club whose goals have included the imprisonment of antiwar activists for sedition, loyalty oaths for immigrants and the eventual establishment of \\"a haven for compassionate conservatives\\" called \\"Revere-Town.\\" A fee of $40 gets new members a Savage Nation baseball cap and an anti-affirmative action pamphlet called \\"The Death of the White Male.\\" There's also the promise that one day they might get to meet the founder and executive director in person. But given Savage's reclusiveness, they may have to wait a while. The group's last major event took place in November 2000, when it held its fifth annual \\"Compassionate Conservative Convention\\" in San Rafael, not far from Savage's home. Since then, Savage made himself available to fans only at dinner parties, and only after they forked over more than a hundred bucks. Meanwhile, according to papers filed with the IRS, this nonprofit \\"educational organization\\" took in over $150,000 in donations in 2001 and expects to take in $250,000 this year.The success of \\"The Savage Nation\\" and its spinoffs is the culmination of a lifelong quest for attention, fame and money. And that raises the question of whether Michael Savage is just a persona created to milk conservatives and taunt liberals. Robert Cathcart thinks his old friend intentionally exaggerates his politics and personality to get a rise out of his audience. \\"It's showmanship,\\" he says. \\"He makes enemies of everybody. He doesn't believe half the stuff he says. On air, he's the ultimate type-A personality, but he quiets down at home.\\" Former \\"Savage Nation\\" producer James Hilliard concurs. \\"I think Michael does have an excellent sense of putting on a show,\\" he says. \\"I think he learned or was told at an early point that this is an entertainment medium, and he thought of himself as an entertainer.\\"However, as Savage rips into another hapless caller or gets exercised about the latest liberal atrocity, it often feels like he's crossed the line between public shtick and personal catharsis. On the air, he lets everything hang out, truly living up to the warning of \\"psychological nudity\\" advertised at the beginning of every show. This is what makes \\"The Savage Nation\\" so simultaneously maddening and fascinating -- as Savage heads over the brink one more time, you have to wonder whether someday he'll go over for good. Cathcart and Hilliard are right when they say the show is not just about politics. But it's not just about entertainment, either. It is about one man grappling with his ambitions and fears while America listens. For Michael Weiner, talk radio is the ultimate talking cure."},{"Title":"Best of the Savage Nation: 1994 - 1998 : Vol. 1","review":"America's liberals must be rejoicing at the rising prominence of Michael &quot;Savage&quot;--his ranting demagoguery does more to give American conservatism a bad name than anything they might think of on their own. Mr. &quot;Savage's&quot; attacks on liberals involve juvenile puns on his their names, outright distortions of what they actually have said, appeals to ignorance, and flagrant leaps of logic and non sequiturs. He claims a &quot;Ph.D.&quot; from Berkeley, but Berkeley in the 1970s granted degrees in all sorts of phony academic disciplines. His range of &quot;book&quot; titles underscores his lack of intellectual substance. Meanwhile, his current calls for Washington to &quot;have the balls&quot; (his words) to use military might around the world belies his failure to serve when his country called, when the United States was still fighting in Vietnam--just another arch-&quot;conservative&quot; chickenhawk. Mr. &quot;Savage's&quot; fraudulence extends even to his own name--his real name is Michael Weiner, which I presume he does not use because people are not likely to enlist in the &quot;Weiner Nation&quot; for fear of becoming tagged as &quot;Weenies.&quot; (I presume his publisher and author of the editorial comment above, Janet A. Weiner, is his wife.) If this is the emerging face of contemporary American conservatism, liberalism has a shining future."},{"Title":"Community Organizing and Development","review":"Great textbook, surprisingly easy to read and conceptually follow. Doesn't read like a normal text book. I feel like there were ideas in the book that were outside the scope of our class (positively). If you are interested in community planning and social action on a macro scale this is a great reference book."},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"Reprints Detective Comics #s 743-750, minus, apparantly, the 8-page backups that began appearing in # 746. The exclusion of said material, excellent though it is, is not enough to justify bumping this down from five stars to four; besides, all DC has to do is start issuing Trade Paperbacks reprinting the Detective backups like they've done for the Black-&-White backups from Gotham Knights (another outstanding title) and problem solved, you don't have to worry about missing any material when you purchase Trades like this or \\"Officer Down\\" or \\"Fugitive\\". What really mystifies me though, is if this is billed as 'New Gotham 1', why they didn't start the volume off by reprinting Detective # 742, THE perfect post-No Man's Land starting point, an issue largely focusing on Jim Gordon and the reprecussions of the final issues of NML. I definately recommend that issue in addition to this volume, as it sets the stage well for the whole post-NML Batman material in many of the titles, not just Detective.Onto the material that is reprinted itself - issues 743-746 bring the detective skills of the Bat into center stage as he investigates the prescence and intentions of Whisper A'Daire and Kyle Abbot in Gotham, two new (to the reader) agents of the Demon's Head, Ra's Al Ghul. 743-746 also give considerable play to many of Gotham's 'non-costumed' organized crime elements, and does so with great characterization and realism. # 747 is a stand-alone issue in which Batman is pretty much a cameo player, in an issue starring GCPD officer Rene&eacute; Montoya and Two-Face; possibly one of the 5 best single-issue Batman stories ever published; actually I'd go even further and say it's possibly one of the 5 best self-contained comics, period. Detective Nos. 748 & 749, 'Urban Renewal' Parts 1 & 2, see the tense friction between the Dee-Zees (residents who left Gotham after the No Man's Land declaration and returned after it was lifted) and OGs (Original Gothamites, who stayed in the city during the whole crisis) escalating into violence; also brings in details on how the actual rebuilding of the city is proceeding. And Detective Comics # 750 is a follow-up to the arc in 743-746, brilliant but containing one small implausibility, the only one in the collection. To focus too much on that would be nitpicking on the molecular level given the overall awesomeness of the issue and the collection.The artwork is tremendous, one of the few examples of veering into the highly stylized realm of art (rather than going for a fully photorealistic style) that I find totally rewarding and expressive on every level. And it's not that it's blatantly UN-photorealistic, it's just that this is a really unique, really innovative pencil style. If the drawing style is innovative, the coloring style is downright revolutionary, casting each individual issue in pre-dominantly in a single primary color and its multitude of shades, plus black, white and grey. A bold move that succeeded magnificently and worked with the pencils and inks for one of the most original looks on any comic title in years and years.Tremendous, riveting, outstanding, and unpredictable, I'll stop now before I use too much bandwidth with thousands of praiseful adjectives."},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"I agree with some of the reviewers that say the artwork is not great. I think the team of artists were going for a simple/classic Tim Sale kind of feel, but don't quite pull it off. The limited color palette is unusual (entire chapters use only a few colors), but this doesn't bother me. It creates an unreal feeling, so you can accept people transforming into animals... well, almost.What saves the book is the writing of Greg Rucka. After his HUGE hit with the recent Batman comic, \\"The OMAC Project,\\" I wanted to check out his earlier stuff. So I ordered this and I wasn't disappointed. Rucka understands that Batman books work well when Bruce Wayne is allowed to be a detective, not just a grunting badass. Even though Ra's al Ghul is probably my least favorite Batman villain, I enjoyed his part of the story. The Two-Face chapter is solid too. I like how Rucka includes characters from \\"Gotham Central,\\" like Detective Montoya (the Two-Face chapter revolves around her).Check out Rucka's work on the \\"Batman & Huntress\\" trade paperback (an excellent read) and the acclaimed \\"Queen and Country\\" series.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"Novelist Greg Rucka came aboard the Batman books during the groundbreaking \\"No Man's Land\\" epic. I loved that story arc, but since then, I've found Rucka's work, both on Batman and other comics (Whiteout, Batman/Huntress, etc.) to be either hit or miss. He is capable of great work, as the Two-Face story in this book shows, but when he's off his game.....oh boy.The biggest problem here is Editorial; When DC rebooted Detective Comics, post NML, they made a few awful decisions- Artist Shawn Martinbrough's work is boring and nondescript, and it's made even worse by the \\"Limited\\" Colors used. The book looks like someone spilled a mug of Hot Chocolate on it. Just awful. Why bother to color it at all? It would be much more palatable in black and white.An Editor should also have stepped in to stop Rucka from using a ridiculous designer drug as his plot device; The drug doesn't just addict, it turns it's users into animals. Literally. Snakes, Wolves, etc. After years spent trying to keep The Batman books (Semi)believable, the sight of addicts turning into snakes had me howling with laughter. Is this the best the great Ra's Al Ghul could do? Pathetic! Ra's Al Ghul is not my favorite Batman villain, but I think that's why he never used to turn up much: It took a really talented writer to do something with him. Rucka was not that writer. After all of that buildup, the story doesn't end, so much as stop. It's almost like Rucka ran out of writing paper....With the great array of Batman books out there, you can't really be in bad enough shape that you'll want to waste your cash on this...."},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"Batman: Evolution picks up where the No Man's Land storyline ends. With that said, the story is individual enough that one would not have to have read No Man's Land to be able to jump right in. Evolution chronicles another attempt by Ra's Al Ghul (pronounced 'raish') to take over the world with a far-fetched scheme that causes general chaos. To be honest, Ra's Al Ghul is probably my least favorite recurring villain in Gotham. To me, nothing seems very memorable about his character. So, it's probably a good thing that Ra's appears on only a few pages of the book. Instead, his genetically altered henchmen make up the main antagonists of the story. With the exception of the now strangely recurring &quot;officer Renee Montoya chapter&quot;, the story stays focused and moves along quickly. While the characters are less colorful than a Joker or Scarecrow, they are developed well and in most cases seem believable. Batman/Bruce himself is done very well, with a good balance of dialogue and action that keeps the character intriguing. The only obvious flaw in the story comes in the ending. Without spoiling anything, I'll say that the conclusion felt very hurried and not very well developed. It's what keeps this story from receiving 5 stars.As for the art, it's the kind I appreciate: clean, clear, to the point, and effective. The pencilling has a sophisticated flair while keeping its utilitarian purposes in check. The muted coloring style is truly inspired, and strives to create a dark yet beautiful setting for Batman to work in. After the conclusion of the story, a few pages are added to show off some beautiful art based upon the story that keeps with the general artistic tone of the book.Overall, Evolution is a worthy Batman novel that covers most of its bases very well."},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"Great read. Not so great art work but you can't blame that on rucka can you. Rucka did a great job with the villans i think. i purchased this along with batman broken bat. Broken Bat was a little better cause of the art work. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"This book reprints several stories from the relaunch of the Batman line in 2000. In the first, as Gotham rebuilds from a devastating earthquake gangs go to war and Ra's Al Ghul's agents are on the prowl. In the second violence between the people who stayed for No Mans Land and those who fled erupts. Finally Batman tracks down Ra's Al Ghul. There's also a one issue story about detective Montoya's birthday.The art and design of these issue deserves special mention, the buildings and cars seem to have come right from Batman the Animated Series or a 30s film. The art by Shawn Martinbrough is moody and atmospheric similar to Tim Sale's work.The plotting is tight, the characters and stories interesting and the book is just plain good.A lot of books from this time got lost in the shuffle of high-profile events that followed. Batman Evolution does not change the character forever, there's no long-dead sidekicks, no world-threatening menaces and no Joker. It's a real shame because this book has some real high-quality work."},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"The number of Batman titles out there is phenomenal. I can never get thru the idea that practically, almost every issue must feature or mention either the Joker or Two-Face.This comic features Two-Face in an interim-like story who sends officer Montoya flowers on her Birthday via Bruce Wayne. I wan's quite sure how Harvey would have known Montoya (given the Batman chronology), let alone remember her B'Day unless he had had a crush on her as DA or later as Two-Face. What has Bruce Wayne got to do with sending the flowers? Won't he be exposing his Batman identity to Montoya by doing Two-face a favour? Not only that, Batman then sends Montoya a note thanking Montoya for visitng Two-face in prison. Any self-respecting detective (that's Montoya) would be able to figure this out.The main story features Batman vs Ras Al Ghul and his nominee Whisper in a deadly plan to get Gotham city inhabitants hooked onto a powerful new drug which slows down the ageing process but turns them now and then into transient were-animals. It starts off well enough but the story then hits a roadblock, with an insertion of the above Two-Face B'day interlude story, and then resumes to a very abrupt ending.The drawings are really basic b/w stuff with spot colouring. Not quite Sin City nor funnies stuff."},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"Frank Miller, Jeph Loeb, Ed Brubaker &amp; Greg Rucka. What do all of these guys have in common? Apart from being absolute masters of the comic book medium, and also being able to tell cracking good mystery tales, they have the distinction of being able to give us the BEST Batman tales. Greg Rucka's take on Batman/Bruce Wayne is at once both believable and fantastic! Do yourself a favour and check this book out. The story flows along at a brisk pace and the art is done in a psuedo film nior style. Very groovy."},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"This book is a continuation of the excellent \\"Batman: No Man's Land\\" sequence, unfortunately it is a step down. While the artwork of the NML series was excellent, in this book the coloration is minimal and the lines are drawn much more harshly.Gotham City is being rebuilt at a frenetic pace, yet it is split into two groups. The people that stayed in the city are called \\"OGs\\" and those that left and have returned are called \\"Deezees.\\" There is a great deal of tension between the two groups with people in each group agitating against the other. Criminal gangs based largely on nationality have carved out their respective niches and they often engage in violent actions against each other.There is also the presence of a gang that is providing an alchemical elixir that will give a human for eternal life. However, it is extremely addictive, must be taken to maintain the longevity and alters your body structure so that you become part animal. For example, one of the gang members is part king cobra. The leader of the elixir gang and his lieutenants use the hostility of the criminal gangs to incite additional violence so that they can take over the underworld of Gotham City and stopping them is the primary task that Batman is working on.While the story has some good qualities, I simply could not overcome the visual theme of the story. It may be that I was spoiled by the previous NML books, but what I saw here left me lacking."},{"Title":"Batman: Evolution (No Man's Land)","review":"This is like a Batman:The Animated Series cartoon on paper. The art and storytelling are both right out of the show. I enjoy when Batman acts like a detective instead of just a ninja. Good stuff."},{"Title":"DEEPWATER: A NOVEL OF THE CAROLINAS","review":"As a librarian and avid reader of southern historical novels, I appreciated the research behind this novel, including a wonderful bibliography (unheard of in most fiction) at the end of the book for further reading. I would recommend the author's books to any reader interested in well-researched historical fiction. The interwoven vignettes are appropriately placed and lend an interesting sidebar to the story."},{"Title":"DEEPWATER: A NOVEL OF THE CAROLINAS","review":"Pamela Jekel has an amazing way of telling a story. A thoroughly delightful read. She has the talent to actually place the reader at the scene. A great way to take an inexpensive trip.Her style is much like Michener's. Extensive research and a story worth telling, and she tells it better than anyone. A must read novel."},{"Title":"DEEPWATER: A NOVEL OF THE CAROLINAS","review":"\\"But what you'll have instead will be burnished and hardened and battle-proven as this land. And that, to me, is a richer love. It's a real marriage.\\"Deepwater is a very chunky book (with tiny font!) set in the Cape Fear region of North Carolina. The story spans several generations, from 1711 through the end of the Civil War and Restoration period. The prologue begins with the lost settlement of Roanoke (including the author's spin on what happened to those who went missing), and is then broken into three parts. In the first, sisters Tess and Glory Hannock aren't willing to let something like a marriage separate them when Tess marries a dashing privateer. It isn't true love forever, but Tess isn't one to let that stop her and through her experiences we watch the colony grow and prosper until those little disputes with the King over taxation without representation get started...The second section is centered around Tess's niece Della (younger sister Glory's daughter). Della's been spoiled and travelled abroad, and when she comes home she hones in on wealthy plantation owner Phillip Gage and she's determined to marry him and become mistress of Deepwater. Phillip is loyal to King George, so you can imagine things get a bit complicated when just about everyone else is on the rebel side, including his wife. The last third of the book begins in 1850 and is centered around Laurel Gage. Laurel marries a Quaker and owning slaves is not the *done thing* for him, but paying for labor takes its toll on Deepwater and slowly eats away at the acreage and profits.That's about all you need to know. This is one of those books that is too difficult to recap without writing a long report, and I'm not of a mind to do it. I liked this a lot, especially as the story focused on the people and the land, there really wasn't a lot of interaction with real historical characters. Better still, despite the two wars involved in the story, there are no real battle scenes, nor are they touched upon in any great detail - no endless info dumps telling the reader about every major battle in excruciating detail. How refreshing. The only downside that might be a deal breaker is that these aren't a set of characters you're going to get emotionally involved with; nor do any of the three women have a great *love story*. If you're looking for romance, I suggest you keep on looking.Last quibble, and nothing to do with the book itself, but part of the publisher's blurb:\\"Seleta...The wife of a Quaker abolitionist, she saw her beloved land fall to the Yankees. Yet is wasn't the horror of war that became her greatest challenge...it was her battle to save her young son.\\"Ummmm, Seleta was Laurel's daughter and wasn't a grown woman with children until well towards the end of the book and she was pretty much out of the picture by then.It's a good thing you-know-who hasn't reviewed it. Then we'd finally know whether or not she reads the books :)"},{"Title":"DEEPWATER: A NOVEL OF THE CAROLINAS","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who enjoyed the historical aspect of this book. I did learn a great deal about the tidal water region of the Carlinas. I liked how the book was divided into thirds. I found the early settlement and revolutionary war eras the most interesting to read. The women in these sections were passionate about their cause and facsinating characters.For me the book fell apart with the final section- The Civil War era. This surprised me baecause I love to study this time period. I felt that the third story was rushed and simply borrowed parts from the other two with out true character development.It really bothered me that the back of the book mentions the third women- Seleta. Well the third heroine was Laurel (Seleta's mother). This is so minor, yet I feel the publisher should have caught this.I found the interspersed history lessons interesting and helpful, but the descriptions of native fauna got a little tiresome.

This futuristic story is set in the far-off year 1981, when a ship called the Gloria Mundi carries the first people to Mars. A young woman has sneaked aboard the ship, and tells the crew of what to expect when they touch down on Mars.This novel can be compared to H.G. Wells' &quot;First Men in the Moon&quot;. Both stories have been proved inaccurate by that bubble burster called Reality. But this doesn't matter. The imagination of such stories is what really counts. This book is the beginning of one man's distinguished career."},{"Title":"Stowaway to Mars","review":"Written by a young, pre-Triffids Wyndham under the name John Beynon, this is a less well developed effort that nonetheless shows his talent. The plot is standard, with an attractive female stowaway joining an all-male crew on a race to be the first nation to land on Mars, but it's graced with original details and intelligent epithets such as &quot;Mind is the control of brain by memory,&quot; and the fast-paced plot keeps you reading. The most interesting elements are the Martian landscape, the rusty berserk Martian robots, and the sad remains of the Martian people whose cities are like a series of empty rooms. When the story turns into a space romance, you understand why the stowaway had to be female. Wyndham always wrote with a sure hand, and that was no less true of this early effort than of his later, better novels."},{"Title":"Stowaway to Mars","review":"John Wyndam was at his best when he did not rely on technology, but looked at what would happen if comapratively small changes happened in an everyday setting.

Probably best left for only the most die hard of Wyndham fans. The kindle edition, however, is poorly prepared. I own a physical copy of the book and the two can hardly be compared -- all formatting has essentially been lost in the kindle edition; medium and long dashes (--) have vanished as well, resulting in conversation with sentences that bleed together without boundaries."},{"Title":"Stowaway to Mars","review":"'Stowaway to Mars' is an early work of John ('Day of the Triffids') Wyndham, written way back in the 1930s. The book was obviously a dud when it was first published since it was not released in the USA until the 1970s after John Wyndham finally found some success. And the book has not been reprinted in the USA since then either. So I was hoping this lack of attention was unfair and I had bumped into a hidden gem when I found this book at a used bookstore. Wrong. Very wrong.Well as you can guess from the title, this book is about an adventure to Mars where a female stowaway \\"with a secret\\" creates a bit of havoc amongst the all-male crew. While the technology aspects of the story are incredibly dated I found the build up of sending the rocket to Mars to be rather entertaining. However the story degrades rather quickly when they actually land on Mars. The author fails to develop the situation, with the result being a very amateurish effort at describing Martian terrain and life. I was just glad the pain didn't last long since the book is very short.Bottom line: a rather poor read I'm afraid. John Wyndham wrote much better stuff later in his career."},{"Title":"Witness to Genocide: The Children of Rwanda: Drawings by Child Survivors of the Rwandan Genocide of 1994","review":"It beggars belief that Mrs. Clinton--anyone named Clinton--would have the NERVE to write a book on Rwanda. The Clinton administration knew exactly what was going on in Rwanda and stonewalled every effort at meaningful US intervention. Not sending troops? Morally detestable, but given the political climate and American lack of interest in Africa, well I can understand that. But the Clinton administration went beyond this, to not approving an increase in the strength of UN forces (the request was for around 5000 troops to end the massacres), to CHARGING the UN for the use of badly-needed military equipment (oh, by the way, the US owed the UN a huge sum of money) and finally providing substandard equipment.As big a fan as I am of the Clinton administration in general, and of Mrs. Clinton, the only words I need to hear fromanyone named Clinton on this issue is a public apology for shamelessly allowing the genocide to occur, and then providing aid to those complicit in the genocide itself after they were expelled from the country.Otherwise, the book offers little of value. A transcribed oral accounting of children's experience (from an historian) would be more helpful."},{"Title":"Witness to Genocide: The Children of Rwanda: Drawings by Child Survivors of the Rwandan Genocide of 1994","review":"\\"Witness to Genocide: The Children of Rwanda\\" tells the horrific story of the genocide through drawings created by children traumatized by what they saw and lived through. It is a heartbreaking book that serves to remind the world the level to which we can sink.I photographed the children as they made some of these drawings, and it is an experience I will never forget. What started out as an exercise to \\"draw a picture of your most recent nightmare,\\" evolved into a graphic display of murder and loss. The children sat up straight when they started in on their drawing, but by the time they finished, they were bent down, close to the paper, and covering up what they had drawn.As shocking as the drawings are, one that I remember the most was a beautiful drawing of a women in brightly colored African dress. When asked to explain the picture, the child said \\"this was the last time I saw my mother.\\"Everyone should see and read this book. Think of it as a shortened version of \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\"."},{"Title":"Witness to Genocide: The Children of Rwanda: Drawings by Child Survivors of the Rwandan Genocide of 1994","review":"Now that we know that President Clinton and Madeline Albright fought and succeeded to have the word \\"genocide\\" removed from all UN talk about Rwanda, this book reeks of opportunism. It is a way of Mrs. Clinton using the tragedy -- one her husband helped play itself out without aid to the slaughtered Rwandans -- to portray herself and perhaps her husbands administration as being caring. Truly disgusting. Of course this was not known at the date this book was first published, but in light of what we now know, this should stick in the throat of anyone who reads it.

I began the program, it hurt like heck, and I wimped out. I tried it again at the end of '08 and stuck with it, no matter how much my shins hurt. I'm now finished with the Beginner Level and am moving on to the Advanced Beginner Level. The advice in this book is clear and without pages of fluff and nonsense, yet it tells you absolutely everything you need to know, from motivation sources to how to handle injuries. The journal setup is simple and easy to fill out quickly between a run and getting on with your day. There are easy-to-read charts to help any runner--from a newbie beginner like me to a marathoner--up their miles or increase their pace sensibly. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn, or relearn how to run, as well as anyone wanting to increase their weekly average mileage."},{"Title":"The Runner's Training Diary : For Fitness Runners and Competitive Racers (Fully Revised and Updated)","review":"I'm an adult onset runner (48 yrs old, 200 lbs) and started running in Sept 07.

I had looked at a few others (Runner's World, Training for Mortals, etc.) and liked the setup of Glover's logbook the best.It doesn't have set dates, so you can start using it in the middle of the year.

So I am of the belief of not complaining without offering a solution so here it is:Have at least a limited run of diaries that do have the current calendar year dates.

I love that I can see the whole week on a 2 page spread, and I love the one page summary of the miles for the year. I also love the places in the back to record shoe mileage, races, PR's, etc. The only downside is that I sometimes want to write more details about the day, and the space provided only allows for a few inches of writing for each day. However, I think the benefits of seeing the entire week on the 2 page spread outweighs the downside of this. I just have to summarize more.

Whatever his many biographers discover about his mundane corporeal existence, James's novels reveal him best, as an inveterate observer - his own words! - a chronic emotional voyeur, always in and never of society, a one-way looking glass. It made him the great writer he was, though one wouldn't want to BE him. \\"Well,\\" as God said to Satan, \\"keeping watch on humans is a dirty job, but somebody has to do it.\\"The four long stories in this Oxford Clssic edition were not originally published together. \\"Daisy Miller\\" appeared in 1878, \\"Pandora\\" in 1884, \\"Patagonia\\" in 1888. The fourth piece, \\"Four Meetings\\", was one of James's first, written before 1877. They are a natural assembly, nevertheless, effectively versions of the same story.DAISY MILLER\\"They're very ignorant -- very innocent only, and utterly uncivilized. Depend on it they're not 'bad.'\\"\\"They're hopelessly vulgar,\\" said Mrs. Costello. \\"Whether being hopelessly vulgar is being 'bad' is a questions for the metaphysicians. They're bad enough to blush for, at any rate; and for this short life that's quite enough.\\"Winterbourne, the first speaker above, is an American of twenty-seven who has lived most of his life in Europe, specifically in Geneva, where he is either a career student or simply an ornamental male presence, depending on the reporter. If 'earning a living' is of any concern to him, it plays no part in his demeanor in this narrative. Mrs. Costello is his wealthy aunt (a dowager?), who 'commands' his proper familial attentions at various resorts and in Rome several weeks a year. She is the very voice of propriety and discretion -- a snooty old biddy, if you will -- while he is a dilettante, a poseur, a prig, a veritable Henry James in short. \\"They\\" are the Millers - mother, daughter, and son - sent to inspect Europe and report back on its cultural progress by their filthy rich pater familias Cyrus Miller, of Schenectady, New York. Winterbourne first meets Daisy Miller while visiting his Aunt at Vevey, in Switzerland. He is entranced both by her beauty and by her bizarre ignorance of and/or indifference to the social codes of the Old World. Winterbourne and his Aunt are ludicrous snobs and ditherers; it's important to grasp that they are objects of satire as thoroughly as the Millers, the prototypical \\"ugly Americans\\" of touristic prominence all over Europe then and now. In fact, everyone in this novella comes in for a share of deliciously condescending satire, most pointedly James himself in the guise of Winterbourne. That's one of the redeeming qualities of Henry James, his ability to perceive and portray his own uselessness as a mere onlooker at life.\\"Daisy Miller\\" is a gem, an 80-page masterpiece of snarky ambivalence. When I read it first, long ago in college, I probably took Winterbourne seriously; after all, the tale is told from his point of view. But taking himself or his fictional avatars seriously was a fault Henry James never committed. A longer exposure to James's self-observation, such as his later novels require, can challenge a reader's patience; there's only so much most of us want to care for such meticulous ambiguity. But \\"Daisy Miller\\" and \\"Pandora\\" are eminently enjoyable.For a man and writer whose sexuality was so peculiarly repressed, James has made his irrepressible American girl Daisy Miller quite a luscious minx. Poor Winterbourne, stiff and epicene, can't keep his eyes off her. In the end, however, his fascination amounts merely to a kind of obsessive observation, and that's the core of the story, the voyeurism which underlies Henry James's literary genius. Nevertheless, Daisy is a brilliant 'study' of the American personality that Europeans have, then and now, found utterly appalling, naive and gauche ... and insidiously alluring.PANDORAWritten six years after Daisy Miller, \\"Pandora\\" is a tongue-in-ear sequel, or perhaps a da capo aria. The characters have different names and play their roles with different outcomes, but James plainly intended the second story to complement the first. In fact, the earlier story is explicitly referenced as \`a fiction to read to prepare for America.' \\"Pandora\\" begins on a ship crossing from Europe to New York. A young German diplomat, en route to a posting in Washington DC, assumes Winterbourne'James's role as \\"observer\\". There's a good deal of fun to be had with putting a precise Teutonic prig in James's skin, and James exploits all of it. The \\"Daisy\\" slot in the cast goes to \\"Pandora\\", less visually delectable perhaps but a good deal more personally functional. Pandora is on her way to becoming \\"the new woman,\\" that is, the woman who conquers society merely by force of personality and physical charm, without the advantages of breeding. Our German observer is even less able to communicate his \`interest' to Pandora than Winterborne was to Daisy; the most he can do is cogitate about the risk he runs, through his observation, of actually becoming susceptible. The reader will have no reason to fear for him in that manner.PATAGONIA...... is also a shipboard tale, with many of the same elements of social misconstruction as the two oolder stories. In it, however, the \\"observer\\" is also the first-person narrator, an older and more desexualized James, not so much fascinated by the \\"new woman\\" character as by his own obsession with observation. He's a gossip and a meddler, and comes to rue both roles. can we assert that Henry James modeled the famous Uncertainty Principle of physics in social intercourse? The end-game of every character in this and other Jamesian plots is disrupted by the impact of being observed.Henry James straddled the world of 19th C class consciousness and 20th C class unconsciousness marvelously. Simultaneously the most conservative and the most prophetic of novelists, his women characters are easily the most persuasive and the most intriguing in all American literature. I have the feeling that James would not be at all surprised by the manners of social behavior in the USA in 2010. Daisy and Pandora were halfway here. Neither would he be any more comfortable in our \`rec rooms' than he was in the drawing rooms of his own era. Really, I'm afraid he'd find us rather disappointing to observe."},{"Title":"Great Fashion Designs of the Victorian Era Paper Dolls in Full Color (Dover Victorian Paper Dolls)","review":"The greater part of the nineteenth century women's fashion is covered by this book. One sees the charming bell skirts mutating into bustles and finally the hourglass figure. The colors are brilliant and the dolls are based on Queen Victoria and Empress Eugenie (although, for some unexplained reason, the latter doll has blonde hair even though Eugenie had dark hair).I especially liked Tom Tierney's selection of a great variety of costumes, including sportswear, daywear, evening wear and ballgowns.The one flaw with the book is that there is a sudden gap from 1888 to 1900. I think there was no need to feature 6 costumes from 1900 alone, while the entire 1890s were unrepresented."},{"Title":"Great Fashion Designs of the Victorian Era Paper Dolls in Full Color (Dover Victorian Paper Dolls)","review":"Tom Tierney's illustrations cover a 60 year time span when what we would consider \\"too much\\", was never enough when it came to embellishing the clothing of a fashionable woman. As eye candy, this is excellent. As a reference, this book is very helpful in establishing the lines and silhouettes of the various decades. As always, the colors are brilliant and the styles are faithfully rendered.The source of most of these illustrations are famous portraits, magazines of the day, and later photographs of fashionable women. Charles Frederick Worth started the practice of showing clothing on real people, as opposed to miniature costumes worn by fashion dolls, and his work is generously represented, along with a number of other designers, all of whom might have been overlooked by a lesser researcher than Mr. Tierney.Since there are a multitude of refernces including printed and photographic material that cover the 1890s, I can understand why those fashions would merit an entire book of their own, so I am not troubled by the absence of the decade of the 1890s.This book serves to provide an excellent overview of how womens' clothing evolved during the Victorian Era all the way up until 1900."},{"Title":"Great Fashion Designs of the Victorian Era Paper Dolls in Full Color (Dover Victorian Paper Dolls)","review":"I love a lot of these books and when I add another one its such a treat..Once again..fine quality.good paper quality,fine coloring.I use them in paperdoll/altered art ,and decoupage.they are perfect for my needs..B.W."},{"Title":"Great Fashion Designs of the Victorian Era Paper Dolls in Full Color (Dover Victorian Paper Dolls)","review":"I love this paper doll set! I own several of Mr. Tierney's paper doll collections but this is probably my favorite. The dolls of Queen Victoria and Empress Eugenie wonderfully dressed in undergarments accurate from the time period and their positions of their limbs allow the costume figures to hold fans and other accessories and allow them to put their arms in different positions without revealing anything of the original doll beneath. One thing about these dolls is that they are shorter than most and that wouldn't be a problem except that it makes it harder to play with them with other paper dolls of a larger size. The clothers are lovely and EXTREMELY detailed making them beautiful but difficult to cut out especially for younger girls. Each gown is unique and Tom Tierney uses a variety of different styles and shows styles throughout a period of sixty-four years.Each doll has 13 essembles with a total of 26 essembles in the book. On the paper dolls the artist also depicts the hairstyles and headware of the time. It's hard to cut out the space where there is an empty gap for a hole for the dolls face to show through. This would be a great selection for anybody who enjoys Tom Tierney's quality work or just anyone who likes paper dolls!"},{"Title":"Great Fashion Designs of the Victorian Era Paper Dolls in Full Color (Dover Victorian Paper Dolls)","review":"These paper dolls are so beautiful that I hesitate cutting them out to use as paper dolls.

I hope my granddaughter appreciates the effort.The paper is very heavy which is great for the dresses. I intend to put the ladies on heavy cardboard to make them more durable. These are too beautiful not to make them last as long as possible. The colors are vibrant.

So naturally Tom Tierney prefigured his 20th-century decade-by-decade and by-name series of fashion-designer doll books with this one. Using the young Queen Victoria (before she turned stout) and the stylish and trend-setting Empress Eugenie (consort of Napoleon III of France) as its models, it features 26 gowns of the era 1840-1900, ranging from Victoria's wedding dress and Eugenie's court gown to afternoon dresses, a riding habit, streetwear, and evening gowns, created by such designers as John Redfern, Mme. Vignon, Mlle. Pierlot, Camille, Paquin, Worth, and others, and all rendered in brilliant color and with minute attention to detail. Like those shown in Tierney'sWorth Fashion Review Paper Dolls, these were garments for the wealthy, but they reflect the styles and shapes of their era and as such will be valuable to anyone interested in the dress of the time."},{"Title":"Great Fashion Designs of the Victorian Era Paper Dolls in Full Color (Dover Victorian Paper Dolls)","review":"I purchased this for my neice and actually all of the adults at the party were so impressed with how beautiful the pictures are.

However painful it would be to be the object of his scorn, however, it's undeniably entertaining to see him take others to task. The \\"Dictionary\\" starts off with a lovely rant about \\"The Decline of the Dictionary,\\" in which Mr. Fiske bemoans the fact that so many dictionaries attempt to describe current usage, incorporating incorrect grammar and spelling, rather than setting down proper usage. He rips into Merriam-Webster with a long list of examples of \\"inexcusably shoddy dictionary making,\\" including the addition of \\"tho\\" as a variant spelling of \\"though\\" and the pronouncement that \\"flaunt\\" means the same as \\"flout\\" or \\"infer\\" means the same as \\"imply.\\"Most of the book consists of a dictionary of misused, misspelled, and mispronounced words. Some of them surprised me; I was a little shocked to find out that, for example, people often misuse \\"accelerate\\" in place of \\"exhilarate.\\" Other entries made me cringe when I realized I'd been misusing them myself; I can't remember any examples at the moment--I suspect I've blocked them out so as to spare myself the embarrassment of having to recount them in this review.It would be enough to have this wonderfully useful dictionary at hand. I certainly plan to keep my copy near to where I work, so I can hopefully reduce the amount of \\"disagreeable English\\" to be found in my own writing. The book is made all the more entertaining, however, through the use of boxed examples from real writers' and speakers' work, always presented with an entertaining cartoon of a frustrated or exasperated \\"grammar curmudgeon.\\" The book is very recent--it was published in 2005--and it uses up-to-date examples that will appeal to the modern reader.The only mild negative I can think of is that occasionally I wished for a little more clarification when two terms seemed very similar in meaning. The format typically consists of examples of the misusage, followed by an explanation of the differences between the words involved. Some of these entries would have benefited from further examples of the correct usage of the words in question.This book is just plain fun for grammar curmudgeons and invaluable for those with imperfect grammar."},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Disagreeable English: A Curmudgeon's Compendium of Excruciatingly Correct Grammar","review":"Robert Hartwell Fisk definitely warrants his (self-described?) label of curmudgeon; and I say that with great admiration. If you have a long list of grammatical pet peeves, his Dictionary of Disagreeable English will furnish you with an entertaining source for putting people right. If you couldn't care less about precise English, don't bother. But if you appreciate the appropriateness of \\"couldn't\\" as opposed to the ghastly \\"could care less\\" that has become so common today, then buy this book in quantity and give it to all of your friends!It is a bit intimidating to write a review of this book, as there is the fear of provoking a mild (or worse) response from the author regarding errors within the review, however I will try. Fisk provides evidence of errors that range from common misspellings and mispronunciations to such flagrant misuse of words that their meanings are completely distorted. I was gratified to find the a number of words and phrases that rank among my linguistic pet peeves, and I was shocked to discover too many errors of my own usage.Mr. Fisk chooses his targets carefully, with wit and sarcasm -[...]- such that you can't help but lose time moving from one entry to the next. He provides examples of each mistaken use, followed by a suggestion that would make the sentence more precise.Interestingly enough, he does not appear to favor a return to the language of the Victorians. He readily acknowledges that English is a living language, and he even makes a few allowances for the \\"creative\\" use of words by some technical disciplines. Nonetheless he loudly denounces what I might call Dilbertarian business-speak at every opportunity. He even coins a new word of his own, \\"lexicographers\\" to refer to dictionaries and editors that are all to willing to bend to the noise of popular vocabulary, at the expense of clear communication.Congratulations Mr. Fisk!

Though it would not seem to require this many pages to refute a self-refuting position, the author along the way makes acute observations on the culture of American academic philosophy that seem little changed in the 30 years since it was written. The final pages contains one of the most beautiful paeans to philosophy ever written. This is a clever, insightful, amusing and lovely work that has received far too little attention.

DON'T BE FOOLED!!!I AGREE WITH BILL WHO WROTE ALSO A REVIEW HERE. - Puzzled??? Uh, YEAH. THE BOOK IS MOSTLY A COLLECTION OF CUT OUT NEWSPAPER OBITUARIES OF VARIOUS YOUNG TO MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE WHO DIED OF SIMILAR CAUSES. THE AUTHOR EVENTUALLY MAKES CORRELATIONS BY CHAPTER 11(WHICH IS ONLY 55 PAGES LONG OUT OF A 496 PAGE BOOK!!?) AND ATTRIBUTES MANY OF THESE DEATHS TO VARIOUS MACRO AND TRACE MINERAL DEFICIENCIES.I just think that the title of the book should have been named differently to reflect the actual content. The book is short of elaborating into the both the area of \\"Rare Earths\\"(Trace Minerals Research) and the \\"Cures\\" which may be obtained thereof. The book is more geared towards pointing out how so many Americans including prominent athletes and public figures are dying young of similar causes. The title could have just as well been \\"Only the Good Die Young: The Grim Legacy of Chronic Mineral Deficiency\\". Now THAT would have been a more appropriate title for this book. Perhaps Joel Wallach ought to write another book that just expands on the research into the minerals themselves and any testing that has been done with them through universities or independent RESEARCH.From the Title and information I've seen reviewed about this book, I would assume that it would be mostly devoted to explaining the science and connections between rare earth minerals(micro and trace minerals) in relation to human health. I expected in depth analysis with case studies and details on biochemical research into the uses of micro and macro trace minerals in the treatment and cure of disease. I was hoping for data to include a distillation of IN-DEPTH research from many sources all gathered together in one book. I desire to understand the applications of the use of other minerals such as Rubidium, Cesium, Strontium, Germanium, Gallium, Indium Etc... The information I am talking about is rather obscure and inaccessible.To the medical establishment its probably considered mostly fringe science but if you study anecdotal evidence through a cursory search of the various elements, you will see that some of the rare mineral elements that we never hear about have been identified as possessing amazing health properties. I will admit that it appears that the Author does make correlations between the lack of certain minerals and disease, but again I find that the material here is severely lacking. It does not include enough actual reference to laboratory research with detailed chemical analysis. That left me feeling dissatisfied right off the bat.Oh well.

Lions are much calmer and docile when no meat is in the diet. So just look at the agression in humanity now, couldn't our diet have something to do with it. Study for yourselves, use as many sources as you can and the natural ones agree over all."},{"Title":"At Seneca Castle","review":"Salem Ridge Press does and excellent job of screening their books for excellent material. You won't find anything offensive in them. My children have read this book and its companion book and loved them. They are a great read and full of information from someone who has lived closer to the time period. Learn real information about The First Americans."},{"Title":"How to Be Better At-- Managing Change","review":"This little book by David Hussey is a useful companion for those who wish to effectively and smoothly manage change in their organisations. Although the book is small, it is packed with practical advice and guidance on how to manage the change process in organisations or departments within organisations.The rapid changes that characterise the current operating environment means that managers are almost always engaged in managing change of one form or another. To cope with the challenges of initiating and managing change can be a daunting task for most managers. I found the book to be very useful to me in managing change in my department. The areas I found most useful were on dealing with resistance to change and preparing plans and budgets for change.The book is divided into six chapters namely:* Introduction* Choosing the right level of participation* Assessing the implications of a change management situation* Dealing with resistance and survivor issues* Working through the change process* Applying the change processThe book is small enough that even a busy executive is able to finish it is a short period of time. I read most of it during a long intercontinental flight. The various scenarios (small case studies) reinforce the issues presented in the book. I recommend the book to those who need a simple, easy to follow guide on how to effectively manage the change process."},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"I can't believe I waited so long to read HOWLING MAD. Peter David takes a traditional mythical creature and stands it on its head. &quot;Josh&quot; is a standard timberwolf that runs into trouble when he's bitten by a werewolf. At the full moon he starts turning into a human man. This story follows his trials and tribulations of trying to accept his transformation, being taken far away from his forest and then trying to return to his pack. Along the way he encouters Darlene, a co-dependent do-gooder who falls in love with him; Duncan, the vampire, who leads a rather non-traditional vampiric existence; and the werewolf himself who is intent on destroying Josh. Josh struggles between his wolf self and his human self, and it's a scream to watch how he develops as a human man (no enlightened savant here, it's beer and television all the way). The story is told by Josh as a series of recollections to an unseen writer who is a friend of Darlene. The characters are quirky, the plot is fantastic, and even the wolves have funny dialogue. I laughed so hard throughout the novel that people started to ask if I was alright! It's funny, it's fast-paced, and it's delightfully tongue-in-cheek. This one is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"&quot;Howling Mad&quot; is one of Peter David's first books, and ranks as one of his best. Why this gem was out of print for so long is beyond me. Peter David has always had a talent for adding comedy into his stories without making them simply an excersise in silliness. And the plot, about a wolf bitten by a particularly nasty werewolf, is wholly original. And lets not forget about the vampire...or the beautiful girl...or the...oh, just by all means READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"This is a smart and funny tale of a wolf who is bitten by a werewolf and every full moon turns into a man, who is taken under the shelter of Darlene, who names him Josh. The story involves other supernatural creatures and ends with an awesome battle with Josh and another werewolf...I won't tell you too much. I could totally see a hilarious Sci-Fi Fantasy movie made in this. GGT"},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"I love Peter David when he writes comics. In that medium, he is one of my absolute favorites. Unfortunately, his skill doesn't seem to translate into other areas quite as well. Don't misinterpret that though because this is a pretty good novel.It's short, and I like short. Modern fiction of nearly every genre is soooo long. And the stories are not any deeper, the writing any more complex. They're just loooong, excessively plotted, redundantly written. I rarely read a novel that can't lose at least a hundred pages. My GF says most people are wannabe writers but that I'm a wannabe editor. True, because even this novel could lose a few pages here or there.But it's still good. An amusing idea presented in an interesting style. Read the summary if you want the plot. I'm not going to get into it. But if you're looking for something fairly unique, I recommend it.One of the better, unintended elements of the novel to me is that occasionally it breaks into present tense and has the wolf talk to the narrator. These bits were totally unnecessary to me, and since they were italicized, I just skipped them automatically. If you the kind of reader who likes them, then go right ahead. I liked the easy way of telling what I didn't care about reading, though it was unintentional. I wish more books did that."},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"I happened to catch this book for $1 and I gotta say I REALLY liked it. I don't know that I woulda been happy if I had paid the $5.99 that on the cover?! But I would recommend this for anything that enjoys a good supernatural beings book ( vampires, werewolves, fairies, etc... ). It handles it well.A Comedy?I don't think so... But, it is rather tongue-in-cheek at a few points, it'll make you chuckle.I guess the best light I could put it in is this...If this was a TV show?I would compare this to a mixture of &quot;The X-Files and Monk&quot;.There's something to make you smile, but it ain't JUST a comedy...andThere's something to creep you out a little too...Good read!Wish I could meet the author, I would love to talk with someone that can think like the writer of this book obviously does..."},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"One of the funniest books I have ever read in any genre! Howling Mad is a biting tale of a poor, confused wolf who gets bitten by a werewolf... and faces the horrible curse of becoming a human every night of the full moon. When this &quot;were-man&quot; is accidently sent to New York, the fur really starts to fly. A wry and inventive twist on the entire genre of horror, I truly could not put it down (except when I was laughing too hard). A must read, no matter how hard it is to find"},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"Another great effort from the pen of Peter David. He has a great mixture of action, horror and humor which makes reading his books so enjoyable. My favorite characters were Joshua Wolf &amp; Duncan the vampire. Darlene was great too but Mr.David always writes a great female character--strong and tender. I hope to read more of the misadventures of Josh and Darlene (sequel maybe? )"},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"This short and very little known book tells the tale of a wolf who was bitten by a werewolf and now, at every full moon the poor beast changes into a man - something it is really not happy about...\\"Howling mad\\" is extremely well written, hysterically funny, very clever and keeps good suspense until the end. This is also one of the best books on werewolves and lycanthropy I ever read (as good as \\"Wolfen\\", just less scary). It can be easily read in three evenings and I can guarantee you will have a merry good laugh every page or two and will enjoy a very interesting tale of surnatural at every line. Wolf's comments on humanity in general (and New Yorkers in particular) are a pure delight!The werewolf who is the villain in this book is a real piece of (evil) art and his mysterious ally (always calling him collect from a phone booth) is even better! And then there is also the girl, a not so succesful animal rights activist, who plays an important role in wolf's dealings with human society - her character is extremely touching and introduces an element of suspense and tension, as her survival becomes more and more uncertain...I loved this book, I had a great time reading it and I am certainly going to check more titles by Peter David."},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"About 20 years ago I started reading this book and accidentally left it a cab. I HAD to buy another copy, and it was worth the twice price. Now I have to buy another copy because I want my son to enjoy it like I did. Easy to read, makes you think, makes you laugh. I just wish it were available on Kindle!"},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"The Werewolf's Guide to Life: A Manual for the Newly BittenFantastic tale of a wolf bitten by a man, or werewolf in reverse if you like, it will have you laughing and crying! Again this is another book that is hard to find at a reasonable price in a reasonable state... But there is a rumor going around that there is going to be a movie made about this book, which I hope is true and would love to see, and who knows maybe then they would republish this book!!"},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"I loved this book - absolutely loved it! The premise was utterly unique and just terrific. The writing was great, it had a lot of humour - I laughed out loud to the point of getting dirty looks from strangers on the bus. It had it all - adventure, romance, vampires and of course, werewolves. I just loved it!"},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"Peter David's book, Howling Mad, sat on my shelf for over a year before I picked it up to read. Three hours later I put it back. Why? I was done!The book moves along like a well-edited movie. There's lots of humor, action, and plenty of supernatural goings on. David even includes a bit of romance. Before the premise can get old, the book ends with a satisfying conclusion.While it's not a great book, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"Although I did not find this novel as funny as the Sir Apropos trilogy, it did have it's moments (Not many things have been able to surpass those books). Peter David did a terrific job in giving this type of a story substance; the story wasn't just about a wolf being bitten by a werewolf but a clever way of executing how animals must think humans behave. Also, everything that occured happened for good reason: Darlene's purse, bat breaking, and not to mention a cavity filled mouth. This was worth the read and I would definitely recommend to friend."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],D={key:0},P={key:1};function E(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=g("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(f,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",D,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-a2d11992"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/20.md","filePath":"people/20.md"}'),H={name:"people/20.md"},R=Object.assign(H,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{q as __pageData,R as default};
