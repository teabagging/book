Reveals that transcendence of current modes of existence requires the dynamic interaction of our fourth and fifth brains (intellect and intelligence) ? Explores the idea that Jesus, Lao-tzu, and other great beings in history are models of nature s possibility and our ability to achieve transcendence ? 17,000 sold in hardcover since April 2002 Why do we seem stuck in a culture of violence and injustice? How is it that we can recognize the transcendent ideal represented by figures such as Jesus, Lao-tzu, and many others who have walked among us and yet not seem to reach the same state? In The Biology of Transcendence Joseph Chilton Pearce examines the current biological understanding of our neural organization to address how we can go beyond the limitations and constraints of our current capacities of body and mind--how we can transcend. Recent research in the neurosciences and neurocardiology identifies the four neural centers of our brain and indicates that a fifth such center is located in the heart. This research reveals that the evolutionary structure of our brain and its dynamic interactions with our heart are designed by nature to reach beyond our current evolutionary capacities. We are quite literally, made to transcend. Pearce explores how this  biological imperative  drives our life into ever-greater realms of being--even as the  cultural imperative  of social conformity and behavior counters this genetic heritage, blocks our transcendent capacities, and breeds violence in all its forms. The conflict between religion and spirit is an important part of this struggle. But each of us may overthrow these cultural imperatives to reach  unconflicted behavior,  wherein heart and mind-brain resonate in synchronicity, opening us to levels of possibility beyond the ordinary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4CqQvwEACAAJ&dq=The+Biology+of+Transcendence:+A+Blueprint+of+the+Human+Spirit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Properties of Amorphous Carbon (EMIS Datareviews)","description":"World experts in amorphous carbon have been drawn together to produce this comprehensive commentary on the current state and future prospects of amorphous carbon, a highly functional material.

This volume is a major contribution to the field of collective behavior, with implications for social movement analysis. McPhail's critical assessment of the major theories of crowd behavior establishes that, whatever their particular limitations and strengths, all share a general and serious flaw: their explanations were developed without prior examination of the behaviors to be explained. Drawing on a wide range of empirical studies that include his own careful field work, the author offers a new characterization of temporary gatherings. He presents a life cycle of gatherings and a taxonomy of forms of collective behavior within gatherings, as well as combinations of these forms and gatherings into larger events, campaigns and waves. McPhail also develops a new explanation for various ways in which purposive actors construct collective actions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_VB9swEACAAJ&dq=The+Myth+of+the+Madding+Crowd+(Social+Institutions+and+Social+Change)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Cook!","description":"A new collection of 50 healthful and fun-to-prepare recipes features Muppet chefs Elmo, Cookie Monster and Grover as well as educational sidebars and nutrition tips.

In traditional historical and scholarly accounts of the making and fighting of wars, women are often nowhere to be seen. With few exceptions, war stories are told as if men were the only ones who plan, fight, are injured by, and negotiate ends to wars. As the pages of this book tell, though, those accounts are far from complete. Women can be found at every turn in the (gendered) phenomena of war. Women have participated in the making, fighting, and concluding of wars throughout history, and their participation is only increasing at the turn of the 21st century. Women experience war in multiple ways: as soldiers, as fighters, as civilians, as caregivers, as sex workers, as sexual slaves, refugees and internally displaced persons, as anti-war activists, as community peace-builders, and more. This book at once provides a glimpse into where women are in war, and gives readers the tools to understood women s (told and untold) war experiences in the greater context of the gendered nature of global social and political life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fBpevSUcJxAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"U-boats of the Kaiser's Navy (New Vanguard)","description":"As was the case in World War II, one of the greatest threats to Britain during World War I was the German U-boat menace.

Then, once my younger daughter entered second grade, she was comforted by the stories until she began to face difficulties not yet handled by Marcy. Suddenly, Marcy had to discover a whole bunch of new adventures both in school and during summer sleep away camp.

From the interpretations of the card spreads and the lore given, one will gain powerful insights and receive positive guidance for the future. The cards have been drawn using the principles of sacred geometry, a science of great importance to the megalith building, pre-Celtic Druids, who employed it extensively in the building of stone circles. Each image incorporates the same use of a pentagram, circle and square. The border of the animal cards conveys a message in Ogham - the tree language of the Druids. The animals are presented in a sequence starting with the Blackbird, who stands at the Gateway, the Place of Beginnings, calling us to adventure and change. Journeying to the four other Oldest Animals of Stag, Owl, Eagle, and Salmon, we come to know animals that lead us deeper into the Otherworld, through a cycle of personal change that leads to turning to the outer world again, the empowerment of the four dragons and the concluding care of the Seal -- the card of love and the necessity for choice in a world that is both joyous and challenging. The companion booklet presents a summary of the Druid, Celtic and native teachings, concerning twenty-nine animals and four dragons. In addition, there are three blanks cards that can be used to draw animals that are personal to the reader. Use the cards as totems or turn to the oracle system provided by the authors.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PEpoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Venus of Chalk","description":"\\"Take the trip of a lifetime with Carline, a home economist and woman-of-size, Tucker, a bus driver, and Mel, a retiree, as they journey from Massachusetts to Texas to unload an old city bus.

This selection of poetry, fiction, and memoir represents work he has published in hundreds of magazines and over twenty books. Edgy, irreverent, and innovative, lyrical and analytical at the same time, he is one of the age's true literary discoveries. His creative geography ranges from the Bay Area to Mexico, Idaho to Salt Lake City, China to Japan, and now rests in Walla Walla, Washington, where his work continues to evolve. A westerner who faces Mexico and the Pacific Rim more readily than Europe or the eastern United States, Potts takes on the issues of his time, according to poet and critic Janice Faye Fiering, in a mode of address unlike any other. Born in Idaho Falls in 1943, Potts emerged as a counterculture poet in Berkeley until he was hospitalized for psychosis in 1968. He collected and published many of his early writings, re-establishing himself as a poet and essayist, in the 1970s in Salt Lake City. After moving to Walla Walla, he worked in real estate to ensure his family's financial security. His renewed contact with the Idaho West of his youth resulted in important books of poetry in the 1990s, and his work developed further following his study of Japanese and Mandarin Chinese in that decade. His books include Little Lord Shiva (1968); Valga Krusa (1977); Rocky Mountain Man (1978); How the South Finally Won the Civil War (1995); Lost River Mountain (1999); Across the North Pacific (2002); and Kiot (2005).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VGGxAAAAIAAJ&dq=THE+PORTABLE+POTTS.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bluff Your Way in Music (Bluffers Guides)","description":"Be an instant expert on music and bluff your way Z99 classical composure No practicing required just a sense of humor Strike a chord Z99 The Bluffers Guide. to Music and score Z99 bravado in any conversational overture","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sBLowAEACAAJ&dq=Bluff+Your+Way+in+Music+(Bluffers+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ignatian Humanism: A Dynamic Spirituality for the Twenty-First Century","description":"\\"Ignatian Humanism puts into perspective our contemporary search for a spirituality that responds both to our search for meaning and desire for God.\\" -John W.

In this vividly written and meticulously researched book, Ronald Modras shows how Ignatian spirituality retains extraordinary vigor and relevance nearly five centuries after Loyola's death. At its heart, Ignatian spirituality is a humanism that defends human rights, prizes learning from other cultures, seeks common ground between science and religion, struggles for justice, and honors a God who is actively at work in creation. The towering achievements of the Jesuits are made tangible by Modras's vivid portraits of Ignatius and five of his successors: Matteo Ricci, the first Westerner at the court of the Chinese emperor; Friederich Spee, who defended women accused of witchcraft; Karl Rahner, the greatest Catholic theologian of the twentieth century; Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the scientist-mystic; and Pedro Arrupe, the charismatic leader of the Jesuits in the years following Vatican II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WQ2MRXZVKScC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principal Photography: Interviews with Feature Film Cinematographers","description":"By using photography as a storytelling medium, the cinematographer plays a key role in translating a screenplay into images and capturing the director's vision of a film.

For thousands of years, the prophet Moses was regarded as the sole author of the first five books of the Bible, known as the Pentateuch. According to tradition, Moses was divinely directed to write down foundational events in the history of the world: the creation of humans, the worldwide flood, the laws as they were handed down at Mt. Sinai, and the cycle of Israel s enslavement and liberation from Egypt. However, these stories and their frequent discrepancies provoke questions: why does the first chapter in Genesis say that man and woman were made in God s image, while the second says that woman was made from man s rib? Why does one account of the flood say it lasted forty days, while another records no less than one hundred? And why do some stories reflect the history of southern Judah, while others seem sourced from northern Israel? Originally published in 1987, Richard Friedman s Who Wrote the Bible? joins a host of modern scholars who show that the Pentateuch was written by at least four distinct voices separated by borders, political alliances, and particular moments in history then connected by brilliant editors. Rather than cast doubt onto the legitimacy of the Bible, Friedman uses these divergent accounts to illuminate a text that was written by real people. Friedman s seminal and bestselling text is a comprehensive and authoritative answer to the question: just who exactly wrote the Bible?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GafkyQEACAAJ&dq=Who+Wrote+the+Bible%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Car","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vn0UAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus: A Biblical Defense of His Diety","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=evj0QwAACAAJ&dq=Jesus:+A+Biblical+Defense+of+His+Diety&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BodyStories: A Guide to Experiential Anatomy","description":"BodyStories is a book that engages the general reader as well as the serious student of anatomy.

It will provide an update on recent research developments and serve as a starting point for research of the many outstanding issues. After its formation at mid-oceanic spreading centers, oceanic lithosphere cools, thickens, and subsides, until it subducts into the deep mantle beneath convergent margins. As a result of this continuous recycling process oceanic lithosphere is typically less than 200 million years old (the global average is about 80 Myr). A comprehensive, multi-disciplinary study of continents involves a wide range of length scales: tiny rock samples and diamond inclusions may yield isotope and trace element signatures diagnostic for the formation age and evolution of (parts of) cratons, while geophysical techniques (e.g., seismic and electromagnetic imaging) constrain variations of elastic and conductive properties over length scales ranging from several to many thousand kilometers. Integrating and reconciling this information is far from trivial and, as several papers in this volume document, the relationships between, for instance, formation age and tectonic behavior on the one hand and the seismic signature, heat flow, and petrology on the other may not be uniform but may vary both within as well as between cratons. These observations complicate attempts to determine the variations of one particular observable (e.g., heat flow, lithosphere thickness) as a function of another (e.g., crustal age) on the basis of global data compilations and tectonic regionalizations. Important conclusions of the work presented here are that (1) continental deformation, for instance shortening, is not restricted to the crust but also involves the lithospheric mantle; (2) the high wavespeed part of continental lithospheric mantle is probably thinner than inferred previously from vertically travelling body waves or form global surface-wave models; and (3) the seismic signature of ancient continents is more complex than expected from a uniform relationship with crustal age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CeKuBNgPvM8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ski Style: Alpine Interiors, Architecture & Living Style","description":"A celebration of the \\"ski style\\" visits some of the most spectacular ski resorts, lodges, and private homes in the Alps and Colorado to offer readers a peek at this unique style of architectural and interior design.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AuIB-EnsdC8C&dq=Ski+Style:+Alpine+Interiors,+Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Training thoroughbred horses","description":"Preston M.

Chapters that fall into this category include Chapter 7  The Second Step  (the doctrine of sanctification as a second definite work of grace) and Chapter 9  Develop a Lifestyle of Holiness  (aiming for the goal of a holy lifestyle. Chapter 11  Signs of the Times in the Christian Life  (explains ordinances of the church, including baptism and communion, two almost universal teachings of Christianity, and footwashing, which is practiced by only a few church groups. Chapter 13  The Last Chapter  deals with the end times from an amillenial eschatological perspective. Even if this is not your theological view, it might be helpful for you to understand end times teaching as viewed from the amillenial perspective.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9O-8BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kriegsmarine U-boats 1939-45 (1) (New Vanguard) (v. 1)","description":"This, the first of two volumes on Germany's World War II U-boats, traces their development from the early U-boats of the Kaiser's Navy, the prohibition on Germany having U-boats following the Armistice in 1918 and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles, the secret development of U-boats using a 'cover-firm' in Holland, culminating in the formation of the 1st U-boat Flotilla in 1935 with the modern Type II.

Over 60 exercises for recognizing, releasing, and transforming fear to promote healing. ? Includes case studies, transcribed dreamwork, and the author's personal story of healing. When Laurel Ann Reinhardt discovered a lump in her breast she witnessed firsthand how fear holds silent reign over the patient in the Western health care system and hinders the process of healing. This fear is systematically perpetuated by doctors and insurance agents, and it has become the cultural norm--undermining the foundation of all healing and the important work these providers are meant to perform. Drawing on the work of Rupert Sheldrake, Ken Wilbur, and Carl Jung, as well as her 20-plus years of experience as a clinical psychologist, Laurel Ann Reinhardt provides a thoughtful discussion about the existence, creation, and impact of this morphogenetic \\"field of fear\\" in the health care system. She provides us with the tools we need to recognize and release this fear and its harmful role in the healing process. From exercises for \\"expelling the breath of fear\\" and \\"talking back to fear\\" to \\"being heard and seen by physicians\\" and \\"dealing with the fears of our health care providers,\\" Healing without Fear utilizes visualizations, journaling, chakra meditations, and dreamwork to teach both health care professionals and laypersons how to transform fear and allow true healing to begin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3hPZK6QtowkC&dq=Healing+without+Fear:+How+to+Overcome+Your+Fear+of+Doctors,+Hospitals,+and+the+Health+Care+System+and+Find+Your+Way+to+True+Healing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Longarm 002: On Border","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZvKNAAAACAAJ&dq=Longarm+002:+On+Border&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Defy Not The Heart (BCED)","description":"Like masterpieces of art, music, and literature, great mathematical theorems are creative milestones, works of genius destined to last forever.

Stern is especially concerned with the process by which we come to formulate the unformulated. It is not an instrumental task, he holds, but one that requires openness and curiosity; the result of the process is not accuracy alone, but experience that is deeply felt and fully imagined. Stern's sense of explicit verbal experience as continuously constructed and emergent leads to a central dialectic at the heart of his work: that between curiosity and imagination, on one hand, and dissociation and unthinking acceptance of the familiar on the other. The goal of psychoanalytic work, he holds, is the freedom to be curious, whereas defense signifies the denial of this freedom. We defend against our fear of what we would think, that is, if we allowed ourselves the freedom to think it. Stern also shows how the unconscious itself can be reconceptualized hermeneutically, and he goes on to explore the implications of this viewpoint on interpretation and countertransference. He is especially persuasive in showing how the interpersonal field, which is continuously in flux, limits the experience that it is possible for participants to reflect on. Thus it is that analyst and patient are together \\"caught in the grip of the field,\\" often unable to see the kind of relatedness in which they are mutually involved. A brilliant demonstration of the clinical consequentiality of hermeneutic thinking, Unformulated Experience bears out Stern's belief that psychoanalysis is as much about the revelation of the new in experience as it is about the discovery of the old","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V2p0Dm1Rkt8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul; The Theology of the Apostole in the Light of Jewish History","description":"A major study of the apostle to the Gentiles, combining exceptional scholarship with an unusual approach. Schoeps interprets Paul's theology in the light of his Jewish background, which coloured and conditioned his Christological teaching. Paul's conception of Jesus differs from that of the Synoptics: what and how extensive the difference is and whence it is derived are among the questions Schoeps examines. After surveying major problems in Pauline research, the Author relates the apostle to primitive Christianity, discussing his eschatology and his teachings on salvation, the law, and saving history. The final chapter shows that Paul's distinctive doctrines result from two converging factors, that Paul never saw Jesus in the flesh, and the influence of Jewish teaching. The consequence was his concern with the resurrected Saviour of the world, the pre-existent and eternal Son of God.

Roberto Goizueta, a Cuban-American theologian, aware that \\"Hispanic\\" and \\"Latino\\" can be terms imposed artificially on diverse peoples, finds a common link in the Spanish language and in a shared culture. Central to this culture is the experience of exile, of being a people at the margins of a society, who must find and make their way together. Central also is faith, and its grounding in this experience of being in exile. In delineating the very particular nature and worldview of Hispanic/Latino theology, Caminemos con Jesus challenges both traditional Euro-American theologies and modern Western epistemological assumptions. It examines the implications of this theological method for the Church and the academy, as well as for the future of the Latino community and North American society. Caminemos con Jesus provides lessons in discipleship for non-Hispanics and Hispanics alike, for students of contemporary theology, and all those engaged in pastoral and church-based work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NH9uCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Home Environmental Sourcebook: 50 Environmental Hazards to Avoid When Buying, Selling, or Maintaining a Home","description":"Covers interior and exterior health threats, including lead-based paint, radon, landfills, and incinerators","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pbmvHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Home+Environmental+Sourcebook:+50+Environmental+Hazards+to+Avoid+When+Buying,+Selling,+or+Maintaining+a+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CST - Earth Science 7-12 (Cst Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Compleat Angler, or, the Contemplative Man's Recreation","description":"An immediate success when if was first published in 1653, Walton's classic celebrtion of the joys of fishing continues to captivate anglers and nature lovers with its timeless advice and instruction.

Scientists are beginning to discover what believers have known for a long time: the rewards that a religious life can provide. For millennia, people have turned to priests, rabbis, imams, shamans, and others to help them deal with issues of grief and loss, birth and death, morality and meaning. In this absorbing work, DeSteno reveals how numerous religious practices from around the world improve emotional and physical well-being. With empathy and rigor, DeSteno chronicles religious rites and traditions from cradle to grave. He explains how the Japanese rituals surrounding childbirth help strengthen parental bonds with children. He describes how the Apache Sunrise Ceremony makes teenage girls better able to face the rigors of womanhood. He shows how Buddhist meditation reduces hostility and increases compassion. He demonstrates how the Jewish practice of sitting shiva comforts the bereaved. And much more. DeSteno details how belief itself enhances physical and mental health. But you don t need to be religious to benefit from the trove of wisdom that religion has to offer. Many items in religion s  toolbox  can help the body and mind whether or not one believes. How God Works offers advice on how to incorporate many of these practices to help all of us live more meaningful, successful, and satisfying lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CbYYEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pilgrim's Path: Freemasonry and the Religious Right","description":"It's a masterpiece...if you're interested in American Masonry and its impact on our country, this book is for you.--Brent Morris, The Scottish Rite Journal","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N3e90eNBIgsC&dq=A+Pilgrim%27s+Path:+Freemasonry+and+the+Religious+Right&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sheppard Murder Case","description":"Discusses the Sheppard murder trial, the recent fascination with the case, and the uncovering of new evidence pointing to a long-ignored suspect","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3mrv4KjInwEC&dq=The+Sheppard+Murder+Case&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Lying in Bed & Other Essays","description":"Alberto Manguel has edited for Bayeux Arts this fascinating collection of G.K.

The respiratory system takes oxygen from the atmosphere and transports it by diffusion from the air in the alveoli to the blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries. The cardiovascular system then moves the oxygenated blood from the heart to the microcirculation of the various organs by convection, where oxygen is released from hemoglobin in the red blood cells and moves to the parenchymal cells of each tissue by diffusion. Oxygen that has diffused into cells is then utilized in the mitochondria to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of all cells. The mitochondria are able to produce ATP until the oxygen tension or PO2 on the cell surface falls to a critical level of about 45 mm Hg. Thus, in order to meet the energetic needs of cells, it is important to maintain a continuous supply of oxygen to the mitochondria at or above the critical PO2 . In order to accomplish this desired outcome, the cardiorespiratory system, including the blood, must be capable of regulation to ensure survival of all tissues under a wide range of circumstances. The purpose of this presentation is to provide basic information about the operation and regulation of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, as well as the properties of the blood and parenchymal cells, so that a fundamental understanding of the regulation of tissue oxygenation is achieved.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w_XwDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Map State Road Atlas Florida","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T2GFwgEACAAJ&dq=American+Map+State+Road+Atlas+Florida&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Penny Arcade","description":"The seven stories of In the Penny Arcade blend both the real and the fantastic in a seductive mix that illuminates the full range of Steven Millhauser?s gifts, from ?August Eschenburg?, the story of a clockmaker?s son whose extraordinary talent for creating animated figures is lost on a world whose taste for the perverse and crude supersedes that of the refined and beautiful, to ?Cathay?, a kingdom whose wonders include landscape paintings executed on the bodies of court ladies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3pJDPgAACAAJ&dq=In+the+Penny+Arcade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LAROUSSE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF ARCHAEOLOGY","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Three bear family activity book, grades K-3","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pI_1GwAACAAJ&dq=Three+bear+family+activity+book,+grades+K-3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pancake Pie","description":"Despite many difficulties, a farmer named Festus is determined to celebrate his cat's birthday by baking a pancake pie.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j6DPz5vuR2kC&dq=Pancake+Pie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lover's Talisman","description":"Welcome to Talisman Bay, where all hell breaks loose on a daily basis, especially when you fall in love.

But over a hundred years later, early Florida breeders would be scoffed at for their attempts to raise horses in Florida.\\" Early thoroughbred breeders (mainly the bluegrass hardboots of Kentucky) warned that thoroughbred horses couldn't survive the Florida heat and swampland. \\"Stick to raising alligators,\\" they mocked. Today the thoroughbred industry is a major business in the state (ranking third in terms of revenue), and racehorses that are born, raised, and trained in Florida gallop to worldwide acclaim. Long-awaited by people in the industry, this book by award-winning turf writer Charlene R. Johnson is the only complete history of racing and breeding in the state. Long known as a winter racing mecca, the Hialeah Race Track opened the \\"palm tree circuit\\" in 1925 with a dusty track, an infield of burned weeds, and no unloading facilities for the tired horses who arrived by train from New York. The first string to race at Hialeah unloaded in downtown Miami and walked ten miles to the track while grooms wielded baseball bats to protect the horses from snakes. The success--and quirky personality--of Needles, the first Florida thoroughbred to win the Kentucky Derby, in 1956 (coming from second-to-last position on the backstretch), accelerated the state's breeding program. Johnson documents the business from the early era in Tallahassee in the 1800s to its unprecedented growth in Marion County, where limestone deposits in the rolling green countryside provide the perfect nutrients for healthy bones and cartilage in livestock. Interviews with first- and second-generation horse people contribute to this record--including Fred Hooper, winner of more breeder's awards and racing honors than anyone in the United States, and Frank David (\\"Buddy\\") Yates, Needles' gallop boy in the fifties and the son of Needles' trainer, Roy Yates. Among more than a hundred photographs in the book are shots of the famous captive flamingoes at Hialeah, Rough 'n Tumble's swimming pool at Ocala Stud, Needles exhibiting his characteristic displeasure during morning exercise, Carryback, the second Florida thoroughbred to win the Kentucky Derby, and Affirmed, the first to win the Triple Crown. Appendixes provide information on tracks, earnings, winners, breeder awards, and more. Charlene R. Johnson is a freelance turf writer and has been involved in all facets of the thoroughbred industry for the past twenty years, from breeding to racing, galloping on the track, to walking hots. She belongs to the Florida and National Turf Writers' Associations and has published articles in The Thoroughbred Times, The Blood Horse, Spur Magazine, and Chronicle of the Horse, winning three national awards for her writing. She served as editor of The Florida Horse and as staff writer for the The Horsemen's Journal, wrote a weekly column for the Daily Racing Form, and was the main correspondent for the Florida Thoroughbred Times.

Hallen renders a great service to African philosophy.\\" --Kwasi Wiredu In Yoruba culture, morality and moral values are intimately linked to aesthetics. The purest expression of beauty, at least for human beings, is to possess good moral character. But how is moral character judged? How do actions, and especially words, reveal good moral character in a culture that is still significantly based on oral tradition? In this original and intimate look at Yoruba culture, Barry Hallen asks the Yoruba onisegun--the wisest and most accomplished herbalists or traditional healers, individuals justly reputed to be well versed in Yoruba thought and expression--what it means to be good and beautiful. Posed as an outsider wanting to gain understanding of how to speak Yoruba correctly, Hallen engages the onisegun and has them explain the subtleties and intricacies of Yoruba language use and the philosophy behind particular word choices. Their instructions reveal a striking and profound depiction of Yoruba aesthetic and ethical thought. The detailed interpretations of everyday language that Hallen supplies challenge prevailing Western views that African thought is nothing more than acquiescence to long-established religious or communal values. The philosophy of ordinary language reveals that moral reflection is indeed individual and that evaluations of action and character take place on the basis of clearly and logically delineated criteria. With the onisegun as his guides, Hallen identifies the priorities of Yoruba philosophy and culture through everyday expression and shows that there are rational pathways to both truth and beauty. Barry Hallen has taught philosophy at the Obafemi Awolowo University (formerly University of Ife) in Nigeria. He is a Fellow at the W. E. B. DuBois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard University and Visiting Professor of Philosophy at Morehouse College. He is coauthor (with J.

Second, it proposes that the inhabitants of this subterranean biosphere are not plants or animals as we know them, but heat-loving bacteria that survive on a diet consisting solely of hydrocarbons that is, natural gas and petroleum. And third and perhaps most heretically, the book advances the stunning idea that most hydrocarbons on Earth are not the byproduct of biological debris (\\"fossil fuels\\"), but were a common constituent of the materials from which the earth itself was formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The implications are astounding. The theory proposes answers to often-asked questions: Is the deep hot biosphere where life originated, and do Mars and other seemingly barren planets contain deep biospheres? Even more provocatively, is it possible that there is an enormous store of hydrocarbons upwelling from deep within the earth that can provide us with abundant supplies of gas and petroleum? However far-fetched these ideas seem, they are supported by a growing body of evidence, and by the indisputable stature and seriousness Gold brings to any scientific debate. In this book we see a brilliant and boldly original thinker, increasingly a rarity in modern science, as he develops potentially revolutionary ideas about how our world works.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b17dBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow of a Dragon (The Langsyne Chronicles, Book 1)","description":"This work is the only comprehensive guide to sequels in English, with over 84,000 works by 12,500 authors in 17,000 sequences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QL4SAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Shadow+of+a+Dragon+(The+Langsyne+Chronicles,+Book+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Captain Blood","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beekeeping","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q9ksn3cxbN4C&dq=Beekeeping&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dream Interiors","description":"The companion to Atrium's Dream Houses, this inspiring volume features more than one hundred of today is most creative interior design projects from around the world.

Hanfling shows in this introduction to Ayer's work how he turned this philosophy into a form of British empiricism in the tradition of Hume. According to Ayer, philosophy is an activity of analysts. Metaphysical truths can be neither established nor refuted by philosophical enquiry: they are meaningless. In support of this claim, he deployed his 'principle of verifiability'. But he found it difficult to refine the principle 'in such a way as to find a middle ground between [an] over-strict requirement' which would disqualify perfectly ordinary statements as meaningless, and 'the over-indulgent licensing of gibberish' - including that of metaphysics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZWp1CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heal the Hurt That Runs Your Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hgj3XMoiI3QC&dq=Heal+the+Hurt+That+Runs+Your+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Row This Boat Ashore","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3XSU6ynEZkoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Johann Sebastian Bach: His life, art, and work","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lROijsZhGukC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gertrude and Alice","description":"How had the pair of elderly Jewish lesbians survived the Nazis?\\" Janet Malcolm asks at the beginning of this extraordinary work of literary biography and investigative journalism. The pair, of course, is Gertrude Stein, the modernist master \\"whose charm was as conspicuous as her fatness\\" and \\"thin, plain, tense, sour\\" Alice B. Toklas, the \\"worker bee\\" who ministered to Stein's needs throughout their forty-year expatriate \\"marriage.\\" As Malcolm pursues the truth of the couple's charmed life in a village in Vichy France, her subject becomes the larger question of biographical truth. \\"The instability of human knowledge is one of our few certainties,\\" she writes. The portrait of the legendary couple that emerges from this work is unexpectedly charged. The two world wars Stein and Toklas lived through together are paralleled by the private war that went on between them. This war, as Malcolm learned, sometimes flared into bitter combat. Two Lives is also a work of literary criticism. \\"Even the most hermetic of [Stein's] writings are works of submerged autobiography,\\" Malcolm writes. \\"The key of 'I' will not unlock the door to their meaning-you need a crowbar for that-but will sometimes admit you to a kind of anteroom of suggestion.\\" Whether unpacking the accessible Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, in which Stein \\"solves the koan of autobiography,\\" or wrestling with The Making of Americans, a masterwork of \\"magisterial disorder,\\" Malcolm is stunningly perceptive.

This plan was a failure, chiefly because Hitler was not a statesman who would ultimately conform to familiar norms. Chamberlain's policy was doomed because he had greatly misjudged Hitler's basic beliefs and thus his behavior. U.S. Cold War nuclear deterrence policy was similarly based on the confident but questionable assumption that Soviet leaders would be rational by Washington's standards; they would behave reasonably when presented with nuclear threats. The United States assumed that any sane challenger would be deterred from severe provocations because not to do so would be foolish. Keith B. Payne addresses the question of whether this line of reasoning is adequate for the post-Cold War period. By analyzing past situations and a plausible future scenario, a U.S.-Chinese crisis over Taiwan, he proposes that American policymakers move away from the assumption that all our opponents are comfortably predictable by the standards of our own culture. In order to avoid unexpected and possibly disastrous failures of deterrence, he argues, we should closely examine particular opponents' culture and beliefs in order to better anticipate their likely responses to U.S. deterrence threats.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VgQaEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespearean Whodunits: Murders And Mysteries based on Shakespeare's Plays","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bUCnAAAACAAJ&dq=Shakespearean+Whodunits:+Murders+And+Mysteries+based+on+Shakespeare%27s+Plays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wolf Tales","description":"When wolf rescue specialist Lisa Quinn, who has no idea of her Chanku heritage, meets Tinker McClintock, she finds the perfect partner to satisfy her hunger as she undergoes a change that awakens sensations she has never experienced.

Tim Kennedy has a problem; he only feels alive right before he s about to die. Kennedy, a Green Beret, decorated Army sniper, and UFC headliner, has tackled a bull with his bare hands, jumped out of airplanes, dove to the depths of the ocean, and traveled the world hunting poachers, human traffickers, and the Taliban. But he s also the same man who got kicked out of the police department, fire department, and as an EMT, before getting two women pregnant four days apart, and finally, been beaten up by his Special Forces colleagues for, quite simply,  being a selfish asshole.  In Scars and Stripes, Kennedy describes how these failures shaped him into the successful businessman and devoted husband and father he is today. Through unbelievably vivid, wild anecdotes Kennedy reveals all the dumb, violent, embarrassing, and undeniably heroic things he s done in his life, including multiple combat missions in Afghanistan, building a school in Texas for elementary kids, and creating two-multimillion-dollar businesses.

With a keen eye for the telling anecdote and pivotal moment, he portrays an array of vivid incidents to show us how Paris endures through each age, is altered but always emerges more brilliant and beautiful than ever. The Seven Ages of Paris is a great historian s tribute to a city he loves and has spent a lifetime learning to know. \\"Knowledgeable and colorful, written with gusto and love....

He yearned to get back to what's real - in this case, real food. And while not entirely certain what that is or what it will mean, he knew he wanted to try. The rest of the book is that journey. Each chapter explores one aspect of his newfound life, describing the challenges of trying to make a farm profitable. A chapter on cows spotlights Kurt's first dairy heifer, Dinah, including her attempt to hump him and Kurt's painful hand-milking days. Another chapter focuses on Kurt's failed endeavor selling vegetables. Readers follow Kurt's evolution into a farmer while learning valuable tips (What is the best way to take honey from your beehive? How do you organize a pig slaughter? How do you ensure you make a profit?). Inspiring and practical, Growing a Farmer is a heartfelt story of one's relationship to food, the land, and the lifestyle of a farmer. We end with him hosting dinners once a week and selling cheese, uncertain he can ever make this work but enjoying every minute of it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b298EkrTdokC&dq=Anyone+can+live+off+the+land&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hiking Trails of Nova Scotia","description":"Michael Haynes is Mr. Hiking in Nova Scotia.

Major Gurney writes about B-29 operations in the Pacific, asserting that this aircraft was instrumental in forcing the Japanese to surrender. Much has been written about this great airplane, because any account of the devastating fire raids on Japan or of the dramatic beginnings of atomic warfare would be incomplete without telling the story of the B-29s which figured so prominently in these missions. But there is also an exciting story behind that story the story of the giant bomber s journey from the drawing boards of its designers to the day when out of the bomb bay of the  Enola Gay  tumbled the fantastic new weapon that, with a blinding flash and unprecedented power, brought about the dawn of the nuclear age. That is the story which Gene Gurney tells in Journey of the Giants, and he tells it well. The book ends with the historic scene on the battleship Missouri which signified the end of the war in the Pacific and, with it, the end of World War II. But while this was the climax in the B-29 s long journey, it was by no means its end. B-29s continued to serve a variety of important peacetime missions; they did their share in the development and testing of advanced nuclear weapons and, in the Korean War, added new battle honors to those gained in the Pacific.

Science is a force for good in the world at least usually. But sometimes, when obsession gets the better of scientists, they twist a noble pursuit into something sinister. Under this spell, knowledge isn t everything, it s the only thing no matter the cost. Bestselling author Sam Kean tells the true story of what happens when unfettered ambition pushes otherwise rational men and women to cross the line in the name of science, trampling ethical boundaries and often committing crimes in the process. The Icepick Surgeon masterfully guides the reader across two thousand years of history, beginning with Cleopatra s dark deeds in ancient Egypt. The book reveals the origins of much of modern science in the transatlantic slave trade of the 1700s, as well as Thomas Edison s mercenary support of the electric chair and the warped logic of the spies who infiltrated the Manhattan Project. But the sins of science aren t all safely buried in the past. Many of them, Kean reminds us, still affect us today. We can draw direct lines from the medical abuses of Tuskegee and Nazi Germany to current vaccine hesitancy, and connect icepick lobotomies from the 1950s to the contemporary failings of mental-health care. Kean even takes us into the future, when advanced computers and genetic engineering could unleash whole new ways to do one another wrong. Unflinching, and exhilarating to the last page, The Icepick Surgeon fuses the drama of scientific discovery with the illicit thrill of a true-crime tale. With his trademark wit and precision, Kean shows that, while science has done more good than harm in the world, rogue scientists do exist, and when we sacrifice morals for progress, we often end up with neither.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F-cKEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Proof Positive","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Flat Rock Journal: A Day in the Ozark Mountains (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","description":"Now in paperback--\\"A Thoreau-voiced memoir of a day off spent recharging the author's batteries by his lonesome in the Ozark woods. . . .

Of course, looking at it the other way, Maine offers these retirees many golden opportunities as well. When Vicki Doudera?s first book, Moving to Maine, was published, she quickly started getting feedback indicating that many readers would welcome a book written specifically for people coming to Maine to retire. Vicki was ready and willing to rise to the challenge, and the result is Where to Retire in Maine. Organized geographically, Where to Retire in Maine examines 21 towns in depth, providing information on housing options, health care availability, transportation, safety, traffic, churches, fitness centers, assisted living, recreational and volunteer opportunities, shopping, weather, educational and cultural resources, and more. The featured towns all stand out as proven retirement destinations themselves, but they also characterize and serve as focal points for their larger regions. Residents and town officials helped provide the information specific to their towns, and first-person quotes from retirees to the area round out this informative and user-friendly guide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bouIAAAACAAJ&dq=Where+to+Retire+in+Maine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Players in the Game: Destiny of Doom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5KZ-_4byxEkC&dq=Players+in+the+Game:+Destiny+of+Doom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swept Off Her Feet","description":"Swept Off Her Feet by Coleen Kimbrough released on Aug 24, 1984 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=22E9l0mFPBoC&dq=Swept+Off+Her+Feet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Law of Gravity","description":"In Newton's view, all objects exert a force that attracts other objects. That universal law of gravitation worked pretty well for predicting the motion of planets as well as objects on Earth and it's still used, for example, when making the calculations for a rocket launch. But unfortunately it cannot be derived from first principles.While Newton was able to formulate his law of gravity in his monumental work, he was deeply uncomfortable with the notion of \\"action at a distance\\" that his equations implied. In 1692, in his third letter to Bentley, he wrote:\\"That one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one another, is to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, no man who has in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it.\\"He never, in his words, \\"assigned the cause of this power\\". In all other cases, he used the phenomenon of motion to explain the origin of various forces acting on bodies, but in the case of gravity, he was unable to experimentally identify the motion that produces the force of gravity. Moreover, he refused to even offer a hypothesis as to the cause of this force on grounds that to do so was contrary to sound science. He lamented that \\"philosophers have hitherto attempted the search of nature in vain\\" for the source of the gravitational force, as he was convinced \\"by many reasons\\" that there were \\"causes hitherto unknown\\" that were fundamental to all the \\"phenomena of nature\\". These fundamental phenomena are still under investigation and, though hypotheses abound, the definitive answer has yet to be found.\\"I have not yet been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity from phenomena and I feign no hypotheses.... It is enough that gravity does really exist and acts according to the laws I have explained, and that it abundantly serves to account for all the motions of celestial bodies.\\" NewtonIn this book gravity has been derived from first principles without any assumptions. What has been believed to be a fundamental force for years can actually be derived from first principles has this book explains. The derivation is simple and straight foward. The experiment to the derivation has also been proposed.This book will help us rethink Physics.In this book gravity has been derived from first principles without any assumptions.

Mortified by his cowardice, Henry yearns for a wound, his own red badge of courage, which would legitimize his desertion of his company. When Henry is finally wounded, he finds himself feeling real anger for the very first time, and finally is able to redeem himself.First published in 1865, and in print for 137 years, Stephen Crane's story is considered one of the most important novels of the nineteenth century. It explores the dual natures of battle -- the simultaneous sensations of beauty and violence, of terror and triumph -- and masterfully mirrors them to Henry's own inner turmoil. Fervent and patriotic illustrations by Wendell Minor make The Red Badge of Courage an important addition to the Scribner Illustrated Classics series.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nh2yzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Red+Badge+of+Courage+(Scribner+Illustrated+Classic+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beneath These Waters: Archeological and Historical Studies of 11,500 Years Along the Savannah River","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PRwCppJc1WEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to do Everything with Your Zire Handheld","description":"This friendly, solutions-oriented guide is filled with step-by-step examples that illustrate how to set up and navigate your Zire, and make the most of the hardware, built-in applications, and third-party tools.

Michael Franti, musician, filmmaker, activist What if, instead of constantly pushing yourself beyond your limitations, you paused to really listen to your body s needs? In Gravity & Grace, innovative yoga teacher and trainer Peter Sterios shares a unique set of practice principles to help anyone from beginners to advanced practitioners and teachers revitalize their approach to yoga by tuning into the subtle body. When our yoga practices become too rigid, overly focused on technique, or dependent upon ideals that are not suited to our bodies, we lose the full potential of what yoga offers a truly personal pathway to physical well-being, emotional unfolding, and spiritual awakening. In this groundbreaking book, Sterios helps you embrace the full, healing potential of yoga as he shares wisdom gained from over 45 years of exploring yoga and the subtle body. He teaches that by developing a sensitivity to how the natural forces of gravity and grace are at work physically and psychologically, we become empowered to confidently decide how to practice each day. Through an insightful blend of practical theory and direct instruction, Sterios will guide you to incorporate awareness of physical and subtle anatomy into your practice, utilize the breath for greater well-being, and create flowing sequences that naturally meet your unique needs in each moment. For teachers looking to deepen their offerings, students who want to bring a more personalized and healing experience to their yoga practice, and anyone working with physical limitations (from injury, body type, age, or any of the myriad obstacles humans face), Gravity & Grace is the  no-style  yoga guide you ve been waiting for.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nZ1jDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My 50 Years in Hollywood: The Story of a 22-Year-Old","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Critical Thinking","description":"How the concept of critical thinking emerged, how it has been defined, and how critical thinking skills can be taught. Critical thinking is regularly cited as an essential twenty-first century skill, the key to success in school and work. Given our propensity to believe fake news, draw incorrect conclusions, and make decisions based on emotion rather than reason, it might even be said that critical thinking is vital to the survival of a democratic society. But what, exactly, is critical thinking? In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Jonathan Haber explains how the concept of critical thinking emerged, how it has been defined, and how critical thinking skills can be taught and assessed. Haber describes the term's origins in such disciplines as philosophy, psychology, and science. He examines the components of critical thinking, including structured thinking, language skills, background knowledge, and information literacy, along with such necessary intellectual traits as intellectual humility, empathy, and open-mindedness. He discusses how research has defined critical thinking, how elements of critical thinking have been taught for centuries, and how educators can teach critical thinking skills now. Haber argues that the most important critical thinking issue today is that not enough people are doing enough of it. Fortunately, critical thinking can be taught, practiced, and evaluated. This book offers a guide for teachers, students, and aspiring critical thinkers everywhere, including advice for educational leaders and policy makers on how to make the teaching and learning of critical thinking an educational priority and practical reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GM_XDwAAQBAJ&dq=Critical+Thinking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Late Phoenix","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ePxgewAACAAJ&dq=A+Late+Phoenix&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crimes of Conscience (African Writers Series)","description":"In stories set in South Africa a woman betrays her husband's best friend, an activist and spy fall in love, refugees are forced to move, and politics strangles daily life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LrdaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Crimes+of+Conscience+(African+Writers+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Irreverent Guide to Walt Disney World (Irreverent Guides)","description":"Looking for a travel guide that goes where other guides fear to tread?

Michael Hrebeniak asserts that Jack Kerouac's \\"wild form\\" self-organizing narratives free of literary, grammatical, and syntactical conventions moves within an experimental continuum across the arts to generate a Dionysian sense of writing as raw process. Action Writing highlights how Kerouac made concrete his 1952 intimation of \\"something beyond the novel\\" by assembling ideas from Beat America, modernist poetics, action painting, bebop, and subterranean oral traditions. Geared to scholars and students of American literature, Beat studies, and creative writing, Action Writing places Kerouac's writing within the context of the American art scene at midcentury.

Given this new reality, the essays in Final Acts explore how we can make informed and caring end-of-life choices for ourselves and for those we love and what can happen without such planning. Contributors include patients, caretakers, physicians, journalists, lawyers, social workers, educators, hospital administrators, academics, psychologists, and a poet, and among them are ethicists, religious believers, and nonbelievers. Some write moving, personal accounts of \\"good\\" or 'bad\\" deaths; others examine the ethical, social, and political implications of slow dying. Essays consider death from natural causes, suicide, and aid-in-dying (assisted suicide). Writing in a style free of technical jargon, the contributors discuss documents that should be prepared (health proxy, do-not-resuscitate order, living will, power of attorney); decision-making (over medical interventions, life support, hospice and palliative care, aid-in-dying, treatment location, speaking for those who can no longer express their will); and the roles played by religion, custom, family, friends, caretakers, money, the medical establishment, and the government. For those who yearn for some measure of control over death, the essayists in Final Acts, from very different backgrounds and with different personal and professional experiences around death and dying, offer insight and hope.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lDP1fWhowJwC&dq=Final+Acts:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"UP GOES THE SKYSCRAPER!","description":"Follows, in simple text and illustrations, the building of a skyscraper step by step.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZJ3SAAAACAAJ&dq=UP+GOES+THE+SKYSCRAPER!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Royal Portraits","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MfdIOwAACAAJ&dq=Royal+Portraits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five Books Of Miriam: A Woman's Commentary on the Torah","description":"Weaving together Jewish lore, the voices of Jewish foremothers, Yiddish fable, midrash and stories of her own imagining, Ellen Frankel has created in this book a breathtakingly vivid exploration into what the Torah means to women.

Born in Asia Minor in about 130 A.D., he became Bishop of Lyons and died as a martyr early in the third century. His main work, Adversus Haereses (Against the Heresies), is as relevant today as it was eighteen hundred years ago. It is a critique of Gnosticism, the 'anti-body' heresy, which, far from dying out, continues to flourish as the main threat to the Christian faith in our own day. With serenity and good humor, Irenaeus unfolds the unity of God's purpose in creation and redemption, in Old and New Testaments. The flesh and blood which Gnosticism so despised has been assumed by God in the womb of the Virgin Mary, and glorified in the Resurrection and the Eucharist. In this book, quotations from Saint Irenaeus have been arranged thematically in order to show the unity of his Christian view of the world. The texts have been selected and are introduced by the late Hans Urs von Balthasar, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest Catholic theologians of this century. They are translated by John Saward. \\"Everything in Irenaeus is bathed in a warm and radiant joy, a wise and majestic gentleness. His words of struggle are hard as iron and crystal clear, ... so penetrating that they cannot fail to enlighten the unbiased observer.\\" - Hans Urs von Balthasar","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NZKjDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Some Sunday","description":"With all the drama, insight and wit of her best-selling Butterscotch Blues, Some Sunday pulls readers back into the lives of a young woman and the three friends who help her cope with the aftermath of loss.

Born and raised in an all-black area of Jacksonville, Florida, Oliver was one of the first African American freshmen to enter the University of Florida. Though she chronicles the strains of her transition from Jim Crow to desegregation, this book is much more than a memoir of the turbulent sixties. It is an upbeat journal of self-discovery in the aftermath of that decade, a look at one woman's coming to terms with living an integrated life in America. With humor, poignancy, and lyrical language (reminiscent at times of another Florida writer, Zora Neale Hurston), Oliver shares her passage from the \\"old world\\" to the new an immigrant's journey indicative of the American experience. Blending past and present, she searches for roots from the Gullah or \\"Geechee\\" culture of South Carolina to the urban streets of northern Florida to the multicultural mix of South Florida's diverse ethnic cultures, serving up family stories with large helpings of southern \\"folktalk,\\" food, and music along the way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XeMzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And That's the Way It Will Be: News and Information in a Digital World (Fast Track Book)","description":"The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called \\"surveillance capitalism,\\" and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behavior. In this masterwork of original thinking and research, Shoshana Zuboff provides startling insights into the phenomenon that she has named surveillance capitalism. The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth. Zuboff vividly brings to life the consequences as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every economic sector. Vast wealth and power are accumulated in ominous new \\"behavioral futures markets,\\" where predictions about our behavior are bought and sold, and the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new \\"means of behavioral modification.\\" The threat has shifted from a totalitarian Big Brother state to a ubiquitous digital architecture: a \\"Big Other\\" operating in the interests of surveillance capital. Here is the crucible of an unprecedented form of power marked by extreme concentrations of knowledge and free from democratic oversight. Zuboff's comprehensive and moving analysis lays bare the threats to twenty-first century society: a controlled \\"hive\\" of total connection that seduces with promises of total certainty for maximum profit -- at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human future. With little resistance from law or society, surveillance capitalism is on the verge of dominating the social order and shaping the digital future -- if we let it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lRqrDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flavors of Bon Appetit: 1999 (Flavors of Bon Appetit)","description":"The food magazine's annual roundup of great recipes includes instructions for preparing paella with chicken, shrimp, and sausage; grilled trout with lemon-sage butter; poached pears, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6e0QBzIKz80C&dq=The+Flavors+of+Bon+Appetit:+1999+(Flavors+of+Bon+Appetit)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memo From David O.

She took the bait, of course, and thus opened a new chapter in a life that had already seen enough adventure for three lifetimes.The Seahawk turns out to be the rustiest of buckets, with sprung, busted, and ancient equipment guaranteed to fail at any critical moment. Life is never dull out on the Grand Banks, and no one is better at capturing the flavor and details of the wild ride that is swordfishing, from the technical complexities of longline fishing and the nuances of reading the weather and waves to the sheer beauty of the open water. The trip is full of surprises, \\"a bit hardier and saltier than I had hoped for,\\" but none more unexpected than when the boat's lines inadvertently drift across the Canadian border and she lands in jail. Seaworthy is about nature -- human and other; about learning what you can control and what you do when fate takes matters out of your control. It's about how a middle-aged woman who sets a high bar for herself copes with challenge and change and frustration, about the struggle to succeed or fail on your own terms, and above all, about learning how to find your true self when you're caught between land and sea.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bBrGTQejipEC&dq=Cultivating+Sacred+Space+:+Gardening+for+the+Soul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life and energy (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","description":"An essential resource for paleontologists, biologists, geologists, and teachers, The Rise of Animals is the best single reference on one of earth s most significant events.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KsFFIrJ8IxEC&dq=Life+and+energy+(A+Bantam+pathfinder+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crack in the Cosmic Egg: New Constructs of Mind and Reality","description":"The classic work that shaped the thought of a generation with its powerful insights into the true nature of mind and reality. ? Defines culture as a \\"cosmic egg\\" structured by the mind's drive for logical ordering of its universe. ? Provides techniques allowing individuals to break through the vicious circle of logic-based systems to attain expanded ways of creative living and learning. The sum total of our notions of what the world is--and what we perceive its full potential to be--form a shell of rational thought in which we reside. This logical universe creates a vicious circle of reasoning that robs our minds of power and prevents us from reaching our true potential. To step beyond that circle requires a centering and focus that today's society assaults on every level. Through the insights of Teilhard, Tillich, Jung, Jesus, Carlos Castaneda, and others, Joseph Chilton Pearce provides a mode of thinking through which imagination can escape the mundane shell of current construct reality and leap into a new phase of human evolution. This enormously popular New Age classic is finally available again to challenge the assumptions of a new generation of readers and help them develop their potential through new creative modes of thinking. With a masterful synthesis of recent discoveries in physics, biology, and psychology, Pearce reveals the extraordinary relationship of mind and reality and nature's blueprint for a self-transcending humanity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XBNBPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Crack+in+the+Cosmic+Egg:+New+Constructs+of+Mind+and+Reality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Love a Mystery","description":"With titles like Jesus Is Not Running a Carnival, Things God Wouldnt Say, Cloning the Savior?, On a Train Bound for Nowhere, Re-Examining Maslow, Not On Public Land, and forty-four more discussions, these pieces are sure to engage and sometimes amuse the reader while fortifying a faith based upon Gods Word.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bXViDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Back to Salem (A Jessie Mercer Mystery)","description":"Jessie Mercer has it all fame, fortune, and a best-selling novel being made into a major motion picture starring the alluring Taylor Andrews.

Susan became a noted classics scholar, while John's work in Republican politics led to his appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in the Reagan Administration, from which he resigned in frustration to become active in the American Farm Movement. Just two weeks before his death, he was given the Heroes of American Agriculture Award. When disaster struck and John was diagnosed with AIDS, Susan began writing a work reminiscent of May Sarton's journals, Madeleine L'Engle's Two-Part Invention, and Jessamyn West's The Woman Said Yes. Drawing on the force of family bonds and her humanistic training in classical studies for comfort and guidance, she shows us two siblings sharing an agonizing but special journey, finding opportunities rather than resignation, commitment rather than withdrawal, and strength instead of defeat. This is, in short, a good and inspiring story - one that will help point the way for the millions of others - those who are HIV positive as well as their friends and families - who bear the emotional wounds this disease is inflicting on ever-increasing numbers of us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4_yIPwAACAAJ&dq=Seasons+of+Grief+and+Grace:+A+Sister%27s+Story+of+AIDS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Star Gift: Flavia's Dream Maker Stories #8 (Flavia Dream Maker Stories)","description":"A poor, but kind and unselfish young girl who is all alone in the world is led by the stars to a loving family.

MacDonald argues that the origins of passages in the book of Acts are to be found not in early Christian legends but in the epics of Homer. MacDonald focuses on four passages in the book of Acts, examines their potential parallels in the Iliad, and concludes that the author of Acts composed them using famous scenes in Homer s work as a model. Tracing the influence of passages from the Iliad on subsequent ancient literature, MacDonald shows how the story generated a vibrant, mimetic literary tradition long before Luke composed the Acts. Luke could have expected educated readers to recognize his transformation of these tales and to see that the Christian God and heroes were superior to Homeric gods and heroes. Building upon and extending the analytic methods of his earlier book, The Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark, MacDonald opens an original and promising appreciation not only of Acts but also of the composition of early Christian narrative in general. /DIV","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VFJdaAnjmU8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big As Life","description":"\\"Ann has always seen the power and potential in young women.

At times something that man creates has far-reach ing effects; an example that quickly comes to mind is the wheel, which has enabled many devel opments, from pottery to computers. At this point it is important to note that these same wheels could not have been made without metal tools. From early Neolithic times on gold was a favorite choice in the making of jewelry. During the Neolithic period these \\"shining stones,\\" probably alluvial, were prized. Actually gold was cold worked as if it were a stone. There is a surviving example of cold-worked gold from Catahuyuk (present day Turkey) estimated to have been made in 6500 B. C. There were only four metals on the earth's surface that were found in sufficient quantity to be used: gold, copper, silver, and meteoric iron. An understanding of the malleability of gold, and of the annealing effect of fire, changed jewelry making; new forms were found. Gold was no longer a piece of stone but a material that could be flattened and made very thin. Sheet and foil are the oldest forms of worked gold. The smiths' tools were stone, wood, and horn.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WBysBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Open Plot","description":"R.

This pathbreaking study presents a comprehensive battery of empirical tests on the performance of alternative early warning indicators for emerging-market economies that should prove useful in the construction of a more effective global warning system. Not only are the authors able to draw conclusions about which specific indicators have sent the most reliable early warning signals of currency and banking crises in emerging economies, they also test the out-of-sample performance of the model during the Asian crisis and find that it does a good job of identifying the most vulnerable economies. In addition, they show how the early warning system can be used to construct a \\"composite\\" crisis indicator to weigh the importance of alternative channels of cross-country \\"contagion\\" of crises, and to generate information about the recovery path from crises. This timely study comes on the eve of impending changes at the International Monetary Fund as that institution reexamines how it reacts to financial crises. Moreover, the study provides \\"... a wealth of valuable elements for anyone investigating and forecasting adverse developments in emerging markets as well as industrial countries,\\" according to Ewoud Schuitemaker, vice president of the economics department at ABN AMRO Bank.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WayxDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SEARCH FOR THE DOCTOR (Dr. Who-Find Your Fate, No 1)","description":"The reader's decisions will determine whether Peri and Doctor Who can be rescued from the time destabilizer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EAIn3lSfG6cC&dq=SEARCH+FOR+THE+DOCTOR+(Dr.+Who-Find+Your+Fate,+No+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales from the Flat Earth Night's Daughter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hXj-wAEACAAJ&dq=Tales+from+the+Flat+Earth+Night%27s+Daughter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Road from Betrayal (Evans Novel of the West)","description":"In a third novel featuring Seth Strummar, the former gunfighter continues his struggle to reform and to escape from his old way of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MGRmLtwvBjUC&dq=Road+from+Betrayal+(Evans+Novel+of+the+West)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Resources for Educating Children with Diverse Abilities","description":"A guide to educationing children with disabilities covers such topics as inclusion, individualized planning, and partnering with families, and includes information on a variety of disabilities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wMlKAAAAYAAJ&dq=Resources+for+Educating+Children+with+Diverse+Abilities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victorian Fairy Painting","description":"Welcome to an enchanting world populated by the little people   fairies, elves, and sprites   envisioned by such Victorian-era artists as Arthur Rackham, Richard Doyle, Edward Robert Hughes, Warwick Goble, and other masters of the genre.

The Diezmo tells the incredible story of the Mier Expedition, one of the most absurd and tragic military adventures in the history of Texas a country and a state, as Rick Bass writes, that was  born in blood.  In the early days of the Republic of Texas, two young men, wild for glory, impulsively volunteer for an expedition Sam Houston has ordered to patrol the Mexican border. But their dreams of triumph soon fade into prayers for survival, and all that is on their minds is getting home and having a cool drink of water. After being captured in a raid on the Mexican village of Mier, escaping, and being recaptured, the men of the expedition are punished with the terrible diezmo, in which one man in ten is randomly chosen to die. The survivors end up in the most dreaded prison in Mexico. There they become pawns in an international chess game to decide the fate of Texas, and with their hopes of release all but extinguished, they make one desperate, last-ditch effort to escape.  The best literary adventure story I've read since Legends of the Fall. Full of unusual history, exciting events, timely ideas, and stunning wilderness scenery . . . a wonderfully told novel of the human capacity for survival in the face of the very worst that war can do to us.

The drilled infantryman, who had been the mainstay of Mediterranean armies since the days of the Greek hoplite, was gradually replaced by the mounted warrior. This change did not take place overnight, and in the 3rd and 4th centuries the role of the cavalryman was primarily to support the infantry. However, by the time of the 6th century, the situation had been completely reversed.

In 1990, seeking a supply of ethnically acceptable unskilled workers, Japan permitted overseas Japanese, along with their spouses and children, to enter the country as long-term residents. The prospect of high salaries eventually drew about 200,000 nikkeis, as Brazilians of Japanese descent often call themselves, to Japan, making them Japan's third-largest minority group. No One Home is an ethnographic study, based on fieldwork and extensive personal interviews, of nikkeis living in Toyota City. The migrants' dual identities coexist uneasily. The book focuses on how Brazilian factory workers and their children work through the problems arising from their ambiguous status. In Toyota City and environs, Brazilian men and women do hard, dirty, and dangerous physical labor in automobile-parts plants that supply Toyota Motors and other large automobile manufacturers. Japanese schools confront their children with an array of cultural, linguistic, educational, and personal obstacles. In the immediacies of the shop floor, classroom, and their leisure activities, nikkeis remake in Japan selves they had forged as citizens of Brazil, a process that is dynamic, varied, and unpredictable. The book complements the recent literature on transnationalism in several important respects. While recognizing the influence of global economics and media, it emphasizes how transnationalism is lived. It highlights people's experiences rather than the conditions of those experiences, and examines their senses of self rather than identity constructs. Instead of treating neighbors and interviewees as members of social categories, the author explores personal realms--the rich, complex, idiosyncratic selves nikkeis continually refashion during their sojourn in Japan. Overall, he underlines the significance of consciousness, experience, and biography for comprehensive studies of transnationalism and identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aHzyzgEACAAJ&dq=No+One+Home:+Brazilian+Selves+Remade+in+Japan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emergency: Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured (Book with Mini-CD-ROM for Windows & Macintosh, Palm/Handspring, Windows CE/Pocket PC eBook Reader, Smart Phone)","description":"Helping the EMT student become EMT basics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p3yS8u0sRfMC&dq=Emergency:+Care+and+Transportation+of+the+Sick+and+Injured+(Book+with+Mini-CD-ROM+for+Windows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They rode the frontier","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

The brothers are destined to play ball in America, and to shape the history of their baseball-crazed homeland. They mature quickly and by the age of ten they leave home for the Major Leagues. Julio is a winning pitcher who, much to the chagrin of any team that signs him, will only throw to his catcher brother, who is a very weak hitter. As they pursue their baseball dreams, events in their homeland, including political brutalities and the outlawing of baseball, continue to shape their lives. They are monitored by the Wizard, a mysterious figure who controls events behind the scenes. In his last years, the Wizard tells the story of the twins, their family and their lovers to a skeptical gringo journalist.

Charles Lindbergh was all of the above and more. Here is a rich, multi-faceted, utterly spellbinding biography about an American hero who was also a deeply flawed man. In this time where values Lindbergh held, like white Nationalism and America First, are once again on the rise, The Rise and Fall of Charles Lindbergh is essential reading for teens and history fanatics alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2ridDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eiken Volume 1","description":"Densuke just enrolled at the exclusive Zashono academy.

And he fully expects his best friend Poppy, a deer mouse, to help him celebrate in a grand manner. But Poppy has gone off somewhere with her husband, Rye, and it appears she has forgotten all about it. \\"Belching Beavers,\\" says Ereth, \\"I am not angry!\\" (Though, perhaps he is and more than just a little.) Ereth knows his special occasion deserves a special treat even if he has to get it for himself. And what treat could be more special than tasty salt? But the nearest salt is located deep in the forest, in a cabin occupied by fur hunters, who have set out traps to capture the Dimwood Forest animals. In one of the traps, Ereth finds Leaper the Fox who, with her dying breath, begs the prickly porcupine to take care of her three boisterous young kits, Tumble, Nimble, and Flip. \\"Jellied walrus warts!\\" Ereth exclaims, but reluctantly agrees. Certainly this day is not going as he planned and it's only just the beginning! Not only does Ereth suddenly have a rambunctious new family to take care of, but he's being stalked by Marty the Fisher, the one creature in Dimwood Forest who can do him harm. And Bounder, the father of the three little foxes, remembers all too well the nose full of quills he got a while back from the grumpy old animal who now fancies himself the leader of the den.

The climax of a campaign that began two months before in northern Mississippi, Perryville came to be recognized as the high water mark of the western Confederacy. Some said the hard-fought battle, forever remembered by participants for its sheer savagery and for their commanders  confusion, was the worst battle of the war, losing the last chance to bring the Commonwealth into the Confederacy and leaving Kentucky firmly under Federal control. Although Gen. Braxton Bragg s Confederates won the day, Bragg soon retreated in the face of Gen. Don Carlos Buell s overwhelming numbers. Perryville: This Grand Havoc of Battle is the definitive account of this important conflict. While providing all the parry and thrust one might expect from an excellent battle narrative, the book also reflects the new trends in Civil War history in its concern for ordinary soldiers and civilians caught in the slaughterhouse. The last chapter, unique among Civil War battle narratives, even discusses the battle s veterans, their families, efforts to preserve the battlefield, and the many ways Americans have remembered and commemorated Perryville. Kenneth W. Noe holds the Draughon Chair in Southern History at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama.

Weary of being forced to join a larger collective, the soldier yearns for an existence free of politics, the news cycle, and perpetual battle-readiness.

Is HR making the most of its new opportunities to become a pivotal part of the business? In a world where HR can suffer from a low, administrative profile, Linda Holbeche shows how some HR strategists have impressed and delivered at the highest level. Building on surveys undertaken through Personnel Today magazine, and research via Roffey Park Institute, Holbeche provides a set of tools and case studies that show how HR strategists have utilised their skills to deliver a variety of key business objectives, often within their current job role. The relationship between an effective people strategy and business success is hard to quantify in financial terms, but Holbeche provides persuasive examples to add to the growing body of evidence. Case studies include Mergers & Acquisitions policies, organizational design, retaining high flyers in an international environment, and core competency approaches.

His journey to an Amerindian society in which dreams are more prominent than everyday aspects of the sensible world leads him to radically reformulate one of the main problematics of Western thought: the relationship between our sensations of the world and the understandings we form of them. Metaphysical Community proposes that this dichotomy comes from the interplay between two sides of discourse-its intelligible side as a carrier of meanings, and its sensible side as thing-in-the-world that must be replicated. This insight leads to the heart of the book-the exploration of the uneasy tension that binds experience and understanding, phenomena and noumena. Urban challenges basic assumptions that underlie social and cultural anthropology and much of the social sciences and humanities. His provocative insights will be of interest to all those concerned with anthropology, cultural studies, literary criticism, the sociology and politics of culture, and philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LpMQAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dale Brown's Dreamland: Razor's Edge (Dreamland (Harper Audio))","description":"A volatile U.S. ally has fallen prey to the terrorist beast.

Marston Bates did not attempt to overwhelm his audience with facts or overinterpret those he did use, and, perhaps for this reason, The Nature of Natural History is a timeless work. The author's genuine interest in the tropics has a very current feeling, and the first ten or fifteen chapters of the work have a style that is parallel to that of David Attenborough's verbal presentations of nature. From the book: \\"I have already made several remarks about the connection between parasitism and degeneracy. I suspect this is a matter of point of view. We are predatory animals ourselves, and consequently admire the characteristics of predationagility, speed, cunning, self-reliance. We feel a certain kinship with the lion, and regard the liver fluke with horror. If a sheep were given the choice, though, it might prefer to be debilitated by liver flukes rather than killed by a lion.\\" Originally published in 1990.

In this instructive yet often entertaining book, he offers clear biblical direction on how to pray more effectively. With remarkable care and balance he discusses key issues, from fascination with God to honest confession of our deepest needs, from concerns over form and freedom in prayer to questions about body language and fasting. Pratt tackles head-on the issues that can puzzle us the most: Why pray when God will do whatever He pleases anyway? Does God ever change His mind? Can we get anything we want by asking for it in Jesus' name? Is it ever right to argue with God? Discussion questions, practical exercises, and assignments with each chapter help to make this book ideal for Sunday school classes and study groups, as well as individual use. - Back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZ9i72yJIoMC&dq=Pray+With+Your+Eyes+Open:+Looking+at+God,+Ourselves,+and+Our+Prayers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Six Miracles of Calvary","description":"The crucifixion.

He had a talent for drawing and an interest in birds, and he would spend the next thirty-five years traveling to the remotest regions of his new countryoften alone and on footto render his avian subjects on paper. The works of art he created gave the world its idea of America. They gave America its idea of itself. Here Richard Rhodes vividly depicts Audubon s life and career: his epic wanderings; his quest to portray birds in a lifelike way; his long, anguished separations from his adored wife; his ambivalent witness to the vanishing of the wilderness. John James Audubon: The Making of an American is a magnificent achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IWJ2uq2Lu1oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aria da capo;: A play in one act (Appleton little theatre plays)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yCcPAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The bastard (The Kent chronicles ; v. 1)","description":"The first volume in the addictive saga of the American Revolution by the #1 New York Timesbestselling author of the North and South trilogy.

One can scarcely go more than a few weeks in any large metropolitan area without reading about one of the community's upstanding citizens discovered to have been sexually involved with children or adolescents. The attention that the popular media give this topic is paralleled by the attention that it receives in the social sciences, where literally dozens of books and more than a thousand articles have been published on it in the past few years. In fact, \\"child sexual abuse,\\" along with \\"co-dependency\\" and \\"dysfunctional family,\\" have become the avant-garde psychological cliches of the decade. However, most of the lay and professional literature, although voluminous, reflect a narrow anthropo-, ethno-, and chronocentrism that precludes any real understanding of the topic with anything more than the preconceptions of our times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nnKEBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Change of Heart: A Novel","description":"The acclaimed #1 \\"New York Times\\"-bestselling author presents a spellbinding tale of a mother's tragic loss and one man's last chance at gaining salvation.

Janis Joplin blazed across the sixties music scene, electrifying audiences with her staggering voice and the way she seemed to pour her very soul into her music. By the time her life and artistry were cut tragically short by a heroin overdose, Joplin had become the stuff of rockandroll legend. Through the eyes of her family and closest friends , we see Janis as a young girl, already rebelling against injustice, racism, and hypocrisy in society. We follow Janis as she discovers her amazing talents in the Beat hangouts of Venice and North Beachsinging in coffeehouses, shooting speed to enhance her creativity, challenging the norms of straight society. Janis truly came into her own in the fantastic, psychedelic, acidsoaked world of HaightAsbury. At the height of her fame, Janis's life is a whirlwind of public adoration and hard living. Laura Joplin shows us not only the public Janice who could drink Jim Morrison under the table and bean him with a bottle of booze when he got fresh; she shows us the private Janis, struggling to perfect her art, searching for the balance between love and stardom, battling to overcome her alcohol addiction and heroin use in a world where substance abuse was nearly universal. At the heart of Love, Janis is an astonishing series of letters by Janis herself that have never been previously published. In them she conveys as no one else could the wild ride from awkward smalltown teenager to rockandroll queen. Love, Janis is the new life of Janis Joplin we have been waiting fora celebration of the sixties' joyous experimentation and creativity, and a loving, compassionate examination of one of that era's greatest talents.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4UI9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Byzantium: The Imperial Centuries AD 610-1070 (MART: The Medieval Academy Reprints for Teaching)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q2WLJa9rY5MC&dq=Byzantium:+The+Imperial+Centuries+AD+610-1070+(MART:+The+Medieval+Academy+Reprints+for+Teaching)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws (Studies in Law and Economics)","description":"On its initial publication in 1998, John R.

Relying on the most rigorously comprehensive data analysis ever conducted on crime statistics and right-to-carry laws, the book directly challenges common perceptions about the relationship of guns, crime, and violence. For this third edition, Lott draws on an additional ten years of data including provocative analysis of the effects of gun bans in Chicago and Washington, D.C that brings the book fully up to date and further bolsters its central contention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j6cMYKRgqQ8C&dq=More+Guns,+Less+Crime:+Understanding+Crime+and+Gun+Control+Laws+(Studies+in+Law+and+Economics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bay City Babylon: The Unbelievable but True Story of the Bay City Rollers","description":"Which was Inspired by the Bay City Rollers?

They ve been fired, forced to resign, or shamed out of public life. They no longer have a market for their gifts, and they may even face criminal proceedings. These leaders have lost the trust of their companies, constituents, nations, followers, and families. Many were surprised to discover that their talents alone were not enough to prevent their downfall. Why did they fail in the end? Because they lacked the one quality that would have protected their leadership and given them enduring influence. Ironically, this quality is seldom taught to leaders today, either formally or informally. It is the quality of moral force, or character. Every human being is a leader over some domain as he or she exercises gifts and influence. That domain might be the halls of government, the boardroom, the classroom, the community, or the home. In The Power of Character in Leadership: How Values, Morals, Ethics, and Principles Affect Leaders, you will discover what character is, what it means to develop moral force, and how to preserve your leadership influence so that it is both effective and enduring.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NzD2BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide to Medical School Admission: A Straightfoward Guide to Getting into Medical School","description":"Lovable Clover Twig is back, and now she's traveling along the Perilous Path to try and save her little brother!Clover Twig-clever, neat, responsible-is still in the employ of Mrs. Eckles - chaotic, cantankerous, and a witch.

The process must mend rips and tears in the social fabric of the language community that result from an enduring colonial history focused on termination. These \\"disjunctures\\" include government policies conflicting with community goals, widely varying teaching methods and generational viewpoints, and even clashing ideologies within the language community. This book provides a detailed investigation of language revitalization based on more than two years of active participation in local language renewal efforts. Each chapter focuses on a different dimension, such as spelling and expertise, conversation and social status, family practices, and bureaucratic involvement in local language choices. Each situation illustrates the balance between the desire for linguistic continuity and the reality of disruption. We Are Our Language reveals the subtle ways in which different conceptions and practices historical, material, and interactional can variably affect the state of an indigenous language, and it offers a critical step toward redefining success and achieving revitalization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p-MvlWpQ498C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wit and Evil Behind Locked Doors: A Collage of Musings and Observations on the World Within Maximum Security Mental Institutions, Prisons, and Penite","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hZAhAAAACAAJ&dq=Wit+and+Evil+Behind+Locked+Doors:+A+Collage+of+Musings+and+Observations+on+the+World+Within+Maximum+Security+Mental+Institutions,+Prisons,+and+Penite&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The philosophy of existentialism","description":"An exposition in five parts of the character of existentialist philosophy, including an analysis of the theories of Jean-Paul Sartre.

A drumbeat is sounding among the global elites. The signs of a worldwide financial meltdown are unmistakable. This time, the elites have an audacious plan to protect themselves from the fallout: hoarding cash now and locking down the global financial system when a crisis hits. Since 2014, international monetary agencies have been issuing warnings to a small group of finance ministers, banks, and private equity funds: the U.S. government s cowardly choices not to prosecute J.P. Morgan and its ilk, and to bloat the economy with a $4 trillion injection of easy credit, are driving us headlong toward a cliff. As Rickards shows in this frightening, meticulously researched book, governments around the world have no compunction about conspiring against their citizens. They will have stockpiled hard assets when stock exchanges are closed, ATMs shut down, money market funds frozen, asset managers instructed not to sell securities, negative interest rates imposed, and cash withdrawals denied. If you want to plan for the risks ahead, you will need Rickards s cutting-edge synthesis of behavioral economics, history, and complexity theory. It s a guidebook to thinking smarter, acting faster, and living with the comfort-ing knowledge that your wealth is secure. The global elites don t want this book to exist. Their plan to herd us like sheep to the slaughter when a global crisis erupts and, of course, to maintain their wealth works only if we remain complacent and unaware. Thanks to The Road to Ruin, we don t need to be. \\"If you are curious about what the financial G?tterd?mmerung might look like you ve certainly come to the right place... Rickards believes -- and provides tantalizing snippets of private conversations with those who dwell in the very eye-in-the-pyramid -- that the current world monetary and financial system is on the verge of insolvency and that the world financial elites already have a successor system for which they are laying the groundwork.\\" --Ralph Benko, Forbes","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=--VDDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Road+to+Ruin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weight Watchers Meals in Minutes Cookbook","description":"Really hungry?

(The Plain Dealer). In Modern Manners, cultural guru P. J. O Rourke provides the essential accessory for the truly contemporary man or woman a rulebook for living in a world without rules. Traditionally, good manners were a means of becoming as bland and invisible as everyone else, thus avoiding calling attention to one s own awkwardness and stupidity. Today, with everyone wanting to appear special, stupidity is at a premium, and manners as outrageous and bizarre as possible are a wonderful way to distinguish ourselves, or at least have a fine time trying. This irreverent and hilarious guide to anti-etiquette offers pointed advice on topics from sex and entertaining to reading habits and death. With the most up-to-date forms of vulgarity, churlishness, and presumption, the latest fashions in discourtesy and barbarous display, O Rourke is our guide to the art of incivility.  Modern Manners is O Rourke doing what he has always done: making hilarious, insightful, often vicious fun of the world and all its inhabitants.   People  A reader who rushes through [Modern Manners] from cover to cover like I did will feel like a child who has gorged on chocolate cake: happy, but a bit disappointed that it s all gone. The reason O Rourke s book is so successful, however, is not just his great sense of humor. O Rourke s writing has a cutting edge behind it, which makes a reader s laughter just a bit thought-provoking, and just a bit rueful . . . Very funny.

In this newest edition, author Jim DuFresne has made a good book better . . . DuFresne, author of more than twenty books, is a careful, consummate researcher and passionate fly angler. Modern trout anglers are lucky to have a wealth of Michigan rivers and streams to discover and to carry on the special sport first enjoyed by fly fishers more than 150 years ago. And they are lucky to have this book to help guide them to the best of all places to do it.\\" ---Tom Huggler, award-winning author of more than a dozen outdoors books This completely revised and updated edition of the indispensable original offers more information on why Michigan is such a great place for all fly fishers. Twelve Classic Trout Streams also features new material---for example, information on hatches, including a hatch schedule chart; a list of ten flies that every Michigan angler should have; and equipment (line weight, rod length, etc.) for Michigan streams. At the heart of the book is the increased number of public access sites complete with GPS coordinates---a first among guides to Michigan streams. There are also all new photographs and improved maps that include stream bottom identification. Twelve Classic Trout Streams answers basic questions for any trip to a trout stream to be successful. Where are the best access sites? How wide and deep is the river there? Will you stand on firm sand or gravel, slip on hard clay or muddy stones, or sink into soft sand or mud? Is the current slow enough that you can wade easily upstream or so fast that you will be swept off your feet? All of these things are described or shown on the maps. Gerth E. Hendrickson was a member of Trout Unlimited and the Federation of Fly Fishers. He wrote prolifically on trout streams. Jim DuFresne is an outdoor writer based in Clarkston, Michigan, and author of more than a dozen wilderness/travel guidebooks. DuFresne gave up the spinning rod for the fly rod in the mid-1980s and has never turned back.

The reason for the double shortening is pretty obvious: the original runs some 4000 pages! (The Summa of the Summa was just over 500.) The Summa is certainly the greatest, most ambitious, most rational book of theology ever written. In it, there is also much philosophy, which is selected, excerpted, arranged, introduced, and explained in footnotes here by Kreeft, a popular Thomist teacher and writer. St. Thomas Aquinas is universally recognized as one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived. His writings combine the two fundamental ideals of philosophical writing: clarity and profundity. He is a master of metaphysics and technical terminology, yet so full of both theoretical and practical wisdom. He is the master of common sense. The Summa Theologica is timeless, but particularly important today because of his synthesis of faith and reason, revelation and philosophy, and the Biblical and the classical Greco-Roman heritages.

Few American artists have captured painters' imaginations with the gripping force of Albert Pinkham Ryder (1847-1917). The brooding spirituality of his works, coupled with formal innovation decades ahead of its time, have long made Ryder a favorite of trailblazers like Jackson Pollock, Marsden Hartley, and Robert Rauschenberg. And yet, the artist's biography and practices remain elusive. A Wild Note of Longing--whose title comes from a Ryder poem--takes up the challenge, bringing a new generation of scholarship to the most comprehensive collection of Ryder masterworks assembled to date. Ryder is considered a seminal artist for both the late nineteenth-century Gilded Age and for the emerging modernism of the early twentieth century. This monumental new book presents multiple voices from leaders in the field on the continuing and ever evolving relevance of Albert Pinkham Ryder in modern art. In addition to a general overview of the artist's career, essays also cover Ryder within the context of his hometown of New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Ryder's influence and context within modernism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6lROEAAAQBAJ&dq=Albert+Pinkham+Ryder.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy","description":"Arthur Schopenhauer's central philosophical achievement was his account of the self and its relation to the world of objects. Embracing epistemological, metaphysical, psychological, and physiological concerns, his dynamic system of thought reveals in a unique way the serious philosophical conflicts that can arise when we think about the self. This book is the first full-length study of this theme, and Christopher Janaway's approach to it is historical, yet at the same time has a clear philosophical emphasis. He explores in unusual depth Schopenhauer's often ambivalent relation to Kant, seeing him as a pertinent critic, especially on the issues of idealism and free will. He shows that, while accepting transcendental idealism and the notion of a pure knowing 'I', Schopenhauer was always concerned to establish a rival view of the self as willing: primarily active, embodied, organic, and manifesting pre-rational ends and drives.

It has been at the centre of debates on the NATO intervention in Libya, UN deployments in Darfur, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and on the failures of the international community in Sri Lanka and Syria. Variously described as a moral responsibility, a legal obligation, a mandated peacekeeping task, and the culmination of humanitarian activity, it has become a high-profile concern of governments, international organisations, and civil society, and a central issue in international peace and security. This book offers a multidisciplinary treatment of this important topic, harnessing perspectives from international law and international relations, traversing academia and practice. Moving from the historical and philosophical development of the civilian protection concept, through relevant bodies of international law and normative underpinnings, and on to politics and practice, the volume presents coherent cross-cutting analysis of the realities of conflict and diplomacy. In doing so, it engages a series of current debates, including on the role of politics in what has often been characterized as a humanitarian endeavour, and the challenges and impacts of the use of force. The work brings together a wide array of eminent academics and respected practitioners, incorporating contributions from legal scholars and ethicists, political commentators, diplomats, UN officials, military commanders, development experts and humanitarian aid workers. As the most comprehensive publication on the subject, this will be a first port of call for anyone studing or working towards a better protection of civilians in conflict.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YQwRDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A treasury of Biblical quotations","description":"Designed as a quick and easy reference tool, this thesaurus of scripture classifies sacred texts from the King James Version of both the Old and New Testaments by topic.

In this book Nicholas Williams situates Blake's thought historically by showing how through the decades of a long and productive career Blake consistently responded to the ideas, writing, and art of contemporaries. Williams presents detailed readings of several of Blake's major poems alongside Rousseau's Emile, Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Paine's Rights of Man, Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France, and Robert Owen's Utopian Experiments. In so doing, he offers revealing new insights into key Blake texts and draws attention to their inclusion of notions of social determinism, theories of ideology-critique, and Utopian traditions. Williams argues that if we are truly to understand ideology as it relates to Blake, we must understand the practical situation in which the ideological Blake found himself. His study is a revealing commentary on the work of one of our most challenging poets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kjvv_waaX7YC&dq=Ideology+and+Utopia+in+the+Poetry+of+William+Blake+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Romanticism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theology and Church","description":"Capitol Hill Baptist Church associate pastor Michael Lawrence contributes to the IXMarks series as he centers on the practical importance of biblical theology to ministry.

Having laid the foundation for pastoral ministry, Lawrence uses the three tools to build a biblical theology, telling the entire story of the Bible from five different angles. He puts biblical theology to work in four areas: counseling, missions, caring for the poor, and church/state relations.

The new edition is the first ever thoroughly revised and expanded edition of this standard text. Among the new material, much of which is not available in any other optics text, is a section on the CAT scan (computerized axial tomography), which has revolutionized medical diagnostics. The book also includes a new chapter on scattering from inhomogeneous media which provides a comprehensive treatment of the theory of scattering of scalar as well as of electromagnetic waves, including the Born series and the Rytov series. The chapter also presents an account of the principles of diffraction tomography - a refinement of the CAT scan - to which Emil Wolf, one of the authors, has made a basic contribution by formulating in 1969 what is generally regarded to be the basic theorem in this field. The chapter also includes an account of scattering from periodic potentials and its connection to the classic subject of determining the structure of crystals from X-ray diffraction experiments, including accounts of von Laue equations, Bragg's law, the Ewald sphere of reflection and the Ewald limiting sphere, both generalized to continuous media. These topics, although originally introduced in connection with the theory of X-ray diffraction by crystals, have since become of considerable relevance to optics, for example in connection with deep holograms. Other new topics covered in this new edition include interference with broad-band light, which introduces the reader to an important phenomenon discovered relatively recently by Emil Wolf, namely the generation of shifts of spectral lines and other modifications of spectra of radiated fields due to the state of coherence of a source. There is also a section on the so-called Rayleigh-Sommerfield diffraction theory which, in recent times, has been finding increasing popularity among optical scientists. There are also several new appendices, including one on energy conservation in scalar wavefields, which is seldom discussed in books on optics. The new edition of this standard reference will continue to be invaluable to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and researchers working in most areas of optics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oV80AAAAIAAJ&dq=Principles+of+optics:+Electromagnetic+theory+of+propagation,+interference+and+diffraction+of+light&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles and Applications of Aquatic Chemistry","description":"Presents aquatic chemistry in a way that is truly useful to those with diverse backgrounds in the sciences.

Presented in English with EASY-TO-READ print for easy reading and study, GREEK GRAMMAR provides an enjoyable step-by-step method of understanding of what has been perceived by many to be a difficult language. One will find, however, that Greek is not as difficult as it may seem. In fact, after just a few lessons, some who have embarked on this project have been able to achieve an effective working knowledge of the Greek language. For those who have had an understanding of Greek when they began, these individuals have enhanced their skills in the language and are ready for advanced studies.This primer contains many tools for a quick grasp of Bible Greek, using three techniques: Illustrations, association, and simple-to-follow exercises. It aids the student to build his or her self-confidence by the book's progressive and absorbing approach to this engrossing study.Whether one is religious or not, GREEK GRAMMAR helps the student to expand that one's understanding of the language which Alexander the Great made to be the international language of his day. Therefore, history, culture and knowledge of people living in the Greco-Roman world are all entailed in a study of what scholars call the language of Koine (pronounced \\"KEE-NEE\\") or Common Greek.For students of the \\"New Testament,\\" this publication is a fine aid which can be used in company with Greek lexicons and concordances when studying Greek words and phrases in the Greek Christian Scriptures. Excellent for use in translating Greek words into English (or one's own native language) and in making comparisons between different scripture texts, GREEK GRAMMAR provides the needed guidance to connect the correct words to each text.This self-help primer is an introduction to the Greek text of the Bible and does not confine itself to the renderings of any particular translation. It, therefore, refrains from engaging in controversial subjects for the benefit of assisting the reader and student to comprehend the basic principles of Bible Greek. It, of course, insists on accuracy within the scope of a word rendered in a particular context. Within the later chapters of this publication is a consideration of \\"pearls\\" of knowledge contained within the \\"New Testament\\" which would otherwise be overlooked if one did not have a basic knowledge of Bible Greek. The author shows the student how to discover these \\"pearls\\" of truth. The inquisitive student will find these studies fascinating!Finally, GREEK GRAMMAR shows the inquiring student the direct connection which Koine or Bible Greek has with modern Greek. There are outstanding similarities between the two languages, so much so that one who is educated in modern Greek can gain a quick grasp of the Greek of Alexamder's day and the Greek spoken when Christ walked the earth by his study of the subject using a grammar of this nature. One well-known scholar who has studied the history of the Greek language has stated that a colleague of his made the remark that Koine (Common) Greek of the \\"New Testament\\" was similar to reading a modern Athens newspaper. This scholar agreed and noted that Greek has made little change since the writing of the \\"New Testament\\" and can see its close parallel to the Demotic (Modern) Greek spoken today.The publisher and author of this publication wishes that all who embark on the noble task of learning Bible Greek, will find their pursuit fulfilling and meaningful, and will add another vista to their knowledge. GREEK GRAMMAR will help them achieve such a worthwhile goal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M6Q8twEACAAJ&dq=Greek+Grammar:+You+Can+Learn+Bible+Greek--A+Clear+Introductory+Course&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Violent cases","description":"Before The Sandman, there was Violent Cases, the first teaming of multi award-winning writer Neil Gaiman and innovative artist Dave McKean.

Entertainment Weekly Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. At any moment, tidal floods may rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people collide. Piya Roy is a marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. Her journey begins with a disaster when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, they are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. As the three launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll as powerful as the ravaging tide. From the national bestselling author of Gun Island, The Hungry Tide was a winner of the Crossword Book Prize and a finalist for the Kiriyama Prize.

The proposal is aimed at supporting a larger range of incre mental behavior variations and thus promises to be more effective in mastering the complexity of today's software. The ability of dealing with the evolutionary nature of software is one of main merits of object-oriented data abstraction and inheritance. Object-orientation allows to organize software in a structured way by separating the description of different kinds of an abstract data type into different classes and loosely connecting them by the inheritance hierarchy. Due to this separation, the soft ware becomes free of conditional logics previously needed for distinguishing between different kinds of abstractions and can thus more easily be incremen tally extended to support new kinds of abstractions. In other words, classes and inheritance are means to properly model variations of behavior related to the existence of different kinds of an abstract data type. The support for extensi bility and reuse with respect to such kind-specific behavior variations is among the main reasons for the increasing popularity of object-oriented programming in the last two decades. However, this popularity does not prevent us from questioning the real effec tiveness of current object-oriented techniques in supporting incremental vari ations. In fact, this popularity makes a critical investigation of the variations that can actually be performed incrementally even more important.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IufiBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Irresistible Mr. Sinclair","description":"SINCLAIR'S SLEEPING BEAUTY Janice Jennings refused to be any man's \\"trophy\\" ever again.

Combining cultural history, economics, and literary criticism, Regenia Gagnier's new work traces the parallel development of economic and aesthetic theory, offering a shrewd reading of humans as workers and wanters, born of labor and desire. The Insatiability of Human Wants begins during a key transitional moment in aesthetic and economic theory, 1871, when both disciplines underwent a turn from production to consumption models. In economics, an emphasis on the theory of value and the social relations between land, labor, and capital gave way to more individualistic models of consumerism. Similarly, in aesthetics, theories of artistic production or creativity soon bowed to models of taste, pleasure, and reception. Using these developments as a point of departure, Gagnier deftly traces the shift in Western thought from models of production to consumption. From its exploration of early market logic and Kantian thought to its look at the aestheticization of homelessness and our own market boom, The Insatiability of Human Wants invites us to contemplate alternative interpretations of economics, aesthetics, and history itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2TTZKWQ0tI4C&dq=The+Insatiability+of+Human+Wants:+Economics+and+Aesthetics+in+Market+Society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"S 13: Pet Store (Spinetinglers)","description":"When the cheerleaders at Lincoln Elementary School develop the ability to hypnotize people and make them do their bidding, the school's biggest rival is quickly mesmerized.

In 1950 at age eight, prompted by an issue of Life magazine marking the century's midpoint, Stephen Jay Gould started thinking about the approaching turn of the millennium. In this beautiful inquiry into time and its milestones, he shares his interest and insights with his readers. Refreshingly reasoned and absorbing, the book asks and answers the three major questions that define the approaching calendrical event. First, what exactly is this concept of a millennium and how has its meaning shifted? How did the name for a future thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ on earth get transferred to the passage of a secular period of a thousand years in current human history? When does the new millennium really begin: January 1, 2000, or January 1, 2001? (Although seemingly trivial, the debate over this issue tells an intriguing story about the cultural history of the twentieth century.) And why must our calendars be so complex, leading to our search for arbitrary regularity, including a fascination with millennia? This revised edition begins with a new and extensive preface on a key subject not treated in the original version. As always, Gould brings into his essays a wide range of compelling historical and scientific fact, including a brief history of millennial fevers, calendrical traditions, and idiosyncrasies from around the world; the story of a sixth-century monk whose errors in chronology plague us even today; and the heroism of a young autistic man who has developed the extraordinary ability to calculate dates deep into the past and the future. Ranging over a wide terrain of phenomena--from the arbitrary regularities of human calendars to the unpredictability of nature, from the vagaries of pop culture to the birth of Christ--Stephen Jay Gould holds up the mirror to our millennial passions to reveal our foibles, absurdities, and uniqueness--in other words, our humanity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D9Zidg9b5j0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A bridge for passing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bPgEAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+bridge+for+passing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reporting Made Easy Guidebook series, Release 4.0B","description":"Before use, standard ERP systems such as SAP R/3 need to be customized to meet the concrete requirements of the individual enterprise.

Turner is one of the most important figures in Western art, and his visionary work paved the way for a revolution in landscape painting. Over the course of his lifetime, Turner strove to liberate painting from an antiquated system of patronage. Bringing a new level of expression and color to his canvases, he paved the way for the modern artist. Turner was very much a man of his changing era. In his lifetime, he saw Britain ravaged by Napoleonic wars, revived by the Industrial Revolution, and embarked upon a new moment of Imperial glory with the ascendancy of Queen Victoria. His own life embodied astonishing transformation. Born the son of a barber in Covent Garden, he was buried amid pomp and ceremony in St. Paul's Cathedral. Turner was accepted into the prestigious Royal Academy at the height of the French Revolution when a climate of fear dominated Britain. Unable to travel abroad he explored at home, reimagining the landscape to create some of the most iconic scenes of his country. But his work always had a profound human element. When a moment of peace allowed travel into Europe, Turner was one of the first artists to capture the beauty of the Alps, to revive Venice as a subject, and to follow in Byron s footsteps through the Rhine country. While he was commercially successful for most of his career, Turner's personal life remained fraught. His mother suffered from mental illness and was committed to Bedlam. Turner never married but had several long-term mistresses and illegitimate daughters. His erotic drawings were numerous but were covered up by prurient Victorians after his death. Turner's late, impressionistic work was held up by his Victorian detractors as example of a creeping madness. Affection for the artist s work soured. John Ruskin, the greatest of all 19th century art critics, did what he could to rescue Turner s reputation, but Turner s very last works confounded even his greatest defender. TURNER humanizes this surprising genius while placing him in his fascinating historical context. Franny Moyle brilliantly tells the story of the man to give us an astonishing portrait of the artist and a vivid evocation of Britain and Europe in flux.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X6WoCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dreamthief's Daughter: A Tale of the Albino","description":"The first new \\"Eternal Champion\\" novel in ten years and a major fantasy publishing event, \\"The Dreamthief's Daughter\\" continues the highly successful Elrick Saga.

The books includes 43 commonly diagnosed disorders that affect children and adolescents, including attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia. Easy-to follow charts highlight the disorders separately and include detailed diagnostic criteria and a list of social skills that can be targeted during treatment. An indepth outline of the treatment planning process is included to illustrate the importance of focusing attention on children's actual problems. Treating Youth with DSM-IV Disorders is an illuminating, unparalled resource for parents, caregivers, and mental health professionals. An excellent companion book to Teaching Social Skills to Youth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zsoelQKgKfoC&dq=Treating+Youth+with+Dsm-IV+Disorders:+The+Role+of+Social+Skill+Instruction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Prayer Heals: A Scientific Approach (Healing (Hampton Roads))","description":"\\"Methodist minister, Walter Weston presents a model of human energy fields, and how they affect our well-being.

Introducing Joseph O'Connell's principal works to a broader public, Divine Favor contains photographs of his work as well as background information and reflections. Readers will find a sketch of O'Connell's life and work in the \\"Chronology of Principal Events in the Life and Work of Joseph O'Connell,\\" an affectionate introduction to the life of Joe as artist and friend in J. F. Powers \\"Dear Joe\\" and a tribute to the man and artist in Garrison Keillor's \\"He Was in the Arts, You Know\\". Other writers present reflections throughout the book on their favorite works, representing the hundreds of viewers who admire a favorite print or sculpture. Influenced as a young artist by Eric Gill's liturgical art, O'Connell produced many works inspired by religious themes. He had an unsettling ability to put familiar scriptural images, like Christ the King or Judas Iscariot, into a contemporary scene where we prefer not to see them. Working as a printmaker and sculptor of wood, metal, and stone, O'Connell developed his own visual voice, a unique style--at once representational and stylized, simple and elegant--which distinguishes his work from the work of other twentieth-century artists. He honed his skills as a sculptor, using no power tools, but only chisels and hammers like those of the master-crafters who carved stone images on the great medieval cathedrals. Articles and reflections in Divine Favor are \\"Dear Joe,\\" by J. F. Powers; \\"He Was in the Arts, You Know,\\" by Garrison Keillor; \\"Unbecoming: A Look at 'Eve in the Baraque,'\\" by Mara Faulkner, OSB; \\"A Bead on Human Folly,\\" by Hilary Thimmesh, OSB; \\"Jazz and the Coming of the Kingdom,\\" by Mary Schaffer; \\"The Gift of Joe,\\" by Rosemary Boyle Petters; \\"A Degree in Theology and Fine Art,\\" by Philip Morsberger; \\"A Work in Progress,\\" by Larry Schug; \\"The Moses Man,\\" by Mary Willette Hughes; \\"Transformation of the Commonplace,\\" by Alan Reed, OSB; \\"Joe's Questions,\\" by Nancy Hynes, OSB; \\"The Tree of Life,\\" by Mark Conway; \\"Tapping,\\" by Dennis Frandrup, OSB; \\" A Meditation on Peter's Denial,\\" by Mary Hynes-Berry; and \\"Chronology of Principal Events in the Life and Work of Joseph O'Connell.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zOuTGGcfwecC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"D-Day 1944 (4) Gold & Juno Beaches","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heat Kernel and Quantum Gravity (Lecture Notes in Physics Monographs)","description":"This book tackles quantum gravity via the so-called background field method and its effective action functional.

This volume contains the first overview and analysis of the different approaches, methodologies and sources that will stimulate and facilitate future comparative research. This volume first addresses the benefits of a media-driven approach, focussing on processes of content recycling, interactions between text and image, processes of production and consumption. A second perspective illuminates the distribution and markets for popular print, discussing audiences, prices and collections. A third dimension refers to the transnational dimensions of genres, stories, and narratives. A last perspective unravels the communicative strategies and dynamics behind European bestsellers.

It follows continuities from the Odyssey to the twentieth century and traces the interplay of fact and fiction in a literature with a notorious tendency to deviate from the truth. The late medieval travels of the imaginary Mandeville and the real Marco Polo are explored, and the writings of Columbus as he struggled to reconcile what 'Mandeville' and Polo had written with what he found in the West Indies. The philosophical consequences of the discovery of the New World are followed in the works of Montaigne and Bacon, and the factual travels of Dampier are placed in relation to the fictional travels of Crusoe and Gulliver. The various accounts of the scientific voyages of Cook and Bougainville are examined and their revelation of a Tahiti more mythic than scientific, erotic as well as exotic. All the factual accounts of the mutiny on the Bounty are assessed, and also the fictions that came in its wake. The supposedly factual narrative that is Herman Melville's first novel is read in relation to other travellers' accounts of the South Seas, as are the factual and fictional writings of Loti, Stevenson, Malinowski, Mead, and the Hawaiian Visitors Bureau. Far-Fetched Facts is the first full account of the Western idea of the South Seas as it evolved from the lost paradises of biblical and classical literature to end in the false paradise found by the tourist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T8FkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Far-Fetched+Facts%3B+the+Literature+of+Travel+and+the+Idea+of+the+South+Seas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Fuzzy","description":"How has computer science changed mathematical thinking? In this first ever comprehensive survey of the subject for popular science readers, Arturo Sangalli explains how computers have brought a new practicality to mathematics and mathematical applications. By using fuzzy logic and related concepts, programmers have been able to sidestep the traditional and often cumbersome search for perfect mathematical solutions to embrace instead solutions that are \\"good enough.\\" If mathematicians want their work to be relevant to the problems of the modern world, Sangalli shows, they must increasingly recognize \\"the importance of being fuzzy.\\" As Sangalli explains, fuzzy logic is a technique that allows computers to work with imprecise terms--to answer questions with \\"maybe\\" rather than just \\"yes\\" and \\"no.\\" The practical implications of this flexible type of mathematical thinking are remarkable. Japanese programmers have used fuzzy logic to develop the city of Sendai's unusually energy-efficient and smooth-running subway system--one that does not even require drivers. Similar techniques have been used in fields as diverse as medical diagnosis, image understanding by robots, the engineering of automatic transmissions, and the forecasting of currency exchange rates. Sangalli also explores in his characteristically clear and engaging manner the limits of classical computing, reviewing many of the central ideas of Turing and Godel. He shows us how \\"genetic algorithms\\" can solve problems by an evolutionary process in which chance plays a fundamental role.

One damp November evening on the Marylebone Road, a couple sits in silence. Though their thoughts are the same money and the lack thereof the time has long since passed when Mr. and Mrs. Bunting could find comfort in sharing their anxieties with each other. Now every word is a reproach a reminder of luxuries forsaken and keepsakes pawned. Retired servants, the Buntings sunk every last shilling into their London lodging house. Now they are trapped.

Each play shows women in various roles--slave, unmarried girl, devoted wife, alienated wife, mother, daughter--providing a range of evidence about the kinds of meaning and effects the category woman conveyed in ancient Athens. The female protagonists in these plays test the boundaries--literal and conceptual--of their lives. Although women are often represented in tragedy as powerful and free in their thoughts, speech and actions, real Athenian women were apparently expected to live unseen and silent, under control of fathers and husbands, with little political or economic power. Women in tragedy often disrupt \\"normal\\" life by their words and actions: they speak out boldly, tell lies, cause public unrest, violate custom, defy orders, even kill. Female characters in tragedy take actions, and raise issues central to the plays in which they appear, sometimes in strong opposition to male characters. The four plays in this collection offer examples of women who support the status quo and women who oppose and disrupt it; sometimes these are the same characters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IiLXvvCFDgQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NANCY WAKE. A Biography of our Greatest War Heroine.","description":"The number one bestselling biography of our greatest war heroine - over 84,000 copies sold in its first two formats. In the early 1930s, Nancy Wake was a young woman enjoying a bohemian life in Paris. By the end of the Second World War, she was the Gestapo's most wanted person. As a naive, young journalist, Nancy Wake witnessed a horrific scene of Nazi violence in a Viennese street. From that moment, she declared that she would do everything in her power to rid Europe of the Nazis. What began as a courier job here and there became a highly successful escape network for Allied soldiers, perfectly camouflaged by Nancy's high-society life in Marseille. Her network was soon so successful - and so notorious - that she was forced to flee France to escape the Gestapo, who had dubbed her the white mouse for her knack of slipping through its traps. But Nancy was a passionate enemy of the Nazis and refused to stay away. Supplying weapons and training members of a powerful underground fighting force, organising Allied parachute drops, cycling four hundred kilometres across a mountain range to find a new transmitting radio - nothing seemed too difficult in her fight against the Nazis.Peter FitzSimons reveals Nancy Wake's compelling story, a tale of an ordinary woman doing extraordinary things.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X_fMygAACAAJ&dq=NANCY+WAKE.+A+Biography+of+our+Greatest+War+Heroine.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ritual","description":"Unexpectedly clashing with his three old University friends while hiking in the Scandinavian wilderness of the Arctic Circle, Luke takes a shortcut that leads the group to an ancient pagan sacrificial site where they are hunted by a bestial predator.

In the process, she discovers a 23-century-old message from Alexander the Great concerning a reserve hidden for his Afghan Queen, Roxanne, in case something happened to the young conqueror. The \\"riddle\\" relates to where the reserve was left, and the question of whether it's still there is a monumental one. Alexander inherited from ancient Persia some 3,000 tons of bullion and jewels worth more than 20 billion of today's dollars.

This is a significant advancement in biomonitoring because it solves the problem of trying to locate nearby control or reference sites when studying an ecosystem that may be degraded, a problem that bedevils traditional approaches. Rather than using upstream reference sites in a river system or next-bay-over reference sites in a lake, an array of ecologically similar, least-exposed to stress sites scattered throughout a catchment or region is used. Once the reference condition has been established, any site suspected of being impacted can be assessed by comparison to the reference sites, and its status determined. The Reference Condition database, once formed, can be used repeatedly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lTTTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gluten, Wheat, and Dairy Free Cookbook","description":"300 gluten- and dairy-free recipes from popular food blogger Audrey Roberts to reset your eating habits to live a healthier life.

Over the years, it has been studied and cherished by Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike. Luminous Emptiness is a detailed guide to this classic work, elucidating its mysterious concepts, terms, and imagery. Fremantle relates the symbolic world of the Tibetan Book of the Dead to the experiences of everyday life, presenting the text not as a scripture for the dying, but as a guide for the living. According to the Buddhist view, nothing is permanent or fixed. The entire world of our experience is constantly appearing and disappearing at every moment. Using vivid and dramatic imagery, the Tibetan Book of the Dead presents the notion that most of us are living in a dream that will continue from lifetime to lifetime until we truly awaken by becoming enlightened. Here, Fremantle, who worked closely with Ch?gyam Trungpa on the 1975 translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead (Shambhala), brings the expertise of a lifetime of study to rendering this intriguing classic more accessible and meaningful to the living. Luminous Emptiness features in-depth explanations of: ? The Tibetan Buddhist notions of death and rebirth ? The meaning of the five energies and the five elements in Tibetan Buddhism ? The mental and physical experience of dying, according to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fqVQAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mis Amigos, los Dinosaurios (My Friends, the Dinosaurs)","description":"Carvings and fossils of dinosaurs with humans have been seen in various caves around the world.

Woman Needs to Know","description":"Susan Brownmiller s groundbreaking bestseller uncovers the culture of violence against women with a devastating exploration of the history of rape now with a new preface by the author exposing the undercurrents of rape still present today Rape, as author Susan Brownmiller proves in her startling and important book, is not about sex but about power, fear, and subjugation. For thousands of years, it has been viewed as an acceptable  spoil of war,  used as a weapon by invading armies to crush the will of the conquered. The act of rape against women has long been cloaked in lies and false justifications. It is ignored, tolerated, even encouraged by governments and military leaders, misunderstood by police and security organizations, freely employed by domineering husbands and lovers, downplayed by medical and legal professionals more inclined to  blame the victim,  and, perhaps most shockingly, accepted in supposedly civilized societies worldwide, including the United States. Against Our Will is a classic work that has been widely credited with changing prevailing attitudes about violence against women by awakening the public to the true and continuing tragedy of rape around the globe and throughout the ages. Selected by the New York Times Book Review as an Outstanding Book of the Year and included among the New York Public Library s Books of the Century, Against Our Will remains an essential work of sociological and historical importance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jaWqAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Les Miserables (Piano Solos)","description":"(Piano Solo Selections).

Originally written in 1950 as the sport was languishing for lack of innovation, this book helped bring about a fly-fishing renaissance on riverbanks across America. An ideal book for readers who share Marinaro's deep reverence for the fisherman's connection to the unspoiled natural world, A Modern Dry-Fly Code will have you yearning for the sound of running brook water, eager to try some of the author's legendary fly patterns, casting techniques, and scouting tips.The product of a lifetime of experience wading in the waters of the Letort, Big Spring, and other south Pennsylvania streams, A Modern Dry-Fly Code significantly changed the way American anglers think about dry-fly fishing. In addition to detailed information on matching hatches, trout behavior and biology, and where and when to cast which types of flies, Marinaro introduces several ideas of his own invention based on the results of his many experimental outings. Among the revolutionary ideas set forth in this book are Marinaro's 'minutiae', miniscule flies designed to imitate the dozens of tiny insects that swarm over the surface of the water as well as his thorax-style technique for crafting superb dry-flies.For beginners and expert fishermen alike, there is much wisdom to be gleaned from Marinaro's inventive and curious inquiry into the nature and practice of fly-fishing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l7KGjgEACAAJ&dq=A+Modern+Dry-Fly+Code&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Living and Holy Dying: Volume II: Holy Dying (Holy Living & Holy Dying)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tfWtwgEACAAJ&dq=Holy+Living+and+Holy+Dying:+Volume+II:+Holy+Dying+(Holy+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GMO Free: Exposing the Hazards of Biotechnology to Ensure the Integrity of Our Food Supply","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v4ZyswEACAAJ&dq=GMO+Free:+Exposing+the+Hazards+of+Biotechnology+to+Ensure+the+Integrity+of+Our+Food+Supply&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Two Cultures and a Second Look, an Expanded Version of the Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6I8OvwEACAAJ&dq=The+Two+Cultures+and+a+Second+Look,+an+Expanded+Version+of+the+Two+Cultures+and+the+Scientific+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strip Show: Performances of Gender and Desire (Gender in Performance)","description":"This book offers an account of an unprecedented North American study of contemporary female and male strip shows. It particularly focuses on the contradictory sex roles, cultural positions, and performance practices of 'straight' strip shows during their second heyday in the early 1990s. Katherine Liepe-Levinson's research took her to over seventy different strip bars, clubs, theatres and sex emporiums ranging from elaborate lap-dancing and couch-dancing 'gentlemen's' clubs in New York, Houston, and San Francisco; to Peoria's onetime duplex cabaret where women strip for men downstairs, and men for women upstairs; to the nightclubs of Montreal where female and male performers displayed the 'Full Monty'. Liepe-Levinson's intriguing, comprehensive study concentrates on the cultural and theatrical elements of the strip shows themselves including the geographic locations and interior designs of the clubs, the choreography and costumes of the dancers and the all-important participation of the audience. She draws upon a variety of methodologies as well as interviews with performers to explore how the strip show's cultural and theatrical aspects simultaneously uphold and break traditional sex roles. Her findings readily complicate several of the most prominent and prevalent theories about sexual representation, gender and desire.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I-iFAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How the Cows Turned Mad","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"\\"Doers of the Word\\": African-American Women Speakers and Writers in the North (1830-1880)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"9 1/2 Weeks (Signet)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OwE8AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook for Pulp and Paper Technologists","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dv5UAAAAMAAJ&dq=Handbook+for+Pulp+and+Paper+Technologists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative: A Study in Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Hermeneutics","description":"Laced with brilliant insights, broad in its view of the interaction of culture and theology, this book gives new resonance to old and important questions about the meaning of the Bible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l2Qt0nGoCScC&dq=The+Eclipse+of+Biblical+Narrative:+A+Study+in+Eighteenth+and+Nineteenth+Century+Hermeneutics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peace Is Every Step","description":"Teaches the Zen practice of mindfulness, the act of keeping one's consciousness alive to one's experiences, and offers methods for continuing the quest for spiritual fulfillment amid daily modern life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3-8KAAAAYAAJ&dq=Peace+Is+Every+Step&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marriage Profile, The","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The White and the Gold - the French Regime in Canada","description":"This is the fascinating story of the French regime in Canada.

But whenever I found myself guilty of overstressing the romantic side of the picture and forgetful of the more prosaic life beneath, I tried to balance the scales more properly. [This] is . . . a conscientious effort at a balanced picture of a period which was brave, bizarre, fanatical, lyrical, lusty, and, in fact, rather completely unbalanced.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a_A1rkhmGO4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Side of Brightness SIGNED","description":"From the author of Songdogs, a magnificent work of imagination and history set in the tunnels of New York City. In the early years of the century, Nathan Walker leaves his native Georgia for New York City and the most dangerous job in America. A sandhog, he burrows beneath the East River, digging the tunnel that will carry trains from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Above ground, the sandhogs--black, white, Irish, Italian--keep their distance from each other until a spectacular accident welds a bond between Walker and his fellow diggers--a bond that will bless and curse the next three generations. Years later, Treefrog, a homeless man driven below by a shameful secret, endures a punishing winter in his subway nest. In tones ranging from bleak to disturbingly funny, Treefrog recounts his strategies of survival--killing rats, scavenging for discarded soda cans, washing in the snow. Between Nathan Walker and Treefrog stretch seventy years of ill-fated loves and unintended crimes. In a triumph of plotting, the two stories fuse to form a tale of family, race, and redemption that is as bold and fabulous as New York City itself. In This Side of Brightness, Colum McCann confirms his place in the front ranks of modern writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tnSkdTTd45oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passion Profit & Power (6 Audio Tapes with Workbook)","description":"It's time to get paid what you're truly worth Although you may not realise it, the knowledge and knowhow you have acquired in your life to date is a truly marketable asset.

Toklas (Zephyr books; a library of British and American authors)","description":"In this original and intriguing study, Anna Linzie examines three mid-twentieth-century texts never before treated as interrelated in a book-length work of literary criticism: Gertrude Stein's The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933) and Alice B. Toklas's The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book (1954) and What Is Remembered (1963). Taking these three texts as intertexts or as an assemblage of the true story of Alice B. Toklas, Linzie challenges assumptions about primary authorship and singular identity that have continued to limit lesbian and feminist rereadings of autobiography as a genre and of Stein and Toklas as writers and historical figures.The True Story of Alice B. Toklas explores how the concept of autobiography as a primarily referential genre is challenged and transformed in relation to autobiographical texts written about the same person, the same life, but differently, by different writers, at different points in time. The concept of one true story is deconstructed in the process as Linzie modifies Homi K. Bhabha's  almost the same but not quite/not white  for the purposes of this particular study as  almost the same but not quite/not straight.  The investigation moves simultaneously on the planes of textuality and sexuality in order to provisionally articulate a  lesbian autobiographical subject  in Linzie's reading of these three texts.Linzie's study fills a gap in literary criticism where Stein's companion and her work have been more or less neglected, conceptualizing the Stein-Toklas sexual/textual relationship as fundamentally reciprocal. The True Story of Alice B. Toklas provides a new critical perspective on Toklas as indispensable to Stein's literary production, a cultural laborer in her own right, and a writer of her own books. Making a significant contribution to recent lesbian/feminist reconceptualizations of the genre of autobiography, this study will fascinate Stein and Toklas scholars as well as those interested in queer and autobiography studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XGqCcEtct2oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Youth Ministry in the 21st Century: The Encyclopedia of Practical Ideas","description":"Focuses on eight of the conclusions from the National Study of Youth & Religion conducted in the U.S. in 2003.

Or sat on a boat opening and eating oysters as you lift them from the sea? Or partaken of a seven course feast of game to celebrate the success of the chasse? When Patricia Atkinson - bestselling author of The Ripening Sun - first moved to France, her intention was simply to establish a vineyard. Over the years, however, she found herself becoming integrated into a way of life that, had she stayed in England, she would hardly have believed existed. Grounded in the rhythms of the land and the seasons, daily life in Patricia's south-western corner of France is dictated by a series of rituals and celebrations that we have long lost in our supermarket age. La Belle Saison is Patricia's eulogy to this way of life: a testament to the timelessness of the beautiful French countryside, the bounty of the land, and the generous-hearted French neighbours who showed Patricia that a simple life has many rewards. In France, every season is 'la belle saison', offering up its gifts to those willing to appreciate and look after the land.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hp8fIpF-wzYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"House of M: Uncanny X-Men","description":"Contains material originally published in magazine form as Uncanny X-Men #462-465 and Secrets of the House of M.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dJPKNwAACAAJ&dq=House+of+M:+Uncanny+X-Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Touched By The Light","description":"Using fascinating case stories, Dr. Yvonne Kason shares the results of her research and experience counselling hundreds of STE experiencers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fxd_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PRAXIS/CST Reading Specialist (National Teacher Examination series)","description":"***Includes Practice Test Questions*** Praxis II Health Education (5551) Exam Secrets helps you ace the Praxis II: Subject Assessments, without weeks and months of endless studying.

This multi-layered analysis should be must reading for a wide audience.\\"--Richard H. Immerman, Temple University \\"Alteras writes fairly and intelligently. . . . His book is a welcome addition to the literature on American foreign policy in the Eisenhower years.\\"--Robert A. Divine, University of Texas at Austin This first detailed analysis of early U.S.-Israeli relations draws on recently declassified documents from both countries, most notably Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion's diaries and correspondence and the Israeli State Archives. Alteras explores the relations between the United States and Israel during the Eisenhower administration in the context of U.S. interests in the Arab Middle East and devotes considerable attention to the impact of American Jewry on Eisenhower's and Dulles's policies toward Israel. Among the controversies this book will be important in resolving: who promised what to whom in the interchanges that preceded the 1956 invasion of Suez, and exactly what the relationship was among Israel, France, and Britain. With persuasive support from primary sources, Alteras argues that although Ben-Gurion understood that Israel stood to lose the most in the event of failure, the British and French were at least as much to blame for the debacle that followed as were the Israelis. Further, Alteras shows that Eisenhower and Dulles agreed fully on U.S. policy toward Israel and that the secretary of state consulted the president at every stage of policy implementation. He indicates that although Eisenhower at times questioned the wisdom of Truman's decision to recognize the Jewish state, Eisenhower never tampered with that decision or with the U.S. commitment to Israel's survival. Alteras also details the manner in which organized American Jewry successfully lobbied Congress to thwart the administration's attempts to impose economic sanctions on Israel in the aftermath of the Sinai campaign. In this examination of U.S.-Israeli relations during a crucial stage of their evolution, Alteras breathes life into the political figures whose motivations and decisions helped shape the two countries' attitudes toward each other today. Isaac Alteras, associate professor of history at Queens College, City University of New York, has published and lectured widely on Jewish history and the Arab-Israeli conflict. From 1986 to 1991 he directed the Center for Jewish Studies at Queens College.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oYb9jwEACAAJ&dq=Eisenhower+and+Israel:+U.S.-Israeli+Relations,+1953-1960&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghost in the Mirror","description":"The old house that Jenny Morgan and her family move into holds a mysterious secret that only Jenny can solve.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cXv-EKDN86cC&dq=The+Ghost+in+the+Mirror&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moo Baa Baa Quack: Seven Farmyard Stories","description":"Seven stories introduce youngsters to the animals of a farm--a billy goat, lambs, chicks, and more--and their hilarious antics make great read-aloud fun perfect for enjoying at bedtime.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rds4AAAACAAJ&dq=Moo+Baa+Baa+Quack:+Seven+Farmyard+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic Mushrooms in Religion and Alchemy","description":"An illustrated foray into the hidden truth about the use of psychoactive mushrooms to connect with the divine. ? Draws parallels between Vedic beliefs and Judeo-Christian sects, showing the existence of a mushroom cult that crossed cultural boundaries. ? Contends that the famed philosophers' stone of the alchemist was a metaphor for the mushroom. ? Confirms and extends Robert Gordon Wasson's hypothesis of the role of the fly agaric mushroom in generating religious visions. Rejecting arguments that the elusive philosophers' stone of alchemy and the Hindu elixir of life were mere legend, Clark Heinrich provides a strong case that Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric mushroom, played this role in world religious history. Working under the assumption that this \\"magic mushroom\\" was the mysterious food and drink of the gods, Heinrich traces its use in Vedic and Puranic religion, illustrating how ancient cultures used the powerful psychedelic in esoteric rituals meant to bring them into direct contact with the divine. He then shows how the same mushroom symbols found in Hindu scriptures correspond perfectly to the symbols of ancient Judaism, Christianity, the Grail myths, and alchemy, arguing that miraculous stories as disparate as the burning bush of Moses and the raising of Lazarus from the dead can be easily explained by the use of this strange and powerful mushroom. While acknowledging the speculative nature of his work, Heinrich concludes that in many religious cultures and traditions the fly agaric mushroom--and in some cases ergot or psilocybin mushrooms--had a fundamental influence in teaching humans about the nature of God. His insightful book truly brings new light to the religious history of humanity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xaaLdPP1lMkC&dq=Magic+Mushrooms+in+Religion+and+Alchemy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art Of The Maasai: 300 Newly Discovered Objects and Works of Art (includes 195 photographs, 80 in full color)","description":"The handwritten diary of a twelve-year-old boy offers readers a perspective on the Yanomami tribe that takes him in when his plane crashes, a story that follows such adventures as Alex's participation in the rescue of a kidnapped girl.

L. Doctorow, Ishmael Reed, Bobbie Ann Mason, and Nicholson Baker. By considering mass culture from a postmodern theoretical perspective, Philip E. Simmons places his readings of fiction within a larger argument about how mass culture is shaping postmodern conditions of knowledge. In particular, Simmons shows how mass culture is related to the ways we construct and perceive history, and how certain developments in fiction mark the novel's participation in a larger mass culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pKhkQgAACAAJ&dq=Deep+Surfaces:+Mass+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Evolution: Human Nature and the Limits of Evolutionary Explanation","description":"Anthony O'Hear takes a stand against the fashion for explaining human behaviour in terms of evolution. He maintains, controversially, that while the theory of evolution is successful in explaining the development of the natural world in general, it is of limited value when applied to the human world. Because of our reflectiveness and our rationality we take on goals and ideals which cannot be justified in terms of survival-promotion or reproductive advantage. O'Hear examines the nature of human self-consciousness, and argues that evolutionary theory cannot give a satisfactory account of such distinctive facets of human life as the quest for knowledge, moral sense, and the appreciation of beauty; in these we transcend our biological origins. It is our rationality that allows each of us to go beyond not only our biological but also our cultural inheritance: as the author says in the Preface, 'we are prisoners neither of our genes nor of the ideas we encounter as we each make our personal and individual way through life'.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xQdREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicken and Dumplings: A Poor Man's Diary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Basix, Sax Method (Basix Series)","description":"Learn to play the alto or tenor sax with this easy-to-understand method.

Today, the shock waves from Azusa Street have influenced countless Evangelicals worldwide. But if dialogue between Pentecostals and Evangelicals has awakened within the latter a thirst for the power of God s Spirit, it has challenged Pentecostals to examine their theology more deeply in the light of his Word. Just how firm is the biblical foundation on which they stand?Spirit and Power provides a cutting-edge look at Pentecostal theology. It addresses the concern expressed by its authors and echoed throughout charismatic churches today:  Although our Pentecostal forefathers intuitively grasped the correlation between the reality they experienced and the promise of Acts 1:8, they did not always articulate their theology in a manner that was convincing to other believers committed to the authority of Scripture.  In response, theologians William and Robert Menzies explore Pentecostalism in a scholarly and current light. Spirit and Power is no mere paraphrase of dated approaches. It is a fresh and penetrating look at the whys and wherefores of Pentecostal doctrine that sets a new standard for Spirit-filled theology. Whatever your persuasion may be as a Christian, this book s thoughtfulness, balance, and biblical integrity will help you appreciate more fully the strengths of the Pentecostal stance.Laying the groundwork for an accurate understanding of Luke s writings in particular, the authors help you grasp the foundations of Pentecostal theology from the standpoints of history, hermeneutics, and exegesis. Then, in Part Two, they give you an in-depth look at specific Pentecostal concerns: the baptism of the Holy Spirit as a blessing subsequent to salvation, evidential tongues, signs and wonders, healing in the atonement, and more. You ll deepen your understanding of the basis for Pentecostal beliefs. And you ll gain a feel for the mutually beneficial dialogue that continues between Pentecostals and Evangelicals today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lWFV0XfBiQ4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Belly Dance Book : Rediscovering the Oldest Dance","description":"\\"The Belly Dance Book is a collection of articles by 17 top belly dance writers.

But the new hybrid culture of diaspora Iranians has produced a prolific literature by women that reflects a unique perspective and voice. Let Me Tell You Where I've Been is an extensive collection of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction by women whose lives have been shaped and influenced by Iran's recent history, exile, immigration and the formation of new cultural identities in the United States and Europe. These writings represent an emerging and multi-cultural female sensibility. Unlike many flat media portrayals of Iranian women as veiled, silenced these writers offer a complex literary view of Iranian culture and its influences. These writers interrogate, challenge, and re-define notions of home and language and their work offers readers an experience of Iranian diaspora culture. Featuring over one hundred selections (two-thirds of which have never been published before) by more than fifty contributors--including such well-known writers as Gelareh Asayesh, Tara Bahrampour, Firoozeh Dumas, Roya Hakakian and Mimi Khalvati--the collection represents a substantial diversity of voices in this multicultural community. Divided into six sections, the book's themes of exile, family, culture resistance, and love, create a rich and textured view of the Iranian diaspora. The poems, short stories, and essays are suggestive of an important conversation about Iran, Iranian culture, the Persian and English languages, and the dual identities of many of its authors. This powerful collection is a tribute to the wisdom, insight, and sensitivity of women attempting to invent and articulate a literature of in-betweenness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wTv6wAEACAAJ&dq=Let+Me+Tell+You+Where+I%27ve+Been:+New+Writing+by+Women+of+the+Iranian+Diaspora&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everyday Cooking for the Jewish Home","description":"From the former president of the International Association of Culinary Professionals comes a beautifully designed, accessible and uniquely comprehensive guide to Jewish home cooking.

Lynn Hansen rightly names the collection for her favorite bird, and for the flickers, or moments, of happenings caught in words, illustrating phases and interests of a lifetime. She carries us through childhood's joys of \\"forest humus, thick moss / and a bouquet of wild orchids\\" and woes, \\"the word move was profane because it frees the rat of anxiety that gnaws on the tight knot in my gut.\\" She rejoices when she declares, \\"When I retire I'm going to write poetry.\\" Then for a decade or more, that's precisely what she has done. Lynn was determined to be a scientist in a time it was regarded as impossible for women; her thirty-three-year career of teaching biological sciences at the college level has proven her right. Her keen naturalist's eye, her awareness and love of all life on this planet, and beyond, show in her poems. She even celebrates the lowly zucchini and rutabaga, though she does sigh toward the end of summer, \\"Zucchini manna again?\\" These observations are woven into the sum of time, the treasure of relationships, \\"just as our lives gathered out of jumble, then cemented with a matrix of mutual respect.\\" Lynn's lone robin \\"lifts his bugle beak to call up morning,\\" and so lifts us all.\\" -Patricia Wellingham-Jones, Los Molinos, California \\"This collection by Lynn M. Hansen is an excellent read. While each poem is intensely personal, moving from childhood experiences to motherhood to traveling the world to growing older, Hansen generously takes us along on all her journeys, creating poems that welcome all comers. Her close observations of the natural world, of lands both distant and close to home, create a landscape at once scientifically clear and poetically imagined, and her poems about growing up and getting older and the joys and losses that come with those parts of our lives, will make readers laugh and cry, sometimes all at once. In reading this book, I grew to even more deeply appreciate our world, our Great Central Valley, and Lynn Hansen's poetry, and I suspect the same will be true for all who read this celebratory work.\\" -Gillian Wegener, Poet Laureate of Modesto, California. \\"Lynn Hansen's gorgeous book of poems is a testament to a writer who loves life and fully embraces living every day. It's rare that a trained scientist will turn to poetry to reflect on the natural world and even rarer that those written poems would be this wonderfully lucid, evocative, and heartfelt. Filled with keen-eyed wonder and amusement, these poems will teach readers about life and how to live.\\" -Sam Pierstorff, Editor, Quercus Review Press","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jjt8nAEACAAJ&dq=Lift+Us+Up:+Poetry+of+Patience+and+Healing,+A+Gift+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Holy Woman","description":"A powerful saga of love and family politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nstOPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Holy+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Every Down, Every Distance: My Journey To The NFL","description":"An account of the incredible career of Wayne Chrebet tells of his climb to the NFL, describing how he overcame adversity and being ignored by the draft, and of his rise to fame as a vital receiver for the New York Jets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XR3wAAAAMAAJ&dq=Every+Down,+Every+Distance:+My+Journey+To+The+NFL&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A legal fiction,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BOHMwAEACAAJ&dq=A+legal+fiction,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meet the Munch Bunch","description":"The unwanted vegetables, known as the Munch Bunch, escape from the grocer's shop and set up a real home of their own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zri7AAAACAAJ&dq=Meet+the+Munch+Bunch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SINGING JUNIORS ENLARGED EDITION","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JMXmAAAAMAAJ&dq=SINGING+JUNIORS+ENLARGED+EDITION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient and modern methods of growing extraordinary marijuana","description":"Growing Extraordinary Marijuana is a concise, simple and affordable guide to both ancient and modern methods of cultivating marijuana.

Paul Jewett, author of the creative and highly provocative book Man As Male and Female, here turns his critical attention to the practice of infant baptism. Jewett does not accept the traditional \\"covenant\\" argument for baptizing infants, and this book explains why he believes this argument fails. Infant baptism is not a subject which can be isolated. For, as Jewett would have his readers understand, one's view on this issue is integrally related to one's view of the sacraments in general and thereby to the whole doctrine of the church and salvation. Thus it is understandable that what appears to be a minor theological question has had such divisive effects on the church. A discussion of the historical source of infant baptism begins Jewett's critique and introduces such issues as the distinction between infants and children, the silence of certain early church fathers on the subject, infant communion, and catechetical instruction. The second and major portion of this book examines the theological issue, focusing specifically on the covenant argument, which suggests that baptism replaces circumcision as the sign of the covenant and thereby is given to infants. This argument, Jewett claims, fails to take into account the historical character of revelation, and contains certain contradictions. Jewett concludes with a creative defense of believer baptism, one which is theologically responsible and which recognizes the profound truths of covenant theology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Riz_ljVQMQC&dq=Infant+Baptism+and+the+Covenant+of+Grace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heights of Courage: A Tank Leader's War on the Golan","description":"Kahalani, commander of a tank battalion on the Golan Heights, describes his experiences during the Yom Kippur War.

Dave Barry Internationally renowned journalists Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher present a captivating memoir about falling in love with each other and with wine. She grew up in the all-black environment of Florida A&M University in Tallahassee. He was raised in Jacksonville, Florida, where his was one of a handful of Jewish families. When they met on June 4, 1973, in the newsroom of The Miami Herald, she says,  I felt in my bones like I had known him forever.  And he says,  I felt the instant I saw her that we had always been together, and knew we always would be.  That passion for each other and for wine has made their column a must-read for millions of neophyte and veteran wine lovers, who also follow their appearances on Martha Stewart s TV show. The annual global celebration of wine that they created,  Open That Bottle Night,  encourages readers to finally drink that special wine they have been keeping. As Dottie and John write,  Wine can conjure up memories in a way that few other things can,  whether it s a rare Burgundy or a bottle of cold duck. Frank J. Prial of The New York Times said of their first book, The Wall Street Journal Guide to Wine,  Their enthusiasm for the grape . . . is exceeded only by their enthusiasm for each other. It spills over on every other page.  Indeed, John and Dottie say they don t write a wine column; they write a column about more important things. This book follows them from love at first sight, through a life of journalism, to a triumph on the basketball court at Madison Square Garden. You ll discover the joys of wine along with them, but you ll also discover that wine is really about good times, bad times, moments shared with loved ones, and new friends. It s about memories. It s about life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yl20j_vmkNgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Find the Best Doctors: New York Metro Area (Top Doctors New York Metro Area)","description":"Whether you have recently moved to the New York Metropolitan area, are choosing a primary care doctor or seeking a specialist, Top Doctors: New York Metro Area provides access to more than 6,000 highly qualified physicians in 65 specialties, enabling you to find the best doctor for you and your family's needs.

The Order of Time is a dazzling book.\\" --The Sunday Times From the bestselling author of Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, Reality Is Not What It Seems, and Helgoland, comes a concise, elegant exploration of time. Why do we remember the past and not the future? What does it mean for time to \\"flow\\"? Do we exist in time or does time exist in us? In lyric, accessible prose, Carlo Rovelli invites us to consider questions about the nature of time that continue to puzzle physicists and philosophers alike. For most readers this is unfamiliar terrain. We all experience time, but the more scientists learn about it, the more mysterious it remains. We think of it as uniform and universal, moving steadily from past to future, measured by clocks. Rovelli tears down these assumptions one by one, revealing a strange universe where at the most fundamental level time disappears. He explains how the theory of quantum gravity attempts to understand and give meaning to the resulting extreme landscape of this timeless world. Weaving together ideas from philosophy, science and literature, he suggests that our perception of the flow of time depends on our perspective, better understood starting from the structure of our brain and emotions than from the physical universe. Already a bestseller in Italy, and written with the poetic vitality that made Seven Brief Lessons on Physics so appealing, The Order of Time offers a profoundly intelligent, culturally rich, novel appreciation of the mysteries of time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=POi9DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Reality+of+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Triple Play","description":"Strong women meet cocky baseball players in three sexy stand-alone baseball romances!

Hence it should be useful to any Christian, and indeed to anyone who wants to acquaint himself with some principles of the interior life as it is understood in the Catholic Church. Nothing is here said of such subjects as  contemplation  or even  mental prayer.  And yet the book emphasizes what is at once the most common and the most mysterious aspect in the Christian life: grace, the power and the light of God in us, purifying our hearts, transforming us in Christ, making us true sons of God, enabling us to act in the world as his instruments for the good of all men and for his glory. This is therefore a meditation on some fundamental themes appropriate to the active life. It must be said at once that the active life is essential to every Christian. Clearly the active life must mean more than the life which is led in religious institutes of men and women who teach, care for the sick, and so on. (When one is talking of the  active life  as opposed to the  contemplative life,  this is the usual reference.) Here action is not looked at in opposition to contemplation, but as an expression of charity and as a necessary consequence of union with God by baptism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kcV-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fighting the third death","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wAQEMwAACAAJ&dq=Fighting+the+third+death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honda Vt700 and 750, 1983-1987: Service, Repair, Maintenance/M313","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Red One","description":"Vera Yelnikov returns to finish her battle with the Carpenter, and thenthis elite Kremlin agent must carry out her mission of becoming the new darlingof America, by donning the costume of the superhero Red One!

Includes 8 vivid stories of women overcoming great emotional pain and life obstacles through Mindfulness Psychotherapy. ? Each story is followed by a discussion and a relevant mindfulness meditation. As a result of her years of working with women as a psychotherapist, Barbara Miller Fishman developed the discipline of Mindfulness Psychotherapy--a combination of mindfulness meditation and psychotherapy that, taken together, describe a path toward wholeness. Now she presents the integration of her life's work through the poignant stories of eight women--all faced with critical decisions and tough life circumstances--and how they used Mindfulness Psychotherapy to attain greater levels of peace and well-being. The author offers a radical shift in a woman's relationship to life. Readers will discover the importance of naming a life problem, accepting the \\"is-ness\\" of it, developing a matter-of-fact curiosity, and exploring the mind/body reactions that we call emotional pain. The path continues as the reader creates an observing self and discovers the deep compassion that ultimately heals. Once learned, these six awareness practices can be used to face difficult situations, discover self-acceptance, and release the love needed to reside fully in one's whole self.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XFsoDwAAQBAJ&dq=Emotional+Healing+through+Mindfulness+Meditation:+Stories+and+Meditations+for+Women+Seeking+Wholeness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Day by Day with Jonathan Edwards","description":"Ranked among the greatest thinkers in American history.

Yet we know very little about the local and transnational processes that characterize this new migration. Transnational Adoption is a unique ethnographic study of China/U.S. adoption, the largest contemporary intercountry adoption program. Sara K. Dorow begins by situating the popularity of the China/U.S. adoption process within a broader history of immigration and adoption. She then follows the path of the adoption process: the institutions and bureaucracies in both China and the United States that prepare children and parents for each other; the stories and practices that legitimate them coming together as transnational families; the strains placed upon our common notions of what motherhood means; and ways in which parents then construct the cultural and racial identities of adopted children. Based on rich ethnographic evidence, including interviews with and observation of people on both sides of the Pacific from orphanages, government officials, and adoption agencies to advocacy groups and adoptive families themselves this is a fascinating look at the latest chapter in Chinese-American migration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C7fHwKsrEgUC&dq=Transnational+Adoption:+A+Cultural+Economy+of+Race,+Gender,+and+Kinship+(Nation+of+Newcomers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soy el monstruo comepesadillas! = I am the nightmare eating monster (Spanish Edition)","description":"Second edition of Gloria Anzaldua's major work, with a new critical introduction by Chicano Studies scholar and new reflections by Anzaldua.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c32tvgEACAAJ&dq=Soy+el+monstruo+comepesadillas!+%3D+I+am+the+nightmare+eating+monster+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"30 Energy-Efficient Houses...You Can Build","description":"This book is about how to build tomorrow's house -- today.

In his drawings of the infantry dog-faces Willie and Joe, done while he himself fought in campaigns in Sicily and Italy, Mauldin created the immortal archetypes of the American fighting man. He knew, as one who had been there himself on the front lines and in the slit trenches, drenched with mud and rain, that Willie and Joe - with their unshaven faces, their gallows humor, their fortitude, and their dislike of privilege and cant - exemplify something enduring and surely noble about Americans at war. He knew their gripes, their fears, their jokes, and their opinions, and he recorded their talk with the most pungent accuracy. As for the timelessness of this book, David Halberstam puts it best: \\"One senses that if a war reporter who had been with Hannibal or Napoleon saw Mauldin's work, he would know immediately that the work was right\\". This new edition of Up Front is being published to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the end of World War II. It reproduces the exact design of the interior of the original 1946 edition as well as its front cover art. Up Front endures today as a piece of living history and a potent reminder of the sacrifices made by the men who fight our wars, whether that fighting takes place in Italy or France or Korea or Vietnam or the Persian Gulf.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YCY8AAAAMAAJ&dq=Up+front&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Quiet Storm: A Novel","description":"Corey Buchman and his wife Susie had a normal life together and on a path to contentment.

That's the easy part.But few people, as Joseph Barbato says in the first chapter of his new book, can write a ?Knockout? proposal, \\"a document of such force it nearly catapults the funder down the hall.\\"A proposal writer himself for 30 years, Barbato hopes to change that.Even if you don't have the skills to compose a riveting proposal ? in other words, even if you're not blessed with the talents of Philip Roth, Toni Morrison, or John Updike - you can dramatically improve your proposal and make it more appealing than the overwhelming majority of those currently submitted.The key is to heed Barbato's tips and suggestions on everything from naming your proposal, to helping the funder ?get it?, to emphasizing the right benefits, to focusing on the most arresting data, to guarding against a range of red flags. Barbato's engaging style goes down like icewater in August. He is brief, snappy, and always fresh. The entire book, with its 51 two-page chapters, can be read in one sitting.But don't be fooled by its brevity.As Joel Orosz, the Kellogg Foundation's former program director, says in the Foreword: \\"As someone who has sat on both sides of the funding desk, I can attest that How to Write Knockout Proposals provides advice that will help you in the real world, with real funders.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9NvkjAniWb8C&dq=How+to+Write+Knockout+Proposals:+What+You+Must+Know+(And+Say)+to+Win+Funding+Every+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Herbert: The Country Parson and the Temple (Classics of Western Spirituality)","description":"George Herbert (1593-1633) was an Anglican priest, poet and essayist--truly one of the most profound spiritual masters in the English tradition.

It is the summer of 1979. An English painter travels to a small island off the west coast of Ireland. Mr. Lloyd takes the last leg by currach, though boats with engines are available and he doesn t much like the sea. He wants the authentic experience, to be changed by this place, to let its quiet and light fill him, give him room to create. He doesn t know that a Frenchman follows close behind. Jean-Pierre Masson has visited the island for many years, studying the language of those who make it their home. He is fiercely protective of their isolation, deems it essential to exploring his theories of language preservation and identity. But the people who live on this rock three miles long and half a mile wide have their own views on what is being recorded, what is being taken, and what ought to be given in return. Over the summer, each of them from great-grandmother Bean U  Fhloinn, to widowed Mair ad, to fifteen-year-old James, who is determined to avoid the life of a fisherman will wrestle with their values and desires. Meanwhile, all over Ireland, violence is erupting. And there is blame enough to go around. An expertly woven portrait of character and place, a stirring investigation into yearning to find one s way, and an unflinchingly political critique of the long, seething cost of imperialism, Audrey Magee s The Colony is a novel that transports, that celebrates beauty and connection, and that reckons with the inevitable ruptures of independence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B6o9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life In The Coral Reef (Wild, Wild World of Animals Series)","description":"Profusely illustrated text discusses the ecology of coral reefs and the interrelationships of the plant and animal life that inhabit them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=APfiAQAACAAJ&dq=Life+In+The+Coral+Reef+(Wild,+Wild+World+of+Animals+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To My Son, with Love (A Little Bit of Series)","description":"This beautiful gift book is one that any parent would be thrilled to give to a son.

The interpretation of seismic waves generally follows the assumption that the Earth's physical structure is grossly layered and that fluctuations of the physical parameters within individual layers are smooth in structure and small in magnitude. While this view greatly facilitates the analytic and interpretative procedure, it is clearly at odds with evidence from outcrops and boreholes, which indicates that compositional, structural and petrophysical heterogeneity in the Earth prevails over a wide range of scales. This book is the first to unify three different views of crustal and upper mantle heterogeneity. It brings together the geological view, which is derived from the analysis of crustal exposures and deep boreholes; the stochastic view, which attempts to find order and structure in these seemingly chaotic data; and the seismological view, which considers the end product of the complex interaction of seismic energy with the heterogeneous structure at depth. John Goff and Klaus Holliger have compiled chapters that explore and quantify the relationship between geological and petrophysical heterogeneity and its seismic response, and use seismic data to probe the fabric of the Earth's interior. Geologists, geostaticians, and geophysicists alike will benefit from the integrative perspective presented in Heterogeneity in the Crust and Upper Mantle: Nature, Scaling, and Seismic Properties, making this text an unparalleled reference for professionals and students in Earth science fields.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m63eBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chaucer and the Legend of Good Women","description":"An outstanding poem and a consummate example of employing the dream vision technique.

The story opens in 1973 as Conway, unbeknownst to her, is first  looked over  as a prospective candidate by members of the Smith community, and continues as she assesses her passions and possibilities and agrees to the new challenge of heading the college in 1975. The jolt of energy she gets from being surrounded by several thousand young women enables her to take on the difficulties that arise in dealing with the diverse Smith constituencies from the self-appointed protectors of the great male tradition of humanistic learning to the equally determined young feminists insisting on change. We see Conway juggling the needs and concerns of faculty, students, parents, trustees, and alumnae, and re-defining and redesigning aspects of the college to create programs in line with the new realities of women s lives. We sense the urgency of her efforts to shape an institution that will attract students of the 1990s and beyond. Through it all we see Jill Ker Conway coping with her husband s illness, and learning to protect and sustain her inner self. As the end of a decade at Smith approaches, we see her realizing that she has both had her education and made her contributions, and that it is time now for her to graduate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eIQEmV-o-VgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Fashion Designs of the Fifties Paper Dolls: 30 Haute Couture Costumes by Dior, Balenciaga and Others (Dover Paper Dolls)","description":"Two lifelike paper dolls and 30 haute couture outfits by Chanel, Paquin, Jacques Heim, Mainbocher, Pauline Trigere, Givenchy, Cardin, Norell, other greats.

Wright Mills Award from the Society for the Study of Social Problems The Making of the Unborn Patient: Social Anatomy of Fetal Surgery, Monica J. Casper, It is now possible for physicians to recognize that a pregnant woman's foetus is facing life-threatening problems, perform surgery on the foetus, and if it survives, return it to the woman's uterus to finish gestation. Although foetal surgery has existed in various forms for three decades, it is only just beginning to capture the public's imagination. These still largely experimental procedures raise all types of medical, political and ethical questions. Who is the patient? What are the technical difficulties involved in foetal surgery? How do reproductive politics seep into the operating room, and how do medical definitions and meanings flow out of medicine and into other social spheres? How are ethical issues defined in this practice and who defines them? Is foetal surgery the kind of medicine we want? What is involved in reframing foetal surgery as a women's health issue, rather than simply a paediatric concern? In this ethnographic study of the social, cultural and historical aspects of foetal surgery, Monica Casper addresses these questions. \\"The Making of the Unborn Patient\\" examines two important and connected events of the second half of the 20th century: the emergence of foetal surgery as a new medical specialty and the debut of the unborn patient.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C1wPE1ejhEAC&dq=The+Making+of+the+Unborn+Patient:+A+Social+Anatomy+of+Fetal+Surgery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foreign Bodies and the Body Politic: Discourses of Social Pathology in Early Modern England (Cambridge Studies in Renaissance Literature and Culture)","description":"Jonathan Gil Harris examines the origins of modern discourses of social pathology in Elizabethan and Jacobean medical and political writing. Plays, pamphlets and political treatises of this period display an increasingly xenophobic tendency to attribute England's ills to 'foreign bodies' such as Jews, Catholics and witches, as well as treat their allegedly 'poisonous' features for the health of the body politic. Harris argues that this tendency resonates with two of the distinctive paradigms of Paracelsus' pharmacy which also includes the notion that poison has a medicinal power. The emergence of these paradigms in early modern English political thought signals a decisive shift from Galenic humoral tradition towards twentieth-century politico-medical discourses of 'infection' and 'containment', which, like their early modern predecessors, make mysterious the domestic origins of social conflict and the operations of political authority.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x0IXc2e_7GIC&dq=Foreign+Bodies+and+the+Body+Politic:+Discourses+of+Social+Pathology+in+Early+Modern+England+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Renaissance+Literature+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Life and Love: A Guide to Catholic Teaching on Marriage & Family","description":"This reference work summarizes the key documents of the Roman Catholic Church on marriage and family life, from the time of Leo XIII to John Paul II.

Toklas Cook Book","description":"A beautiful new edition of the classic culinary memoir by Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein's romantic partner, with a new introduction by beloved culinary voice Ruth Reichl. Restaurant kitchens have long been dominated by men, but, as of late, there has been an explosion of interest in the many women chefs who are revolutionizing the culinary game. And, alongside that interest, an accompanying appetite for smart, well-crafted culinary memoirs by female trailblazers in food. Nearly 70 years earlier, there was Alice. When Alice B. Toklas was asked to write a memoir, she initially refused. Instead, she wrote The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book, a sharply written, deliciously rich cookbook memorializing meals and recipes shared by Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Wilder, Matisse, and Picasso--and of course by Alice and Gertrude themselves. While The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas--penned by Gertrude Stein--adds vivid detail to Alice's life, this cookbook paints a richer, more joyous depiction: a celebration of a lifetime in pursuit of culinary delights. In this cookbook, Alice supplies recipes inspired by her travels, accompanied by amusing tales of her and Gertrude's lives together. In \\"Murder in the Kitchen,\\" Alice describes the first carp she killed, after which she immediately lit up a cigarette and waited for the police to come and haul her away; in \\"Dishes for Artists,\\" she describes her hunt for the perfect recipe to fit Picasso's peculiar diet; and, of course, in \\"Recipes from Friends,\\" she provides the recipe for \\"Haschich Fudge,\\" which she notes may often be accompanied by \\"ecstatic reveries and extensions of one's personality on several simultaneous planes.\\" With an updated look and feel, and a heartwarming introduction from Gourmet's famed Editor-in-Chief Ruth Reichl, this much-loved, culinary classic is sure to resonate with food lovers and literary folk alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=udSezQEACAAJ&dq=The+Alice+B.+Toklas+Cook+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Canadian Catholics: Gallicanism, Romanism, and Canadianism (McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion, Series Two)","description":"A history of the first 400 years of Catholic life in Canada.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4OszB8KwdjgC&dq=A+History+of+Canadian+Catholics:+Gallicanism,+Romanism,+and+Canadianism+(McGill-Queen%27s+Studies+in+the+History+of+Religion,+Series+Two)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flow of Fluids Through Valves, Fittings, and Pipe (U S ed)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PXWSDAEACAAJ&dq=Flow+of+Fluids+Through+Valves,+Fittings,+and+Pipe+(U+S+ed)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keystone: The Life and Clowns of Mack Sennett","description":"From the author of \\"Stan and Ollie\\"--a funny, fresh, and compelling look at Hollywood's Original King of Comedy. From his early aspirations to sing opera, to his time under the tutelage of D. W. Griffith, to the fortune and notoriety that his uncanny eye for talent deservedly brought him, Mack Sennett stood behind his belief in individuality and originality. Now, more than eighty years after Sennett rose to heights that epitomized the American dream, the acclaimed biographer of Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, and W. C. Fields offers a compelling account of comedy's transformation at the hands of a true master. Regarded as the father of American slapstick, Sennett--iron-worker, boilermaker, actor, director, producer, writer, and creator of the infamous Keystone Kops--held audiences in thrall to a world where chaos was order and banana peels, car crashes, and leaps from tall buildings were a matter of course. As the cameras rolled and vaudeville gags morphed into celluloid wonders, the rising stars of Charlie Chaplin, Mabel Normand, and Gloria Swanson were born. Behind it all was the \\"King of Comedy,\\" governing from his office bathtub. In this irresistible journey into early Hollywood at its peak, Simon Louvish crafts a fascinating portrait of the enigmatic entrepreneur. Through film scripts, telegrams, even liquor bills, Sennett's world is skillfully re-created, offering a rare and humorous glance into the infancy and innocence of moving pictures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DaosHAAACAAJ&dq=Keystone:+The+Life+and+Clowns+of+Mack+Sennett&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remember the Catskills: Tales by a Recovering Hotelkeeper","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Hand of the Mighty: Right and Wrong Uses of Our Power","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QpWfPHmAdmQC&dq=The+Hand+of+the+Mighty:+Right+and+Wrong+Uses+of+Our+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Web Publishing With Adobe Pagemill 2: The Ultimate Guide to Designing Professional Web Pages","description":"The tutorial approach in Web Publishing With Adobe PageMill makes designing Web pages easy.

When she sees the dust cloud on the horizon she knows he has arrived. She knows he will want the loveliest girl: her sister. She vows she will not let her be next. And so she is taken in her sister's place, and she believes death will soon follow. But back in their village her sister is mourning. Through her pain, she calls upon the desert winds, conjuring a subtle unseen magic, and something besides death stirs the air in it's place. Lo-Melkhiin's court is a dangerous palace filled with pretty things: intricate statues with wretched eyes, exquisite threads to weave the most beautiful garments. She sees everything as if for the last time. But the first sun sets and rises, and she is not dead. Night after night Lo-Melkhiin comes to her, and listens to the stories she tells and day after day she is awoken by the sunrise. Exploring the palace, she begins to unlock years of fear that have tormented and silenced a kingdom. Lo-Melkhiin was not always a cruel ruler. Something went wrong. The words she speaks to him every night are given strange life of their own. She makes things appear. Little things, at first: a dress from home, a vision of her sister. With each tale she spins, her power grows. Soon she dreams of bigger, more terrible magic: power enough to save a king, if she can put an end to rule of a monster.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iaKvBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Duke","description":"The adventures of two boys and dog in a small river town on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay in the early twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fnpCGQAACAAJ&dq=Chesapeake+Duke&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cuisine Provencale","description":"Pelez et coupez en rondelles les oignons.

This blueprint helps harvest our creativity to: Enable us to identify, understand, and fulfill our personal and professional goals and desires more effectively Allow us to recognize that our perceptions about our environments are unique, fluid, and subject to change Show us that each individual is an intrinsic part of his or her environment Encourage us to think systemically, rather than linearly Design new behaviors to succeed in the new and changing environment By following the blueprint outlined in Relearn, Evolve, and Adapt we can facilitate our destiny and expand the opportunities for accessing inner peace, harmony, and unity, while reducing despair and frustration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cdqBixJ0WfUC&dq=Journey+to+the+Boundless:+Exploring+the+Intimate+Connection+Between+Your+Mind,+Body+and+Spirit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Al-Hallaj (Curzon Sufi series)","description":"The life and teachings of Islam's most dramatic and controversial mystic, Husayn ibn Mansur, better known as Al-Hallaj (the reader of hearts).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xEaewBpZwfMC&dq=Al-Hallaj+(Curzon+Sufi+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"General Maxwell Taylor","description":"The son of the distinguished general profiles his father's long career and his key role in such events as the Vietnam War, nuclear retaliation, and the Bay of Pigs invasion","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oAcgAAAAMAAJ&dq=General+Maxwell+Taylor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Estrategia Competitiva - Tapa Dura (Spanish Edition)","description":"Cerca de su sexag sima impresi n en ingl s y traducida a diecinueve idiomas, la Estrategia competitiva de Michael E.

These essays argue, on the contrary, that the Reformers' radical re-thinking of the definition of the church is one of the Reformation's greatest treasures. Not only is \\"mere Protestant\\" ecclesiology firmly in concert with the multifaceted biblical witness, but it is also manifestly in accord with natural reason and the lived experience of Christians throughout the ages. As we celebrate the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, this volume seeks to honor the Protestant heritage by remembering, reclaiming, and critically reflecting upon the relationship between the gospel promise and the community which it calls into being. \\"Conventional wisdom holds that just as Protestantism supposedly fractured the church into churches, so it fractured ecclesiology into ecclesiologies. This spirited volume argues the opposite: that the magisterial reformers in fact advanced a single, powerful, coherent, and biblical account of the essence of the church focused on the gospel. With remarkable restraint, the authors of People of the Promise decline to be distracted as they retrieve Protestantism's core ecclesiology. Readers may experience the shock of recognition to find that not only have they seen this ecclesiology before, they are inhabiting it. This retrieval should strengthen us to inhabit it more amply.\\" - Fred Sanders, Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tOSNswEACAAJ&dq=Joseph+(People+of+the+Promise)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventure of Philosophy (Contributions in Philosophy, 71)","description":"Explores the most important questions and issues that have engaged philosophers over the past twenty-five centuries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bCujbRI16akC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cassie","description":"Though she has been raised as an Iroquois, 15-year-old Cassie Steven's blonde hair and blue eyes clearly indicate that she is not an Indian, and as she grows up she must decide whether she belongs with the Indians or with her own people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NVK_W9CiEagC&dq=Cassie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joni Mitchell: Hits (Authentic Guitar-Tab)","description":"Titles are: Big Yellow Taxi * Both Sides Now * California * Carey * Chelsea Morning * Chinese Cafe * The Circle Game * Come In from the Cold * Help Me * Raised on Robbery * River * Urge for Going * Woodstock * You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SiMPAAAACAAJ&dq=Joni+Mitchell:+Hits+(Authentic+Guitar-Tab)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ovid: The Art of Love and Other Poems (Loeb Classical Library No. 232)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qeTunQEACAAJ&dq=Ovid:+The+Art+of+Love+and+Other+Poems+(Loeb+Classical+Library+No.+232)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Compulsion,: A play","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g-GvngEACAAJ&dq=Compulsion,:+A+play&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook on plumeria culture","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Great Devonian Controversy: The Shaping of Scientific Knowledge among Gentlemanly Specialists (Science and Its Conceptual Foundations series)","description":"\\"Arguably the best work to date in the history of geology.\\" David R.

You read it as a small child, or even an adult, and never forget the images it conjures up of a wonderful Englishman who lives in the mysterious forests of faraway Burma and of the kind native people who teach him about their lovely country. But most of all, you never forget the elephants! For this is a story about those magnificent creatures. Though he was officially known as Lt. Colonel JH Williams, the author was known to the world at large as \\"Elephant Bill.\\" That is because he spent 25 years living with the elephants in the mountains and forests of Burma. There he trained them to haul teak logs out of the isolated jungles. Yet this is also a story of great courage, because when the Second World War struck it also came to Burma. The Japanese Imperial Army planned to confiscate the Burmese elephants, drafting them to make the bridges and railways they needed to invade India. When he learned of these plans to put his beloved animals to a war-like purpose, Elephant Bill knew what had to be done. The mighty kings of the jungle had to be evacuated to safety. This is thus the story not only of the peaceful days in the jungle, starting in 1921, but also the story of the largest elephant rescue in history. It tells the amazing account of how Elephant Bill, along with his friends and family, rode 45 of the great beasts across the mountains of Burma, before reaching safety in faraway India. A classic then. A classic now. \\"Elephant Bill\\" is a blessing to any library and a literary treasure.

What is the relationship between types of sleep and types of dreams? Does dreaming serve any purpose? Or are dreams simply meaningless mental noise--\\"unmusical fingers wandering over the piano keys\\"? With expertise in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, Owen Flanagan is uniquely qualified to answer these questions. And in Dreaming Souls he provides both an accessible survey of the latest research on sleep and dreams and a compelling new theory about the nature and function of dreaming. Flanagan argues that while sleep has a clear biological function and adaptive value, dreams are merely side effects, \\"free riders,\\" irrelevant from an evolutionary point of view. But dreams are hardly unimportant. Indeed, Flanagan argues that dreams are self-expressive, the result of our need to find or to create meaning, even when we're sleeping. Rejecting Freud's theory of manifest and latent content--of repressed wishes appearing in disguised form--Flanagan shows how brainstem activity during sleep generates a jumbled profusion of memories, images, thoughts, emotions, and desires, which the cerebral cortex then attempts to shape into a more or less coherent story. Such dream-narratives range from the relatively mundane worries of non REM sleep to the fantastic confabulations of deep REM that resemble psychotic episodes in their strangeness. But however bizarre these narratives may be, they can shed light on our mental life, our well being, and our sense of self. Written with clarity, lively wit, and remarkable insight, Dreaming Souls offers a fascinating new way of apprehending one of the oldest mysteries of mental life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sm12CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beatles Forever","description":"A devoted fan and serious musicologist evaluates the Beatles' impact on music and the youth culture, assembling an extensive collection of memorabilia, complete discographies, and other background information","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fwIhAQAAIAAJ&dq=Beatles+Forever&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photoshop Elements 2 Restoration and Retouching","description":"* Covers the features users want most in restoration and retouching: scanning existing prints, correcting color and lighting problems, hiding dust and scratches, repairing holes in the image, improving focus, and printing and posting the retouched images * VISUAL format uses step-by-step, full-color screen shot accompanied by minimal text to make learning quick and easy * Simple-to-use features, top-quality photo editing tools, cross-platform capabilities, and an affordable price make Photoshop Elements 2 extremely popular with the booming market of digital camera users * New elements of Windows XP are expected to produce even faster growth in the imaging market, with digital camera sales expected to triple over the next five years","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pwdUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Photoshop+Elements+2+Restoration+and+Retouching&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pebble in the Shoe","description":"What's holding you back from business success, marital bliss or parenting nirvana?

In the final days of 1944, Admiral William  Bull  Halsey is the Pacific theater s most popular and colorful naval hero. After a string of victories, the  Fighting Admiral  and his thirty-thousand-man Third Fleet are charged with protecting General MacArthur s flank during the invasion of the Philippine island of Mindoro. But in the midst of the landings, Halsey attempts a complicated refueling maneuver and unwittingly drives his 170 ships into the teeth of a massive typhoon. Halsey s men find themselves battling ninety-foot waves and 150 mph winds. Amid the chaos, three ships are sunk and nearly nine hundred sailors and officers are swept into the Philippine Sea.
