Make sure to have a box of tissues nearby, but you will be a better person for having read it...trust me"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My English Professor recommened this book. Was not too sure I would like it. I started reading and could not put the book down. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen between Noah and Allie. The book sparked my imagination. I have never really placed characters into my mind, but with this book, I had to know what the characters looked liked, and I had to explore the places that they took you in the book. I was intrigued by the way Mr. Sparks put this story into fine detail for the readers. I love this book and I cannot wait to read it again!!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was beautifully written with characters that were involving and easy to care about. It was romantic, sad, happy and made one wistful to have had that kind of love in one's life. This is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was a wonderful love story. The boy getting the girl isn't as easy as it always was. Mr. Sparks has a true talent. Would recomend this to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Truly, one of the best books I have ever read. Very well written with all the heart anyone could ever hope to read. I could not put it down. It was given to me to read and I passed it on to a friend. I bought my own copy to keep. I absolutely loved this book. It will be hard to pick up another. I just can't find one I want to read now. Keep writing, Nicholas Sparks, I want another book to read. Thank you so much!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thank Nicholas Sparks for having writen such a beautiful book on the trials and tribulations which a couple edures but who's love outweights the darkness of Alztymers. I think that this book is a great work of art for an amature such as Mr. Sparks and I hope that he continues to write much more. He has a talent in story writing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It seems from the reviews I read, that readers either loved the book or hated it. Personally, I loved it. Yes, it was an easy read and may have been grammatically simplistic but the emotions that Nicolas Sparks evokes is masterful. I felt the plot was unique for love stories and was a refreshing change of pace from the &quot;heat of the moment&quot; love stories on the market. If you are not a true romantic find something else to read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. If you want to curl up and read a sweet romance story and maybe shed a few tears, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Both times that I have read this book, I could not put it down if my life depended on it. At some points I couldn't even see the pages through my blurry vision. It is beautifully written, and Nicholas Sparks describes the characters so vividly, that you would think that you were right there, experiencing and seeing everything take shape. It was realistic too, not like some super sappy, fake book that would never take place in real life. If you are looking for something wonderful to read, pick this up. I would highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nichols Sparks paints a picture with his words. This is a great love story about love that last forever!! I could read it over and over again"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks does it again! What a fabulous storyteller he is! This book is an incredibly moving and heartwarming story of love that can never end... loved it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book proves what a great author Nicolas Sparks really is. I've read a few of his books now and he is a truly great writer. I enjoyed it and just like his book &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; it gave you all of the good feelings that you should get in a great book. This book is a true love story, the kind you don't really read about these days, and it's a wonderful collection to anyone's library."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I like Nicholas Sparks. He is unpretentious, yet is amaster when it comes to manipulating the emotional stateof the reader. It is very refreshing to find a book whichlets the reader wander through a time of innocence andindulge in the longings for true love. Read this book andtake a short vacation from life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I like Nicholas Sparks.

It is very refreshing to find a book whichlets the reader wander through a time of innocence andindulge in the longings for true love. Read this book andtake a short vacation from life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was my first Nicholas Sparks experience. I immediately bought his other works. Spectacular reader involvement into the storyline occurs at the onset of The Notebook. He weaves a tale of true love. This is not a typical &quot;romance novel.&quot; Seduction is a fleeting moment; Sparks, however, spins a magic tapestry in the strength of true love and lasting devotion. I have purchased numerous copies of this novel for my friends' enjoyment. Each recipient has raved at Sparks' soulful writing and ability to hold one spellbound. As a voracious reader I can unequivocally state that this is my favorite book of all."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was hard to put down. Little surprises kept popping up making the reader not put it down. The main character, Noah Calhoun, is very adventerous. He likes to go canoeing and play the guitar. Allison Nelson was the other main character. Her enjoyment comes from painting. Noah and Allison spent a summer together and fell in love. They haven't seen each other since. Since not having met in about five years, this book is very suspensful. When Allison comes back to meet Noah, they fall in love with each other all over again. This part of the book is very suspensful. I find myself asking, &quot;Will they fall in love again?&quot; or &quot;Will they marry some day?&quot; I couldn't wait to finish the book to find out if they stay together. I give this book an eight rating out of ten. It was a good book but some parts were dragging."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am a writer and when I don't write I read. The Notebook is one of the best books I have ever read. It is heart wrenching yet tells a tale that could be in our very own journal entry. All I really want to say is, if you haven't read it...read it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was my first Nicolas Sparks novel. I'll start out by saying that the novel is definately one that somehow intrigued me to go one reading, and it definately made me cry throughout the last half of it. I felt that this was a really good concept and the story line was also pretty good. However, this book was really lacking in a lot of areas. I felt that there were so many places where Sparks could have really delved in and captured a great moment, but instead of embelishing on these parts, he was very brief. There was never a chance to really enjoy something going on in the book because as soon as you got into the moment, he would hurry and switch to the next subject. I felt like his descriptions were vague and cliche...I don't like a writer to tell me what something looks like...I want to be able to see it for myself and also I want to be able to hear whats going on and smell the scents around me...his descriptions needed more depth. I thought the dialouge was very unrealistic...there were many places where I had to really try hard to laugh because the dialouge was so corny. I did enjoy the characters of Noah and Allie, but I didn't think either character was very well developed throughout the tale. This was a really easy read...it took me about 2-3 hours, and I enjoyed the reading, but I did feel that there was so much more than Sparks could have done with this story, and it just didn't live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't really like the book. Their love is not as meaningful to me as the book has described. The plot is good, but the author should've made it more of a tragedy instead of a happy ending. I don't like when Laura came back to him and then they stayed together. The author should just leave the story when Laura left to get marry with Leon. To me their love doesn't seem stable. I would like it more if he change the end and maybe have one of the main characters die. It may be lame, but it's unexpected. It would be more emotional and remembering."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was, by far, one of the best books I have ever read!! So far, I've read all of Nicholas Sparks' books except &quot;The Rescue&quot; and now I can't wait to read that one! Like his others, &quot;The Notebook&quot; made me laugh and cry. It is brilliantly written and the excerpts of poetry make it all the better. The fact that it was about two old people reminiscing on their love was not appealing to me at first, but after I started reading I couldn't put it down! I would gladly recommend this book to anyone who loves love! It is awesome!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have to confess that when I read this book, I was in the car on a roadtrip with my parents. I had a horrible head cold, and they were riding up front while I huddled in the backseat with this book. Now, I NEVER cry at movies or books -- for heaven's sake, right? -- but by the time I was done with this beautiful love story, I was weeping furtively, concealing my tears under the sniffly guise of my cold. This story is absolutely gorgeous. I mean, this book violates absolutely every rule against melodrama, manipulation, or maudlin emotion, but it WORKS. What can I say? You grow to love these characters, and their story unfolds so tantalizingly and so carefully, your whole heart will become invested in their experiences and decisions. The only thing now is that I dare not read the book again... I'm afraid my husband will come home and find me in a most satisfying heap on the floor, weeping inelegantly! But see for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A beautiful book. Nicholas Sparks has a way with words. He can develop a romance and put just enough drama into it to make it exciting. The Notebook has a wonderful plot. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"All I can say is Wow. This was one of the best love stories I have ever read. Anyone who has read Nicholas Sparks other books and enjoyed them will be equally saitisfied with this one. The last chapter of the book was a wonderful way of showing how love can overcome everything."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in one sitting. I laughed and cried. My heart pounded in my chest as I read. The passion that Sparks creates in his characters flows from the pages of this wonderful short story. He has truly captured what &quot;soul mates&quot; are all about. The feelings evoked through this love story are beautiful and will be enjoyed by the romantic in everyone."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone. I did not want to put this book down and I liked the fact that it was a quick read. I am determined to read all of the Nicholas Sparks books before school starts again. Chances are I will be posting many reviews~"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After seeing the movie multiple times, I decided to finally read the book. It was hard to separate the movie and the book but in the end, I think I liked the movie better. The book was a real quick read, keeping my attention for long periods of time (can be hard to do). I loved the way Nicholas Sparks described the house that Noah eventually fixed up and the way his life was all wrapped around it. Just like the movie, then ending made my cry knowing that their love will last forever. Even though I liked the movie better, I did enjoy the book and its story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What terrible, terrible writing. Vapid, hollow, trite--I could go on, but mere adjectives fail to capture the bounds of my distaste. i'd rather read a magazine. Or a blog. Or a roll of toilet paper. With so many great books out there in the literary canon, please take my advice and avoid this formulaic trash. If you're just that curious, watch the movie--running time two hours instead of 8 in front of a forgettable book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I liked the book just OKAY. I dont think there is a time i have EVER said this, but i like the movie much better. I thought i would be balling like i did in the movie, but not a drop! i did finish the book so it did keep my attention, but it wasnt what i expected."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This by far one of the best love stories I ever read. It grabs you heart and won 't let go. I also enjoyed the movie and watched it over and obver again. A must read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"For once I have to say that I liked the movie better than the book. I enjoyed the book but it was definitely not my favorite Sparks book. It was however a great guideline for one of my all time favorite movies!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this after seeing the movie, and it was different, but still amazing. The story was simply told in different ways. It's emotional, sweet, and written very well. It will probably make you cry, but trust me, this story is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought the book thinking that the book was going to be as good as the movie, but it's not.It was so bad that I want my money back!!! The book starts when Allie wants to meet Noah. That's about when the movie is almost over. The book doesn't really tell the story of Noah and Allie together. They remember of bits and things and that's about it. The book also is kind of boring. I had a hard time reading it, because Noah says something and then they walk for a long time and then she answers or they gaze at the sun or the trees for a long time and then they talk or they are comfortable with silence... It's a boring novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It was impressive. I read it in my language. Even though it's translated into another language, it was fine written and the way he conveyed the story is excellent. I surprised that majority of the story I was reading was from Noah's notebook. I ended up crying because of how much Noah loves Allie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a fairly well-known story as it was the basis of the wildly successful movie of the same name. I was happy to find that the movie didn't stray too far from the heart of the book. The Notebook is a beautiful, heart-breaking story and the characters Noah and Allie are utterly convincing in their love for one another. The last paragraph threw me and brought my final rating of the book down slightly. The novel was so beautiful and romantic and I felt the last \\"unbuttoning\\" cheapened the message a little.The Notebook is amazingly detailed and heartfelt for such a short book. It's ability to invoke such deep feeling, compassion and complete understanding of its characters make reading it an experience to be treasured. I am in no way a romantic at heart, but even I found the story to be very touching. I also found it rather flowery and full of an abundance of poetry that didn't speak to my hardened heart, but could very likely leave a romantic personality completely smitten."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas captures your interest and holds it throughout the book. It is sweet and emotional. I love the story and the way it is written. It is one of the best I've ever read...easy to read, believable, and inspirational.Ready for another one Nicholas!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Thank you Mr. Sparks. I loved this book. I got into the story so much that I thought I was really there. I was reading the book when I heard a car outside my house and for a minute I thought that it was Lon looking for Allie at Noah's house. I also loved Message in a Bottle and look forward to reading more Nicholas Sparks books."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks justifys that chivalry has not died. In this romance he allows a woman to feel like she is the center of the universe. HIs characters enthrall you with their passion and love for one another. Even through sickness &quot;The Notebook&quot; shows how love can overcome even in the depths of despair. A great novel for the woman waiting for her knight in shining armor or the woman who longs for the lost romance in her life. A great read for both a single man,woman or a great read for a couple to rekindle the old flame."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this novel! It was heart-warming from beginning to end. It is so easy for anyone to get caught up and emotionally attatched with the story and the characters because most people have either experienced such a true, beautiful love such as the one in the story, or they are looking for a love like this! I reccommend this novel to anone who believes in the power of love and who loves to cry, because that is just what I did for 10 minutes after I finished this novel...which I read in 1 day!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book hit home in a big way. I read it at work in two hours. (Actually, sat in the car to finish the last 10 pages). I cried for a long time but felt so comfortable and mellow when I finished. I wish it was longer!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Most people who have reviewed this book seemed to love it or hate it. I am the rare person who thought it was so-so! I liked the way it covered the characters' whole lives and didn't begin and end with youth, but dealt with the problems of old age that most romances never get to. I also found it fairly engaging to read, and read it quickly. I was genuninely interested in whether Allie would marry Lon or Noah (I knew who she would end up with in old age, but didn't know whether they'd been together the whole time). However, the characters seemed unrealistic--they were too perfect, with practically no flaws (Allie's illustrious art career seemed particularly over-the-top), and their love was also unrealistic and too syrupy to me. The letters in it also seemed rather ludicrous--especially the ones written after their marriage, and those that explained events the reader needed to know about in a way no one would ever do in a real letter (i.e., &quot;you told me you and he went and sat on a bench,&quot; etc.). I am a firm believer in long-term, committed, marital love, in sickness and in health, etc., but I think the true triumph of love is loving the other person even though you can see their flaws and have to deal with them, not when you think they are divine in every way. I was also a bit annoyed by the sexual references and scenes...values and mores were different in 1932 (especially among 15-year-old society girls!) and birth control was not widely available...and it certainly added nothing to the story for me. I have to admit to feeling like the author could write a better book but knew this is what would sell. I'm sure it will appeal to anyone who liked The Bridges of Madison County or the love story in Titanic. To me, those stories and this book all elevate romance and gushy romantic feelings to a higher priority than they deserve. But it was still a pleasant enough diversion and I thought the Alzheimer's angle gave it an interesting twist."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a quick and very easy read. At first I found the characters to be very cliche, and the story to be unoriginal, but I got over that and found myself enjoying this book. Sure, it's not timeless literature, but in its own way, it does offer a powerful look at the extreme capacity for human love. I'd never read any book with characters like Noah and Allie - characters who loved eachother that much. It was a bit unreal, but for those who can suspend their disbelief for a few hours, it was entertaining and in some ways enlightening. I've read a lot of classic litereature, and still, I found this to be more than a simple, sappy, romance novel. Call me a fool, but it made me cry!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was told to read this book by my grandmother who said the book was written for my soulmate and I. We are both still young and have not come together yet because of circumstances beyond our control. This book made me believe that it will happen when the time is right. Anyone who believes true love prevails should read this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The story line was really good and I loved it alot. Nicolas Sparks really knows how to choose a good story. I loved the mystery in the begining and the resolution of the long sought over problem in the end... all around great."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Began reading this book on a family overnight camping trip-absolutely couldn't put it down. I read by the fire, inside my tent with a flashlight while my husband and kids told ghost stories, and then finished at 7:30 the next morning. Haven't cried this much in a long time. NOah and Allie had a truly remarkable love that any of us would be blessed to find...READ IT-it's great. I can't wait to share my copy!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Reading this book made me realize how much my husband and family mean to me. They are my life and without that kind of love &amp; warmth-your life is not complete. I thank Nichols Sparks for this book of love, hope &amp; joy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As I read this book I found myself lost in another time. I found myself looking at my husband with Allie's eyes. I have known since the day that we met when we were fifteen that I would love him forever. And oh how I wanted them to be together. I can only hope that when we grow old we will do it with such grace and love as they did. Anyone who has ever loved needs this book! It took my breath away!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"NICHOLAS SPARKS HAS PROVIDED A GREAT RANGE OF DISCUSSION TOPICS FOR OUR BOOKCLUB IN COUNTRY WESTERN AUSTRALIA TO TALK ABOUT. I THINK IT'S THE TYPE OF BOOK WHICH WILL ATTRACT A 'ROMANTIC' AUDIENCE WHO HAVE A DESIRE TO ATTAIN THE SIMPLEST, MOST BASIC OF BIRTH RITES - TO BE LOVED AND TO LOVE. IF ONLY LIFE WERE AS SIMPLE AS THIS, IF PEOPLE TOOK A LEAF OUT OF THE ALLIE AND NOAHS 'BOOK' THINGS IN OUR WORLD WOULD HOW THEY SHOULD BE - WITH LITTLE OR NO DIVORCE. I ENJOYED THE MESSAGES THEAT NICHOLAS SPARKS SENDS TO HIS READERS AND THE WAY HE CHOOSES TO SEND THEM - IN A SIMPLISTIC AND EASY TO READ MANNER. WELL DONE NICHOLAS."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book and loved so much, that I reccomeneded it to my mother - who does not have time to read - she absolutely loved it too and finished it within hours. I cannot tell enough people about it. All of my friends are waiting for their turns! Anybody with a heart - even a little one - will thoroughly enjoy &quot;The Notebook&quot;."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"it's the type of book where you can read in one night. It is hard to put down and once you're done reading it, you have to go back and read the last paragraph again. Sparks wrote such a beautiful book, one of the best writers of our time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this book! As soon as I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It was so realistic and probable. The beauty in the words that the man wrote sang to my heart. I've recommended this book - no, more like demanded- that all my friends read this book. It is now probably one of my favorite love stories."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The actual story was good, but was lacking in details. Would have liked more explanation on some issues. Not bad for his first novel. Will read the next one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The only thing that might top it is &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; just finished it and LOVED it too! Wish more writers could write like this but I haven't found one yet!!! Sparks catches you from the very beginning and just pulls you in from there on out until the end, which leaves you feeling AWESOME can't find the words to describe the feeling! You'll just have to read both and find out for yourself!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After hearing so many glowing reports of this book, I read it only to be disappointed. This book is a classic example of how excellent marketing can sell any product. The story is sophomoric and the writing is insulting to the reader."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I found the book an easy read. A true testiment to true love in the purest of means. Everytime I read this book(twice), I find new ways of falling in love with the characters."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this book. I saw the movie years ago and enjoyed the book even more. Nicholas Sparks is a flowing writer, it is so easy to be drawn deep within his stories and characters. I have read several of his books and am always sad to reach the end of the book and I miss his characters after I am done reading. I LOVE HIS WRITING."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've seen the movie about a 117 times and was not expecting to enjoy the book, but surprisingly I loved it. The details of their feelings for each other made me cry."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love this book! It is one of the best all time love stories ever! true love will never die!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My mother in law is legally blind, so she relies heavily on borrowed audio books. My husband and I loved this story so much that we had to find a way to share it with someone else. She just loved this beautiful story of unconditional love and devotion."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"All in all, The Notebook was a great love story and I would recommend it to any romantic. It's a perfect combination of love, suspense, and the will to work for what you want. It shows that true love really does exist and there is that perfect person waiting for you somewhere out there."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've yet to read a better love story. Nicholas Sparks transports you to a place in time where you become one of the characters. Having had a family member who suffered with Alzheimer's, this book really hit home!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was disappointed that the book was so different from the movie. I also felt that the movie portrayed their love and passion for one another in a much greater way than could ever be experienced through just reading this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Was not the cover shown, other than that the book will be fine. The book will serve it's purpose just fine."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm a person who usually loves a book more than the movie version, but in this case the movie was SO much better than the book. Unfortunately I watched the movie before the book so I was incredibly disappointed when I read this, it just didn't get into there past and how they fell in love enough for my liking. It's still a touching story, I just didn't enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"An amazing love story. Could not put the book down . It sucked you in and it was written beautifully"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought this book was very heartwarming, a great read for anyone looking for a quick read as well as a romantic tale..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This story shows that love and destiny are partners. Noah and Allison have what almost every woman dreams of and yearns for, genuine love. The book is a definite page turner, so make sure you have time to read the entire book once you begin!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This beautifully written story has touched my heart in ways none other has. The story of Allie and Noah reminds us how lucky we are to find and keep that one special love. I couldn't stop the flow of tears one hour after reading this story. It will make you think how vulnerable we are to illness and how we must follow our hearts to our destiny. I never thought I would love a story as much as Bridges of Madison County. This is a must have book to read over and over."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Read it to someone you love and fall in love again and again and again...."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a simple love story. A true tear jerker, I admit. I was crying so hard at the end I couldn't see the pages. This is not a book to be analyzed, (I agree with the others), it is just a book to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"left me with a great feeling which I cherish."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I kept thinking that I couldn't believe this romantic heartfelt story was written by a man. I did ponder Noah's manliness and Allie's womanliness. Fourteen years ???? But I kept with it to the bitter end and it was. If these two elderly people could have recognized each other, caressed and departed this life together spiritually it would have been a great culmination of two lives woven together. Instead, we have a nauseating picture of two elderly decrepit people in mind and body looking for sexual fulfillment. I guess love equals sex to Mr. Sparks and he is too young to understand the altruistic love and feelings that the elderly can possess. He's missed a lot. Corny ending. Maybe only the great know how to end a good story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is beautiful. I have just finished reading it for the second time, and am amazed at all the info I missed! The bond between Noah and Allie is amazing and shows the power of true love. I was more than satisfied with the development of characters and believe that Nicholas Sparks only wrote the information he felt needed to be shared. Sometimes you dont want the writer to tell the &quot;Whole Story&quot; because then you can think of your own details in your head. When the story takes a turn into the lives of the older characters I was sad to see that all they had shared was gone... yet in some supernatural way BOTH could remember it. This is definitley a classic Love story.. not a romance but a love story none the less. It is Beautiful, and you have to truly understand it to appreciate its deeper meaning. It is short, but sweet, and captures your attention immediatley. Read this book, and have tissues ready!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks' book is trite, predictable and completely one dementional. Granted, I love the idea of true love and its ability to survive in modern times, but I also read for enriching dialogue, convincing charaters, and original thoughts into matters that so many authors have already contemplated. This book just doesn't cut it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When I closed the book at the end of the page, my eyes were in tears. When my grandfather was suffering from Alzheimers, my father was telling me that it is a gift from a god to be able to go back to his childhood before his final day. I read this book in Japanese because the expression was so beautiful, and now I am trying it in English. It is also touching emotionally as it did in Japanese. Beautiful book! Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Great book! I would recommend it to anyone. It definitely grabs your heart strings! Very interesting! I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Every so often a love story so captures our hearts that it becomes more than a story-it becomes an experience to remember forever"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Fantastic story! I would read again. Nicholas Sparks is a great author! Sparks makes if Easy to read and understand!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas SparksGreat romantic book that keeps your interest. Very easy read in a short time.Would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Couldn't put it down.

I didn't particularly love it and found it a bit corny."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Some books you can't put down. Noah was an extraordinary man, one of a kind. Good good good good good."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book had a lot of promise and was well written. I was hooked and read through the first half in one afternoon, it was wonderful.Then the rest of the book just left me flat. I hated the old folks home story, and sickness and loss and gooey love letters. I understand what the author was getting at, but to me, the love story was their life, not trying to remember it.It just left me dissapointed and sad. I wanted more of their love story, that part seemed unfinished."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The movie was tons better. I didn't care too much for the ending in this book.The movie makes me cry. The book didn't. I was expecting to get a good cry from the book, and I didn't. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"So I remember several years ago when the movie came out, all I heard was how touching this story was and how you had to see The Notebook. So my husband and I rented and watched it and could only wonder what everyone was getting all hot and bothered over. The movie was terrible. However, in recent months, I wanted to read something I hadn't, and so I wondered if the book might be better than the horrible movie. Checked it out from the library and read it in 2 or 3 days. It was an easy read. Sparks is no Tolstoy or Fitzgerald, but who is? Okay so the reason I didn't give it fewer stars is because the love story part was mostly believable and slightly touching. I get it - no one compared to Allie for him, and he never stopped thinking about her. I understand her situation as well, being taken from someone you love and then always wondering about them. There were parts where I felt a bit emotional. BUT...I hated the love \\"scene\\" part and the ending. OH, how I hated the ending. Presumed geriatric sex in a home for gomers is not how I expected it to end, especially with her teetering precariously between reality and being out of her mind basically - that situation could go south really fast. I felt it reduced this great love of theirs to mere sexual attraction, which cheapened it in my mind. I was willing to call it a decent read...until I got to the end. Seriously that kind of ruined it for me.I would say this is a good beach book, but don't go into it expecting some awesome work of literature. You might cry, you might not. If you read the reviews and don't expect to much, you may be pleasantly surprised. But stop before you get to the end."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The first time I watched the movie I instantly fell in love with it, it wasn't until a year had gone by, until I heard that there was a book called THE NOTEBOOK and that the movie was based on the book, a day after hearing, I went to the store and bought the book. I knew it was going to be a great book, because the movie was great, and I enjoyed every second of it. I love THE NOTEBOOK both the book and the movie and I would suggest it to anyone. I would also like to suggest another book \\"THE FORBIDDEN TRUTH: The truth lies within\\" by Annayah, amazing book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A great love story if you want to wipe away a few tears this is the book for you. A great read recommended highly"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Once again, Nicholas sparks brings us a tale of love, friendship, and courage in the face of challenge. A great summer /beach read!! Grab a beach chair, this book, and a sweet tea; you will be set for hours!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I enjoyed the movie much more than the book. That said, I thought the book was just ok. I don't get what all the hype was about. It is a short book, but it fell short in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It is the first time I have purchased something like this from anyone. The book came with a thank you note and it was in excellent condition as promised. I was very pleased. I would not hesitate to do this again. My purchase was a first edition of Nicholas Sparks book \\"The Notebook\\".I had purchased this when if first came out. I had loaned it to several to read, then one person who took my book to read, left it in the back seat of her car and left her convertible top down. Yep. You guessed it. It rained so she discarded the book, promised she would buy me another and never did. I have always felt sad about this loss over the years and when the opportunity came up on Amazon to get a first edition, I was so pleased. I can lay that memory to rest now. Thanks Amazon for the opportunity to purchase a used book instead of one of your new ones. It is truly a good thing!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"ThreeI've now read three Novels by Nicholas Sparks, and all three have had me in tears, however, none quite as badly as The Notebook. Tears now stain the pages in my book, a permanent reminder of the feelings evoked by seemingly harmless words on a page.This is why I love reading! For anyone who has ever loved, truely loved, this is a must read!!This is a tale of young love, love lost, love found, love remembered, and heartwrenching decisions. True love that knows no boundaries and can overcome anything. My heart literally ached for Noah and Allie in this timeless love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Alrighty. So I just read The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks.Great concept, awesome movie, so obviously I went into it with high hopes.Well, my hopes were really let down.And maybe you like the book, that's totally ok. Nicholas Sparks is a great writer and we all have our opinions.Mine is this:As an author, Sparks left me wanting details in places and getting bored of it in others. At times the plot moved extremely fast. The most prominent for me was when Noah's father died. I mean good grief, the man got sick, said he was fine, and then died in two sentences. The man died of pneumonia, not exactly something that instantly kills you. I would know, I've had people close to me suffer and then die from it. Keywords being suffered. You don't just keel over. If he wasn't important enough to keep around for a chapter or two, don't introduce the character. (Personal pet peeve).Good points to it were that it was an incredibly beautiful, moving story of love and overcoming things for it. It's nice to see a more realistic view of love rather than a Disney movie. Don't get me wrong, I love Disney movies with a passion, but Princes and Princesses that get married after looking into each other's eyes don't live happily ever after. Ever.I really have nothing more to say on this book. As a writer I normally don't say this, but I don't recommend you read the book. Instead watch the movie, I liked it much better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book after I checked it out from a bookmobileI have read thousands of books in my life but this one tops them allI teach at an elementary school and after reading The Notebook I let several others read it tooEveryone agreed this book is oneeveryone should readThere are no wordsto express how wonderful this book isIt captures any reader of any ageLastly,I want to be loved like that"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down all night. I started it at ten and ended at 3AM I cried my eyes out. I also gave a copy of it to my best friend and she hated me for it because it made her miss her fiance who was out at sea even more. This definitely is something that everyone needs to read to remind them of what love is about."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"hi, i just wanted to let all you all know that i lived the book &quot;the notebook&quot; by nicholas my mom brought it home for me to read it and i thought it was going to be boring but it nded up GREAT. usually, truthfully i hate reading i never read i usually lie about what i read and just say i do it but i actually likes this book. i mean all through it i cried and laughed. i mean one day i read 130 pages of the book and the day after i read 90 pages and was finished (well i mean i read some at school but i REread some of it =) anywasy i think you SHOULD be this book cause its GREAT (i think womaen and female teenagers would engoy this book) i recommend this to everyone who likes a warm-hearted book (even 15 year olds ...lol)....amanda...15 years old =o)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I will always treasure this book as being one of my favorites. Noah was one of those special souls who searched his mind for detailed memories of a person so very special to him. He breathed for Allison until the very end, determined to know that she would die remembering who he was and nothing would set them apart."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is NOT the Great American Novel, but it is a touching story and a really good cry! Those looking for literature should know by looking at it that The Notebook isn't for them, but anyone looking for a great love story, this is for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I gave it a 9 because it was a little bit short, I wish it would have go into more detail. The story is a credible one, I lived something similar to what Noah lived, only she marry the other guy! It is very sensual and even erotic, without being vulgar or shameless. Very romantic. The second part is one of inspiration and devotion to true love and loyalty. It was recommended to me by a very romantic friend. I read it while I was away from home in Bosnia with the Army, mad at my wife, and it help me to assess my position as a husband and re-commit myself to my wife and being a better husband and lover. Not a book to be read with the mind, but with the heart. A re-born romantic"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in one sitting. I started crying around page 95, and didn't stop until about half an hour after I'd finished. It's like the author had all my buttons (true love, alzheimers, the South)lined up in a row and pushed them hard. Sure this book is schmaltzy, sure it's no great work of lit-rit-ture, but it is a great read if you want a good cry."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was one of the more enjoyable books I have read in a long time. Despite the sad storyline I found it inspirational that love two people could love one another so much."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"At the urging of my wife and best friend in the world, I picked this novel up. To say I couldn't put it down would be a gross understatement. After finishing the book (and a box of tissues) I found myself invigorated and with a new appreciation of the love that I have. I also felt a renewed passion to savor that love as fully as possible -- while our youth is still with us. I have no question that nearly everyone has either experienced a special relationship such as this -- or they have dreamt of it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I picked this book up on a whim and didn't put it down until I had finished it. I very much enjoyed it. It was a wonderfully written lifelong lovestory and very moving. Very accurate portrayal of Alzheimer's. I've had it a week and already lent it out twice."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this book in the airport in LA. I finished it as we pulled up to the gate in Atlanta. Perhaps the greatest love story ever told. I can't imagine writing a bad review about this book. And for those who did, you are missing something special in life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It is once in a great while that I find a book that moves me as much as The Notebook did. Being only 14 years old, I hope that someday I will have the type of love that Noah and Allie had and cherish someone as much as they cherished each other. The Notebook demonstrates the type of love we all wish to have in our own lives: pure, sweet and unconditional, with no strings attached. This book will touch your heart and bring tears to your eyes, but most of all it will show you that true love is real and can be found-- no matter how many years go by or how many miles apart you are. Your hearts will find each other."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the most beautiful, inspiring love story I have ever read. Allie and Noah bring to life, the kind of love we all dream exists. They make me believe in that love, and want to find my Noah in this world. We should all read this, and not be afraid to face the possibility of real and lasting love. This story ignites a new faith, and reminds us of what is important in life. I hope and pray that I will grow old and know the feeling Noah and Allie knew...that real love endures forever."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"While the love story in this book is beautiful, the story was so predictable that it was ultimately boring. Lucky for the reader the author limited the length. Please keep in mind that this comment comes from a reader who is very tired of the my-father-killed-my-puppy-when-I-was-ten-psycho-babble that dominates so many novels today. I like to read happy novels...I just didn't fnd any substance in this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"&quot;The Notebook&quot; is on par with &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;. The writing and plot is attrocious, complete sap. So, why couldn't I stop crying? I guess it has to do with my undying romantic tendencies. Romance is fanciful and not based in reality, and the characters are so far from reality they would have to book a flight back. This story would never happen in the real world. It's a quick read, enjoyable, but pretty fluffy. I liken it to cotton candy, it looks pretty but not a whole lot of substance."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Amazon.com asks for the content of the book, not the style in which it is written. Although the literature isn't strong, the story overpowers that and really pulls at the reader's heart. Noah will teach you how to love while Allie will bring out your secret carefree spirit. Once you get into the book, it's hard to put down. I recommend this book for anyone who is in for a great Story, not great writing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I enjoyed this book for showing us the history of their relationship. There wasn't much about their years in between. You only heard about how they got together and what happened to them in the twilight of their marriage. It doesn't go into details about what Noah did for a living or how their 4 year old died. What the book does relay to you, is that their love endured everything. Yes, you could call it sappy, but don't we all yearn for romance and passion that is so unconditional? It was a nice retreat for me to read this book. I did have one question, though- In the end, did they both die together? And like the Titanic movie, they were reunited in heaven as they were in their youth?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was the best love story I have ever read! When I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I have read it about 4 times now and could read it many more. I bawled when I read this book. This book talks about a love that everyone dreams about having. The story line was so well written, and I think Nicholas Sparks did a wonderful job at writing this fantastic book!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought this book was an excellent love story! A fast read that I read on an airplane while flying across the country. It captured my heart and that's what's important to me. I think most people would love this story!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"&quot;The Notebook&quot; is the most amazing love story I have ever read. I'm not usually one for those sappy love novels, but this one is quite different. It proves that true love can beat all odds, no matter what they are. It also gives a good insight to the aging process, and a very accurate account of Alzheimer's Disease. It was a very quick read. Once you start it, you won't be able to put it down until you have finished."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you loved the movie as much as I did, then you'll love the book too. It sounds silly, but The Notebook touched my heart like nothing ever before. I was immediately infatuated with this beautiful love story & its characters. Although the book reads a little differently from the movie, it is equally moving,& they complement each other beautifully. If you've seen the movie, the book offers a vivid, in-depth incite into the characters, period, & setting. The poetry & flow of the book is beautifully visual, inspiring, romantic, & passionate (but far from cheap/vulgar like some romance novels). If you've read the book, the movie is a vibrant & colorful portrayal of everything that romance & love should be. It makes us all (women & men) believe in a love that lasts forever, & furthermore, a love that remains forever young. Book or movie, everyone should read or see The Notebook at least once. In a nut shell, it is ... a breath of fresh air, hope-against-hope, Romeo & Juliet persevere, young-at-heart, crazy about you, can't live without, soul-mate inspiring, old-fashioned, fairytale meets reality, all-or-nothing, southern-style dramatic, semi-tragic, tear-jerking, do you believe in miracles, \\"our love can do anything\\" ... hopeless (or should I say hopeful) romance. Enjoy!! :)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"In the summer of their seventeenth year, Noah Calhoun and Allie Hamilton meet for the first time.

With two young people falling in love and separating and reuniting makes you believe in love. The chacacter in the book make it so real. When Noah and Allie met it was almost like \\"love at first sight\\" Noah knew this girl was too good to be true. She was everything he wanted and more. Rich, good personality, and educated. Noah was the total opposite. Didn't come from a wealthy family knew they had to make his money to have anything and never did anything with his education. That's what made them so special they were different from each other. As years past on and time goes without one another Allie meets another man and engages with him.

Until one day they had to leave each other. They hadn't seen or talked to each other for over ten years. Either of them couldn't stop thinking about each other. Noah wrote to her, but Allie's mother was keeping the letters from her. Allie got engaged to a lawyer named Lon. A few weeks before the wedding she found out where Noah lived and went there to tell him that she was engaged. She told Lon that she was going antique shopping but she also went to see Noah. When she arrived at Noah's he was very surprised to see her. Allie told him that she was engaged and Noah was a little disappointed because he still liked her. The two of them spent the evening together talking about what they have been doing the past ten years and when Allie was getting ready to leave he asked her to come back again tomorrow. So Allie came back the next day and Noah brought her on a kayak ride. It started to rain and they got soaked, so when they arrived back to Noah's he got her some dry clothes. They spent the whole night together when they both realized how much they loved each other. Allie's mother come the next day and told her that Lon had been calling her and she hadn't been answering. Allie had to decide between Lon and Noah and she told Noah that she was going to have to go because she was engaged to Lon. Allie changes her mind, and then goes back to Noah because she truly loved him. They get married, have a family, and grow old together. Allie was diagnosed with Alzheimer and they were no longer allowed to sleep in the same room. They spent everyday together though. Allie didn't remember that she was married to Noah, but they fell in love all over again.I really like this book because it is a love story. Love stories always catch my attention because they are really interesting and say what love and life is about. Nicholas Sparks is a great author. He always has his ways of writing the book so that you can't put it down. I like how he had Allie decide to marry Noah because I don't think I would have liked it as much if she married Lon. Since I like this book so much, there really isn't anything I disliked about it.Some people who would like this book, are people who like love stories. The Notebook is a really good love story. Also, people who like other Nicholas Sparks books would like this book because this is a lot like his other books. It is very hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I will be honest.

I loved the book but didn't care for the movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is one of my favorite stories. I truly recommend this book to the people that like romance and love stories. This story will make you cry and fall in love at the same time.

I would suggest people reading the book, and to see the movie opening June 25."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is the first novel I've read from Nicholas Sparks, but I'm sure won't be the last! The novel swept me away to a rural town in North Carolina and allowed me to learn a story of true love. The main characters, Noah and Allie, were unforgettable and realistic.

Especailly those who like love stories."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really enjoyed Nicholar Sparks' &quot;The Notebook.&quot; I liked how all the characters were developed very well. You could tell so much about Noah and Allie by just what Nicholas was commenting that they did. A few times in the book I had tears in my eyes. It was very touhcing. I most likely reccomend this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've never been one for romances - but I've got to tell you - this is an absolutely lovely one. I really liked how real it was. I have not read Nicholas Sparks work before, but I am going to start from his first book now. Also, I saw the preview of the movie &amp; I think they did an amazing job!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook has been called one of those classic love stories, and it is one.Most people find themselves rooting for Noah (the poor boy).Like most stories social class comes in the middle of their relationship. Allie's the rich girl. Who grew up with money and is expected to marry it. Noah's the working class small town boy who sweeps her off her feet. They spend one summer together, after which they lose touch. Well-wishing parents, misinterpreted feelings, and World war II keep them apart. Then certain circumstances calls for Allie to come back to New Bern, there she encounters Noah again.I think this was a good book you really feel the dilemma Allie's going through. Whether to do what her parents want for her or follow her heart. You also feel for Noah as he has to face losing her all over again. You'll like this book especially if your into romance novels."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"These days, true love is hard to find. I think that's what makes this story so special. I think it'll touch you no matter what your situation is or how old you are. It's an almost too perfect love adventure between two souls that connect to a piece of your heart and leaves you thinking about your own past experiences. One of the best books I've read in a while, it's a definite read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Normally I prefer books to movies because they offer more insight into the characters, their lives, and the story in general. But not this time. Sparks' books have a shallow, Lifetime Movie Network feel to me. Shocking twists, plot holes, one in a million happenings...just not realistic.However, the movie was absolutely wonderful. I saw it four times in the theater (normally a movie isn't worth $7.50 to me, but I love The Notebook and had to go see it with everyone!) and cried every time. The movie offers a more \\"realistic\\" and passionate view of Noah and Allie's love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Christina G. Miller Place, NYThe Notebook by Nicholas Sparks is a romantic tale of two lovers who don't want anyones love but each others. It's not that easy, though ..One thing I really enjoyed about this book is Noah and Allie's never ending love for each other. Throughout the years, each thinks that the other person has forgotten about the love they once had. When they meet again, though, they find that each is experiencing the same problems where no one's love measures up to the love they had years ago. It's hard to believe that you can really love someone that much that as soon as you meet that person again, it's just like things used to be.Another thing I enjoyed about this book is how most of it was a flashback, and the very end of the book is during present time. Noah and Allie's early love is summarized in the beginning and throughout the book. The majority of the book is then when Allie and Noah see each other again and fall in love for the second time. The very end reveals that it was all just Noah's journal telling the story and then fast forward's to present time.I did like the end, although I was sad that Allie was suffering from a devastating illness. Noah still stayed with her, though, when they both became old and gray. Beware: You might catch yourself with tears rolling down your cheeks as you read the end.I would strongly recommend this book. It has laughter, drama, and love all in the same story. If you enjoyed A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks you will especially enjoy The Notebook."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I definitely liked this book, The Notebook, by Nicholas Sparks.

The suspense and different conflicts that occurred, internal and external, made this book so interesting. The Notebook is also full of surprises, with such loveable characters.

I was spell bound for the first 3/4 of this book, and then it gripped my heart and wrenched it through the rest. I could actually feel the joy and sorrow, the love and loneliness, the elation and pain of Noah, the main character as he remains ever committed to the woman he loves, through her progressive mental deterioration with alzheimers disease.This book will wrench tears from your heart and even lead you to view your own life with greater introspection."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks is known for his talent of writing love novels that make you cry. This book fits that description. I would suggest the book if you like romantic love novels. If you dont this is defidently not the book for you. The ending is kind of confusing but is a book you will want to read over and over. Once you start it you really cant put it down. It has good twists that you wouldnt expect and it keeps you wondering what is going to happen. This novel makes you think about life and how it can change so quickly."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Recently my grandmother was diagnosed with lymphoma. I had read this book before and knew she would love this story! I asked her one day if she would like me to read to her and so I began reading this wonderfully written story to her.

Reading this book out loud and sharing it with my grandmother made a superb book even better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought the book yesterday and finished it... yesterday. It is, I repeat, the most beautiful love story I know, and also the most complete. I find it unfair to rate it as having no literature, or being the Harlequin kind of book. Nor do I think it has the Hollywood kind of love-conquers-all, very, very weak story you just don't buy. This is the story, not only of the beginnings of love, but of one of the possible endings it may have, and surely not the easiest one. This is how I want to be loved."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The best expression of the emotion of love I've come across.

In it is an excellent display of the power of the only emotion that matters the most in life-love. I know no author who has been able to better express love in such a unique way. The Notebook is like no other book I have ever read. Whenever I feel down and need spiritual uplifment I pick up my copy of the Notebook and it sure does its job. To me this book is very spiritual and touches the very soul of any serious romantic. I think it is a classic that derseves more praise than it has received. The story is timeless and transcends the limtations of time and space through its ability to lift the heart to the highest state of being possible. It is a must for those who love romance."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've read this book 3 times, and I still cried. Simple, sweet, heart-renderingly beautiful. A true love story.

I would give The Notebook 10 stars if possible."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After recommended by a co-worker, I watched the movie then read the book recently.

This timeless classic is all about true love, hardship, and the realization about how life isn't fair.\\"Remarkable, memorable, beautiful,\\" \\"A touching story,\\" and \\"The most romantic novel,\\" are just a few of the many other reviews of The Notebook.Falling in love at a young age is somewhat hard for people, but not for Noah and Allie. When Allie arrived to North Carolina for the summer, she is reunited with the man who stole her heart so many years before. Spending a few days with him helps her realize why she loved and him and why she left him. But Noah son finds out the hard way that when something comes back their not always for good. Allie returned with a surprise that Noah wasn't at al expecting. He always imagined they would grow old together, on the front porch, watching the sunset every night. Sometimes dreams, to fall madly in love, and have someone live me back, is demonstrated in this book.Love this strong is hard to find in real life, but you truly can fell the love from this story. Noah and Allie truly grasp the idea of love, longing, desperation, and devotion in this romantic novel.Nicholas Sparks has written many novels, most of which have been nominated for awards. The Notebook is followed by the sequel, The Wedding, which plays off the lived of Noah and Allie.I recommend this loving, heart wrenching book to anybody that wants to read a great love story. It can't get any better then this."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is my all time favorite novel. What an unbelieveable story. A book that should come with its own box of tissues. Nicholas Sparks did a wonderful job in writing this story and what makes it even better is that it's based on his grandparents.

Love can make anything happen and Allie comes back to Noah dispite evrything. True Love is stronger than everything.........."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"THE NOTEBOOK by Nicholas SparksThis man can write a good romance and keep you crying all the time you are reading. It is the story of a romance between two beautiful people and lasts until time stops.She was a famous painter; he was a dreamer and a poet, although he did not write poetry he read, remembered, quoted Whitman, and played the music that he grew up with on the guitar. What ever he did was poetry for her. Noah Calhoun was an on old man when this book begins. The story is told in vivid flashbacks of his life.He considered himself an average person who liked the snow, the trees from bare branches, through buds in the early spring until they leaved out and changed color in the fall, and water fast in a stream and calm in a lake and he loved loud electrical storm with plenty of rain and the quiet after a storm when the sun came out again.Norm liked setting in his rocking chair after a physical, hard, fulfilling day's work playing his favorite guitar tunes while the evening changed to twilight. He liked seeing the stars come out and his wife join him with tired eyes and various colors of paint smeared on her smock after a long session painting.The story does a flash-forward to Norm and Allie, his wife when she is beginning to suffer the effects of Alzheimer and Norm has his notebook, the story of Norm and his marriage to Allie. This notebook is too the story of Allie sometimes by her thoughts, letters and writings. Norm keeps it as a memory for them both. He reads it to her.If a reader can read this without tears, then they should not read for understanding the passions of human beings and what Alzheimer will do to the brain.FIN"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book didn't leave me crying, or even feeling attached to the characters, and I consider myself a fairly emotional and romantic person. The book was too short to really feel anything for the characters. Any true depth or believability I found myself feeling at times was always hindered by Spark's horrid writing style. I found myself cringing from time to time over the sentences and words he chose; it was that out of a pre-teen novel. The dialouge was all too contrived and unrealistic. I could see myself really enjoying this book if I were fourteen or younger, but for the older reader, just take it for what it is: a quick and easy read for the beach. Nothing you'll want to reread or cherish, but it's entertaining for a few hours."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in a few hours. I couldn't put it down. Although, some may say this is a predictable plot the book's real gift is the last fifty pages. It's Noah's enduring love for Allie past their &quot;perfect summer&quot; that makes you cry. Someone said they wanted more written on their past and that would be a mistake. Reading how Nicholas Sparks wrote how Allie and Noah were afer 40 years of marriage is what makes their love a rare and true love.I would NOT read this after a break-up or if you are yearning for someone."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The love is written in the most poetic manner.

I could have not been more wrong. Although the introduction is not the best, the rest of the book makes up for it. The love described in this book and the idea of Soul Mates was so unbelievablely well put together. I rooted for Noah the whole way and at times felt myself choking back some tears.

At that point I considered him one of my favorite authors and now that I have read another one of his fabulous books, I can say, without a doubt, that he is one of the best. I loved how the time frame was established and towards the end, it kept you hanging on what really happened.

I went to the library couldn't find message...bottle, but stumbled upon the notebook. The tears started in the first chapter and didn't ever end. It wrecked me for days. Turns out, my friend hadn't even read the darn thing. I told her it was a really funny, funny book and strongly advised her to take it to read on a plane. On the sob a lot meter, it ranks right up there with Love Story, An Affair to Remember, Magnificant Obsession and Beaches. Even now, the sweetness of this story brings a smile to my face.

Kudos to Sparks for writing a book with a plot that has been used many times before and actually receiving praise for it. I was extremely disappointed with the ending. The writing style was easy to read, but how it was set up in some parts made it confusing about who the author was referring to. I have not seen the movie but I heard good things about it.

The movie is one of my favorites of all-time.The movie and the book differ on a large number of details, some minute, some significant. And, in every case, I believe the movie opted for the better version of the story.It seemed like the movie expanded on key elements of the story more than the book, such as the significance of the notebook, Fin, Noah and Allie's courtship, the symbolism of the birds, the poetry, Noah's role at the elderly home and The Ending.The movie's ending created the ultimate love story, a magical story from beginning to end; the book's ending created a vaugue ending and no resolution for the reader. You end the book worrying about the couple, whereas you end the movie respecting their perfect and infinite love.All of these differences make you appreciate the movie's direction and you feel as if the book were really a rough draft and the movie became the final version.I read the book in three sittings over the course of two days.

The reason I chose it is that it supposedly implicated the Second World War, something that, I surmised, would add some interest for me, a curmudgeon who sneers at the world from his moral high horse.Alas! I don't think the author knew anything about World War II. Heck, that conflict doesn't play much of a role in the action anyhow. Basically the book is just a bunch of kissing and sunsets - until the end, where the two principals are a couple of horny octogenarians struggling to maintain their bond despite the ravages of Alzheimer's disease.This book is so sappy, and the leading man is such an uxorious schmuck, that I thought for a moment that \\"Nicholas Sparks\\" had to have been a pen name for a female author, as no writer with a pair could possibly have written this tripe.Alas.

The story isn't amazing enough to compensate for the novel's flat characters and lack of wit. The sentiments sometimes come across as so saccharine and hammy that the book starts to read as bad post-war emo fluff. Yes, emo.I read it because it was given to me by a friend who wants to borrow it afterwards. I'm sure she'll like it.This is not to knock on fans of The Notebook (hello, movie!).

Over summer break they share a love so deep that no one could ever rip them apart. Until one summer afternoon Allie leaves town for a reason only she knew. Noah was heart broken.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I already wrote one review advising people not to buy the book. The writing is bad, the characters are boring, the story is trite. It is the second-worst book I ever read. The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 is that the final segment was somewhat charming. I explained why. People then proceed to accuse my review of being not helpful. It's not supposed to help decide TO buy the book, but NOT TO buy the book. It's a bad book, trust me! Are only positive reviews helpful ones? Look and see how many others wrote the same thing I did! I'm trying to save you a few bucks here. If you MUST read it, check it out from the library. Don't spend money on this crap. You want to read some good southern literature - read Lee Smith, Pat Conroy, Fred Chappell, numerous others. Stay away from Nicholas Sparks.

Save your money and your time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What a waste of time. My wife and I just read The Notebook and were disappointed by almost every facet of it. Most of the dialogue was contrived and totally unreal. I don't care how romantic Noah is drawn up to be, no man speaks like that; unbelievable (in a bad way). One reviewer said the ending was creepy, and I would say that is putting it nicely. Another thing that was really stupid was that Sparks tries to give Allie virtue, yet she cheat's on her fianc&eacute; without remorse. Total character flaw, again unbelievable.Did I mention the writing was horrid? Sparks jumps between perspectives way to much. Third person is good, but he puts us in the mind of Allie and Noah in the same scene on more than one occasion. It surprises me Warner bought the rights in the first place. Not only that but the editor should be fired.I paid a mere 5.95 for the paperback and trust me that was too much."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't believe this guy's books are selling.

This could be an excerpt: &quot;A penny saved is a penny earned, actions speak louder than words, and all you need is love.&quot;This is a terrible book. But you know what, this guy may know that. I have a sneaking suspicion this guy is smart enough to know that his stuff has the literary content of a hooked on phonics brochure, but is able to make millions of people take him seriously while he laughs all the way to the bank.

Well, I couldn't find it at the library for nearly 2 months, so I read two other of his books first. They really let me down. He writes a corny love story to toy with your emotions to sell books. I felt like I was reading a story a Freshman in High School would write. After reading the Notebook I was again saddened at his lack of writing abilities. He writes plain, no depth or soul or passion can I find in his characters. Yes, they have sex, so he writes about their passion for each other, which is easy to do, but he did not write the characters themselves to come alive. I think the third time's the charm for me... I will not read any more of his books. They are not getting any better for me, and I dearly love a good book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"i just finished reading this book and i must say that the author should have done some research before publishing this piece. it is not well written at all and it seemed that every character was the same. i mean they all liked each other deep down and there was very little conflict. he stopped \\"reading\\" the notebook when it got to something that could even be construed as interesting. also what kind of love scene was that? and all the sexual stuff leading to that seems very implausible.as far as Noah goes how can a man cut wood for 20 minutes without breaking a sweat? and as far as depth goes he's as flat as characters come. i mean he reads poetry but doesn't understand what it means, but he is able to read poets like Eliot that require a PhD in order to fully comprehend. i seriously doubt that someone would read poetry from masters in the craft for 80 years and still have no idea what they mean.Mr. Sparks, while he's making more money off his writing than i ever will, should think about editing his work and making it more concise.. as well as doing some research before publishing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I do not like Sparks' writing style but the way he puts the last sequence of the book about Allie and her husband's love at old age was so... well beautiful. It can easily be compared to Nancy and Ronald Reagan. Getting old is expensive when it is a loved one you are losing. I hate most of the book but the last few pages are timeless."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Alternate titles could be: \\"Spoiled Girl Can't Find a Stamp\\" or \\"Love Cures All\\". I've heard a lot about this movie since it came out on DVD, but I have mixed feelings about the book.I was crying toward the end, but don't let that sway you; I cry over commercials too. The book kept me interested in spite of the fairly predictable plot, but then I mostly stuck with it hoping for and expecting something more imaginative.Unfortunately, I feel that Nicholas Sparks is a pretty poor writer. I caught myself doing a mental edit as I read, thinking as I went, \\"Wouldn't it have been much more interesting if he had only written it this way...\\" It reminded me of the writing in the Harlequin Romances I read when I was twelve. I wonder how Sparks manages to get published and get movie deals when none of thousands of similar books get any attention.My copy included a \\"reading group guide\\", and I had to laugh at Sparks' response when asked about the appeal of this novel. He believes the \\"short length was appealing to many people.\\" It did only take me a few hours to read it, but I have to wonder what Sparks feels about the reading abilities and attention spans of his readers. I'm just grateful I didn't waste more time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Someone hold out a hefty bag for me to vomit in. Now, dont get me wrong, i love a good romance novel, love a well put together story full of historical content, good descriptions and believable dialogue this book has none of that. A lake full of freaking white birds? kissing in the rain? True love being divided by class lines/war/Fiancees? UNORIGINAL AND SAPPY. What kills me is that people rave about it. Save your time (although it took me all of an hour to get through this 5th grade prose) and read a real romantic novel like \\"the bronze horseman\\" if you want all the themes but no drippy assuming crappola."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Honestly, do we need another book where you don't actually have to read anything because you already know what's going to happen? While reading The Notebook, I felt like I could have written every single word in ever single sentence. I asked some girls from my work what they thought about it and they loved it. It is a feel good novel that makes you wish everything was so perfect all the time, but get real. I guess there is something to say for love stories and happy endings, they never happen, but it's fun to pretend. If this is your thing, go for it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A truly great love story should be about real people with real faults and real warts. Sparks writes his story about handsome Noah who reads poetry, works incredibly hard, communes with natures, and loves intensely and steadfastly. Allie is incredibly beautiful and soulful (or so we are told, although we are shown no evidence of it) and a tremedously talented artist. The first half of the book is told with all the depth of a fairy tale. What isn't fairy tale is cliche. There's even a scene where they are caught in the rain and he can't help but notice her erect nipples protruding against her wet dress. The second half becomes slighter better, but is marred by the same lack of reality. Allie is still perfect, even in her old age and disease. Her memory is her only deficit. There is no real substance here, just lovely fluffy cotton candy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Cripts. First The Bridges of Madison County, one of the most boring stories ever, then Message in a Bottle, and now This. YUCK! You know, is it the fact that a man has crossed over to the romance genre such a novelty that people will buy the book no matter how stupid it is? I guess this proves the answer is YES."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Terrible. Predictable. Intelligence insulting. Though true love can last a lifetime, teenaged passion cannot. And true love can not cure Alzheimer's - even in romantic fiction the premise is unbelievable. This book goes into the \\"Hours of My Life I Will Never Get Back\\" pile."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a poignat tale of love. While some say that the story lacks real characters, these people need to understand that the story's focus is not in characterization.The Notebook is more like a fairy tale, a tale so sweet and heart-wrenching. It is the tale of enduring love, of undying devotion, of tender memories. Each word, each sentence should be read with carefullness and intense concentration- only then can you fully understand the tenderness of the story. It's not a classic, it wasn't meant to be. It's not a 1000 page novel, it wasn't meant to be that, either. It's a simple, yet somehow complicated, tale of the romantic Noah's love for Alli. And it's a haunting tale of the love we all hope to have. It will make you listen to your heart, follow your dreams, and want to feel love like that. But, if you're not a hopeless romantic, you probably won't appreciate the book in the same way. If you are, however, get those tissues ready!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After seeing the movie and finding it rather enjoyable...I thought- &quot;I should read the book&quot;...because I always love see a movie, like it and then read the book and find the book is even better... Sadly- this was so not the case in &quot;The Notebook&quot;... The writing reminded me of girls in High School who fancied themselves good writers...very flat decriptions, everyone was just perfect (in their younger days -at least)..and people used characters full names out of nowhere- which no one does in real life! (p. 44 &quot;You're still a poet Noah Taylor Calhoun.&quot;)-... I felt nothing of the story...felt nothing for these people...I didn't even really feel that Noah and Allie really loved each other all that much except that they kept saying it over and over...Sparks never wrote anything that made me feel it. And while I enjoy my movies- I love a good book more than anything- and after seeing how great the character Allie was in the movie- I was looking forward to reading it in the book... It was all a very disappointing ordeal...and the end made me throw up in my mouth a little... sorry, but it did. I just wish I could get back the hours I wasted on this book..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What a disasterous novel!Sparks is a romance novelist at the most, but somehow a twist of fate not only netted him tons of dollars of sappy movie earnings but also boosted his status to a serious writer. While the movies are tolerable and even touching at moments, the books, however, are a manifestion of juvenile use of figurative language nested in badly-formed sentences that simply don't flow together."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As a man, I'm somewhat embarrased to admit I read this book. But my wife read it and liked it and since it is so short (hardly worthy of being a novel), I thought I'd read it.The first three fourths of the book is your plain old generic plot. A woman (Allie) is in love (Lon) but used to love another man named Noah. She sees Noah again a few weeks before her wedding after not seeing him for 14 years and suddenly has doubts about her relationship with Noah.The Notebook, like so many other love stories of this ilk, ignores the man who is scorned. Allie spent one summer with Noah when she was 15. She dated Lon for 4 years and said yes when he proposed. Reading this story, I wondered how shallow Allie was to date a man for 4 years then dump him so easily.The above is my complaint about the Notebook as a man. Being objective, this book was still horrible. Inserting lines from famous poets doesn't make a man romantic. Also, this book is full of Allie and Noah telling each other how much they love each other. Sparks told us how much they loved each other, instead of showing. I wish they scene where Allie makes her choice would have been written.It gets repetitive and boring. Also, nothing really happens in this book. The jacket description is really decpetive because it implies some sort of climax or twist at the end, istead of more poetry describing love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Actually I read The Notebook in 1998 but wasn't actively writing reviews at that time. Recently I read it again and decided it was better late than never. When I read a great story, I can't resist the opportunity to say great things about it. And this book most definitely falls into my top ten category of the best books I've ever read. Although it is fiction, the story is based on the author's wife's grandparents who were married 60 years and passed away a few years before he wrote the novel. I liken it in some ways with the non-fiction best seller, Tuesdays With Morrie. Not for the content but for the wise lessons that we all can learn from the elderly. Nicholas Sparks illustrates beautifully that love does not end in the winter of our years but can even be more complete, more passionate and unconditional among two people no matter what age. The story cleverly begins in the first person with Noah, already well up in years, talking about his daily humdrum routine in the nursing home. It is sad because from what we read, we can tell that his days are numbered. The next segment written in third person takes us back to Noah's younger years and explain the ironies of how he and Allie, his childhood sweetheart, are reunited after 14 years of separation. Allie is engaged to a successful young lawyer and reasonably happy about the situation but often thinks of her old flame Noah and decides to visit him one day apparently for the purpose of closure. But when they meet again, they both discover it is just like the first time. She has some hard decisions to make and the author has us believe during this segment of the book that she decides to marry the lawyer after a very touching parting scene between Allie and Noah. The final segment takes us back to the nursing home again where we learn that Allie has become a victim of Alzheimers. At the same time, Noah (confined in the same facility) is riddled with crippling arthritus, has heart problems and many of the other typical afflictions the elderly face. We learn that they indeed did marry after all and had a happy marriage for 49 years, along with raising 4 children. When Allie learned she was in the early stages of Alzheimers, she wrote a poignant letter to Noah (the first of the 3 hankies you will need), which he reads again and again to help him feel close to her true person. As her disease progresses she no longer recognizes Noah. He befriends her in the home and it appears at times she has rekindled her love for him but there are also the bad days when she lashes out at him and tells him to go away. Noah doesn't give up and faithfully visits her every day. He has a stroke (get out 2nd hankie) that sets him back for quite a while where he doesn't see his wife. Finally when he is able to walk (just barely) he is determined to see his beloved Allie and slips into her room where he can see she is slipping rapidly. However, by some miracle the sparks of recognition begin after he lies by her side and embraces her. Subsequently she re-enacts a love scene that occurred between them over 49 years before. Absolutely beautiful and time to get out that last hankie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"How did I wind up spending two hours of my life reading this book? Well, I was out of movie ideas for the weekend, and since I'd never seen The Notebook, one of my friends suggested I rent it. BUT I felt bad about watching the movie without reading the book, as, for some reason, I have a personal rule about not doing that. Now that I've read the book, however, I can tell you I will probably not be watching its film counterpart anytime soon.I know a lot of people like, even obsessively love, THE NOTEBOOK by Nicholas Sparks, bestselling author who seems to have a goal of getting all his books made into movies. But I'm not one of them. I've been told that not weeping over this sentimental, plotless non-story makes me heartless. I think it makes me someone with enough heart to know a real romance when I see one, and Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson are no Mr. Darcy and Lizzie Bennett. Nor a Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. Nor [insert romantic couple here]. They are one-dimensional fantasy people, possibly the two most obvious Mary Sues I've ever read. Noah does not even appear human, but a robot programmed to spew mushy dialogue in a never-ending stream. I mean, I'm a girl just like any other, and I would laugh hysterically if someone told me that our \\"souls [were] connected\\" or canoed me out in a storm to see a freak gathering of white birds. Where did Nicholas Sparks get the notion that this was romantic? In fact, half the time I was reading this book, I was laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it all.There was also little to no plot in this book. I was expecting a sweeping adventure romance. But really, nothing happens. Unless you think someone telling someone else how much they love them, in the purplest prose imaginable, for about a hundred pages, an interesting story, in which case The Notebook might just be the right book for you.I realize I'm being harsh, but I am dumbfounded that this book, actually that this author in general, has risen to such popularity and success. I was going to give this one star, but for all its flaws, I actually enjoyed one thing about this book: Morris Goldman. Yes, the tiny background character who only appears for a second or two. I found him amusing at least. I wish Mr. Sparks had written more about Morris Goldman."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Hands down, this is the worst romantic novel I've ever read. The narrative was stiff, unnatural, almost painful to read. The dialog was at times unbelievable, at times simply awful. The plot was poorly developed and the characters, especially the female lead, were ridiculous. There was nothing even remotely romantic even in the romantic moments! In contrast, the movie, which I saw a few days after reading the book, was very nice."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After reading a walk to remember i picked up the notebook expecting it to be like AWTR or at least close to it...well it's the furthest thing from it that i can't understand what this praise is all about! i didn't laugh,i didn't cry i just kept flipping the pages waiting for something exciting to happen but it never did. The two stars i give are for the first two chapters only because they really got me into the book but it wasn't obvious then that the rest of the book is so dull! The idea of the story is beautiful but the way it was written is so awful that i couldn't believe it was written by Nicholas Sparks.The book is so unrealistic in many ways..i mean what kind of mother is allie's mother? how comes she was so calm and understanding when she found her daughter with a man a few weeks before her wedding to another one??!!!and how can reading some memories to an Alzeheimer patient treat her???? Moreover the characters are so undeveloped and they're so dead that you find it hard to sympathise with them despite all their diseases and suffering! Bottom line read a walk to remember instead because it's reall about love not fantasy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you have seen the movie The Notebook and are interested in reading the book, don't waste your time. The book leaves out any character development and leaves you with two-dimensional personalities that are too flat to connect with. It's a quick and easy read, and I admit once you start you want to finish, but only in hope that something surprising or interesting may happen. Expecting the same ending as the movie, I was extremely upset when I finally finished the book. It was quite a disappointment. I'm not too cynical to appreciate the theme of true, enduring love, but it is insulting that Sparks would expect his readers to buy into the sappy and unrealistic story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A friend gave me this book to read on a plane. he loved it and it made him cry. I was excited to give it a try. The worst book I have ever, ever read in my life. The writing style (lexicon used, vocabulary, etc) is so poor, that a 9 year elementary school student can write with more imagination. What a miserable prose... The plot is weak, the characters (that are flawlessly perfect in every way) are flat, 2 dimensional, no development. The story is not credible to begin with. The writing is repetitive, the author has no imaginative ideas, in addition he makes factual mistakes (in 1946 his Noah is wearing jeans like James Dean, but in fact, these pants werent even called jeans at that time, nor they were in fashion). Someone who reads Nabokov, Umberto Eco, Markos Garcia, Marcel Proust-- never should touch books by Sparks. It is a shame, I cant believe that some people actually rate it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"THIS BOOK GIVES ME HOPE THAT I, TOO, COULD WRITE A BEST SELLER.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm a male reader who reads and enjoys romance. With much interest did I pick this book, only to disappointed. This book belongs to the garbage heap along with Waller, folks. The story is most contrived and shallow. There is (a) no chemistry between hero and heroine, (b) no humour, (c) contrived dialogues reminiscent of a grade three essay book, (d) flat descriptions of people, (e) mawkish melodrama being passed off as poignant drama. Take my advice, ignore the other '10' reviews and get this from a library instead."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I cried my eyes out. What a story. I am thrilled that one can speak so honestly of love. A lesson in patience and understanding. beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What is it with you people? After reading the reviews on this site, I can't believe that so many of you thought it was the best book you'd ever read! Have you never read The Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden or anything by Faulkner? The Notebook will not stand the test of time, but will, ironically, make lots of money and be a blockbuster film starring Meryl Street and Clint Eastwood (they'll just move over from Bridges of Madison COunty). This novel looked interesting to me, because my father just died and he and my mother had a long, successful, happy marriage and she misses him terribly. But I found Sparks' writing to be affected, his characters thin, and the story full of empty holes and absolutely unrealistic. Anyone who has been in a long relationship or marriage knows the difficulties that can unfold. Romantic, passionate lust happens to all of us, but you don't just marry someone and spend an idyllic wonderful life based on a few days of romping in the hay...or if you do, you usually find out that you've made a terrible mistake. Allie and Noah didn't even know each other!!! And furthermore, a lot happens to you in fourteen years, between your early twenties and thirties. Anyway, I found the whole thing unrealistic. Perhaps reading this kind of trash is what makes so many marriages and relationships impossible...people expect it to be like these stories and they inevitably are not. How many times have I seen women standing in line for a movie like Bridges with their uncomfortable looking I'd-rather-be-anaywhere-but here dutiful guys? Get real, people! Read a good story, full of character depth and complexity. I know that my book club will not read this novel"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"this book made me late to work because I stayed up too late in order to read it"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I had never read a Nicholas Sparks novel prior to The Notebook. After watching the movie (and enjoying it immensely) I felt I owed it to the source material, as well as myself, to give the novel a read. I so wanted to enjoy this book. After all, I'm a sucker for romance.What can be said about this book that isn't negative. Weakly realized, poorly written, and ridden with sentimentality I can only marvel at its popularity. It was nearly impossible to look past the drab and commonplace prose and the author's overwhelming propensity for sappy inner dialogue.I'm certain that I'm in the minority here. Nicholas Sparks clearly has a devoted following. For me, however, it was unsatisfying to say the least."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"While reading this book, I felt as though it had been written for a second-grader. The sentences and words were short and sparse. The faults of the writing style are not the only problems, however; the storyline is melodramatic and sappy, and the author clearly didn't do sufficient research on Alzheimer's. The story is very predictable (and also appears in many other books by Sparks). The only good thing I have to say is that at least the book is a little less sappy than the movie. If you enjoy reading books with substance and style, this is NOT for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was my first Sparks book and I really enjoyed it. I read it in one night. I find it funny that there are so many Sparks bashers out there when the truth is he is a wonderful storyteller. For myself, not every book has to win the Pulitzer Prize to be enjoyable and Sparks is at the top of my list when I just want to read a great, uncomplicated book. LOVE IT!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you are looking for a good romance novel, I recommend everyone to read The Notebook. The Notebook shows good relationship between the two people in love, and shows the difficulties that the two main characters had dealt with. This novel \\"proves that good things come in small packages; a classic story of love found, lost and regained.\\" I can relate to this novel really well because my parents had a similar experience. My parents suffered through lost, however, many years later they found each other and now they live happily ever after. This book really shows how much the two love each other. As I read the book, I can visualize myself as the main character, and visualizing myself in the scenes. This novel gives me a chance to treasure every bit of life, and to cherish the love I have for my family, friends, and other love ones. This novel is a good example of faith. Reading this book makes you wonder about your own relationship. It gives you the trust and confidence to love. It was really touching and any girl would love to have someone love them the way he loved her. It is true love because he still felt the same about her even when they were really old. \\"The lyrical beauty of this touching love story will captivate the heart of every reader. . .\\" (Rocky Mountain News) I adore this book and I suggest anyone who is looking for a romance novel to read The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Yes, I think the actual story is amazing and wonderful and did make me teary eyed. However, the reason i'm only giving it 3.5 stars is because I felt that nearing the end, it read like a hallmark card. I thought that the dialogue between the characters were unrealistic and had me rolling my eyes at how cheesy it actually sounded. If you at least sort of liked this book, I would highly recommend the movie!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I absolutely loved this book and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who enjoys a really sweet, touching romantic story. I remember when I was finishing it up in the car on the way to work with my dad one morning last summer. I started crying hysterically over the end of it and I didn't have any tissues! My dad didn't know what I was reading so he thought I had gone crazy or something :) You just HAVE to read this book :)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"LOVED this book.

Anyone could fall in love with this American love story"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It's difficult to talk about the content of the book without giving away the plot. On a broad view, it's a love story, but not in a sweet, sappy, happily ever after sense. The realism is fantastic- so much so, that I read it from start to finish in one night- I just couldn't put it down. The book has a slow start as you're introduced to the characters, but once the plot takes off, it draws you into the lives of the people that you're reading about. That's really all that I can say without giving away the story, but I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good story to curl up with on a rainy day. Definitely 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This isn't a great book. Heck, this isn't even a great romance novel. If you're looking for a quick, predictable, emotional little romance, this is the book for you. The ending was just too sappy for me but a lot of people like that kind of thing. I finished it in roughly two hours so it's perfect for a summer afternoon at the beach but not one to treasure."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.

The Notebook, by Nicholas Sparks, is undoubtedly a book I will never forget for the rest of my life. It's a love story, but so much more than that. This book goes beyond when they were young and first in love... it deals with the aftermath, what happens to the couple, and the painful reality of Alzheimer's. It is by far the saddest book I have ever read, but it is also the most romantic and beautiful and... I can't even explain.Just read it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Very sweet! This is a very quick and easy read. I actually cried during parts of this book. How often do you find a book that actually makes you cry or laugh out loud? It is very rare for me to experience that kind of emotion while reading a book. I highly recommend reading this book.

The world would be a much better place if they did."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was a very good book and I really enjoyed it. The book kept me interested, I couldn't put it down, and it was very moving. The Notebook is the kind of book that touches many people. I know almost every girl dreams about finding the perfect man and falling in love. This book makes it seem possible.At the beginning the book was kind of slow. It just tells about the life of Noah and the back round information. The information in necessary though. You need to know because it tells about the wonderful love story of two teenagers one summer. Once I heard about the main part of the book and heard about the summer Noah and Allie fell in love, I got hooked. That is what made the book appealing. I am a teenager and love stories are the kind of thing that most teenage girls like to read about. It is what teenagers dream about.I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Just remember that the beginning came get boring at times but it becomes better, much better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in one day. I just had to find out what happened to Noah and Allie. This is the first book to ever make me cry.

This is Nicholas Sparks' greatest book!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Having a grandmother with Alzheimer's, I was deeply touched to discover the love story that unfolds in this work. I now have a perspective I might otherwise have never gotten on what it must be like to love someone and watch them waste away. And, over that, the tremendous love story of their whole lives before that makes the book very rich and quite unforgettable. I have given my copy to friends to borrow and read. I typically only read non-fiction; this restored my interest in a good fiction novel!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Such passion,unrelenting devotion,and sweetness in the face of cold hard tragedy--life is always tragic eventually. I see people in the rehab hospital like that--spouses carrying little sacks of special things to their darlings. No wonder THE NOTEBOOK is popular. And I have loved like that. How comforting, how inspiring to listen to the story of another's complete love for a spouse who for one reason or another is losing time.Jane Riley, author of SOLOMON'S PORCH, THE STORY OF BEN AND ROSE"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this story! Their hearts were seperated by time and distance. Then several years later, they meet again. Has their loved faded, or Is that old flame still there? Read it and find out. It was interesting to see how our decisions we make, can change our lives, and the lives of those around us. This is a tear jerker, but it also makes you smile. It's important to recognize, how precious love is and savor every moment."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Wow, 800 reviews! This is a very compelling book. It's my favorite book of all time. It shows true love in it's fullest. I suggest anyone who is considering this book, thats you should just buy it. I promise you it will affect your life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a book I read at a trying time in my life. It was a novel with heart and emotion that bring tears to your eyes. I absolutely loved this book and would recomend it to everyone who wants to feel true love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks beautifully captures what we all long for -- a relationship so complete that it spans everything -- time, sickness, distance. He truly makes us see what a special, powerful, and eternal gift love is. This story is touching and is a great read on a lazy summer Sunday, lying in a hammock under a tree with a cool glass of sweet tea nearby."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A book that proves love endures time. A real page turner. Sparks brings tears of saddness and happiness. It's beautiful!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My older sister gave me the book to read saying that &quot;it's a very good book&quot;. Once I started to read this book, I couldn't put it down. It was so magnificant and it gave me chills. The love felt between Noah and Allie was and still is rare. The love was sooo strong and I must say that I am jealous. It's the kind of love story I want to have. They lost each other and found each other again. I started it the other night and finished it today. I cried. I keep thinking about it in my head. I just wanna read it over and over again. It would make a great movie and I would LOVE to play Allie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was walking through a bookstore and found this book. For some reaon the title caught my eye. I opened it up and began to read the first chapter to see if it flowed well. In a few moments I was done with the first chapter and knew I had to have the book. I finished the book the next day. It is a story of great and undying love. Have you ever had a love that was so intense you never forot about it and it haunted you? The book will keep you in suspense the whole time wondering what happened to the young lovers and if they will meet again. I definitely recommend this book. Remember to have a box of tissue around because it is definitely a tear jerker."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought this was one of the most over-written, overwrought books I've read in some time. Talk about saccharin-sweet! Yuck! I will give the author some credit for his description of living with someone with Alzheimer's. That was about the only credible part, in my opinion. I was glad this was a short book; otherwise, I would have flung it into a far corner with a foul oath!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A boy and a girl meet when they are in high school and experience a summer of bliss. Then she leaves town. He writes but she never writes back.Fast forward to their late twenties. He has returned home after a war, restored a house, is conveniently single and his life is going nowhere. So guess what? She shows up out of the blue, but she's about to marry the perfect man. After a couple of heavy \\"will they or won't they\\" scenes, they start making out like bunnies. So the groom comes to town and .... abdicates!Fast forward another 40 or 50 years to a nursing home where the happily married couple is living out their dotage. She is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's. But at the end of a day of poetry reading and ardent wooing he induces her to become lucid enough to recognize him. And guess what? They ... (But then I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise ending!)What is it that attracts them to each other? Is it just good sex? If this is just another whirlwind romance, what has kept the marriage together for all those years when so many other marriages ended in divorce? The only answer offered by the author is ... good sex.This is a story about enduring sexual attraction; nothing more. The main characters are one dimensional, at best. I would suggest renting the movie because it would be quicker and cheaper, but I found it too painful to watch."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am not a romance reader in the best of situations, but I do enjoy a frothy, epic tale of love from time to time, and, when I saw a paperback copy of this novel sitting in the book rack at my hotel's pool when I was on vacation, I thought I'd try it, for a little brainless, \\"guilty-pleasure\\" entertainment. I mean, Sparks has sold millions of books, it must be at least fun, right?Wrong. This book isn't even worth making fun of. The dialogue was bland, the characters ridiculous, the editing sloppy. The phrase \\"laughed under his breath\\" was used no less than 6 times over the course of 10 pages. Without getting into the logistics of exactly how one WOULD laugh under one's breath, cannot Mr. Sparks have his characters laugh in some other fashion between banal banter? I suppose not.But my biggest complaint is this: these characters supposedly have an all-surpassing love; however, their \\"epic romance\\" is summarized in the most insipid of terms in about three pages of description. No dialogue, no interesting character details, no foiables or intrigue. Just a summary of \\"what we did this summer\\". Which makes it VERY hard to understand this \\"love\\" and why the heroine would come and find her love FOURTEEN YEARS later (not before, mind you!) - the reader has absolutely no idea WHY she does this. I am all for brevity, if a writer can pull it off - but Nicholas Sparks certainly doesn't.If you are looking for a fun, brainless vacation read, this isn't it. This is the literary equivelent of a coma."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As teenagers, Noah and Allie fell in love, but at the end of the summer, they went their separate ways. Two weeks before Allie was to be married, Allie went to see Noah and the flame was re-kindled.After spending some time together, Allie knew she had to decide between her fianc&eacute; and Noah. Her mother, who had tried to stop their teenage romance, told her to be careful, and to make the right decision. She knew she that Noah was the one that she really loved and decided to marry him. After their long life together, they ended up in a convalescent home because they found out that Allie had Alzheimer's. They both wrote down their memories and put them in a notebook, which he read to her daily for the rest of their lives. They died together while sleeping. This book was very realistic and romantic.I liked the book because Allie and Noah really seemed to love each other. When Allie had to decide on Noah instead of her fianc&eacute;, you could feel the pressure and tension she was going through.I also enjoyed the way Sparks described the characters. He made you feel like you knew them personally and they became real. When he wrote about Alley's green eyes and her blond hair, it seemed like she was in front of you.Even though I was not happy with the ending, I understood that the ending had to have the couple die together. This was simply because one couldn't go on without the other. So, he had them die together, as one.I would recommend this book to people wanting to read a good, realistic story about two people in love.J.L."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have never given a bad review before. I always try to find some good in everything I read. I usually succeed. The Notebook is no different.The good points: it was very easy to read. the author didn't ramble or put in unnecessary description or \\"show off\\". Other than these things though, there is not much good to say.When you are reading a good book, a really good book, you can literally *feel* that the author loves the characters. You can tell that he or she poured everything they could into them. The emotions are real. The dialogue is real. It's all real, and knowing how much the author loves the characters makes you love them too.With The Notebook, I did not feel that Nicholas Sparks loved his characters at all. They seemed like cut out pictures from a magazine that he glued on a page, like he was yawning and bored as he wrote. Glossy and unrealistic with no substance to them. There was no emotion. If there was, it was slapped in there with no substance to back it up (oftentimes, no legitiment reason either). I know nothing about these characters after reading. Absolutely nothing. They are not real to me at all. They were cliches, but even *cliches* don't have to be a problem if you can give them some substance and purpose. These characters didn't even have that.After awhile, I could barely read anymore because I just felt *nothing*. I can't imagine how this book moved some people to tears.Now, hey, don't get me wrong. I watched the movie of The Notebook, and I did cry. It was very good. The characters were actually real.But the book seemed like the unedited movie version or something. The script that the writers tossed out.I don't suggest reading this book. I'm sorry, but it was just completely flat. There was hardly anything to it. It read like a boring lecture. Barely any description. It was choppy and dull. And I just don't see how anyone could enjoy reading this. I really don't. . . Watch the movie. But don't waste your time with the book. Luckily I got this free with a giftcard I received for Christmas. Because if I had paid actual money, I would be very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book has a decent plot line,however the characters aren't as well developed as they should be, which makes it difficult to connect with the story. The awful prose is was so trite and dull it was painful to my eyes. But I had an eight hour flight so I finished it out of boredom. The ending wash rushed and should have been more focused and detailed. If you like \\"literary\\" literature, ie excellent prose and style, you will not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The novel The Notebook is absolutely breathtaking. The Notebook is certainly not your average romance novel, and it is much more complex and realistic than any love story I've ever read, as it truly brought tears to my eyes. Every part of the story was either amazing in how sweet the character's gestures towards one another were or heart-wrenching at some of the painful decisions they had to make and things they had to go through. I've never seen a more incredible picture painted of two people that were so truly, deeply in love.As the plot of the novel moved slowly forward, I found myself savoring each sensory detail that was portrayed in every activity Noah and Allie did together. It was just amazing to me how Noah and Allie's love seemed to fly off the pages of the book and become something real, a part of me.I felt that although I haven't been in love like that quite yet, I could relate to how Noah and Allie felt about the different problems they had to go through. I felt m heart breaking as Allie had to make her decision of if she was going to marry Lon, who her parents loved, or Noah, her true love that her parents did not approve of. I mistakened their frustration for my own when they couldn't be together.When Noah and Allie's teenage love story ends abruptly and I was flashed forwards to an elderly man telling the story of his unstoppable passion for his wife who has Alzheimer's Disease, it all clicked that the elderly couple is Noah and Allie far into their future together, their love still gong strong. Noah is desperately trying to relieve Allie of her disease by reading her the story he wrote of their love in hopes she will recover and remember his name at least so they can love fully once more.I have never felt so satisfied by an author's attempt at a dramatic twist in a plot or a twisted ending of a story, and I have never been so satisfied overall with a love story. As I closed the book and let my final tears fall, I cried and cried for Noah and Allie's incredible, beautiful and realistic love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The NOTEBOOK is a superb good book I couldn't put it down. It is a beautiful story about great love. Nicholas Sparks knows how to get to our emotions. Bravo Nicholas. I have read Message in a Bottle, A bend in the Road, The Guardian and now I'll read The Wedding. I have never been disappointed in any of your books."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If I could rate this book on a scale from 1-10, I would give it a 12. Unfortunately, we can only give up to five stars.Noah's love for Allie is inspiring. He proved that no matter what happens, he intended to keep the vows he made on their wedding day. &quot;For better or for worse, in sickness and in health, as long as we both shall live.&quot; He never gave up on her. That is the kind of marriage every couple should have. The book is so passionate and real. You can relate to the everyday things that happen in the story, but you can also find the escape that every reader looks for in a good romance novel. Starting with the first page of this book, I was captivated by every word that I read. By the end, I was in uncontrollable tears and cried for a long time after finishing. However, I love good romance, and I love to cry. People EXPECT me to cry....Keep reading.My husband is not the romantic type, and he is DEFINATELY not the reading type. However, he asked me what I wanted for my birthday, so I told him that all I wanted was for him to read &quot;The Notebook&quot;. I thought he could pick up a few ideas. He half-heartedly agreed and told me he would begin the following day. I was surprised at how quickly he was nearing the end so I sat beside him pretending to read a book of my own. Suddenly, I saw tears escaping his reddening eyes, and heard a faint sniffle from time to time. I can't tell you how much I wanted to know what part he was reading, but I sat quietly and waited for the end. After about ten minutes, he put the book down and, surprisingly, reached for my book and sat it down as well. He turned to me and stretched out his arms. I held him close while he cried, and I couldn't help but cry (and laugh to myself at the same time) to see my macho-man finally at his weakness.Overall, I have to say this is a spectacular book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Having just finished &quot;The Notebook,&quot; I am overwhelmed with emotion. This is an extraordinary tale! Spark's captures true love so perfectly, it's wondrous. So much for the myth that only the feminine variety is capable of penning passion and love.There's nothing terribly suspenseful about this book. There's nothing uncommon, nothing vulgar, nothing violent, nothing unsacred. It is simple; it is realistic; it is pure; it is beautiful; it is a masterpiece. Given the aforementioned, perhaps it is, indeed, very uncommon!Spark's literary portrait of main characters Allie and Noah shines brighter with each passing year in their lives. With age, they gain more charima & definition. With age, they become more realistic. So much so that the reader can actually feel their emotions, their happiness, their sorrows, their pain. And yet, this novel is a joyful & inspirational & hopeful one. It might be that Spark's best writing in &quot;The Notebook&quot; is realized through the poignant letters that he's composed (so eloquently for Allie & Noah). It's the best &quot;notebook&quot; I've ever happened upon & may very well be the most beautiful book I've ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"The Foxes of the Desert : The Story of the Afrika Korps","review":"Unlike most other books about the North African war, this book is a superb account from the German perspective. One wonders what might have been if Hitler hadn't been so stubborn, or if Malta had fallen. It gives the insider view of the famed Afrika Korps, and is a gripping tale ( just like a war thriller ) of the campaign. This is a must read for all enthusiasts of military non-fiction. One would also do well to reread The Destert Fox after reading this book - it would definately lend a new perspective to Rommel's biography.Unfortunately the copy I have is old, and has started coming to pieces. The price of the hardcover edition is rather high. It would be good if a cheaper, softcover edition is available."},{"Title":"The Foxes of the Desert : The Story of the Afrika Korps","review":"This was the last of Carell's books for me to read, so finishing it was bittersweet. Once again Herr Carell has produced a masterful historical piece laced with many eyewitness accounts that keep it interesting to read. Overall coverage is good, especially from the german point of view. This campaign was always a relatively small time sideshow to the germans due to their preoccupation with the Ost Front. Logistics eventually won the campaign for the allies, though Afrika Korps fought with great daring and elan for over 2 years, giving the Brits the fits! Small unit actions are covered as well as the more strategic picture. I recommend this book to persons wanting a thourough review of this excing and exotic campaign and devotees of Herr Carell. It is,of course, somewhat slanted to the German point of view. This should not dissuade you from enjoying this wonderful African campaign overview."},{"Title":"The Foxes of the Desert : The Story of the Afrika Korps","review":"This book covers Rommel and the exploits of his Afrika Korps and Panzer Armee Afrika in Libya and Tunisia and is one of the best ever on the battles won and lost there.The narrative is involving, and soldiers and generals come alive in Carrell's words.A must buy."},{"Title":"The Foxes of the Desert : The Story of the Afrika Korps","review":"Although this book is fine for the layman who wants to learn something about the North African campaign of 1941-43 it is not good for the scholars or anyone who wants to study the battles in that theater in greater depth. Carell uses many personal histories to color his account but he often loses the great picture. I would recommend instead Mitcham's book \\"Rommel's Greatest Victory\\", Heckmann's \\"Rommel's War in Africa\\", Irving's \\"The Trail of the Fox\\", Massignani's \\"Rommel's North Africa Campaign\\" or even the excellent Time-Life volume \\"Afrikakorps\\" from the \\"Third Reich\\" series."},{"Title":"The Foxes of the Desert : The Story of the Afrika Korps","review":"There is no dearth of books on Rommel and his legendary Deutsche Aftika Korps. Author is a doyen among World War II historians . The story narrated here is strictly from the German standpoint.Desert was an ideal place to fight.From western frontier of Egypt there stretched westward to the Tunisian border \`Great Sand Sea'. Flat open spaces of desert , punctuated a mass of sand dunes ,offered an ideal terrain for tanks to manoeuvre. Rommel called desert as \`tactician's paradise and quarter master's hell'.He opened campaign with a bang which sent British forces reeling. British Supreme Commander in Middle East Lord Wavell - and in fact no one from Western Desert Force - anticipated such a quick resumption of hostilities after Italians were routed at Bedda Fomm. Unfortunately for British Rommel was not a text book \`General'.His ways of waging war must be construed as unorthodox. He even chose not to disclose his intentions to German High Command. Had he done so English would have known thanks to their ability to read German Enigma ciphers.Most Anglo Americans hold Rommel in awe though there were other exceptional leaders like Cruewell,Nehring ,Bayerlein. Respect stems from the fact Rommel openly courted danger and escaped death. Unlike British commanders who were often sulking behind Desert Fox led from the front. He shared dangers along with his fellow soldiers.So his stature grew. Author is an admirer of Rommel and makes no bones of this fact. According to Carrel, if not for shortage in supplies and bad luck Afrika Korps would have evicted British from Egypt and captured Middle East with its rich oil reserves.Yes, Rommel carved fame in the \`hall of war'. But we must view him objectively; bold and daring but impulsive and rash. Gazala battles could have turned into a disaster. Elite panzer divisions were stranded behind enemy lines and somehow Rommel managed to retrieve the situation by restoring line of communications. Biggest flaw in his strategy was inadequate appreciation of logistics in modern war. So much so when Afrika Korps reached El Alamein sector it had almost shot its bolt. Paucity of ammunition and fuel supplies constrained the ability of panzer units to manoeuvre besides it increasingly coming under attack from RAF based in Alexandria, Cairo. Correct course would have been revert to defensive posture after fall of Tobruk on June 21, 1942 as advocated by Marshal Albert Kesselring . Take Malta, build overwhelming strength and simultaneously cut British lines of supply before storming the final barrier which barred the road to victory in North Africa.Rommel's reputation as great panzer tactician partially shaped by his access to Speicial Intelligence.His mobile, highly-efficient radio listening posts plucked almost everything British were transmitting in the ether ranging from casual battle field chat, tank to tank calls, HQ chat, supply depot reports. Then Rommel also read radio cipher messages sent to Washington by US military attache in Cairo intercepted and deciphered by Italian/German intelligence. Some reports were even better than Enigma decrypts.Nonetheless,Rommel for nearly 2 years posed nightmare for the Allies. How can we explain his astonishing series of victories? It must be attributed to German superiority in combined arm tactics.Some sections of the book look outdated .Author frequently refers to the work of a traitor. As a result Rommel's top secret operational plans became known to his opponents. The theme permeates through out the book. Failure of his first attempt to storm Tobruk ,frequent disruption of supples to Afrika Korps, defeat of Alam Halfa offensive ,failure of spoiling attack to stop Montgomery from piercing Mareth line have all been imputed to treason. Author argues some senior officers of Italian Navy were in touch with American intelligence.To butttress this point he has drawn information from Adm Ellis Zacharias book \` Secret Missions'. Today we know that no traitors were involved thanks to de classification of hitherto confidential archival material. Author did not have privilege to know Allies were reading German radio messages. Details about Allied World War II SIGINT remained classified for a long time.Author has enlivened the account by giving facts on Abwehr's espionage mission in Egypt - Operation Condor - which involved a former officer of Austro Hungarian army Laslo von Almaszy. Germans had the foresight to realise soon they were bound to loose the ability to read cipher messages of US military attache. To plug this hole agents were infiltrated to serve as \`eyes and ears of Afrika Korps. There was Fifth Column actively working to undermine British rule in Egypt. Some disgruntled members of Egyptian officer corps were prepared to welcome Germans with open arms. To add cream, the conspirators had in their ranks the famous belly dancer Hekmat Fahmi who was an important source of information for Abwehr. Details were sensational ,read for the first time .The book is definitely a military classic, one of the earliest works on Desert War. Published in the late 50s still in print which means it has continued to retain popularity among readers. Ever since its publication there has been explosion in literature on North African campaign.Some new authors have been able to shed fresh light on the subject. Frontiers of knowledge always continue to expand. However passage of time has not diminished the lustre of this book."},{"Title":"The Foxes of the Desert : The Story of the Afrika Korps","review":"Mr Carell always writes an engaging story and this one begins in late 1940 when the British during their offensive inflict a series of major defeats on the Italians. This forces Hitler, in order to keep Mussolini in the war, to come to his aid by sending Rommel and the Africa Korp to Africa beginning in Feb 1941. The coverage continues with the major events of the war up to the Axis surrender in May 1943.With Churchill over confident with the African victories in Africa, he sends forces from Africa to Crete and Greece and dilutes the British strength. Rommel is determine to attack the British while the British are weak and in so doing, garners a number of victories for the Axis. Further coverage of Sollum, Malta, Benghazi, Bir Hacheim, Tobruk several times, Alam Halfa, Alamein, Operation Torch and Medenine which is Rommel's last battle before going back to Germany. Back in Berlin, Rommel tries to persuade Hitler to leave North Africa but was unsuccessful. And the book closes with Arnim's surrender only two months later. Hitler loses 250,000 men for a worthless piece of property. With those men stationed in Sicily and Italy, the Allies would have had a much harder time with the invasions.The book only has a few simple maps. The photos, though not many, are good. There is a decent Index to help you locate people and places.Its not comprehensive but as an overview, its very good. If you're a casual reader, it may be all you need to read of the North Africa campaign. If you're an enthusaist, it will help point you to the key events or people for your further research."},{"Title":"The Foxes of the Desert : The Story of the Afrika Korps","review":"This is the first of Paul Carrell's books I have read. I liked the information and stories contained therein, however, I only give this four stars because Herr Carrell's writing style, especially in the first third of the book, I found very distracting. He has a tendency of re-emphasizing things multiple times in multiple subsequent paragraphs, which takes up room, but adds no real content to the chapter(s). He will repeatedly illustrate a point about a person, or subject, over and over, in a sentence, in a paragraph, in a follow-up sentence (yes, I got it the first time, thanks; no, really, I did :-/ ). He also on occassion goes off on tangents about things, discussing at length these topics as they applied elsewhere in the war, or earlier in history (e.g., traitors and betrayal) before obliquely coming to the point as to how it might be a concern of/to the DAK or British. He might have saved a bit of room here and there by being more focused on these points.Now, these aspects aside, there are a lot of good stories contained within the books. I don't have access to the materials Herr Carrell does, so I can't say how much is literary license exaggeration and how much is actual events clothed in a story-telling narrative (Paul Carrell's real name is Karl Schmidt, a well-known German propaganda writer during WWII, so take the stories to what level you will). However, I still enjoyed the stories within the book (Rommel's passing visit of a New Zealand field hospital, Lieutenant-General Bayerlein's account of his and General Cruwell being surrounded by British tanks while in a captured British armoured car, and being mistaken for being Brits not Germans), and appreciate the information given as it helped me flesh out details that I had not known about from other books on the subject of the war in North Africa (i.e., the tonnage of shipping Germany lost to the RAF trying to resupply Rommel) or learn something entirely new (i.e., the Oasis Companies).In addition, he does have a few pages of photos from the war in North Africa that I had not yet seen elsewhere (not that I have every North Africa WWII book, mind you!). Some of them were quite cool.If you can get past or through Carrell's writing style, and not be distracted by his tangents and repeat emphasis items, you should be able to at the very least enjoy the stories contained within. And maybe learn a tidbit or two about something from that part of the war you didn't know before."},{"Title":"The Foxes of the Desert : The Story of the Afrika Korps","review":"The book I have is in paperback form. I got.it at a library book sale for about a quarter. A real gem! Much of what we know about the war in North Africa comes from the allied side. Being able to read about it from the opponents viewpoint is great. Brings out all the ins & outs of the campaign. The German loathing for their Italian allies is compelling. Not much different from that of the British there of the U.S. This loathing comes up a lot. Rommel develops fuller the use of the deadly 88 flak gun as an anti-tank gun here. I especially liked how the book brings out the stories of ordinary soldiers as well as the major players. Great book. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Chalk Whispers","review":"Paul Bishop has been writing cop novels for about a decade now. He started with a book that was a better premise than a novel, about a pair of patrolmen trying to win a bet by driving their patrol car from LA to Las Vegas and back in one shift without anyone noticing. It wasn't quite as good as it sounds. He's written several books since, trying different characters. One was a detective who was also a soccer player or something. The one he seems to have finally decided is a hit is Fey Croaker, who gets called Frog Lady (frogs croak) and who's been assigned to LAPD's West Side Division for three books. In this fourth entry, the author appparently decided to up the ante and promote her, and her \\"team\\", to Robbery Homicide Division downtown.This was the first of several annoyances in this book. I don't know this, but I suspect that LAPD is like any other large organization: they don't transfer teams like this around their department's organizational structure. Now there are mitigating circumstances: Bishop mentions an outgoing chief of police, and a new one trying to shake things up. Still it was hard for me to buy that they would do this.Next, no sooner do Fey and her cohorts get downtown than they are assigned a real hot potato: the torture-murder of a prominent black woman who's an attorney and child molestation crusader, and also the sister of a police commissioner, and the daughter of a judge. Soon, the case develops into a hunt for missing children who have entered an \\"underground railroad\\" where they are spirited away from abusive parents who have the law on their side. Just in case things weren't complex enough, the case also takes a historical turn, with a bloody armored car robbery and a shootout involving the police and the Black Panthers from almost thirty years ago proving to be connected with the case.There are interesting, if a bit eccentric, characters throughout the book. The cops are fun, and well-defined. The dialog is well-written. The plot is a bit like something Michael Connelly or Jeffrey Deaver would concoct. Everything's logical and believable, but at the end you wonder if anything this complex ever occurs, and if it does, do the detectives on the case ever solve them?Given that, I did enjoy the book, and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Chalk Whispers","review":"This book had everything: intrigue, graphic details of a bloody murder, and the biting sarcasm of Fey Croaker. It is a true work of art. Ironically it was the first of the series I had read, so now I am scrambling to read the other books. To anybody who is a fan of the NBC TV show LAW & ORDER, I recomend this book."},{"Title":"Chalk Whispers","review":"I try to read every cop fiction novel I can get my hands on. Wambough has always been my favorite author, but I found Paul Bishop to be more entertaining in this one. I've been a cop for 18 years, and enjoyed the realistic cop humor."},{"Title":"Chalk Whispers","review":"Los Angeles police veteran Paul Bishop's fourth Fey Croaker novel finds the LAPD detective promoted to robbery/homicide, where she heads up her old team in investigating the torture death of a black woman lawyer, Bianca Flynn, who helped run an illegal underground railroad to hide sexually abused children from predatory parents exonerated by the courts.Gritty, sometimes over-the-top (but it works) writing propels this fast-paced procedural, exposing a conspiracy of power players in child sex abuse and exploring the uncertainties in nasty divorce cases. Croaker confronts her own abused childhood in an interconnected subplot, which includes a suitcase of money, a newly discovered sibling and a romance.Bishop's secondary characters, particularly Croaker's team, are skillfully drawn and the quirky dynamic partnerships drive the police work. Intuitive thinking, luck, perseverance and distracted mistakes play crucial parts in this hard-boiled, action-packed series."},{"Title":"Chalk Whispers","review":"The new police chief of the LAPD plans to turn the department into a model for other police forces to emulate. He promotes homicide detective Fey Croaker and her team to a newly formed special cell of the prestigious Robbery-Homicide Division. Other officers are enraged by this preferential treatment and refuse to cooperate with the new team.Someone tortured and killed a black woman, but the victim was considered a call girl and the case given low priority. Two days later, the deceased is identified as child advocate attorney Blanca Flynn, the daughter of a judge nominated for a seat on the California Supreme Court and the sister to a police commissioner. The trail is cold when Fey and her crew are assigned the case. The victim had a lot of enemies, including her estranged husband and father, both of whom she accused of being pediophiles. As Fey investigates, the case stirs up buried memories from her own past that, if she is not careful, could taint her inquires.Paul Bishop's police procedurals are some of the best works on the market today as he employs his twenty-three years with the LAPD to turn his exciting story lines into authentic, believable tales. With the recent headlines in LA, the relevancy of CHALK WHISPERS is obvious as the investigation is delayed until the status of the victim is known. The clever mystery is filled with strong characterizations, especially the five lead protagonists (Fey and her team). Readers experience their triumphs and fears as the audience senses what the quintet feels. If justice prevails, this book will gain its due, as it deserves best seller status.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Chalk Whispers","review":"I must admit, I love the Fey Croaker series of novels.Just finished Chalk Whispers, and would highy recommend this crime novel to anyone who loves a fascnating,well defined look into the gritty world of police work. It has all the elements you come to expect from Author Paul Bishop...holds you captive in a world of danger, anticipation, and intrique. If you have read any of the other novels in this series,you won't be disapointed! An enjoyable rollercoaster ride of love,murder,betrayal and redemption."},{"Title":"Chalk Whispers","review":"I was a cop of some sort for over 30 years, and don't believe I've ever read a book with such a far-fetched plot or cast of characters. From the judge to his high-profile law partner, virtually everyone is a pedophile. If they're not a pedophile, then they've were molested when they were the operative age, which is conveniently about the age of several dozen children who come to the USA via some underground pipeline. Mr. Bishop truly does a great job of developing characters and building the story. However, the complexity of the story and the subtle nuances he continually throws in finally reaches a point where, if you don't read it all in one setting or a few nights, you completely lose track of what...is happening. I certainly liked some parts of the book, but the cover describes Mr. Bishop as \\"the new Joseph Wambaugh\\", or something similar, and that is certainly not the case...."},{"Title":"Contrary Neighbors: Southern Plains and Removed Indians in Indian Territory (Civilization of the American Indian)","review":"Contrary Neighbors is an enjoyable and informative book for historians as well as the novice on the subject.

As you will find in Pashto speaking areas, the language differs greatly from one area or another. You may find that using a phrase in this book will work in one village, but in another you will only get blank stares. The best thing to do is use this book and cross-reference with a translator.

So this was some help.This dictionary does offer a few amenities, however. There are some useful vocabulary lists and a thumbnail sketch of grammar. However, all entries are in a transliteration and the Pashto alphabet is not used at all. I can't imagine that an Afghani learning English would find an English-Pashto dictionary of much use if the English were only written in a phonetic transcription. Ideally a Pashto dictionary would cite the word in its authentic alphabet and then include a transcription as an aid to pronunciation as written Pashto is not very phonetic (and some of the letters are pronounced differently by speakers from different parts of the country).

They are in fact quite scary, so I wouldn't recommend them to kids that are too young (personally I'd say 11+) or prone to nightmares.The main character Thomas Ward is both credible and very human! The storytelling flows well, and you are quickly caught up in the story. The County comes alive before you, as you partake in Thomas' journey towards becoming a Spook - the medival equivalent of Ghostbusters :-) Only this is far more gloomy and sinister.There's also humor and suspense in these books, and even as an adult i read them both in 4 days, and I'm now annoyed that the third book won't be out before April!The series has a very interesting take on good and evil - you choose your own path, and if you try hard enough, maybe you can direct the people you care about away from the dark side.There are also some interesting points on dealing with fear, narrowminded people and well.. boggarts, whitches and ghosts!I like the fact that apart from a few villains, things in these books are \\"grey-shaded\\". Good witches exist (benign), and the Spook has a pet boggart that cooks, cleans and protects the household. The \\"good guys\\" have faults and make bad choices.So order the books, wait for a stormy night, make a huge amount of coffee or hot chocolate, and crawl under the covers and be spooked! (in the best sense of the word:-)"},{"Title":"Spook's Apprentice (No.1)","review":"This is not \\"high fantasy\\" with world building, heroic characters, and profound quests. At least not in the early volumes. The County Spook deals with the mundane tasks of keeping witches and boggarts and the like in line. There are creatures and spirits and practitioners of the black arts out there, and sometimes they misbehave or leave their territory and have to be trapped, relocated or dispatched. It's sort of like being an officer of the Department of Wildlife, spooky division.The main characters are the Spook, Thomas his new apprentice, and Alice, the young witch with the pointy shoes who could go either good or bad, but who is also a budding love interest for our young apprentice. The Spook has a fair-but-firm grumpy vibe that suits the story. Thomas is bright, honest, loyal and prone to youthful error. He is an insightful and trustworthy narrator, and a good fit as the hero the reader can identify with. Alice is well above the normal girl/sidekick. She is shrewder than Thomas, and more mature. She knows more about witchcraft. As the series develops she will become a more and more important character. (The best part of this is that Alice is a fine protagonist for girls to identify with, and she is certainly a character who holds her own with the Spook and Thomas.)The book is unique because it tries to present a sense of the work-a-day world of spook busting. Thomas has to learn about the habits of creatures, how to trap and hold them, how to be a spook. He practices skills, digs pits and traps, and generally lives the life of an apprentice. He does a lot of bag carrying as the Spook moves from job to job. While it's fantasy of course, it feels like an introduction to an authentic life.The larger appeal of the book, and the whole series, is that as time passes the Spook becomes a fully realized character. Thomas begins to grow up. Alice becomes a much more intriguing force. The series is involving from this character development point of view, and the odd blend of spirited fantasy and matter-of-factness creates a really compelling narrative.Definitely worth consideration."},{"Title":"Spook's Apprentice (No.1)","review":"Good book, great series.

Delaney has created great characters from Spook and Thomas, to Thomas' family and other characters, good and bad. I want to know how one gets a house boggart. The back of the book states \\"Warning: Not to be Read After Dark.\\" It's not quite that bad for adults but may make children cautious of mirrors. I very much enjoyed this book and look forward to the 2nd and 3rd books"},{"Title":"Spook's Apprentice (No.1)","review":"The Spook's Apprentice is a tale about a boy who is learning to fight the forces of evil that haunt his county. Thomas Ward, a thirteen year old seventh son of a seventh son, has been volunteered by his parents to be the apprentice of the local spook. This spook has protected the county from dark forces for a long time but knows that his work is soon to pass. All of his previous apprentices have failed, and now Thomas is his last hope. As Thomas tackles his training, he is faced not only with the challenges of evil, but also with those of coming of age. He must learn quickly that this world is not as it seems and that his trust and will can be his greatest allies in this battle against the horrors that surround him."},{"Title":"Spook's Apprentice (No.1)","review":"My 9 year old daughter started reading Spooks, and she raved about it so now I have been reading them too.The strength of these books lies in the fantastic storytelling of teh author who spins a tail that really will achieve that suspenful state of tension that will delight younger readers. For adults too, the story is well written and never becomes tedious. Good interesting stuff.The stories are quite original, and well constructed, but not of great depth, and some of the themes feel like they are aimed at an older age group than 9, although the stories are perhaps not sufficiently complex to be branded young adult. Nevertheless I have a hard time recommending them to 9 year olds because while this first one is just fine, there are theems in some of the later books that are downright disturbing. Without wishing to write spoilers it is hard to go into details, but there is one particular theme, several books into the series, that led me to speak to teh school about placing these in an older section of the school library. The only time I have ever behaved like such an interfering parent! So please don't hold that against me.My recommendation is that children and young adults 11 and up would love this series."},{"Title":"Spook's Apprentice (No.1)","review":"The Spooks series comprising of nine volumes has to be one of the most gripping young adult/ children's books that I have had the pleasure of reading, being truly fantastic in their design and execution by a genius of a writer who certainly has spent a lot of time on his work and done the research into the specific genre. This series begins with book one; the apprentice which \`hits the nail right on the head' in terms of reaching out to its target audience, incorporating everything that this younger reader wants to explore in such a way as to enthrall, delight and mesmerize. It is a character-driven tale that takes you on the most thrilling and somewhat scary journey, which will leave you breathless and with chills sent down your spine. I absolutely love how the author structures his storyline around the main character of Thomas Ward (aka; apprentice) so that we come to see his world and imaginative creation through his eyes, making it utterly realistic and believable. Throughout the Wardstone Chronicles you begin to personally connect with the main character that you are by then able to relate to and empathize with, as the writing just gets better and better with the story becoming more exciting and thrilling as the fast-paced action intensifies. It is Joseph Deleaney's memorable characters that draw you into this story and which pull you along so as to be unable to put the book down, without leaving the memories fresh and vivid etched within your mind. It is the distinctive settings and environment that create the most atmospheric and realistic background to an intense plot, with one complimenting the other so as to bring It all to life. I love the symbols, the character profiles and maps at the beginning of the book which again helps to bring the author's creation and world to life and turns the black & white pages to full luminous color, so that you are able to visualize the surroundings with complete clarity. I also love the beautiful illustrations within each book, with everything so well thought out from not just the incredible writing but also the visual and marketing side of the books as a product; with an additional accompanying book to add to your collection and a most well thought out and detailed website. The series as a whole is totally original and something completely unique that many readers will find themselves getting lost within as I myself did, hence once you have read book one you will then want to read and collect them all! Completely brilliant and utterly unique, a spectacular story that deserves to take pride of place on anyone's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Spook's Apprentice (No.1)","review":"This is a fun book for those who enjoy fantasy writing!

I thought the story was a little better than Lightning Thief or Eric Rex, for comparison sake.I bought the English version off of Amazon.uk, I like the physical product (cover, etc.) better than what I had seen in the book store."},{"Title":"Spook's Apprentice (No.1)","review":"Tom is the seventh son of a seventh son and left handed.

With each interviewee having a different take on just what taboo is. It is about sexual desires, acts and fantasies that people keep secret from their partners. They put stories in this book that seemed to follow regular themes. There is a wide range of personality types and their corresponding kinks represented in this book. They range from Mary, who was brought up in a Convent after her parents died, and has some pretty tame ideas about what is taboo in her story titled \\"Shameful Desire\\", to Olga who likes to exhibit herself graphically in front of a web cam. This was a thoughtfully written, sexy, well-put together book. The stories in it not only titillate but they also educate by presenting a wide range of sexual fantasies and realities from normal people. It is a good book and a decent addition to any collection."},{"Title":"Unspoken Desires: Real People Talk About Sexual Experiences and Fantasies They Hide from Their Partners","review":"This is good one-handed reading.

It was a slow read, but interesting to see into his mind and to discover his influences. The highlight of the book for me was the Farmer Giles of Ham. It was a well told story. The adventures of Tom Bombadil were good because it gives you some backstory of Tom.

LOTR was the main course,this Tolkien collection is a fine brandy after a more than agreeable meal. Oh,yes,great service from this seller."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"Pros: This is more material from a beloved author, including a long essay and quite a few poems. The poems, entitled collectively \\"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,\\" are actually pretty good. I guess the early 20th century was a good time for poetry all around. Tree and Leaf, another short story included, was also good, simple but not saccharine and oddly dystopian.Cons: As a collection, this book is disjointed. Each of the should be enjoyed individually. Also, Mr. Tolkien has a propensity to draw out things which should be short. The essay seems to promise things that it never gets around to. Farmer Giles of Ham has such a short plot that it's almost worth skipping, as most of the results are predictable and take forever to arrive. Even the collection of poems has an odd introduction talking about the fictional \\"real\\" authors that goes on for 5 pages in a way that doesn't make a whole lot of sense out of the context of the Lord of the Rings, even though the poems are great on their own.Conclusion: This is well worth the time, though you may find yourself trying to make it go faster in places."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"I love The Hobbit, the LOTR, and even Tolkien's translation of the Middle English poem \\"Sir Gawain and the Greene Knight.\\" However, I was less than excited by the Tolkien Reader. His play about the Battle of Maldon (his play from a story from a real old English poem) is rather boring. This is a shame, because I've read the Battle of Maldon in Old English, and it's very interesting. The essay on Fairy Stories is long-winded and cryptic if you haven't read all his references. The Fairy Story itself, Leaf by Niggle, is not great. The Adventures of Tom Bombadil are actually a collection of Tolkien's poems, and only a couple of them are actually about Tom Bombadil. The rest seem to be poems that didn't fit anywhere else, so Tokien pretends that various hobbits from LOTR created them or wrote them down. Farmer Giles of Ham is a pretty good story. Instead of going to Old English for his background (as Tolkien did in The Hobbit and LOTR), he goes to Latin as the basis of the story. It's the only story I actually enjoyed from this book. Now the book itself is a cheap paperback. The printing goes almost to the edge of every page, so there's almost no margin in which to put your fingers. All in all, a disappointing read."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"I recently completed a philosophy course on JRR Tolkien's works and this book was an inherent part of understanding the mind and writings of JRR Tolkien.

As a child, I also memorized his letter on page 74, which begins \\"Although now long estranged...\\" and which encompasses topics which challenge the oldest among us.As an adult, I still find Tolkien's works and thoughts compelling, though perhaps for somewhat different reasons than those of my childhood.The book is worth the price, if only for Leaf by Niggle and the letter on page 74."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"At its inception as a hodge-podge of unpublished works, with prose offerings in the form of essay and fairy tale and poetry in styles ancient and (almost) modern, no doubt The Tolkien Reader was a hurried effort to feed the masses of Tolkien-hungry readers after the surging tide of popularity of Lord of the Rings. Nonetheless, it serves quites passably as an introduction to the many facets of the Oxford don who would be voted the most popular writer of the century. While it is a must for any Tolkien fan it must be conceded that only a reader of very specific tastes will be able to enjoy all four parts of this collection.Perhaps unfortunately, The Reader begins with the least accessible work to modern tastes, The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son. In the publisher's introductory note we are told that \\"Professor Tolkien has graciously permitted the publishers to add\\" this scholarly work to the three \\"established favorites,\\" implicitly acknowledging the limited appeal. For most readers not well versed in ancient sagas appreciating the Homecoming will be akin to viewing a richly colored painting via a black and white photograph.The essay and fairy tale included in the second section, collectively titled Tree and Leaf, are by themselves sufficient reason to buy The Tolkien Reader. The essay On Fairy-stories gives a revealing look at Tolkien's deepest beliefs about writing and faith. The autobiographical fairy tale Leaf by Niggle should be mandatory reading for any struggling artist. Tolkien provides a brief introduction to this section, including an inexplicably moving five line anecdote concerning the demise of a poplar tree.The third section is Farmer Giles of Ham, a fairy tale subsequently published as a stand-alone volume. It is perhaps the most palatable offering for readers of The Lord of the Rings looking for more Tolkien fiction, but it is closer to The Hobbit than the trilogy, both in size and tone. Readers will recognize Tolkien's humor in this light-hearted tale but it lacks the depth of his longer works.The Reader concludes with a collection of poems entitled The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses purportedly from the now out of print Red Book. Many of these poems are incorporated into The Lord of the Rings and still others allude to characters and places of Middle-earth. Lines such as \\"the fat cat on the mat\\" are not likely to impress modern poetry critics. Many of the poems reflect a homey streak in Tolkien's tastes, but this was surely as much a part of the man as his love of the ancient and the magical. Indeed, the sixteen poems in this collection are equal part elf and hobbit, with a touch of troll thrown in, the same mixture (if not the same scale) that worked so well in his epic trilogy."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"I love the Tolkien Reader! It is a wonderful selection of stories and poetry which has been of great use for me as a teacher working with children. Extremely enjoyable reading!Kick back your hobbit feet and explore the adventures!"},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"\\"Smith of Wootten Major\\" and \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" -- two novellas by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" creator, J.R.R. Tolkien -- taste crisp as produce new from the garden, even in this aging paperback edition. Giles, written in the 1930s and Smith, written in his old age, allow Tolkien to remind us again of the good sense and courage of the common man. Giles ripples with sophisticated humor as the simple villager inadvertently takes on first, a giant thanks to his alarmist dog, and then a dragon, helped by his patient and wise mare. Animals are as well-written as people in his \\"faery\\" world, where negotiating with a dragon (twice!) sounds like a court-house-steps deal between the S.E.C. and a Wall Street trader, only Giles' deals actually do some good in the end. Smith reminds us, in a tender and graceful way, that attending to the day and what it brings is a a kind of glory unseen, worth our every effort, even if we live and die in quiet obscurity. No one of us is without value. No matter how humble our good work, our strenuous best counts, it has a legacy that we all live within and share. Thank you again, Professor Tolkien. You are a true friend."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"This book is a collection of either 4 or 5 shorter works, depending on how you count; Tolkien himself grouped \\"On Fairy Stories\\" and \\"Leaf by Niggle\\" together as \\"Tree and Leaf\\", but I think of them as being very different.The 1986 edition in front of me was illustrated by Pauline Baynes. My understanding is that her work with Tolkien on \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" led him to recommend her to C.S. Lewis; the style of the pictures for that story resembles those she later created for \\"The Magician's Book\\" in Lewis' THE VOYAGES OF THE DAWN TREADER.\\"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son\\" is part analysis of an epic poem, and part play based on the poem. I find this hardest to get into of all the pieces in the book.\\"On Fairy Stories\\" A serious essay, starting with prettified Victorian fairy tales and tracing them back to their origins in more serious stories of Faerie and its inhabitants. Personally I would have paired this up with SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR rather than \\"Leaf by Niggle\\" in terms of subject matter.\\"Leaf by Niggle\\" I acquired the book solely for this story; everything else was icing on the cake. Niggle, although he knows that he will someday have to go on a long journey with no return, finds the idea distasteful and avoids preparing for it; instead, he prefers to spend all the time he can painting, being 'the sort of painter who can paint leaves better than trees'. But when the time for his journey finds him completely unprepared, it turns out that neither his time working on leaves nor helping his disagreeable neighbour Parish has been wasted.\\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" is another of Tolkien's 'translations', but along the lines of THE LORD OF THE RINGS - that is, when discussing it he refers to it seriously as a translated history rather than an original story, to the point of identifying his source texts and criticizing some earlier scholar's carelessness about detail. (Tolkien and Lewis indulged in games like this often; see THE LAYS OF BELERIAND for examples of some of their letters analyzing the work of 'translators' on various poems of Tolkien's.) The hero of the story, Giles, starts out as an ordinary farmer who almost accidentally causes a giant to leave his village alone (the giant being hard of hearing, and not caring for what he took to be stinging insects). Unfortunately for Giles, being an official hero isn't always convenient when the professional knights inexplicably can't spare the time to chase *real* monsters, and the giant gave other people quite the wrong impression of his home. I happen to like Tolkien's sense of humor myself, so I enjoy this story, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. The story's style also reminds me a bit of THE SWORD IN THE STONE, particularly in dealing with professional knights.\\"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book\\" is a collection of 16 poems; note that only the first two poems feature Bombadil. The preface identifies them as coming from THE RED BOOK (the 'historical' record from which THE LORD OF THE RINGS was 'translated'), and identifies the chararacters who wrote some of them. \\"The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late\\" and \\"The Stone Troll\\" also appear early in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, but there are more poems along similar lines such as \\"The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon\\", \\"Perry-the-Winkle\\" (another troll-song), and \\"Oliphaunt\\". About a quarter of the poems have a more serious tone."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"This book is well done, full of several wonderful short stories, an essay, and even a poem or two. It's really not something to read all at once, but more of a selective reading volume. It also has excellent illustrations."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"Be aware, this nice collection of some of J.R.R.T.'s shorter works does NOT--I repeat, does NOT--include his important essay \\"On Fairy-Stories\\" as described."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"Tolkien's passion for the deep roots of the English language led him to weave a skein of story-telling that enthrall us. The book begins with his translation of an ancient fragment of an epic poem, \\"The Battle of Malden,\\" about a real 10th battle between the English, led by Beorhtnoth of Essex, and Viking invaders. \\"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelms' Son\\" is followed by an essay on the nature of heroism. The words bang up against one another in painfully exquisite poetry: \\"Aye, a bump on the bone is bad for dreams, and it's cold waking\\" (Tolkien 1966:19), is due to Tolkien's fine craft as philologist and myth-maker. Another sample (1966:19):\\"Thus ages pass, and men after men . . .So the world passes;day follows day, and the dust gathers,his tomb crumbles, as time gnaws it,and his kith and kindred out of ken dwindle.So men flicker in the mirk and goes out.The world withers and the wind rises;the candles are quenched. Cold falls the night.\\"The love of story-telling, what Tolkien calls the \\"Cauldron of Story,\\" is a gift. As a child, I soaked-up vivid renderings of unabridged Brother's Grimm, every juicy ounce of gruesomeness savored. \\"Without the stew and the bones - which children are now too often spared in mollified versions of Grimm - that vision [of distance and a great abyss of time] would have been lost. I do not think I was harmed by the horror in the fairytale setting, out of whatever dark beliefs and practices of the past it may have come. Such stories . . . open a door on Other Time, and if we pass through, though only for a moment, we stand outside our own time, outside Time itself, maybe\\" (56).\\"I feel strongly the fascination of the desire to unravel the intricately knotted and ramified history of the branches on the Tree of Tales . . . It is now beyond all skill but that of the elves to unravel it\\" (Tolkien 1966:46-47). For a delicious immersion into the world of imagination, made visual, see the art of Arthur Rackham. To explore the \\"Perilous Realm\\" of the story, this small book is a pleasure; I highly recommend Tolkien's lyrical, academic essay \\"On Fairy Stories,\\" in the section \\"Tree and Leaf.\\" Even the introduction to this section delights. Following the essay, his classic fable \\"Leaf by Niggle\\" is interrelated \\"by the symbols of Tree and Leaf,\\" both touch on Tolkien's creative concept of sub-creation (Tolkien 1966:31). Tolkien was a creator who believed in, as he put it, the \\"True Myth.\\" I highly recommend the superb study, written Humphrey CarpenterJ.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography, andThe Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, edited by Carpenter. I also suggest T. A. Shippey's excellent books:J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Centuryand The Road to Middle-Earth: How J.R.R. Tolkien Created a New Mythology, among his extensive works on Tolkien.J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"On Fairy Stories,\\" explores his love of the genre, myth and folklore, sub-creation, imagination, art, and fantasy. He describes how Art is \\"the operative link between Imagination and the final result, Sub-creation\\" (68). For him, the imaginative world of the \\"fantastic,\\" the art of creating believable images not of the primary world, \\"is virtue, not a vice. Fantasy (in this sense) is, I think, not a lower but a higher form of Art, indeed the most nearly pure form, and so (when achieved) the most potent (69). He declares that, \\"Fantasy, of course, starts out with an advantage: arresting strangeness. But that advantage has been turned against it, and has contributed to its disrepute. Many people dislike . . . any meddling with the Primary World, or such small glimpses of it as are familiar to them [pretentious rationalists, confined to their narrow view]. They, therefore, stupidly and even maliciously confound Fantasy with Dreaming, in which there is no Art; and with mental disorders, in which there is not even control: with delusion and hallucination\\" (69).J.R.R. Tolkien referred to himself as a Large Hobbit, he also had deep Catholic faith; his mother's life was shortened by the cruel privations after her family rejected her conversion. She was inspired by Cardinal John Henry Newman; after she died, young Tolkien and his brother found refuge at Newman's Birmingham Oratory. Early on, Tolkien found richness in mythologies and the world of faerie, and in his faith. The following words of encouragement to artists, writers, musicians, and architects are written as if the author had read Tolkien's treatises on the creative impulse. \\"Art must make perceptible . . . the world of the spirit, of the invisible . . . Art has a unique capacity to take one or other facet of the message and translate it into colors, shapes and sounds which nourish the intuition of those who look and listen. It does so without emptying the message itself of its transcendent value and aura of mystery.\\" Also, \\"Every genuine artistic intuition goes beyond what the senses perceive and, reaching beneath reality's surface, strives to interpret its hidden mystery. The intuition itself springs from the depths of the human soul, where the desire to give meaning to one's own life is joined by the fleeting vision of beauty and of the mysterious unity of things . . . what they manage to express in their . . . creating is no more than a glimmer of the splendor which flared for a moment before the eyes of their spirit.\\" And, \\"the intimate reality of things is always \`beyond' the powers of human perception.\\" From the \\"Letter to Artists\\" (JPII:1999), whose essence explores Tolkien's description of sub-creation.Those with artistic ability, and a love of writing and reading, may especially appreciate Tolkien's modest protagonist in \\"Leaf by Niggle.\\" The story was born of a piece, when Tolkien woke one morning with it already complete in his mind. In the introduction to the book's section \\"Tree and Leaf,\\" he describes how the story was inspired by the beauty of a \\"great-limbed poplar tree that I could see even lying in bed. It was suddenly lopped and mutilated by its owner, I do not know why. It is cut down now, a barbarous punishment for any crimes it may have been accused of, such as being large and alive. I do not think it had any friends, or any mourners, except for myself and a pair of owls\\" (31-32).As to the story: in another realm, Niggle's old neighbor, Parish, is guided by a man towards some distant mountains. Along the way, Parish is astonished to see a gorgeous, somewhat familiar looking tree flourishing in divine light . . .\\"Did you think all this, Niggle? I never knew you were so clever. Why didn't you tell me?\\"\\"He tried to tell you long ago,\\" said the man; \\"but you would not look. He only got canvas and paint in those days, and you wanted to mend your roof with them [Niggle's paintings]. This is what you and your wife used to call Niggle's Nonsense, or That Daubing.\\"\\"But it did not look like this then, not real,\\" said Parish.\\"No, it was only a glimpse then,\\" said the man; \\"but you might have caught the glimpse, if you had ever thought it worth while to try.\\"Meanwhile, what is left of Niggle's portrait of his tree crumbles, \\"but one beautiful leaf remained intact. Atkins had it framed. Later he left it to the town museum, and for a long while 'Leaf: by Niggle' hung there in a recess, and was noticed by a few eyes. But eventually the Museum was burnt down, and the leaf, and Niggle, were entirely forgotten in his old country\\" (119-120). But, in his new country, Niggle's beautiful landscape proves refreshing and restorative for many soul.You also won't want to miss the section with \\"Verses from the Red Book,\\" with the original, delightful illustrations by Pauline Baynes, and alliterative treats such as \\"The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late.\\" The little dog laughed . . ."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"A collection of material about and by J.R.R. Tolkien, this is a must-have for any fan of Lord of the Rings. It combines several previous publications into one longer book, including &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; and &quot;Father Giles of Ham.&quot;It begins with an essay by noted fantasy writer Peter Beagle, who also wrote the screenplay for the animated LOTR movie eons and eons ago. &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son&quot; is radically different from Tolkien's more popular works, in that it is more of a play and less of a short story. It will probably appeal to fewer, given its obscure historical context. &quot;Farmer Giles&quot; is about a rather unusual farmer called on to deal with a rather unusual dragon; this is definitely a light, fluffy, funny story. &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; and &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; are more for the analytical thinkers among Tolkien's fans. &quot;Leaf&quot; is something of a glimpse into Tolkien's own soul, concerning his work and his own mortality. &quot;Fairy Stories,&quot; on the other hand, is one of the best-known essays on fantasy works and should be shoved in the face of anyone who denies fantasy's literary worth.We then lapse into entirely different material. There is a long poem called &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,&quot; written in the style and meter of his songs about himself in LOTR, when he meets the hobbits. It explains a little more about the hearty Maia and his wife Goldberry, as does the second of the poems, &quot;Bombadil Goes Boating.&quot; I didn't understand the beautifully written &quot;Errantry&quot; very well; but I did think that the catchy &quot;Princess Mee&quot; was cute, about a little elf princess dancing with her reflection. &quot;The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon&quot; is written in a very different style from the similarly titled &quot;Stayed Up,&quot; and definitely in a less merry style. There is also the entertaining &quot;Perry the Winkle&quot; and the utterly creepy &quot;Mewlips,&quot; and the amusingly jerky &quot;Cat.&quot; Also the eerie, beautiful &quot;Sea Bell,&quot; which seems almost like a dream.LOTR fans will recognize some of these poems: &quot;The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late,&quot; which fans of LOTR will recognize as the song that Frodo sings in an inn. &quot;Stone Troll&quot;, which Sam sang to entertain the others. &quot;Oliphaunt,&quot; an old rhyme about certain enormous pachyderms. Others are reminiscent of Middle-Earth: &quot;Fastitocalon,&quot; a poem about a creature in the sea; &quot;Shadow Bride,&quot; which is reminiscent of Beren and Luthien; &quot;The Hoard,&quot; about a massive amount of gold that brings no joy to its owners; and finally &quot;The Last Ship,&quot; a tale about a beautiful human girl who is invited by Elves to follow them over the sea.For unsurpassable prose, nonfiction and poetry, this is where to find the lesser-known gems by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"This book contain's Tolkien's shorter fiction and works, including a play and Leaf by Niggle. There are four works in total:1. The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm's Son: a play dealing with two men after the Battle of Maldon. Interesting, and shows more of the scholarly side of Tolkien.2. Tree and Leaf: This is a book consisting of two things: his essay on faerie tales, and Leaf By Niggle. Tolkien's essay is now considered one of the main centerpieces of literature defending and validating fantasy and faerie tale (as if THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT weren't enough). Leaf By Niggle is a very deep work, and basically it deals with his despair of mortality and not being able to finish his mythology, his great work. However, in the end Tolkien shows his glorious hope.3. Farmer Giles of Ham: a mock medieval story. Everything that THE LORD OF THE RINGS represents, this story pokes fun at and parodies. Very funny story, and shows Tolkien's sense of humour. This was written originally for his children (as much of his stuff was).4. The Adventures of Tom Bombadil: This is a very misleading title. It is a collection of poetry, and only the first two poems have anything to do with Bombadil. The rest of the poetry deals with Middle-earth, or set therein. It is a nice selection of his verse.Overall, a well put together anthology. However, it would have been better had it included SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR. That, along with the two works constituting TREE AND LEAF, is the closest thing to autobiography he ever wrote, and all three are vitally important in any serious study of Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"This is the book one should read after they have finished &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and just before they are about start &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; or &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;. With the film of &quot;Fellowship...&quot; to come out in December 2001, it is clear that there will be an increased interest in the canon of Tolkien's works.Peter S. Beagle introduces the book with an essay in which he gives a good analysis of Gollum's character; notice how the creature always spoke in first-person plural. &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son&quot; is so far Tolkien's only attempt at a play (brief though it is) and at writing something of his own that has the feeling of Beowulf. It is an addendum to what happened after the historical Battle of Maldon when the Danes invaded England. Tolkien was the type who would have felt at home in medieval northern Europe, and probably would have been a scribe like Snorri Sturluson.The collection called &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot; is another side of Tolkien. &quot;Farmer Giles...&quot; is a non-Middle-earth tale about a medieval knight off to fight a dragon, and &quot;Leaf By Niggle&quot; is a Borges-type of magical realism about a painter trying to create reality out of his art. It is the closest piece, I believe, that Tolkien came to writing what snobs consider &quot;literary&quot;.It stands on its own, as does the classic essay &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot;, in which he shows that fairy and/or faery tales are worth the attention of adults. To quote, he believes that fantasy is a higher form of Art, the most pure form and the most potent. He shows that fantasy works very well when it presents themes on recovery, escape, and consolation.Now for the poetry. Ever wonder who Tom Bombadil really was? He's a bit Falstaffian for a Maia, and I doubt he will be in the film, but somehow Tolkien believed it necessary to include him as part of Frodo's journey to Rivendell. &quot;The Adventures of TB&quot; include Goldberry and Old Man Willow and quite a helping of Hey Come derry-do, merry-dol my darling! These poems begin what is known as The Red Book of Westmarch, originally written by Bilbo Baggins and Sam Gamgee (Tolkien only compiled them). Most of the songs which are about animals, trolls, and the Man-in-the-Moon, seem suited to the ears of children. The poems which stand out, however, are the narratives like &quot;Errantry&quot;, &quot;The Hoard&quot;, and &quot;The Sea-Bell&quot;. Tolkien's poetry is in the classic traditional style of rhyme and meter. There's is nothing &quot;modern&quot; about it, and that is its quality. One who is inclined to reading T.S. Eliot or Wallace Stevens may not enjoyTolkien's old-fashioned style. But to readers of Kipling, Masefield, Graves, Sassoon, and Houseman, Tolkien's poetry is a delight, refreshing, and a fine conclusion to a collection of works by one of the best writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":". . .of essays, short stories, poetry, etc. by the Master of Fantasy, JRR Tolkien.In addition to a fragment of a play, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, etc., there is Tolkien's famous essay &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; which, in the mind of this reviewer, is the seminal work on what &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; actually are, how they are constructed -- and, most importantly, why people want to read and write them. The concept of man as &quot;sub-creator&quot; and the ultimate longing for the Great Escape is explored, as is the final resolution in the Gospel story. Surely a work of sheer brilliance.As an example of how &quot;Fairy Stories&quot; work, Tolkien provides the reader with his short story &quot;Leaf, by Niggle&quot;. Truly it is a gift.Anyone who wishes to truly understand Tolkien cannot be without this volume."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"Not really planned by Tolkien himself, A Tolkien Reader is more properly a Tolkien Sampler. It combines two of his shorter books (The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Farmer Giles of Ham) with other material Tolkien wrote through the years, including the dark and autobiographical allegory &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot;.Tolkien commentators usually hold out this book as a resource for his &quot;On Fairy-stories&quot; essay (actually the transcript of a lecture Tolkien delivered in the 1930s) and &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son&quot;. Both works are of narrow appeal, however, as they require a minimal knowledge of some scholarly details on the reader's part.&quot;On Fairy-stories&quot; and &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; were originally published as Tree and Leaf in 1964, but they don't really explain how Tolkien achieved The Lord of the Rings. He admitted that the story took on a life of its own, and he ended up incorporating several disparate works into the new mythology he was creating. LoTR fans who want to know more about Middle-earth will find the only relevant material is in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, a collection of several poems (of which only the first two actually deal with Tom). Tolkien included some explanatory notes.The Bombadil book was originally composed and produced so Tolkien could present his beloved aging aunt with a special volume in the last year of her life.

The poetry at the end is positively beautiful. An excellent anthology of Tolkien's lesser-known and shorter works."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"I received this book as a birthday gift, but I must confess it took the back burner, but only for a little while. I soon dug into it, an avid Tolkien fan, and found myself slogging through Tolkien's essay on Fairy stories.First in this edition is a great little summary and analysis of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, popular in its own right, but now immensely popular at the box office since New Line released the first two novels as major motion pictures. The summary is written by Peter Beagle. Yeah, I know, I never heard of him either, but he summarized the series pretty well, without spoiling anything, so you'll enjoy reading it.Then there's Tolkien's essay. The essay is somewhat long, and quite a hunk of literary philosophizing to bite off and chew . . . and it took me a while to chew. Once I got done, it was on to the more enjoyable things: Leaf by Niggle, the example and essence of all Tolkien wrote of in his essay, Farmer Giles of Ham, the story of the simple farmer whose one act of bravery, and the subsequent events made him a living legend, and the Adventures of Tom Bombadil.The Adventures of Tom Bombadil gives little insight into the mysterious character that we briefly encounter in the first novel in the Rings series, The Fellowship of the Ring. He is a merry man whom the four hobbits meet in dire trouble, and who helps them on their journey. (This is the man that many fans of the books were disappointed not to see in New Line's cinematic version) While he seams innocent enough in the book, it is obvious that underneath he carries power, some sort of power, the prevents him from being influenced by the Ring, and gives him authority to command tree and leaf. But you learn little more about this fascinating character in the stories in Adventures of Tom Bombadil. Indeed, that section of the book contains a few poems of the doings of Bombadil, and a few other poems as well, some of which readers of the Rings books will recognize, being sung by the hobbits in the books.Most of you will probably find Tolkien's essay rather dull and dry, but for the rest, it might be interesting to \\"get into\\" Tolkien's mind by reading this, and his insight into the realm of fantasy and tales. Most fans of the Lord of the Rings (and I'm talking FANS, not just movie-goers who liked the movie) will enjoy it, and if not the essay, then for sure the sections of stories and poems that follow."},{"Title":"The Tolkien Reader","review":"This is a collection of several of Tolkien's smaller works like his short stories.Most importantly, however, is that it contains his rather hard to find essay entitled&quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; and its demonstration : &quot;Leaf and Niggle.&quot; To appreciate more Tolkien'sother works (LOTR, etc.) I must recommed reading his essay.

The stories in this anthology come at you from angles and styles I suspect most readers did not expect. Nothing is sacred in this book, which is the point. Even his own style is different. I enjoyed his hilarious novel THE AZTEC LOVE GOD, so I expected his work in the anthology to be in the same humorous style as the novel. Wow, I was blown away by his story &quot;TAKE ME&quot; From Sombrero Hysteria. This is a very intense piece. Also, the excerpt from the late Omar Castaneda's novel ISLAS COLORADAS was equally intense. Once again, these styles are not what is typically thought of when you think of Latino Literature, so this anthology forces you to broaden your imagination about what writers can and should write about and how. But the styles also go back to the what Chicano Writing was about during the Chicano movement. Stephen D. Gutierrez's story &quot;La Gloria Meets La Helen en la Marqueta and What is Best Left Unsaid is for You&quot; is about two ex-cholas who meet up after many years. Even when these writers choose &quot;typical topics&quot; their styles update the tradition. The heresy is that nothing is sacred so that everything can be enjoyed. My other personal favorite piece was &quot;a latina lesbian activst's survial guide: o, mejor dicho, activism de-mystified, de-glorified &amp; de-graded&quot; by Tatiana de la Tierra. Even the introduction is not typical of anthologies. This one does not pound into your head a definition of Latino or Latino Literature. It lets the writing do the talking, and it challenges you to free your mind. If you enjoy strong prose, new styles, new ways of thinking, you need to check out this anthology."},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"Steamy, steamy scenes!!!!

I did not like all the revenge, the numerous characters and the depth she went into each character's history and the ending left me feeling as if I had wasted my time reading the book. The love scene portions of the book were typical Nan Ryan but the rest of the book...well let's just say it went to the Trade store the day I was finished with it."},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"It was an ok book - seemed like a recycle of the plot in \\"you belong to my heart\\". Dissapointing ending."},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"I liked that this book had a western theme... that's about it. There was love, but only in the beginning of the book. The rest was pig-headedness and lust. I also hated that this book just ended..."},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"I first read this book about 10 years ago. Since then I have read it at least 8 times. I like this book so much that I started looking for more books by Nan Ryan. I have now read 13 of her books. She is my all time favorite author and &quot;SunGod&quot; is my all time favorite book."},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"What a treat Nan Ryan's Sun God is! It is the first of her books for me to read and I am excited to see she has a rather large backlist. Sun God is mostly a dark romance - there are very few, if any, light moments in it. However, the leads have some serious negative history to work through. Most of the book is about revenge.Amy Sullivan is a very young sixteen during the opening pages of the book. She has just returned home to her beloved family's ranch in Texas after five years at school. Although she is anxious to see her father and two brothers, she has most missed Tonitiuh, a seventeen year old half breed (half Aztec - half Spanish) who she has adored all of her life. Tonitiuh is the Aztec name for the hero who's Spanish name is Luiz Quintano. Amy and Luiz's fathers are equal partners in a very successful ranch.Once Amy returns home, she and Luiz begin a dreamy love relationship - first love in all its beauty. When Amy's father dies suddenly, her two older brothers do not want to have the elder Spaniard as an equal partner and decide to run off Luiz, his only heir, first. As they are attempting to bind Luiz, his father interrupts and the Sullivan sons kill him. Then they whip Luiz and want to murder him as well since he is obviously someone very special to their sister. In an unbelievable play of events, the brothers bring Amy to see the trussed-up and whipped Luiz and seek to find out what Luiz means to her. Amy realizes how mean and awful her brothers really are and acts out her indifference and ill will towards Luiz in front of him. She even hits him once with the whip. Convinced that Luiz means nothing to Amy, they take him to the desert and leave him for the vultures. Amy believes she has possibly saved Luiz's life by pretending indifference for him. Luiz only sees her actions and hates her for it.Now the book skips ten years forward. A lot has happened at the Sullivan ranch since the river dried up immediately after Luiz's disappearance. The Civil War has come and gone. Amy is alone with the two remaining servants at the ranch. Luiz, now a Captain in the Spanish/Mexican army, brings his soldiers to the ranch and reclaims his half of it. Since the soldiers are presently inactive, the troops stay at the ranch and soon the river is flowing again. Luiz is seeing to the updating and repair of the rundown home. And Amy - so thrilled to see that Luiz is alive - finds she is a prisoner in her own home. Luiz refuses to believe any of Amy's explanations and is out for pure revenge with her. She is forced to share his bed and he is definitely an alpha male to the extreme. Gone is his kindness. Oh - he still exhibits his kindness to others but not towards Amy. This time of Luiz and his soldiers present at the ranch is the largest portion of the book. Many things happen to keep you reading the next page and yet the next page to see each new development. There are many sensual scenes and rate a 4.5 out of 5.0 (see More About Me for rating guidelines).Sun God is a moving book - sometimes a little heartbreaking. You wish that Amy and Luiz were a little more forgiving and truthful with one another. They play the hate game well which is one of my complaints about the book. They love at night and hate during the day. Although Luiz is a revengeful hero, you still are sympathetic to his character. It is a little harder to be as sympathetic towards Amy. She is hateful nearly all the time to Luiz. I couldn't help thinking that if she would only be kind and make him stand still long enough to listen to her, things would have proceeded a lot differently.Overall, Sun God is a superb book that I will keep to read again. Take heed - there is a mystical aura to Sun God. If that is not your usual taste, just ignore it. It adds a certain wistful, hopeful tone to a dark book. Although this is a definite five star rating in my mind, I still have another complaint that tempted me to rate this only four stars. The problem? The ending. It came too fast with so many situations playing themselves out within too few pages. The last 35 pages should have taken at least 100 pages. In addition, the leads work out their problems very late in the book. When reviewing a book, the period of positive growth in the romance is a very important criteria to me for a high rating. Knowing that, this had to be a pretty great book to make up for what I usually consider a serious flaw. But regardless, I eagerly am looking forward to the next Nan Ryan book which I have already purchased."},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"I read Sun God at 16 (nearly 10 years ago). It was the first romance I read. In the middle of the night during the summer I stumbled upon my mom's book: Sun God. As a naive 16 year old I made fun of mom for reading what I called &quot;smutty romance&quot;. But knowing everyone was sleeping that night I was intrigued by the very sexy man on the cover and opened the book. To my surpise I stayed up til day-break reading Sun God! I fell in love with Tonitiuh, (the hero). I cried, I smiled, my heart pounded with excitemnet, and flowed with warmth. I have never been more moved by a fictional story of any kind, even a movie. I feel in debt to Nany Ryan for writing Sun God. I have since read hundreds of &quot;smutty romances&quot; as I once called them. And as an English Writing Major, I would like to write my own romance in time. To this very day, at 25 years old SUN GOD is my ultimate favorite story. After reading the other reviews about this book last week I was inspired to pick up my old, yellowed copy. &quot;The Indian stood naked in the sunlight,&quot; the first line of the book, engulfed me once again. I re-read this WONDERFUL romance in only 2 days and grew sad as I had only a few pages left to turn. How I wish for a sequel, or even a TV mini-series! (Ms. Ryan I hope your reading this!) I told my mom to read Sun God again, becasue she would love it the second time as much as the first time. And I was right. I passed it to friends who turn thier noses away from romance novels, and guess what? They loved Sun God too! READ I!PS anyone who would like to chat about Sun God please email me."},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"Once I started reading The Sun God, I just couldn't get myself to put the book down. Nan Ryan, I commend you on this wonderful novel. Characters and Setting - incredibly romantic. This was only my first Nan Ryan book that I've read, and now I'm in search for more. I only wish this book had a sequel. I'm passing on this romantic book to my friends, already mentioning that I want it back. I recommend that a reprint be made. It even made my heart melt and my eyes tear, in fact, I was actually crying. Again, this is a must read book!"},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"As a devoted romance reader from as way back as 1980; I must say that SUN GOD is right up there with the best of them Susan Johnson &quot;Brazen&quot; is definately threatned. &quot;Watch Out Sue'.

It is a very intense book. WONDERFUL."},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"This was an awesome books. Out of all the romance books I've read, this one definitely had the most intense and descriptive \\"love\\" scenes. Amazing.However, I had two complaints about the book. First, I thought is was very odd that Amy's daughter Linda was hardly ever mentioned during the summer that Amy spent with Luiz. You would have thought, especially when she was captured, that she would have been thinking about her daughter and how she would have no mother if Amy was killed by the Apaches. But the book doesn't mention her one time during that summer. I thought that was very strange.The other complaint is that the end is very anticlimatic. There was this huge buildup and then all of a sudden, he's shot and now they admit they love each other all in the space of about two pages. Plus, the part where she reveals that Linda is his daughter was very disappointing. Nan Ryan should have had Linda just show up and then Luiz looks at her and realizes that it's his daughter. That would have been much more entertaining.Despite these complaints, I still thoroughly enjoyed the book and would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"A friend gave me a very worn copy of this paperback in high school (1991) ... I had never been into trashy romance novels and so it sat on my shelf for a few years, but when I read it I discovered it was a great book! Excellent writing, well-thought storyline, and a tale of great romance. Nan Ryan is now one of my favorite authors and this is my favorite book from her collection. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"One of the best romance novels I have ever read. The plot line keeps you turning the pages, as if you could stop. The characters are well-developed, and the passion and love they share for each other makes you dream of finding a love like this. The twists and turns also hold your interests, and the love scenes provided many hours of enjoyment. Far and beyond your average love scenes, this book borders on explicit - at times I had to make sure that I wasn't reading erotica! A great pick for lovers of Western and Native American romance - Nan Ryan proves she is the best!"},{"Title":"Sun God","review":"I first read this book about ten years ago.

His apartment's been robbed twice. His best friend Pete passed away. He was laid off from the play in which he had a lead role (and rehersals hadn't even started). His girlfriend Kate dumps him on New Year's Eve. And, Bobby Seale, his cat, died. What a way to bring in the new year!Feeling angry and sad, Jimmy decides to hole up in his apartment and to not answer the phone, knowing that if he'd been robbed twice, the burglar was sure to come back again. Enter Vito Antenucci, a bisexual burglar who returns for a third robbery. They struggle, and Jimmy knocks Vito out, then ties him to the kitchen counter.Throughout this New Year's Eve together, Jimmy discovers what he's been avoiding in his life and begins to understand that he and Vito aren't that different from each other in what they want from life. To Jimmy's surprise, he begins to find friendship with his captive.A few unexpected interruptions from people in Jimmy's life help to liven up this dark comedy from one of the writers of \\"A Chrous Line.\\" It's full of strong characters, even those with only minor roles such as Jimmy's Aunt claire, a rich spinster who sublty tries to control Jimmy's life, and Crazy Carmine, a drugged-out sex fanatic who's been trying to get into Jimmy's pants for years. It's the developing friendship between Jimmy and Vito that drives this story, though. I wanted them to get together at the end, either as friends or lovers, it didn't matter.I laughed out loud while reading some of the passages. Though it was written in the 1970's, the humor is defintiely NOT dated. If you're looking for some light, fun reading, then this is the perfect book for you."},{"Title":"P.S.

Your Cat is Dead","review":"This book is just one of Kirkwood's many, with insight to human behaviour. He could get you spell-bound with his phrases, descriptions, dialog. Talked on phone one time with him, and he talked just like he wrote. When he died, I almost stopped reading. His 'dead cat' is just one which displays his ability to make you 'see' the characters, and know them. He could make your stomach hurt from laughing, reduce you to tears, and make you realize just how precious we all are. His 'dead cat' should be taught in schools; perhaps it would encourage more compassion and humor into our daily, often-stressed lives. Mr. Kirkwood had a unique way of telling a story. One could almost reach out and feel the room, Vito, Jimmay...Bobby Seale (his real cat), and his selfishly-loving Aunt, whom he almost shot via Ma Bell. Tremendous book. I have had to tape my copy together; it's been shared so much. I would like to have his entire collection in my library. Must have read each one twenty times. I really miss his passing, and his gifts to humankind, in the name of satirical comedy-drama. What a guy! We've all had one of THOSE days when even getting up in the morning seemed like the wrong thing to do. He was so able to put these feelings in print, and make some sense out of it all. We shake our heads, and say, &quot;Yep, been there, Jimmy.&quot; I truthfully want to fill my library with all of his books, which will be hard, since a lot are out of print. Shouldn't be...he gave so much to us. Laughter is wonderful, and Mr. Kirkwood did his all to produce some belly-laughs, and some tears. And lots of insight to me. I understand my human contacts a lot better now. I am not alone when I say that James Kirkwood left a great legacy... himself. I watched him get a Grammy on t.v. from Kirk Douglas, for A Chorus Line. I was as thrilled as he was. I don't think anyone could put this book down after reading the cover. Too hilarious and touching...one of his many masterpieces. Ganoog is Ganoog.

I too 'lost' my (much taped and taped and taped) copy of this book (the fourth or fifth copy I had purchased, I might add!). This incredible author and his offbeat, engaging characters pulled me through some of the most difficult moments of my life and helped me to come out laughing and or crying (sometimes, both).

I laughed until I cried-for the main reason:(ala Vito) is that Kirkwood really brings out the humor of the most inane and rediculous variety! One page you are laughing, another your are crying. I don't believe they have done justice in the movies to his books(i.e. &quot;Some Kind of Hero&quot;- NOT the way I pictured Eddie-I refused to see it). Please Amazon !! Have the publishers reissue Kirkwood so future generations do not miss out on his &quot;vividness&quot;!!"},{"Title":"P.S. Your Cat is Dead","review":"The title put me off a bit when I first saw this book in the early 80s. But a glance at the first few pages got me hooked. Just the complete title is enough for a short story worth reading!;) Looking over the reviews, especially of the folks that came to this story in the last decade or so, made me wonder if my memory was slipping. I don't think so. I have shared this book with many people and the complete title with many more. Like the Chronicles of Narnia and The Forgotten Beasts of Eld I often keep spare copies to give away. Dated or not, it is a window to those still able to read when the world seems to be collapsing and it has helped several of us get through a tough spot. No, it doesn't solve any problems it can just let some of the pressure escape so breathing is maybe a little easier. And if the days aren't tough, it is still an amazing web of what an imagination run wild can create. It's not a major investment in either money or time so I would still recommend it happily."},{"Title":"P.S.

I was on the Blue Line in 1987, taking the train to high school. I started it on the bus and by the time I was on the train I was so entranced that I missed my stop. I missed it by 3 stops! I was laughing out loud. People were looking at me like I was insane. All I wanted to do was tell them what I had just read. I was actually crying from laughter! It was sooo invigorating! Such and extremely original story!! I couldn't wait to share with all my fellow readers. It was years before I was able to get another copy to actually give away. I now have my original copy with all its tape just barely holding the cover on and another copy that I loan out.

It was very special to him as it is very special to those who read it.Get your hands on a copy of this book and read it on one of those nights when you're feeling blue and ready to give up. During these times of unnerving Post 9/11 stress, what can be more empowering than the story of Jimmy and his gem of a New York City \\"burgler\\" named Vito?"},{"Title":"P.S. Your Cat is Dead","review":"I cannot see what all the great reviews are about. I spent 6 hours reading this book today, most of which made me want to bang my head against the wall. Every step of the way I complained about the different plot turns to my boyfriend, and aside from telling me to stop reading it, he said it sounds like an emotional roller coaster; I agreed, adding the kind that makes you puke. Not only did I not like the story line, but I thought the writing was horrendous. There were numerous grammar and spelling errors and a few instances of poetic license that should not have been made. I never laughed out loud, or even a little. At most, I smirked. Right when I thought it was starting to go from terrible to okay, it turned to crap again. The language wasn't funny, and neither were the stories. At times it sounded like an amateur teenager was the writer. I've never read about a break up or an argument with an ex, but I could imagine it (the reading) not being pleasant. This book proved that assumption correct. Note, and I can be quoted on this, a real break up or argument cannot be as painful as it was reading about his. Pages on top of pages of \\"you prick!\\" \\"no, you slut!\\" made it laborious to go on reading. Right when one of the characters became a tiny bit likable, the author did something to F it up.In the story, the character loses his manuscript. If that was really the case, he never should have rewritten it.p.s: I mean no disrespect towards the writer himself. This is the first book I've read by him, so it's not personal. As for my opinion, which is what most reviews are, these are the feelings I was left with after reading this book."},{"Title":"P.S. Your Cat is Dead","review":"I like Nora Ephron. Really. I thought When Harry Met Sally was quite a film, very cleverly written. Perhaps, however, I shouldn't hold Ms. Ephron in such high esteem that I immediately buy anything with her name on it. No, she didn't write PS Your Cat is Dead...but she did endorse it. And shame on you, Nora. This book made me laugh countless times, but never at anything the author intended to be humorous. Rather, I laughed at the sheer absurdity of the dialogue. Never have I heard people speak in the way these characters did. They were overly witty and brazen, as well as entirely one-dimensional. As much as I disliked this book, I would recommend it to self-declared \\"theatre types.\\" What they saw in Rent (the film, of course) I shall never know, but they will almost certainly find that same element in PS Your Cat is Dead."},{"Title":"P.S. Your Cat is Dead","review":"I'm reading other customer reviews - \\"The best book I've ever read\\" and \\"My favorite book of all time.\\" Still others have wildly praised the novel's comedic elements. Hmmmmmmm. I didn't get it. I felt that the basic plot premise was rather tragic. Sure it had a \\"happy\\" ending and there were a number of funny quips. However, this book is not \\"a laugh riot\\" - I never had one burst of uncontrolled laughter (as I have many times when reading books by Augusten Burroughs, David Sedaris and Dan Savage). I felt that the characters were contrived and the situation seemed forced. The physical writing is rather simplistic - there are no flurishes of great prose styling. The tough guy is gay and the artistic guy is straight. Alright, I can accept that. Why then does the author burden the straight guy with numerous gay stereo types like cleaning his apartment while listening to his original cast album of \\"Candide?\\" \\"Me thinks the lady duth protest too much.\\" Alright, straight guys can love musicals too. All I'm saying is that it just didn't ring true for me. I wanted to laugh a lot more. I didn't hate this novel, but I didn't love it either. I expected more based on the reviews of other readers. Oh, well."},{"Title":"P.S. Your Cat is Dead","review":"After seeing this book around I got a copy after checking the reviews here :) But what I found is a 1973 old book that has finally been printed post-mortem, with some dippy 1973 sensibilities like you can fix any problem by smoking some strong marijuana, or it's OK to snatch a purse if the victim can afford it. Then there's the homo/bi-sexuality part, one of the major themes of the book. I wasn't offended but I didn't care for it either. This book should make a great movie for the Brokeback Mountain crowd."},{"Title":"P.S. Your Cat is Dead","review":"I chanced upom this book probably fifteen years ago and it has remain a favorite every since. The two lead characters are so touchingly human you really empathize with them.

As a scared, deeply closetted gay teenager being able to see humor in my situation was a priceless gift."},{"Title":"P.S. Your Cat is Dead","review":"This slim novel was the basis for three play versions and remained one of James Kirkwood's personal favorites of his oeuvre. Based on his own life as an actor, it is the weird story of a second-rate soap opera star who catches a burglar in his apartment on New Year's, ties him up over the kitchen sink, and eventually bonds with him.Noted for its blatant scatology, it embodies many of Kirkwood's most important themes (the Cosmic Joker and the saving grace of true friendship). This play was about to be made into a movie in 1976, starring Sal Mineo as the cat burglar. Mineo's murder, on the way home from a rehearsal of PS, Your Cat is Dead, is a sad sidelight of the story. As the author once said, the novel is &quot;just a little kinky-dinky.&quot; Not for everyone"},{"Title":"P.S.

Kirkwood's others are very good, this one is beyond great. I was thrilled to see that it's now back in print after so many years of being out of print. Buy it, you'll love it.

When the burgler returns for a third time around, he is in for quite a surprise. This is not your traditional down-on-your-luck, catch a burgler and become friends story.

This is a story you will read over and over again!P.S. Your Cat Is Dead"},{"Title":"P.S. Your Cat is Dead","review":"I hesitate to sum this book up, for its nuances and innuendo are at once very clear and rather implied. In other words, the mark of a good book or movie is that it makes you think and wonder. This book makes you do both.The other good part is that I wanted to finish it, sooner rather than later, and gave up some much-needed beauty sleep to do it. So there is value in this book.This scenario involves a wretchedly unhappy and unsuccessful \\"sad sack\\" man who manages to catch, tie up, and proceed to torture the (gay) man who is attemtpting to burgle (is that a word?) his apartment for the third time. Once the tying up and pants-removing is done (don't ask,) where things go from there is anybody's guess, including an ex-girlfriend and a sexually-adventurous (maybe predatory) friend, who stop by.I didn't realize that this book was written in 1972 until after I had finished it. Yes, there are some sorta dated views and theories, along with some philosophies that hold up well in our \\"modern\\" and \\"enlightened\\" times. Certainly the knowledge of the age of this story helps to understand it, and many of the references to music went right over my head.It's not hard to figure out, but I felt the book was more mysterious underneath the surface than I expected, and not at all clear, for instance, about whether much of the burlgar's rantings were true, rooted in truth, or simply huge lies. I would have also liked a more definitive and clearer ending, but it's just a matter of taste. I think you can read into it whatever you want, and that was probably the author's intent.Overall, it's mostly pretty fascinating, and certainly is worth your time. I'd stop short of saying it was hilarious (I didn't think it was; amusing, yes, but hilarious, no.) I'd also stop short of saying it was a classic, but is something I found real hard to put down once I got going."},{"Title":"P.S.

A book or movie can just be something to enjoy without it having to be a great work of art. And that's what this book is.I have read this book dozens of times and have lost numerous copies I have lent out and never gotten back. When I have a friend who is having a rough time with life and seems to be giving up hope, I lend them this book. It is a silly, quirky story of a life gone wrong and the absurdity that happens that brings things back to reality. The moral...no matter how crazy and out of hand life gets, it usually turns out OK.

It's also a colorful and intriguing story of revenge, murder and the impact of cultural upheavals spanning a period of over sixty years.Knab was an anthropology professor in the early 70s at the National University of Mexico doing fieldwork in a small village in the Sierra de Puebla when he encountered authentic brujas and brujos who followed ancient traditions of sorcery and dreaming dating back to at least the Aztecs.Unlike Castaneda, Prof. Knab is fluent in Nahuatl, and records the actual ancient terms used for various practices, and for regions of the dreaming world--Talocan or Tlalocan--that witches need to visit to help cure their patients, or to inflict harm on their opponents and other witches. He also faithfully records and translates his Nahuatl conversations with his two primary informants, an elderly man and woman of the village--Innocente and Rubia--who had both practiced curing and witchcraft for over 50 years. Unlike the supposed metaphysical and philosophical discourses of don Juan (especially in Castaneda's later books), these conversations are what one would expect of someone coming from this kind of cultural milieu.Probably the most fascinating aspect of the book for Castaneda readers is the detailed descriptions of dream journeys that Prof. Knab is instructed in by his two informants. These sections of the book describe a realm that has a geography and consistent features that have supposedly been experienced by generations of Aztec-descended brujos.Knab's instruction and interaction with his informants described in the books takes place over a three-year period, from the fall of 1974 to the fall of 1977, but it also eventually leads him to unravel a dark tale of witchcraft and intrigue in the same region in the 1920s that ultimately led to dozens of deaths attributed to witchcraft. These killings, which occurred over a period of about a decade, were ultimately brought to an end only when the townspeople literally crucified one of the alleged witches."},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"This book contains invaluable information about crucial elements of Aztec ritual life, including those of the tonalli, nahualli, the animal guardians, and the great flower of darkness, the Talocan ; there are many wonderful descriptions of the syncretic blend of the pre-Colombian and the Catholic and quite specific descriptions of the ancient technique of Dreaming, used to navigate in the harsh and often unforgiving underworld. The story is told by a master raconteur who introduces us to two wily and remarkable teachers of the old ways, Inocente and Rubia. In a masterful sweep of the history of a small town in the Sierra de Puebla we get to see their roles in the havoc caused by the tension between the indigenous peasants and the mestizo rulers in which the former's only defense were the ancient techniques of &quot;snuffing the candles of the unjust&quot;. K's prose allows the reader to revel in the evocative beauty of Nahuatl and it evokes one's respect and affection for the people he is writing about (in short, this is anthropology at its best). I recommend the book to people interested in exploring the thin line between the real and the imaginary, reality and dreams, and to those who like to witness how the new world and the old world can meet in the spirit of respect, strength and mutual enrichment."},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"This is the tale of a very science-minded anthropologist who begins a long and ultimately life-changing spiritual journey, under the tutelage of an elderly Curandera. He learns to accomodate his scientific beliefs with the reality he encounters as a healer in this ancient tradition, just as his teacher accommodates her ancient faith with Catholic beliefs.It provides a window into the form that the Aztec spirit world takes (and how its priest/esses approach that world), as well as demonstrating how we in the modern world can coexist with the sacred and the secular."},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"This book has many parallels with the writings of Carlos Castaneda such asThe Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, The Original Teachings in a Deluxe 30th Anniversary EditionandSeparate Reality. Both authors were anthropologists and studied Mesoamerican old shamanism and witchcraft as it was still practiced in Mexico in the 1960s and 1970s. Both authors study and describe a similar underworld, world of dreams, and the supernatural.However, Carlos Castaneda is a far superior writer. He is a gripping story teller. His main mentor, Don Juan, jumps out of every page with vivid mythical proportion. Their counterparts, Rubia and Inocente, in this book really pale by comparison. They are dying or delirious elderly beings far from the top of their game. They go on and on about speculative and boring dream interpretations. As a result, the story has a hard time getting off the ground. The second half of the book gets more interesting as it reaches back into the past when Rubia and Inocente were more vibrant and human. Their struggle in defending the agricultural culture of their village against the greedy economic interest of usurping outsiders (coffee growers) is pretty good. But, this may be too late for many readers.Giving Knab the benefit of the doubt, maybe the difference between Castaneda and Knab is the difference between fantasy and reality. We all know Castaneda's writings are most controversial and not well accepted in anthropological circles. In other words, anthropologists have accused Castaneda of making it all up. Knab's writing so far has not suffered such an ill fate. The Acknowledgment section of the book suggests Knab is on strong scholar footing. But, is Knab's book more credible than Castaneda's because of his lack of relative notoriety? I can't readily answer this question. At this stage, I may accept that Castaneda is a far more entertaining fiction writer. Meanwhile, Knab's duller prose may be better grounded in reality. Sometimes that's just the way it is. Reality is a bit duller than fiction."},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"This book was for an anthropology class and ended up being a fast-paced read with plenty to keep you glued until the very last page. It read like a crime novel or other riddle to solve, but was very eye-opening into the contemporary world of Mexican Aztec peoples today and how they have coped within their mix of Christianity and Aztec religions and with their micro and macro worlds. A must read for any anthropolgy major or someone interested in a different perspective on spirituality and beliefs. Thoroughly engaging throughout."},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"A wonderful, involving journey into the midst of a modern Aztec blood fued. Knab does a sensational job of keeping this story very technical while at the same time creating a very tangible sense of dread and even terror."},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"When Timothy Knab visits the small village of Sierra de Puebla he encounters ancient Aztec beliefs and traditions that are still being practiced today. Despite the fact that many of the villagers claim that \\"all the witches died years ago\\", he finds that quite a few of the villagers participate in what many would call witchcraft. And many of the people depend on these practicioners for healing and for justice.Knab's journey takes him to the Aztec underworld, a mirror-like world beneath our own, where he finds his nagual, or animal counterpart, gains support from lost souls, and confronts the afterlife. Here, one gets the sense of how the Mesoamerican cultures relate to the afterlife and the supernatural--the line that separates the two worlds are blurred and thin.As Knab's story is told, a dark history of the village unfolds that involves the War of Witches--an incident in which many of the townspeople are reluctant to talk about.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"The author, Dr. Knab, believes a great many things. He provides the reader no particular reason to believe them, but he sure does. For example, when a child's ill health and malaise is said by the author to look like \\"a classic case of soul loss,\\" one understands remotely that he really does believe in such things, as if he were an anthropologist who really had come to believe that photographs can steal the soul.Of course, he is not completely credulous, this is a man of SCIENCE, I shouldn't caricature him as believing that photographs steal your soul. That would be absurd. He simply believes that witches can steal your soul.Unless you have a curandero, such as Dr Knab himself, to protect you from the witches and their soul-stealing ways. He has, the book jacket boasts, become a curandero himself. He is, shall we say, a very empathetic anthropologist. One wonders if he would have adopted the beliefs of the cargo cults if he had happened to study them. One is glad that he didn't decide to study, say, the Klan or the Khmer Rouge.At any rate, the book is filled with the decade-old memories of tales told of half-century-old memories and rumors of events claimed to be literally true. Their truth is important--if this is just folklore, then the whole crux of the book is undermined, namely, that he has uncovered real Aztec witchcraft being carried out.Within the frame tale of Knab's learning the ways of dreaming and curing is the historical tale that needs to be true--basically a murderous feud in which the murders were done with exotic techniques such as the \\"shadow of death,\\" the \\"jaguar's claw\\" and so on--the classic stuff of delightful B-movies. Towards the end, as the 'revelations' come tumbling out too quickly to follow or to care about, the author summarizes one of the versions of these tales in a sentence that I found hilarious, as it basically summarized the storytelling method of this book: \\"The tale was fantastic but probably quite accurate.\\" No further comment. Say what? Why quite accurate? What could it possibly be about the tale of witchings and murders he has just recounted that would make it seem any more accurate than any other version that he might have heard? He does not say. What details had the ring of truth for him? He does not say.He does not say WHY that particular version seemed accurate, he just says it must have been accurate. He provides the answer without ever really delving into the question. He doesn't inquire into the accuracy of what he has heard, he just announces it.Well, he may have thought it had the ring of truth, but for me, nothing in this book had the ring of truth.It had the ring of delusion."},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"Picking this book off the book shelf, I began to read this purely because of the fact I wanted to broden my reading selections and read about something I have never read before. I was astonished to discover the immense liking I developed for the story Knab told of the modern Aztecs. I am not an anthropologist at all, but if a 15 year old teen can like a book like this, then it must be good! It was a history book, murder story, mystery story, and personal narrative all in one, and a true story to top it off!!"},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"I was actually assigned this book for my Sociology of Religion class.

Awesome book!"},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"This is an excellent book, written by a legitimate anthropologist. During his stay in Mexico, Timothy Knab learned from an old curandera, a wise woman or healer of sorts, who springs from a tradition of fusing Native American shamanism of the Aztecs with the mysticism of the Catholic Church brought over by the Spaniards. This is an excellent book, showing the modern day Aztecs and their religious beliefs from the perspective of a westerner. An excellent read, even if you know almost nothing about the Aztecs."},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"Look under 'Knab, T' for his other book, 'A Scattering of Jades: Aztec Poetry . . .'"},{"Title":"A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs","review":"I find THE DIALOGUE OF EARTH AND SKY (2004) more interesting than this earlier story of the Aztecs beliefs by this same writer. It's a more in-depth study of the modern Aztec underworld in Mexico and the dreams which may heal and cure souls removed by these witches.In this real-life mystery, he tried to be a healer to restore a child's soul (tonal). The thing to make me want this book was his 'dedication' \\"For the white-haired woman who insisted I embrace her tradition,\\"as it shows how some educated people respect and honor white-haired women. In the Indian culture, the woman is the head of the tribe, not the chief. We have a \\"sculpture\\" bust of a Cherokee woman in the courtyard of the old Whittle complex, now a federal court system.It proves that a white-haired woman has more wisdome than a 48-yr-old male who has maybe two years more of college education than she. Liife is an education, and reading will educate a person more than any teacher. I know, because I was married to a college professor and have two sons who are college professors, one a PhD, two wives of those sons with PhDs.It does not take a degree, though I do have one, to make an educated person and certainly not one to write short columns. Now that last, extra long (with some duplication -- after all, it was written over a period of three weeks) article was scholarly and I asked him, \\"When did you get so good?\\" Four years ago, it was too many \\"that's\\" which caused me to start criticising my favorite writer. How on earth could he go from that state to one of scholarly discourse with very few \\"that's\\"? Did he listen to this white-haired woman and study a bit of grammar on the side? I doubt it as he is too busy following local bands along on the Amtrack as a groupie and writing weird things about New Orleans where his son is in school.The Mother Mary stature is showed on the title page of this book with other religious symbols. Yet, this book is not about religion, but about the devil's work. It would take an actual devil to steal a child's soul. Children are born with a purity we lose only in adolescence. I had thought at one time that my youngest son was a 'bad seed.' and sometimes still wonder how he got to be so bad. He was, after all, brought up in the United Methodist Church.Timothy Knab is an Amreican anthropologist who has become an expert on the Aztecs and regales us about the dark past of San Martin. Since I graduated from Martin Methodist College in Pulaski, Tennessee, perhaps some of San Martin's devilishness entered my body (not the soul) as I've had to deal with voodoo at the last place I lived here, and the devil incarnate followed me from there to here. God works in mysterious ways and will protect the innocent and pure at heart. Devils are here to test our beliefs and to transform some into bad, bad people who become non-human. You can see it in their eyes."},{"Title":"Thomas Edison: The Fort Myers Connection (FL) (Images of America)","review":"What a disappointment!

Its most outstanding representative was Ludwig von Mises and its leading thinker in recent memory was Murray Rothbard. Both von Mises and Rothbard wrote substantial treatises on economics. However, there haven't been many introductory works. (Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson focuses more on government intervention than prices, the evenly rotating economy and capital theory.)Gene Callahan has remedied that situation with this excellent introductory work. Written in the style of Rothbard, Callahan provides a primer on methodology, economic theory, and a critique of government intervention. The examples are always vivid and at times humorous.After finishing this book, the reader should tackle Rothbard's Man, Economy and State. Then he should try von Mises's Human Action. Human Action isn't easy, but it will present the reader with the acedmic and theoretical rigor of the Austrian school's greatest exponent. For an introductory work that is more basic that Callahan's, David Gordon's An Introduction to Economic Reasoning is excellent."},{"Title":"Economics for Real People: An Introduction to the Austrian School","review":"Callahan (and the Austrian school in general) explain economics in terms of human action rather than the abstract and sometimes obtuse models of classical economists. Beginning with the simplest possible scenario, a single human acting in isolation, Callahan builds a hypothetical society and uses it to explain the crucial concepts of economics in a style and language that should be accessible to anyone who has completed high school.He explains the concept of subjective valuation with his individual on the island, then begins adding people and concepts. He quickly takes us through direct exchange, a refutation of the labor theory of value, the introduction of money (including the explanation of the criteria that make something a good choice to use as money), time preference (and how the interest rate serves as the &quot;price&quot; of a time preference), and so on. In the second half of the book he explains concepts that are a bit more abstract - how do central banking and fiat money work? What causes the business cycle? How does a free market system handle externals (benefits or consequences imposed upon those not party to an exchange -e.g. water pollution).Throughout it all, Callahan cogently makes the case for a truly free market as the only means of efficiently satisfying the desires of a society's members.There are things I would have liked Callahan to cover better, for instance, a greater discussion of how the neo-classical economists work, and how their theories influence media reporting of economic issues (think about all the indicators that we are bombarded with in the business section of the paper). However, I don't see how he could have covered that material while keeping the book small and readable. He does give an extensive bibliography for those wishing to further investigate particular points.A handy appendix gives the five page version of the history of the Austrian movement. It seems foolish to say this with it only being April, but I expect this will be the best book I read this year. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Economics for Real People: An Introduction to the Austrian School","review":"That's why you're reading this review. You know you want to. Hit that one-click button. Are you tired and confused by what passes for economics these days? Did you sit in class in college and wonder what the heck was going on? Do you believe people can't think in graphs and algebraic equations? Do you believe if you took all the economists in the world and laid them in a line they'd still all point in different directions? If you answered \\"yes\\" to these questions then you'd be interested in the Austrian school of economics (the only school, by the way, that predicted the Great Depression). And Gene's book is an excellent introduction to that school. Of course, you can just bypass this book and go straight to Ludwig von Mises, the grandmaster of the Austrian school, and read his magnum opus, the 1000+ pages _Human Action_...nah, don't do that, at least not yet.

Even if you are already familiar with the Austrian School, the book is useful because it puts in one place the latest refutations of objections to the most important, and timely, Austrian insight, the Business Cycle Theory. The rest of the book is also excellent in its consistent application of the theory of subjective value, the foundation of the Austrian School. I personally love the way the author uses quotes right from Austrian masters to reinforce his points.For the novice, there are few places to gain a firm grasp on real economics so quickly and painlessly, it's a complete first-year course.

Objective value, the Austrians contend, is an illusion. Nothing has economic value in and of itself; rather, \\"things are valuable because acting humans consider them to be so.\\" (pg. 25)Besides this emphasis on subjective valuation--not surprisingly--economists of the Austrian school see the individual human being as the alpha and the omega of economic phenomena. That is why Mr. Callahan cleverly decided to start this book with the scenario of a man stranded on an uninhabited island. To the Austrians--Ludwig von Mises in particular--this is the ideal setting to learn the basics since economics is rooted in purposeful human action. The lone man facing an uncertain future, saddled by the limitations the island presents and by his own limited knowledge and skills must somehow make do and survive. He must use the scarce resources available--his time and knowledge being the scarcest--and make wise economical choices if his goal is to survive long enough to be rescued. Every decision that he makes towards that end will involve trade-offs; he has to weigh the costs and benefits of every action and aim to profit from his effort. Callahan says that economics studies the consequences of choice, and his island scenario perfectly illustrates this; moreover, the choices taken in this economy of one lead to one of the clearest explanation I've ever read concerning marginal utility.Because economics is rooted in human choice and value is subjective, Austrians see \\"Political solutions to questions of value...\\" as inimical to freedom and economic principles. Perhaps more important, this subjectivity of value ultimately means that \\"you're as wealthy as you think you are,\\" and questions like, \\"Am I wealthier if I have more cash in the bank, or more time to spend with my children?\\" cannot be answered by government planners or by economists, but only by you.Economics for Real People is an important book that deserves careful study and a wide audience."},{"Title":"Economics for Real People: An Introduction to the Austrian School","review":"This book provides an introduction to Austrian economics which is sometimes funny to read.The first parts lay the philosophical (logical) foundations of Austrian economics and build up a picture of the market economy. This is done by looking at a person living alone on an isolated island (like Robinson Crusoe). Later more people, goods, and money are introduced. In my opinion, this is one of the best explanations of Ricardo's \\"Law of Comparative Advantage\\" and the history of money.According to Austrian economics, the market process does never establish a general equilibrium. Sure, there will sometimes be equilibria in distinct markets, but these cannot last for long. The price informs entrepreneurs of new profitable undertakings, thus destroying the equilibrium. New data will have the same effect. The price will cause entrepreneurs to gradually adjust to their customers' wishes. There is thus no need for a general equilibrium (nor does is actually exist) as in conventional economics for the market process to be beneficial. Unlimited information, perfect competition, and instantaneous action aren't necessary either. The market process consists of learning, discovering opportunities, and adapting to new information. Austrian microeconomics is much more realistic than neoclassical models. (You might guess from this that there are no figures of demand and supply curves within this book. Your guess is correct.)Later parts introduce the government and show its role in manipulating prices and money, regulations, minimum wages, etc. Callahan's explanation of inflation and deflation is much better than in conventional economics textbooks. The market process will destroy monopolies, because their profits attract new competitors. Only monopolies privileged by the government will survive. Therefore, Austrian economics rejects antitrust laws.The \\"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\\" states that recessions are caused by central banks via manipulation of interest rates. Artificially low interest rates cause entrepreneurs to think that there are a lot of savings which they can use for investments. Later on, the central bank detects an \\"overheating economy\\" and raises the interest rates, thereby initiating a recession during which unemployment is likely to occur. According to Austrian economics, all agents (consumers, capitalists, workers, and entrepreneurs) have a time preference which causes aggregate savings and investment to equal in the loan market. The resulting price for time is the interest rate. If the central bank alters the interest rate, the capital structure of the economy (consumption today versus future consumption via investment) is distorted and does not correspond to consumers' wishes any longer. The subsequent recession merely restores the normal structure of capital. Thus the problem is the artificial boom and not the inevitable bust following it. Callahan considers critics of the \\"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\\" and refuses them by pointing to their fallacies. In my opinion, the \\"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\\" seems to be correct. It is much better than the conventional theories we discussed at university.I recommend this book to all readers interested in economics. It is especially illuminating for students of economics."},{"Title":"Economics for Real People: An Introduction to the Austrian School","review":"The author writes in any engaging style and uses many of the same instructional models used in the \\"canon\\" of Austrian economics.

My understanding is that it has been widely repudiated by the economic community. Wow."},{"Title":"Economics for Real People: An Introduction to the Austrian School","review":"(Truth in advertising: 0 out of 4 libertarian readers found any value in the following review.)Economics for Real People is a clearly-written overview of \\"Austrian\\" economics, a super-libertarian school of economic thought founded by thinkers from Central Europe in the early 20th century. The first chapters are devoted to methodology, price theory, money, capital, and the the role of the entrepreneur. These chapters are interesting and lucid (and witty), as are later chapters dealing with the business cycle.Unfortunately, author Callahan stumbles badly when he deals with practical policy issues or cases of market failure. Here, the book falls into the familiar lapses that have made \\"Austrian\\" synonymous with \\"crackpot\\" in many circles. Contrary to Callahan, Consumer Reports is not a substitute for the National Transportation Safety Board, the minimum wage cannot be evaluated without knowing the elasticity of demand for labor, the concept of a public good is not meaningless just because it's fuzzy on the margins, etc., etc. The Austrian tendency to answer all economic questions by citing first principles -- ignoring careful analysis of how particular markets function in practice -- is on full display in these sections.Economics for Real People would be a good book to supplement an introductory college course in neo-classical economics (along with a book on Marxist economics). However, Callahan's failure to engage with neo-classical economics or to consider non-Austrian views seriously makes it a bad introduction to economics as understood by the vast majority of practitioners.Footnote: To put Mr. Bryars' review in context (see above), readers should look at Appendix A of Economics for Real People, where Callahan writes that Menger founded the Austrian School in 1871 but then notes: \\"It was [Bohm-Bawerk's] research and writing that solidified the status of the Austrian School as a unified way of looking at economic problems.\\" Bohm-Bawerk wrote in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and presided over a famous seminar in Vienna from 1903 to 1913. The seminar's most illustrious student, Ludwig von Mises, put the final touches on the Austrian \\"system\\" with his theories about the business cycle and socialist calcuation. Mises later emigrated to the U.S. and become the object of posthumous cultish websites referenced by Mr. Bryars. Bottomline: Readers should ignore the Austrian School's more argumentative devotees (and critics) and read Callahan's book instead. But take it with a grain of salt.Footnote II: At the risk of continuing a dialogue with Mr. Bryars that has little to do with Economics for Real People (but which may entertain Amazon customers):-- Re the minimum wage, readers should consult Card and Krueger's NBER Working Paper no. 4509 (1994), which researches the impact of minimum wage hikes in one industry (fast foods). The conclusions don't support the usual Austrian/libertarian position. Many Austrians frown on empirical research (for reasons that are too theological to discuss here), but purely as a matter of theory, if the demand for low wage labor is sufficiently inelastic, a hike in the minimum wage can steer extra income towards the working poor even though it eliminates a few jobs.-- Re Rothbard on Mises, Rothbard once wrote: \\"[Mises] solved all the problems and inconsistencies that I had sensed in economic theory...Never would Mises compromise his principles, never would be bow the knee to a quest for respectability or social or political favor. As a scholar, as an economist, and as a person, Ludwig von Mises was a joy and an inspiration, an exemplar for us all.\\" I found this quote at -- surprise! -- the Ludwig von Mises Institute website.Jousting with libertarian strangers is fun but life is short.

The course was titled, &quot;Technically Christian: The Internet and Christianity.&quot;\\"Quentin Schultze has a dark, pessimistic view of technology,\\" were the words spoken by one of my classmates regarding this book. I immediately disagreed with him. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that I both agree and disagree with him. I agree that at first glance, Schultze does indeed seem to have a pessimistic view of the Internet, but I actually appreciate the so-called \\"dark\\" view that he presents. In fact, I do not perceive it as \\"dark;\\" I would choose to use the word \\"realistic\\" to describe Schultze's view.Schultze writes, \\"In the Hebrew tradition, faithful people seek shalom--right relations of peace and justice.\\" (70) It seems that he does not wish to do away with technology, he simply wants people to use technology in a way that fosters shalom. Many of the people who use the latest technology, especially the internet, maintain anonymity as they surf. Their anonymity often seems to encourage people to exhibit behavior and attitudes that would never be displayed in their day-to-day lives. Schultze calls people into reflection on their own behaviors and invites them into an attitude of self-accountability. Such self-examination and accountability is not only healthy, but it can serve to encourage people to seek new and wholesome ways in which existing (and cutting edge) technology can be used.\\"The sad truth is that we are not interested so much in rebinding brokenness in life as we are in enjoying greater power and control.\\" (73) When I read this statement, only one word came to mind: sin. Sin brings imperfection to every human institution, including the technological realm. Not only does technology lead people to ignore the call to shalom, it can also feed individuals' desire for power and control. Even viewing religious services over television is a way of seeking control; after all, if we don't like what is being preached, we can turn off the television! But how many people would \\"turn off\\" their own pastor by simply getting up and walking out of a church service?Generally speaking, rules of etiquette within our society do not allow people to simply walk out of church in the middle of a service; televised worship services, or websites found on the internet, can encourage self-centeredness as people who are made uncomfortable by the proclamation of an offensive Gospel-a message which, by the way, should be offensive-maintain their own comfort by refusing to hear the message being proclaimed.Human wisdom is key to discerning appropriate uses for technology, according to Schultze. Throughout this book, he discusses many situations in which wisdom and discernment and wisdom. Unlike the individual who noted the \\"darkness\\" in this book, I find it hopeful and encouraging. There are indeed no \\"fixes\\" offered; the individual is invited into self-examination and discernment. In examining the so-called \\"dark\\" side of technology, perhaps we can find enlightening ways in which to use technology in a helpful, healthy, wholesome manner."},{"Title":"Habits of the High-Tech Heart: Living Virtously in the Information Age","review":"Dr. Schultze eloquently unmasks the successes of technology to show how values have been displaced. He does not treat technology itself as an evil, but he does spell out the Pyrrhic victory in store for us in our never ending quest for faster messaging and the overzealousness of capturing information.Dr. Schultze offers some sobering thoughts for chief information officers in all industries as well as the CEO's. He has managed to focus on the very heart of what our technical world has done to unravel the cloth of our character. It was uplifting and encouraging for me after 20 years in the industry to realize that others are noticing this trend - a trend that needs reversal. His observations align well with the reasons many software engineers are looking at agile programming practices (e.g. extreme programming, SCRUM etc) which establish their foundations on direct interaction between developers, nurturing the courage to do the right thing and realizing the basic humanity of developers themselves.In pure economics alone, we are finding the deception of our quest for more computing capacity. While upholding Moore's law to double computing capacity every eighteen months, industry has also realized that the cost of research and development has doubled every 18 months as well. Basic arithmetic tells us there will be a breaking point. Dr. Schultze tells us without explicitly doing the math we can look into our hearts and see another breaking point - a breaking point of common decency and the human spirit."},{"Title":"Habits of the High-Tech Heart: Living Virtously in the Information Age","review":"Living virtuously in the information age is an interesting thought. Quentin Schultze truly gives us something to think about in the Habits of the High-Tech Heart: Living virtuously in the information age. He spends the entire span of the book telling us that we should not \\"adopt every new information technology uncritically...\\" He also states in the preface, \\"My goal is not so much to discard database and messaging technologies as much as to adopt them to venerable ways of life anchored in age-old virtues.\\" However I do not believe he has done this. He paints a clear picture of how the technology is something we need to be very critical of, and how it will effect our lives. He tells us that we need to question how this goes beyond \\"addressing annoying glitches and short-term inefficiencies. We also have to examine deeper moral issues, such as moderation, wisdom, humility, and authenticity.\\" He never tells us in all of this how we are to do this. He never shines a light of hope that technology is not the spawn of the devil and we should destroy it and run as quickly as we can. Ok maybe I over stated this a little bit. He does not say we should run from technology, but rather except it not so unabatedly, but with some apprehension. He never in all of this helps us to see how this could be done with technology and living a virtuous life. He said himself that he struggles with this. I believe this is something that we as the current and future leaders of our faith bodies needs to figure out. Dr. Schultze says \\"a servant hears the call to responsibility, listens to those being served, and then ministers to them.\\" We need to do this with the technology. My wife has said that if we get rid of the technology in the churches, or as Dr. Schultze says \\"de-technologize\\" our churches, then how are we going to reach the \\"entertain me\\" group. We are living in the time when every around us wants what ever it is now. We live in the era of microwaves, and fast computers. We do not want to wait, and if it is boring I want nothing to do with it. We as leaders of the church need to know this and account for it. We have moved beyond the age of the Baby Boomers. We need to know how to get the people in the pews, not for the sake of numbers, but for their sake. They will not come to church when the chips are down, or their lives are in the pits, because most of them do not know the church. They were not raised in a church family; they did not attend church on a regular basis, more than likely. So how do we get these people to come in and listen to what we have to say? We need to meet them where they are. We need to be in that hurry up and entertain me mind frame. How ever in doing this we need to heed Dr. Schultze. We can not run head first into the internet and new technologies in our churches without examining them first. We need to have ourselves grounded in a morally virtuous life, and then we can figure out this new technology and how it can work in our churches, and how we can make our church work on the web. If the internet is a new culture, and if it is possible to create a community in a culture, then we should be able to create community on the internet. For many in today's society, this is probably where they would turn when the troubles come. This is why we can talk about the inherent evils in being uncritical of new technology and how it will effect us and everyone around us, who we are in community with, but it also, shows how we can not stand by and let what is happening technology wise pass us by. If we as leaders do not embrace technology in some way I believe we are signing the termination papers for ourselves and the Christian community as we know it. Dr. Schultze gives us a place to begin to question the technology around us, and how it will affect our lives as moral, virtuous human beings, but this is only the beginning. Technology will have an effect on us, even if we as a church choose to de-technologize ourselves. It will affect us, because we did not do anything with it. It will affect us by having more people turn away from the light of the world, and to their computer screens to find the filler for the whole in their lives. While technology is something that Dr. Schultze, and I fully agree, says we need to be critical of, I believe that if we do not embrace it, we will be hurting ourselves, and not being true to our marching orders of Matthew 28:19 \\"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,\\". We need to go and meet the people where they are. So embrace it, critically, but embrace it."},{"Title":"Habits of the High-Tech Heart: Living Virtously in the Information Age","review":"There's a lot of passion in this book. You can feel that Schultze earnestly wants change from an increasingly shallow, dismissive society that has developed a tendency to cling to superficiality. And he presents a good case for a lot of the points that support that view of society. But some of his examples and discussions have a tendency to fall flat--they miss a crucial aspect of the technology they discuss; they hit only the negative aspects of a situation without addressing the positive; or they focus on the extremes of a behavior rather than a more moderate practitioner. It seemed that there were also some issues where, rather than looking for broad support for the issue, Schultze would cite a single source repeatedly to address it.This book was frustrating because you _could_ see the veracity of a number of issues that Schultze brought up, but, at the same time, they were intermixed with more dubious issues. Furthermore, rather than addressing the issues as he brought them up, the author spent seven chapters painting a gloom-and-doom picture in which you desperately _wanted_ to know how to address these problems, and then, in a rushed final chapter, he provided a general series of solutions (the titular habits) that address the issues only indirectly. (\\"Each one is suggestive rather than definitive, since I, too, am lost in the digital miasma.\\") In fact, the book is less about the habits than about the perceived problems that Schultze suggests that the lack of these habits create--and, unfortunately, it feels as though the causality link can be rather tenuous at times during the book.Much of the book is hit-or-miss. Some valid points well worth considering are brought up, but amidst other points that are weakly or speciously argued and considered. The conclusion itself feels somewhat lacking: although the societal problems may indeed result from individual failings, there is a lack of a sense of how to propagate the solution-habits to a level where they are effectual instead of leaving islands of attempted virtue in a societal sea that is more virtual, as well as a lack of conviction that the habits will address everything that's been raised."},{"Title":"Habits of the High-Tech Heart: Living Virtously in the Information Age","review":"Informationism derails any quest for moral wisdom by emphasizing the is over the ought, observation over intimacy, and measurement over meaning.This well thought out book lays bare the concern that without thoughtful use of technology it can and does produce a world in which human and humane concerns suffer.

I had to stop reading, after several poems; Pablo Neruda's love poetry was so intensely powerful that it overwhelmed my senses. He wrote brilliantly and passionately of the feelings of his soul, at once enthralling yet brutally candid. You suffered along him, you loved the woman he loved. The verses he wrote express the ineffable and indescribable. And the earthly images he creates are potent, almost too potent.

I don't even know how to describe Pablo Neruda. When you read his poetry you just become entranced by the way he is so accurately able to convey such passion in his simple words and beautiful imagery. Even now after I have read each poem in this book at least a hundred times I am still amazed by the way he does it.

Whether he imagines himself as an insect making a journey &quot;from your hips to your feet&quot;, traveling to distant places with his beloved by his side, or as a soldier who must leave but whose love will &quot;go on singing until the end of life&quot;, Neruda writes with exquisite simplicity, and great beauty.I find this to be the most accessible of Neruda's books that I have read, perhaps because its subject was a central part of his life. As explained in the introduction of the book, these poems are autobiographical, and written about his wife, Matilde Urrutia. First published anonymously in 1952, they were released in 1963 under his own name, but only after much thought, because of their &quot;intimate birth&quot;.The translations by Donald D. Walsh are superb. He has captured the fluid rhythm, the emotion, and the fire.He was fortunate to have had this remarkable relationship, as well as the ability to express his feelings with such uncommon depth, but for those men who lack Neruda's poetic genius, and who would like to melt the heart of the woman they love, this might be the perfect gift to go along with that bunch of flowers."},{"Title":"The captain's verses: (Los versos del capitan) (A New Directions book)","review":"I bought this book because for the long time I wanted to read something by Neruda, and this bilingual edition offered an opportunity to read the original Spanish alongside with the English translation. Since I know a bit of Spanish, this was an opportunity to practice it and improve it, as well as get exposed to some of the most sensual and inspiring poems in any language. Neruda's idiom is rich with metaphors, and he takes everyday objects and situations and imbues them with poetic and emotional undertones. This fascination with common objects is particularly useful for someone who is learning Spanish - it provides a great and enjoyable vocabulary-building opportunity. However, be warned - some phrases and words are a bit risque, and you shouldn't be too liberal at trying to impress your Spanish speaking friends at parties. It may lead to some interesting situations."},{"Title":"The captain's verses: (Los versos del capitan) (A New Directions book)","review":"Pablo Neruda was the greatest poet of our time, in my opinion.There are few poets whose works can be just as effective when translated, yet because of his brilliant use of simple words, his poems are breathtaking pieces of art in both languages(eng/span)!

But there aren't a whole lot of Troubadour or Trouv&egrave;re anthologies available in print, especially ones with music. And this is an excellent anthology, beautifully produced on light cr&egrave;me-colored 250-year acid-free paper. It's probably the next best thing to owning G, R, X, or W, one of the 4 existing Troubadour chansonniers with music. Notation is mostly the enlightened non-metrical variety proposed by Hendrik van der Werf: noteheads only, with neumes indicated by slurs. The page layout is spacious and delightful, with side-by side text and translation of Old Occitan to English by Margaret Switten and Old French to English by Samuel Rosenberg. Both text editors have given very clear, flowing translations. I especially appreciate Switten for preserving the Old Occitan syntax as much as possible, which makes it much easier to get a handle on the learning the original Occitan while working through a song.You don't have to be a musicologist to appreciate this anthology. Though solidly researched with sources and key editorial decisions clearly indicated, most of the &quot;critical apparatus&quot; has been left to the editors' previous publications. Commentary is given at the section headings for the various poet-composers along with their vidas (lifes). Pronunciation guides and introductory essays give just enough linguistic, musicological, and historical background and differing opinions to encourage readers and singers to draw their own conclusions and make their own informed and inspired interpretations. To continue the tradition. A small selection of sharply-reproduced facimile pages makes the visual and spiritual link between this rare volume and the chansonniers of old.The accompanying CD is well performed and a joy to listen to."},{"Title":"Songs of the Troubadours and Trouveres: An Anthology of Poems and Melodies (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities)","review":"Rosenberg, Switten and Le Vot's anthology is the best anthology available if your aim is to learn some of these and sing them.

Hotchner, that revealed to the world upon its publication in 1966 that Ernest Hemingway died in 1961 not of an accident while cleaning a gun but of an intentional self-inflicted gunshot. If that was all this book had to offer the world on Hemingway, it would not still be in print. He provides an up close and personal portrait of a man he admired and called a good friend, but a complicated personage all the same. This is not a critical, exhaustively researched biography weighing 10 pounds; it is memoir by someone who experienced life with the man firsthand, an account that comes across with honesty and enough detail for readers to draw their own critical conclusions.Hotchner was a young writer dispatched by a magazine in 1948 to find the by then world famous Hemingway in Cuba and negotiate an article. Hotchner's terror at the assignment turned into high surprise as Hemingway took to him and brought him right into his inner circle. Hotchner never talks about himself really, so we don't know what Hemingway saw in him, but it had to be something because Hemingway was not a man who trusted easily, who required exacting standards in his pals, who also included restaurateur Toots Shor, Marlene Dietrich, Gary Cooper and Ava Gardner. Hemingway was at the top of his powers in 1948, living as he thought life should be lived and settled in with his fourth and last wife, Mary, who could stand up to him. On the pretense of editing work, he takes Hotchner along for European adventures, making fun while also disclosing memories of his earlier days, and most important, what inspired his classic novels. As they move into the 1950's together, Hotchner also catches evidence of Hemingway's battle with mortality. He has a tough road back to health after surviving a plane crash in Africa, and then, trying to work again, he is bowled over by the response to THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (the Pulitzer) and the Nobel Prize. Castro, with whom he thought he had an understanding, takes his home and sanctuary. He is briefly revived in the outdoors of Ketchum, Idaho, but depression and paranoia begin to tear at him. What now seems a brutal electric shock treatment at the Mayo Clinic, especially for a man who never believed in analysis or being penned up, who wanted to do his own fighting, preceded his death."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"Very well written with lot's of first person experiences with Ernest to share - at times you almost feel like you are sitting at Ernest's favorite Havana bar with them.

I had some concerns because, although I ordered a new book, the confirmation said \\"library copy\\" and I didn't know if that was a copy that had been circulated through a public library and retired or what.

As an aspiring writer myself, I found that a lot of Hemingway's dialogues with Hotchner provided me with useful insight for my own writings."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"Before I wrote this review I read all of the others and made comments on several. That, I thought, would be my contribution to the reviews of this book. But now that I have read all of the extant reviews, I find that I might be able to add a few new thoughts.I had read two other biographies of EH before I bought this memoir by Hotchner (because they were in my library and the Hotchner book was not). So I bought Hotchner based upon the fine reviews of this book found here. My library should have this one and I will offer same to them, even though mine is an ex-library book itself!. Still, those fellow reviewers have it quite right: this is the best way to really find out what EH was all about. As far as I know. (There have been some other recommends and I will check those out).Prior to reading this memoir (and the other books that really were bios), I had not read any Hemingway other than \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" (TOMATS), and that because it was assigned way back when I was in public school. Since then I have read half of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and then lost interest in the story and characters. I am going to try again with Hemingway after reading Hotchner, with \\"Farewell\\" and the short \\"Snows of K\\". And maybe also \\"Bell Tolls\\". So suffice to say I was not a Hemingway fan.Actually I was more curious about him because he is a fellow Sun in Cancer. I was able to find an accurate (as far as we know) birth-time and his Ascendent turned out to be Virgo, of all things. I am still studying his birth chart trying to see just where it should show why Hem was the way he was. He is certainly the most atypical Cancer I've ever seen! But I shall say no more about this angle as it does not interest most people.This is a good book. That much can be said without reservations. I agree with another reviewer that if you want to know about the real \\"Papa Hemingway\\" this is the book. The subtitle is \\"Ectasy and Sorrow\\". One can see the sorrow lurking below the surfact throughout before it comes to the fore at the end. Very sad and another indictment of alcohol if not used with caution."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"Some have questioned the accuracy of Hotchner's representation of Hemingway. Malcolm Cowley put it best when interviewed by Denis Brian: &quot;You know what he did? I could spot it because I knew the sources. When he said 'Hemingway said,' actually he was quoting from Hemingway's letters to him. Because Hemingway's will said: 'You must not quote from my letters. They're protected by copyright.' So Hotchner just put the letters in place of the conversations.&quot;For more on the factual inaccuracies present in &quot;Papa Hemingway,&quot; one should consult Denis Brian's &quot;The True Gen: An Intimate Portrait of Ernest Hemingway by Those Who Knew Him&quot; (1988).I do not doubt that Hemingway and Hotchner were friends. At a Hemingway conference several years ago, I had the opportunity to hear Hotchner speak. His love and respect for EH seemed very genuine. However, I do question the accuracy of some of Hotchner's recollections in this book."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"I initially began reading this book many years ago and was taken aback by the author's use of very long verbatim quotations, often two pages long, attributed to Hemingway, which I found very hard to believe that Hotchner was able to remember verbatim things that Hemingway had said, some things decades before. Hotcher prefaces the book that he often took notes and had a tape recorder, but it is obvious that in some instances there would have been no way for him to take a tape recorder.Then I read Jack Hemingway's (\\"Bumby,\\" Hemingway's first son) memoir (Adventures of a Fly Fisherman), in which he describes his experience of reading Carlos Baker's biography (which is considered the standard) as not portraying his father in any way even close to being accurate, and Hotchner's bio as being the closest to the life and personality of his father, so I took up the Hotcher book again, but still wasn't happy with it, but finished it. I have in general been very unhappy with pretty much all bios that I've read on Hemingway. I think the most enjoyable was The Hemingway Women. I think we really need an updated Hemingway bio that doesn't fall into the psychoanalytic and/or impersonal historian type of bio."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"For those new to Hemingway, I would recommend reading a wiki review of Ernest Hemingway, and then \\"A Moveable Feast\\" to hear in his own words his thoughts on the myriad cast of characters he met around the world. If possible (but highly unlikely, due to its rarity) I would follow that with Charles Fenton's \\"The Apprenticeship of Ernest Hemingway.\\" I would then read \\"The Hemingway Women\\" (probably reading chapters in reverse order) to get one of the best histories of Ernest Hemingway's life. I would conclude with Hotchner's \\"Papa Hemingway.\\"The books by Hotchner and Fenton are classics and I would recommend hardback copies. I think remaindered copies from discount bookstores might be the most precious; there's something to be said for giving these homeless books a loving and final resting place on your bookshelf of treasured possessions.All I can say is that I had no idea Ernest Hemingway was so much more than an author. It would be like calling TR a politician."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"What a treat and a pure delight this magnificent book was. The wonderful thing about libraries, the best places on earth, is that every now and then you discover a gem like this that you never knew exsisted. This is certainly one of those \\"where the hell have you been all my life\\" books, and one I must now own and add to my library. I was drawn in from the first page, and would have read it through without so much as stopping to breath if sleep had not interuppted this grand voyage. Hotchner is a terrific writer, and through these glorious pages has allowed us to tag along for page after page of adventure and glory with the extraordinary and incomparable Ernest Hemmingway, a man who lived ten lives in one. This book is a priviledge. I felt like I was invited personally into the great writer's home to share a glass of wine and to listen to his stories, and wit and wisdom. It is as if we are there in the bars and cafes, allowed, if for only 300 pages or so, to walk along beside this great man and be a part of his world. This is the greatest of any book on Hemingway I have read. It is a direct line into the heart and soul of this legend, and gives an unadulterated look into the mind and soul of an icon and a true legend. His life was legendary, and that legend is captured so well in this book. I felt sad and depressed as I read the final pages, as we all know how this great giant fell, but then asked myself this. If one were to ask a million people if they would rather live to be 62, and in the process live the most fullest and magnificent life imaginable, or live to be 85, and live a dull, uneventful and safe and tedious life, (which many people, sadly do)then I believe all one million would take the Hemmingway life. I would. #$%^ old age. It means nothing, and I mean NOTHING if you have not lived a grand and adventerous life. Any mere mortal can just get by. Hemingway took life by the horns, literally, and kicked it's ass. A great book.

Hotchner's Hemingway memoir, \\"Papa Hemingway\\", so after what seemed like an eternity, I started reading my grandfather's copy of this book, a paperback edition from 1966.I was immediately hooked.The book has an impressive conversational tone and pace. Hotchner's been accused of quoting letters and making them into conversations, but who cares? This is captivating reading! When Hotchner first meets \\"Papa\\" in 1948 we are there to witness Hemingway downing vase-sized daiquiris, and we see Hemingway robustly swimming ashore with his shorts and shirt tied in a bundle with the German \\"Gott Mit Uns\\" belt, hand held over his head while swimming using only one arm. These vignettes captured my imagination and were about as ideal a Hemingway image as one could imagine! Hotchner captures Hemingway the wise philosopher, the hurt, angry writer whose 1950 novel, \\"Across the River and Into the Trees\\" is roundly rejected by the critics, and we ride high alongside Papa when he storms back to the top of the heap with \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" Hotchner vividly recalls Cuba, Italy, and Spain as he accompanies Hemingway on his adventures.After reading \\"Papa Hemingway\\", my enthusiasm took off and by the next year I had read and collected most of Hemingway's works as well as the numerous biographies about him. Hemingway was my portal to the first half of the 20th Century. Through \\"Papa Hemingway\\" I discovered many of the writers, artists, and political figures of his time and became fascinated with the 1920s and '30s. \\"Papa Hemingway\\" might not be the ideal first book to discover Hemingway the writer, but it serves as a magnificent first book to anyone wanting to learn about Hemingway the raconteur, adventurer, and friend."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"The reader is treated to a feast of biographical detail and insight. A rare and able biographer gives us a close-up and personal glimpse of a great man and character. What more can one ask for? In a league of its own!"},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"In 1948 A.E. Hotchner was dispatched from New York to Havana by Cosmopolitan Magazine to do a story on Hemingway. Hotchner was in awe of the famous writer and tried to dodge the assignment. Well, it didn't work and even as he was intimidated by the thoughts of how Hemingway would dismiss him without so much as a hint of a story, he screwed up his nerve and initiated the first contact. And from their first meeting at the Floridita Bar in Havana, to Hotchner's dismay, the two connected. A true friendship ensued and Hotchner traveled to Cuba at least once a year and communicated frequently by letter, wire and phone. Papa Hemingway called him Hotch and Hotch was as close to Papa as anyone. During their general conversations apparently very few subjects were off limits. Most of Papa's personal problems were discussed; he even talked about some of his writing techniques.Travel was a big part of Hemingway's life. He paid regular visits to New York, Paris, Madrid, Key West and Ketchum, Idaho. Spain was his favorite destination and the Spanish lifestyle was reflected in his writing from \`The Sun Also Rises' to various short stories.There was no one thing in this book that defined the Hotchner Hemingway relationship unless you consider brotherly love. That kindness is on full display toward the end as Hotchner describes Hemingway's mental path to self-destruction.Papa Hemingway is a must read human tragedy.Tom Barnes Author \`Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone,' \`The Goring Collection,' \`The Hurricane Hunters and Lost in the Bermuda Triangle.'"},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"Wild game hunter, war correspondent, bull fighting afficionado; these were the elements that comprised the public persona of Earnest Hemingway, unparalleled man of American letters. As time went on though, Hemingway added unfathomable amounts of liquor to the mix and he began to confuse his public persona with who he really was. Hotchner's memoir finds Hemingway near the end of his remarkable reign as macho wordsmith king extrordinaire--It begins somewhere before he wrote the Old Man and the Sea, won the Nobel Prize, and covers through his tragic psychological/physical decline and suicide in 1961. Hotchner spent a lot of time with Hemingway during these later years touring Europe and running with the bulls. Along the way Hem and Hotch rub shoulders with Hemingway pals Ingrid Bergman, Ava Gardner, among others; but front and center are Hotchner's observations of the great man himself. It must have been hard for A.E.H. to write this as Hemingway slid into the paranoia/psychosis that eventually led him to fire that shotgun into his mouth in Ketchum, Idaho. As the memoir goes on, EH drinks more and more and struggles to maintain his art. Eventually, he imagines himself a target of the FBI, and at one point attempts to jump out of a plane transporting him to the Mayo Clinic for treatment. Through it all his last wife, Mary--as well as Hotchner and his many friends, stand by him. The reader,though, gets the feeling that while Hemingway was never easy to be around, the years of decline were especially difficult. Hotchner, a loyal friend and admirer, proves a more than able chronicler, always managing to mix just the right touch of compassion (that never becomes blind hero worship) with a keen objectivity that serves a good memoir best. In this book, Hotchner relates both the high and low points of the literary lion in winter."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"After reading \\"Papa Hemingway\\" for the third time I felt compelled to contribute some comment. What makes this book unique is that in it Hemingway speaks and you somehow know the quoted dialogue is a faithful replication of what Hotchner heard.While reading I felt as if I was in the back seat of the touring car Papa and Hotch used through Spain and The Riviera.

That my life will be nothing like a life touched by, or experienced like Hemingway's."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"Probably will be most cherished momento published FOR the 100th anniversary...."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"It's a disturbing fact of Hemingway's life (and of his life after death) that a majority of his &quot;readers&quot; seem more interested in his life than in his works. Furthermore, this majority seems to be about equally divided between those who worship the big-game-hunting macho man and those who detest the phony braggart who could leave no good deed unpunished (Is it possible he might have been something of both?). Well, this book is for the former group--all those world-class jerks, for instance, who misread &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; as a guide to behavior and who return to Pamplona year after year to impose their obnoxious drunkeness on the infinitely patient and kind Navarrans (who truly know how to enjoy themselves). Sure, read this tawdry fawning memoir, but for the right reason: because it shows just how obsequious the most worshipful of Hem's worshipers could be. (Incredibly enough, Hotchner does much to redeem himself in his later picture book about Hemingway's world, which is, sadly, out of print.)"},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"Anything I say here will simply detract from this wonderful book, so I will keep it short. I've read a number of Hemingway biographies, but this is unquestionably the best. Hotchner only new Ernest for approximately the last 14 years of his life, so if you're looking for a comprehensive biography, try elsewhere (I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending any of the other Hemingway bios I've read). What Hotchner can give us is a portrait of Papa (Hemingway) from the perspective of a very close and dear friend (Hotchner hunted and travelled with Papa, helped edit and publish his books and essays, and even named A Moveable Feast). And Hotchner is no fool. He knows that Hemingway had a propensity towards exaggeration, and seems to have a pretty good B.S. detector.If you want all the facts, and want to know everything Hemingway ever did, read one of the opuses written by a college professor who got all of his or her information third-hand. If you want to know what Hemingway the man was like, read this book.After finishing, I think it is fair to say that Hemingway's most tragic character turned out to be himself. Read this book."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"It by sheer chance I got this book while I was in San Jose,CA. I read the entire book in 2 days. It gave me so much information about the biographical details, mental make up and lonliness of a great author at the fag end of his life. I reread Hemingway's novels after this which gave me an entirely new insight into the writer's mind as well. The final days of Hemingway are touchingly elaborated by the author. I will certainly recommend this book to any one interested in studying Hemingway."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"Decades after publication, this book maintains its freshness and rightfully takes a seat as a classic literary memoir. Hotchner, a dabbler in TV and magazines without literary pretensions, keeps his eyes, ears and nose open and delivers the best portrait from life of this complex writer which exists.Forget the criticisms about technical innaccuracies or adulatory tone; it is part of the game that the tutor, Hemingway himself, taught this tyro. Any lingering doubts can be resolved by looking at Hemingway's own Moveable Feast from this period. The name of Hemingway's game is creating literature, not scholarship or journalism.The writer is engaged in the early 1950s and followed to his bitter end. Hotchner makes you feel the sadness and loss. Imperfections, foibles, and silliness are all there -- also some cool wisdom. And you can't match the scenery -- Venice, Spain, Cuba, Montana. Obviously a portrait of this clarity is going to cause contoversy and hurt feelings; those maligned have spoken in their own memoirs which of course are well worth reading, too, even the brittle but brave Mary -- Hemingway's fourth wife who became Hotchner's fully armed foe. No matter: she is memorably on these pages too -- immortalized as the tough prickly pickle she was.It finally does not matter what you think of Hemingway or any of these people. \\"Getting it right and true\\" was Hemingway's code, so that the reader feels as if he were there and remembers it all down to the weather and the smells. The result is literature. The unlikely little Hotchner succeeded on Hemingway's own terms, delivering a searingly human portrait that the writer would never have been capable of himself, but certainly would have been forced by his own standards to approve."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"Hotchner really scores big with this book. The friendship between the two fueles the fire for this book of intense detail of the writer,lover, and friend within Hemingway. Their many adventures together bring vivid memories to Hotchner, and in turn he brings them to the reader. I feel that this biography, is by far the best literary biography done for the cause of Ernest Hemingway. This is a must read for the Hemingway fan."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"Mr. Hotchner met Ernest Hemingway in Cuba while Mr. Hotcher was just a young man. His editor had sent him to Cuba to persuade Mr. Hemingway to write a magazine article. Acutely embarrassed by the idea of &quot;bothering&quot; one of the greatest American writers, he finally sent a note to Mr. Hemingway asking for a rejection letter he could show to his editor. Apparently charmed by Mr. Hotchner's diffidence (and probably wanting a drinking buddy and an audience), Mr. Hemingway called to invite him over. They quickly became fast friends, and the relationship lasted for 14 years until the 1961 suicide by Mr. Hemingway.The attraction of this book for most readers will be the &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; look at what it was like to pal around with Mr. Hemingway, and the events that led up to his death.Mr. Hotchner has a good memory for stories and dialogue, and reports on what Mr. Hemingway said and did in his presence in some detail. He does this in the way you might adapt a taped conversation into a screenplay, so the dramatic movement is quite good. On the other hand, he is totally uncritical of what Mr. Hemingway said or did. Other biographies of Mr. Hemingway have indicated that much of what he said about himself was hopelessly exaggerated, apparently as a prop for a fragile ego.Despite the fact that both men were writers, and Mr. Hotchner sometimes helped Mr. Hemingway edit his work, the book has very little to say about Mr. Hemingway's writing, but a lot to say about what he did when he was not writing. That is like writing a biography of Picasso and focusing almost solely on his relationship with women. Ernest Hemingway's drinking and carousing are not the reasons why we are interested in him. Although to some it is glamorous to read about endless trips to the race track, drinking endless cocktails and wine, and partying in Spain, others will find it gross. I graded the book down accordingly for these two flaws.The book is quite sad in capturing the frustration that Mr. Hemingway felt as his ability to write left him. Because he was a celebrity, he seemed to get less than the care he really needed while suffering from some sort of depressed paranoid state (he thought that the Federal government was tailing him).After you have finished reading about these experiences, I suggest you look on the positive side. Is there some great person you would like to meet? How can you legitimately introduce yourself? That could be the start of an amazing friendship of your own.Be sure not to overlook finding friends where you least expect to meet them."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"I am a Hemingway scholar, researcher, and enthusiast and found this to be very thoughtful and insightful. Hotchner writes well and the little anecdotes are fantastic. People who thought they knew a lot about EH wil learn quite a bit more about this great man. I was really sad to finish it and was left wanting more."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"I enjoyed this work. It was interesting and certainly adds another layer to the mound of Hemingway \\"I knew him well\\" literature. I felt the book was worth reading, but do feel that other biographies, by other author's and acquaintances should be read as well, in order to get a full picture of the writer and man Hemingway. By the author's own admission, this is a work of admiration and should be read as such. More and more we are finding the existence of the phenomenon of there being more interest in Hemingway the man, rather than Hemingway the author, or, I should say, Hemingway's works. This is okay by me as I probably fall into that category more and more as the years go by. This work gives us yet another view of Hemingway the man. The writing is good and holds the reader's interest. I am not at all sure of the accuracy of some of the facts found in this work as they do not agree with other biographers. In light of the reason this book was written, perhaps these inconsistencies should be overlooked. After all, this is not hard core history we are talking about here. All in all I recommend if for a pleasant read, a way to pick up more knowledge of Hemingway and should certainly be added to your Hemingway collection."},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"This is the best book that I have read about Hemingway as a man. It doesn't pretend to be (and is not ) a biography. It is an intimate and deligthful portrait of Hemingway the fisherman, the hunter, the womanizer, the drinker, the gambler and all the things that really meant something to him. Were can you get such a descriptive account of the pain and insecurity associated with a writer's creativity? Without this book one cannot size the tragedy of a writer that, in his last years, was conscious of his inability to create great literature, but was condemned to live up to his myth and his character. To those that criticize this book, on grounds of lack of objectivity, one must oppose that this is a book about Papa like the one that he, when Paris was a moveable feast, would have wanted to write about Hemingway.........After all, if Papa lived, he would have explained to all of us that time is precious and that he took Hotchner under his wings, wined and dined and shared intimate thoughs and moments with him, only in order to provide the young lad with good story writing material. And Hotchner has delivered!"},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"I am so glad this book is still in print! I still have my 1966 hardbound copy and love rereading it every five years or so before delving back into Hemingway's works! If you are a Hemingway fan, you MUST read this memoir -- it is a sheer delight, and Hotchner makes you feel as if you knew Hemingway personally. Quite simply, a gem of a book!"},{"Title":"Papa Hemingway","review":"A.E. Hotchner, a gifted writer in his own right, provides a fascinating memoir of the last 13 years of Ernest Hemingway's life. As a close friend during the time period between 1948 and 1961, Hotchner provides an insider's glimpse of Hemingway's travels, friends, writing, and troubled personality. Hotchner manages to fill in most of Hemingway's personal and literary history before they met through a variety of stories told to him by the great writer and master story teller. Thus, the reader is transported to Spain and its bullfights and bullfighters, Paris, where Hemingway spent his twenties making his name in literature, and Hemingway's home near Havana where he lived, wrote, and fished on his boat, the Pilar. His last years are particularly tragic, as it seems pre-ordained that Hemingway will kill himself despite the best efforts of those who loved him. Hemingway, whose brilliant career was cut short by mental illness, left a legacy of magnificent short stories and novels written in his sparse, gritty style that still ring true fifty years after his death."},{"Title":"Kat Kong","review":"The book was in great shape, better than described.It would be nice if there was a way to bundle multiple items from the same seller, in order to avoid paying expensive shipping and handling on inexpensive products."},{"Title":"Kat Kong","review":"I missed my old 28lb cat named Chula until we read this book.

Pilky's trademark puns and silly jokes punctuate the text.This is fairly sophomoric stuff that is not quite as clever as \\"Captain Underpants;\\" however, the book is highlighted by Pilkey's \\"manipulated photographic collage, heavily retouched with acrylic paint.\\" Photographs commingle with vivid surreal colors for a unique book that is as gratifyingly cheesy as the text."},{"Title":"Kat Kong","review":"Kat Kong has interesting pictures that match the story.

But who would know that his dog Dogzilla) and his cat (Kat Kong) are funny-looking??? When Pilkey takes their photographs and paints a story background, they are hilarious. I assume that the featured cat and dog are very old or passed to their reward by now (2010). This is a really funny book, not like most children's books. It is not for the too tender-to-eat-meat crowd or someone looking for easy readers. It is a funny story book. Funny. Get it???? Silly. Get it???? Not serious. Get it???? Maybe by now, they've made a children's book out of PETA newsletters for you all. Remember to recycle!"},{"Title":"Kat Kong","review":"The story is funny, but the pictures are hilarious!!! I would definitely recommend buying this book for anyone who likes funny cat pictures."},{"Title":"Kat Kong","review":"Patterned after the storyline of \\"King Kong\\", of course, this tale involves a cat being kidnapped from his home, tied up in a burlap sack, and placed on display in irons in Mousopolis. After Kat Kong escapes he climbs up a tall building and is lured to fall to his death by a mouse in an airplane. Throughout the story the cat is made to look ferocious and evil, while the mice, who have engaged in kidnapping and who are responsible for the cat's death, are made to look cute and innocent.As the primary caregiver of 2 adopted cats, I find the story a bit disturbing, and children might find it disturbing too. The notion that children reading this story might be inspired to torment cats also disturbs me.I gave it 2 stars because despite my objections to the plotline, I still thought the artwork and prose were good.If you like this type of story and want to read it to a child, \\"Dogzilla\\" is the better choice since in his story, the dog is not kidnapped and murdered."},{"Title":"Kat Kong","review":"This is a horrible book. We love cats and checked it out from the library after seeing the fuzzy kitty on the cover. My 2 and 4 year olds were totally into the real pics of the kitty and the mice - until the cat fell off the building and died. I had two sobbing kids. I had to make up a different ending and hide the book."},{"Title":"Kat Kong","review":"This is an excellent book to share with children - especially those with a well-developed sense of humor. The jokes, illustrations, and play on words will appeal to all ages. As a teacher, I read this book to 2nd graders and then ask them to draw what Kat Kong saw in the package. The ideas start flying. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Kat Kong","review":"I was disappointed with this book because at a glance, it seemed like a fun \\"easy reader\\" for my first grader. We absolutely love Dav Pilkey's Dragon series, which I would recommend for any early reader - boy or girl - as an introduction to very simple chapters. But unlike the Dragon series, the vocabulary used in Kat Kong is going to be too difficult for the early reader to manage alone, and the nuanced puns are going to be way over the young reader's head. So, the reader needs to be a bit more advanced to independently read and enjoy this book - but if the reader has the skills to manage this book, then he/she has likely already moved on to true chapter books. This leaves me wondering who gets the most out of this book? The story itself is somewhat cute - the puns are amusing - so I suppose an adult reading this as a picture book to a child might enjoy the story... but it is definitely not an early reader book. If you want fun confidence building easy readers, I'd go back to the Dragon series by Pilkey, or look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Kat Kong","review":"A spoof of the story of King Kong, with cat &amp; mice characters.Starring Flash as Professor Vincent Varmint, Rabies as Rosie Rodent, Dwayne as Captain Charles Limburger &amp; introducing Blueberry as the Monster this big book, a mixture of photographic collages &amp; liberal acrylic paint daubings, tells the story of fearless mice who set sail for a strange island.This book as been rated TS - terribly silly &amp; some material may be too silly for grown-ups.

The contents can still be found useful even in Win32 platform."},{"Title":"Internetworking with TCP/IP, Vol 1 (5th Edition)","review":"It was through an earlier version [2nd edition], that I got my first detailed look at the internet structure. It is good to see that Comer continues his decades-long best selling text. It is aimed at engineers and programmers who have to understand and use and possibly develop applications that will run atop the internet.Firstly, as with the earlier editions, there are comprehensive explanations of what the Internet Protocol means. Thence for the User Datagram Protocol and the Transmission Control Protocol. To most internet or web users, these are really meaningless terms. Not to you, after you have gone through this book. So, as a crucial example, you will understand the difference between UDP and TCP. And what the format of a TCP segment contains, like the source and destination ports and sequence numbers. Plus the TCP 3 way handshake protocol. The above has been well established and stable for over 15 years.But Comer also brings in newer material. Like the Network Address Translation. A nifty kludge that can get around a shortage of IP addresses. Or, it can be used to furnish more privacy for machines inside a private net, that still need to communicate with the wider internet.Even newer issues include VOIP. Leading into an analysis of the difficult real time problems of audio Quality of Service. The recent rise of Internet Telephony centres around successful resolution of these matters.Finally, Comer concludes with a synopsis of the next generation of the internet - 128 bit addressing under IPv6. And how, apart from the vastly increased addressing, it promises to enable such features as protocol extensions and more elaborate address hierarchies. However, he prudently refrains from suggesting when IPv6 will be fully rolled out."},{"Title":"Internetworking with TCP/IP, Vol 1 (5th Edition)","review":"This book is written in a very readable style and yet covers vast ground in a concise way. Its organisation is excellent and the index finds references to the most useful sections quickly and accurately. The student will quickly gain insight into the protocols and operation at an advanced level, and the design engineer will gain the oversight to design excellent products. The references in each chapter provide good additional reading where extra depth is necessary, but are not required for most readers. It is a system designers book, not aimed at implementors of a TCP/IP stack, and this lack of reference to particular software constructs comes as a relief in todays publishing. The best book on this subject which I have read."},{"Title":"Internetworking with TCP/IP, Vol 1 (5th Edition)","review":"This review compares the following four books:Computer Networks by Peterson and Davie (P & D)Computer Networks by TanenbaumComputer Networks by Comer / Internetworking with TCP/IPComputer Networking by Kurose and Ross (K & R)By far the best book in the list is \\"Computer Networking\\" by Kurose and Ross. This book covers all of the essential material that is in the other books but manages to do so in a relevant and entertaining way. This book is very up to date as seen by the release of the 5th Ed when the 4th Ed is barely two years old. There are lots of practical exercises using wireshark and the companion website is actually useful and relevant. The attitude of this book with regard to teaching networking concepts could be summed up as \\"try it out and see for yourself\\". One interesting thing to note is that the socket programming example are all in Java.Next up is the Peterson and Davie book which covers everything that Kurose and Ross discuss but is slightly more mathematical in how it goes about things. There are a lot more numerical examples and defining of formulas in this book which is fine by me and in no way detracts from the book. Also the socket programming examples are in C which is a little more traditional. The points where this text loses ground to K & R is that it doesn't have the practical application exercises that K & R has and it also doesn't extend the basic networking theory that is covered to modern protocols like K & R.The two Comer books come next. Comer's \\"Computer Networks\\" book is probably the most introductory book out of this whole list and is more of a survey of networking topics that doesn't cover anything in any real depth. Still, this is an excellent book in that it is a quick clear read that is very lucid in its explanations and you can't help feeling that you understand everything that is covered in the book. Comer's TCP/IP book is the equivalent of the other authors' computer network books and in that respect it is pretty average. It covers all of the relevant material and in a manner which is more than readable but that is all. There is nothing exceptional about the book which stands out from the rest.Last comes Tanenbaum's book from the author who is probably most famous for his OS books. This is probably the most technical and detailed of the books with lots of sample C code belying is experience with operating systems and their network stack code. The weak point of this book is that all of the code and technical minutia might prevent the reader from seeing the forest for the trees. Unless you are trying to learn how to program your own network stack for a Unix/Linux system, then I would get either the K & R book or the P & D book to learn networking for the first time. This book would best be served as a reference in which case the technical nature of the book becomes a benefit rather than detracting from the text."},{"Title":"Internetworking with TCP/IP, Vol 1 (5th Edition)","review":"This book describe the TCP/IP family protocols. Of course, there is so much to say that in the limited space that a book can offer that I would say that the book presents only a quick overview of the protocols. Fortunately, at the end of each chapter, there are pointers on the relevant RFCs for the discussed topic in that chapter. My next statement is an impression and not a proven fact but by having read the first edition a long time ago, I have the impression that some details have been removed in this edition in favor of a better coverage of more new protocols. That being said, the information contained in the book is extremely accurate and the book is very useful when analyzing the output of a packet sniffer such as WireShark (previously known as Ethereal)."},{"Title":"Internetworking with TCP/IP, Vol 1 (5th Edition)","review":"[ The TCP/IP set by Comer + TCP/IP Illustrated set by Richard Stevens + The TCP/IP Guide by Charles M.

Discovering Marvin Vincent has been like discovering a stratum of pure gold. Because he takes the Gospels seriously as the word of God, he respects their textural integrity and his in depth commentary on key words is brilliant His associations and connections are beautiful. It's refreshing to plunge into this after walking through the valley of the shadow of nihilism with so many specialized modern Biblical scholars who have ripped the gospels to pieces in the name of theories and ideas that don't amount to a footprint in the wet sand. Vincent takes seriously the traditional identity of the evangelists and talks about their individual personalities. This is also extremely important to one who regards all the modern theories about &quot;anonymous authors&quot; and &quot;gospel communities&quot; as of little or no use because the theories don't make sense in light of what we may safely call &quot;the facts.&quot; (If the gospels had been anonymously written, nobody would have read them. And in the ancient world at that time communication was sure and fast.) I don't say read Vincent because he believes in legend, you understand. I say believe him because back in the 1880's, his approach yielded more fruit than many modern approaches from those who know little about how society and communication in the First Century really worked. Also the books are full of rich interpretation. And lastly, let me return to the most important aspect: they open up the words for us; they help bridge the gap for us between the translations we've read over and over and what was written in the Greek. Worth it, worth it, worth it. Lobby for a new reprint!"},{"Title":"Vincent's Word Studies in the New Testament (4 Volume Set)","review":"This is a great New Testament study resource. It is quoted quite frequently by other biblical scholars (see, for example, the many footnoted references to it in the Amplified Bible). If you already have Wuest's Word Studies, Vincent's is different enough to get as well, for two reasons: (1) Wuest opens up the depths of the Greek, but his interpretations can also get rather idiosyncratic (I almost said peculiar, but refrained). (2) More importantly, Wuest does not cover the entire New Testament, while Vincent does. So if you have Wuest already, get Vincent as well--and, to be fair, I'd also say that if you already have Vincent's Word Studies, you really ought to get Wuest's. If your significant other says you don't need to spend the extra money on another New Testament Word Studies series, just show him or her this review."},{"Title":"Vincent's Word Studies in the New Testament (4 Volume Set)","review":"an excellent resource for serious students of theWord of God.

Though it looks like she's having sex, because the writing is so specific. But as much as Sharon Olds revels when he does [redacted] to her and she [redacted], she's clear what's really going on. (\\"How do they do it, the ones who make love without love?\\" she wonders.) And so, after, she knows what women know after.Her son, he's so big now. And her daughter --- brushing her hair, Sharon Olds can't help thinking: What does it all mean?Parents, lovers/husbands, children. Sharon Olds deals mostly --- I could almost say: deals only --- with the big topics. At least, the big topics if you have parents, husbands/lovers and kids. And she deals with them so directly, so bluntly, that it may come as a surprise to those who do not know her writing that she is a poet, and, for my money, the best we have.The subject of a lot of poetry is poetry: the poem taking its place --- or wanting to --- in the great chain of literature. Sharon Olds has done her reading. And she has her influences. But the beauty of her writing is that you see none of that. All you get is a woman, looking and listening, and then talking. \\"Do what you are going to do, and I will tell you about it,\\" she writes at the end of a poem about her parents, and that's the strength of her work --- it's just the facts she thinks you need, plus her take on them.Sharon Olds can go this deep because she lives this deep. She does not read newspapers or watch TV. \\"The amount of horror one used to hear about in one village could be quite extreme,\\" she explains. \\"But one might not have heard about all the other villages' horrors at the same time.\\" Also, she doesn't drink coffee or smoke, and she limits her wine. Her life is marriage, kids, work. Which, she says, accounts for accessibility of her poems:\\"I think that my work is easy to understand because I am not a thinker. How can I put it? I write the way I perceive, I guess. It's not really simple, I don't think, but it's about ordinary things -- feeling about things, about people. I'm not an intellectual, I'm not an abstract thinker. And I'm interested in ordinary life. So I think that our writing reflects us.\\"\\"Strike Sparks\\" is a selection of her poems from 1980 to 2002. It tells a story, though that wasn't her intent along the way. (\\"I'm just interested in human stuff like hate, love, sexual love and sex. I don't see why not.\\") In these poems, we follow the dying of a father, the growth of children, the deepening of love through sex. And more. Because Sharon Olds mostly does what the greatest poets do: She knows what you feel, but can't find the words to say."},{"Title":"Strike Sparks: Selected Poems, 1980-2002","review":"Sharon Olds has many capabilities as a poet.

Today I read her moving letter to Laura Bush explaining why she was declining her invitation to the National Book Festival in Washington.If her poetry is one tenth as moving, heart-felt, and true as that letter, she's gotta be one terrific poet, and I look forward to the volumes of her work I ordered from Amazon this evening.

If you like Plath or Sexton then give her a try. She is more graphic then they are though. I hate to see her described by one reviewer as the worst poet in the world. Simply not true.

I look forward to becoming acquainted with your poetry."},{"Title":"Strike Sparks: Selected Poems, 1980-2002","review":"Sharon Olds is an incredible poet, and should be read by anyone interested in current poetry. The poems in Strike Sparks are powerful language evoking clear visuals and strong feelings. The seeming simplicity of her writing style, coupled with her focused attention, leaves one wanting to turn each page and absorb yet another. At the same time, she has a wonderful sense of humor--the first page that flipped open when I first picked up the book was \\"The Pope's Penis.\\" How can you not explore further after that?!"},{"Title":"Strike Sparks: Selected Poems, 1980-2002","review":"Fiery, coarse, sagacious, sensual, confessionalist and lovely are some of my reactions and thoughts on the poems by Sharon Olds. Many of her poems over a twenty two-year period from 1980 to 2002 are chronicled in \\"Strike Sparks,\\" and readers and lovers of poetry will benefit, emote and perhaps even change themselves in some way from this book. Olds' poetry has a beautiful way of showing the many possibilities of life in general from the lowest hardships and pathos to the highest consciousness and feelings of contentment. Her poems are often free verse or of irregular form. They are an experience like digging a much-needed ditch; not clean, uniform, easy or painless but a labor of love that might build strength or character. The words often jolt and jump from one line to the ensuing one, but her voice is as poetic as anyone writing today despite her poems' topsy-turvy shapes.There are over 115 poems in this book and they span, in nature, from profound to playfully witty and, in topic, from disaster to the mundane. In the poem \\"Topography,\\" Olds takes a rest after a trip with her partner and compares their positioning as they lay next to each other cuddling to the geography and landscapes they have traveled over. It is a clever analogy as is her humorous, provocative and catchy poem \\"The Pope's Penis,\\" which creates a description of a mundane, old man's body with beautiful and poetic parts and compartments. \\"The Shyness\\" brings a new slant to the feelings and anxieties so many of us have probably felt or seen in the faces, eyes and expressions of others.Quite a few of these poems are historical in setting or allusions and she has a way to empathize and relate with different persons and peoples across time and the globe; this creates haunting poems of heart-rending beauty such as \\"Photograph of the Girl.\\"Sharon Olds is not just a great American poet but an important one. Her poems can delight, intrigue, touch and inform readers about both life and poetry itself."},{"Title":"Strike Sparks: Selected Poems, 1980-2002","review":"Sharon Olds is an excellent poet, and this collection makes a grand introduction for anyone who is not already familiar with her work."},{"Title":"Strike Sparks: Selected Poems, 1980-2002","review":"This is a fantastic compilation of Olds' best works over the span of her career. Her poems are earthy, stunning and beautiful -- and this is coming from a reader who usually doesn't care for poetry. The only downside to this product is there are very obvious spelling mistakes in too many of the poems that do NOT correlate to the hard copy. It's easy to figure out what the right words should be, but come on now!"},{"Title":"Strike Sparks: Selected Poems, 1980-2002","review":"As one of Olds' fans for many years, I am the owner of most of her books.

Robert Wilson an idiot in his mid-20s who has been a complete failure at everything he's attempted in life, thus he still lives with his tolerant parents. He's also a coward and inveterate liar, clumsily lying his way into corners which make his life more difficult than it needs to be. The premise of the book is that he pretends to be a Muslim in order to get a job teaching at a new Islamic boys school in Wimbledon. The school is founded and run by the energetic, good-humored, and decidedly smooth-talking Mr. Malik, who seems not to notice or care that Wilson is obviously not a Muslim and hires him. Robert's poorly executed charade is partly to blame for a flighty female friend getting drawn into this new Muslim world as well. There's a silly subplot involving a young boy who may or may not be the 24th imam as various sects of local Muslims engage in subterfuges around Robert and the school. It's not a bad idea for a farce, but it never comes together as the wacky hi-jinks just aren't that funny."},{"Title":"East of Wimbledon","review":"True, this is not great literature and neither is the plot terribly good or believable, but, and this is a great but, I have never had such a good laugh since I can remember. In fact I was pleased not to be reading it on the bus as there is no doubt the bus driver would have driven straight to the nearest facility for mentally disabled people and dropped me off there. However, laughter is the best medicine. 4 stars for the best medicine I can remember and minus one star for its obvious imperfections."},{"Title":"East of Wimbledon","review":"Any potential for humour from an &quot;Islam meets The West cultural clash&quot;, played out in a school in suburban South London, is drowned in a sea of coy self-righteousness. Typical of so many liberal writers lookin at minority cultures, Nigel Williams falls into that familiar trap of displaying excess of sympathy but absence of empathy. The result is strangely unappealing, stilted and distant.The Independent on Sunday describes this book as &quot;screamingly funny&quot;; in truth, it's an untidy story that, I suppose, raises the odd chuckle.

Buy it (if you can) and set aside enough time to read it. It's worth every minute. The 'plague' referred to in a previous review is the biological mechanism that allows the human inhabitants of the planet to survive the massive temperature extremes that occur over the 'year' (1000 earth years). The temperature ranges from sub-sub arctic to ultra-tropical and the physical changes as the people go from short fat and conservative Winter people to tall thin active Summer people are described with marvellous detail.The story of the humans and their interaction with the natives of the planet is interwoven with the technical information with a masterful flair.This series is similar in breadth and vision to the Eden series by Harry Harrison, so if you enjoy one, you will love the other."},{"Title":"Helliconia Trilogy","review":"One word keeps popping up in these reviews: CRIMINAL.

This heaviness is maybe the greatest fault of this saga, but there's a lot of good in it too, starting with the very interesting basic idea. And even though you get the feeling that Aldiss only scrapes the surface of the world he has created, in the end he sums up the whole magnificent range of time pretty nicely. It's not every day you see a novel which covers a... well, was it 1000 our years? I can't remember anymore, after all this time.More importantly, Helliconia is not only about great and big things, Aldiss pays much concern to single people and their lives. In fact, each section is an exploration of one person, and since those persons are psychologically very believable, they are most certainly worth the attention. Helliconia doesn't even lack humour, against all probabilities. If massive epics are your trade, go and get it. But friends of neat 150-page novels can save their money for something else: this one really takes time."},{"Title":"The last nine days of the Bismarck","review":"In his brief historical novel about the Bismarck's last days, CS Forester omits most of the usual philosophical reflections that are a hallmark of his most famous novels--the Horatio Hornblower series. Here, the compelling story of the hunt for and sinking of the great German battleship is descriptive rather than analytic, but I don't mean by this that the book is not readable and enjoyable: it is. I started it one evening, thinking I'd get a few pages into it before turning in; I ended up finishing the book in a couple of hours (and I'm no speed reader). Moreover, I'd recently seen the very good 1960 movie 'Sink the Bismarck', which is based on this Forester book--and it still excited me. Not great as strictly history--Forester intended instead to portray events as they probably happened, and the result is persuasive, entertaining, and highly satisfactory."},{"Title":"The last nine days of the Bismarck","review":"Interesting book.

I have read most of his Hornblower series and cannot find fault with any book he has written."},{"Title":"The last nine days of the Bismarck","review":"CS Forester has proven with his Master and Commander series that he is no slouch when it comes to providing literary suspense on the high seas. In THE LAST NINE DAYS OF THE BISMARCK, he's turned that talent to a true-life history of the British hunt in the north Atlantic for the German battleship, Bismarck, during World War II.Just as the catastrophic US defeat at Pearl Harbor in 1941 seemed to result from a concatenation of small events, so too was the British sinking of the Bismarck a series of tiny twists and turns that, to give destiny its due, in many cases seemed to result more from good luck than good management - the serendipitous discovery of the Bismarck's location by a Swordfish torpedo bomber when the weather was so dismal and the skies so overcast that, by all good sense, the bombers should probably not have even been in the air; a chance shot that jammed the Bismarck's rudder and forced her to steam away from the coast of France when she was probably less than an hour away from Luftwaffe air protection; and, finally, Britain's preternatural good luck in being able to stay in battle against the Bismarck when they were literally within minutes of running out of fuel.The history is all well known, of course, and the ending will come as no surprise to anyone. But the joy and excitement is in Forester's ability to tell the story and relate the history with all the bated breath and suspense of the very best thrillers. If you enjoy history, then you'll certainly enjoy this brief re-telling of one of the decisive turning points of the WW II.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The last nine days of the Bismarck","review":"I read \\"The Ship\\" by CSF recently and love it.

If you want a book that actually is going to have up to date material go to lulu.com and search Wendelyn Muckerheide. Thats the author and the only way it will come up. The book is called \\"State Board Exam Review for the Esthetician Student\\". Trust me if you study this book you will PASS like I did!!! :)"},{"Title":"Milady's State Exam Review for Professional Estheticians","review":"This book is a very helpful resource to those who are going to take their State Board Exam. I passed my first time and I studied like crazy from this book. It goes along with the text book very well, so if you have both the text book and this review book, you'll have what all the Schools in California are studying from."},{"Title":"Milady's State Exam Review for Professional Estheticians","review":"I found this book to be a great help. I used it as a study guide with the text book and had no trouble with the test. I do agree with the reviewer above as to say there is a lot of medical terminology on the test and I had known that going in. This book helped me in a lot of other areas."},{"Title":"Dealings with the Fairies","review":"This book is a reprint of Dealings with the Fairies, which was published in England in 1867. There are five fairy tales and fantasy stories in the collection - The Light Princess, The Giant's Heart, The Shadows, Cross Purposes, and The Golden Key. All of these works have been reprinted before in other editions and/or collections. However, Dealings with the Fairies has not been been seen in print for a very, very long time. And original editions of the work can be seen on the rare book market for more than $1,000 dollars. So, I was very pleased when I recently found that this work had been brought back into print.The works themselves are wonderful fairy tale stories that also contain important lessons and/or morals to the reader. The most well-known of the stories are probably The Light Princess and The Golden Key. However, having read each, I can say with certainty that they are all well worth reading.Briefly, the stories are:The Light Princess - a wonderful tale of a princess who is lighter than air! And can't stop floating. Her parents, the King and Queen, do all they can to keep her grounded but nothing works until she meets the Prince. I'll leave the summary at that so you can enjoy how the story all works out.The Giant's Heart - a tale of a girl and her brother who venture into giant land and encounter a giant that has an appetite for young children in his stew. As the tale moves along, the reader sees what the children must do to escape the clutches of the giant, and maybe even defeat him with the the help of eagles and spiders.The Shadows - is the tale of an old man who is ill but suddenly one night is made \\"King\\" of the Shadows by the Shadow people, who inhabit his and all of our homes. On different occasions the King from his bed and home by the Shadow people, who take him to Shadow land. And there he learns all about these people...and about himself too.Cross Purposes - the tale of the Queen of Fairyland who has two children brought to fairyland and the adventures they encounter while there (meeting such characters as Peaseblossom and Toadstool) and what they must do to find their way home.The Golden Key - is a tale of a young girl and boy who who venture into fairy land - the boy in search of a golden key, which he finds at the end of a rainbow and the girl who follows after him, but has a separate and wonderful adventure of her own, meeting such wonderful characters as the the air-fish. They eventually meet up again and find the doorway with the keyhole for the golden key. I leave the story at that so as not to spoil the ending.While many fairy tales are suitable for youngsters to read, the starting age for readers of this collection is probably about eighth grade level. Of course, children much younger than that would enjoy having the stories read to them. And adults of any age with find them worth reading too and may well profit from them.The original work contained a number of woodcut illustrations drawn by Arthur Hughes. The publisher has omitted them from this reprint edition and, having seen those original drawings, think nothing was lost by their ommission. Instead, you will find illustrations from a contemporary artist, which I think, overall, work quite well with the stories. The full-color cover illustration was created from The Golden Key story. Inside, you will find one black and white illustration for each story.Its important to remember that the text comes from the 1867 edition, which was published in England. So, the english used in this work is that which the English used over 100 years ago. It can take a bit getting used but once that is done, I found the reading to be generally quite easy to go through.In any case, and as noted above, its a wonderful collection of fairy and fantasy tales for young and old alike and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Devil","review":"Prisoner of the Devil is NOT a pastiche Sherlock Holmes tale ,in the manner of such writers as ,say ,Val Andrews but rather a rich and rewarding novel in its own right ,one adding value to the Holmes canon and that can be enjoyed by people who are not rabid Holmesians .Michael Hardwicke was uniquely well qualified to write such a book being an adapter of the original tales for radio and the theatre ,a writer of Holmes movie novelizations and an expert in the era .I especially recommend his excellent Victorian era police procedural-thriller \\"Nightbone\\" as evidence of his absorbtion in the era .Prisoner of the Devil is ,in addition to being a well written novel a brave one too as it does not end on a note of unqualified triumph for Holmes as his involvement in the case he is investigating is partially thwarted by government machinationsThe case is one of the most notorious in European history -that of the French Jew ,Alfred Dreyfus.In 1895 Dreyfus ,a mild and somewhat unprepossessing man ,was carving out a modestly successful career in the French military and was employed on the General Staff when he was accused of trying to sell military secrets to the Germans .He was tried \\"in camera\\" and found guilty on the flimsiest of evidence ,being sentenced to life imprisonment on the notorious Devil's Island near the coast of South America,the widespread view of his supporters and other interested parties being that his social isolation and religion(he was Jewish)made him an ideal scapegoat for the misdeeds of other better placed people .Holmes is approached by Dreyfus' brother Matthieu but he refuses to become involved until he is asked to do so by none other than Queen Victoria who is worried that the case may be exploited by those anxious to drive a wedge between Britain and Germany.Under cover as a journalist he travels to the area ,sneaks onto the Island and meets Dreyfus and is persuaded of his innocence .Holmes uncovers the truth -that Dreyfus is indeed a victim of wider European power struggles .His brother Mycroft warns Holmes off the case claiming his involvement threatens the stability of Europe and throws a number of obstacles in the path of a wholly satisfactory resolution to the caseThe book is meticulously researched and is a perfectly good primer on the Dreyfus Case as well as a good historical crime novel .In its view of the primacy of political expedience over justice it is also deeply cynical especially about State Intelligence AgenciesThe book is rewarding and makes a great addition to the non Doyle Holmes novels and is a good bet for those who like both the Great Detective and the historical mystery in general"},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Devil","review":"Author Michael Hardwick penned two wonderful Holmes pastiches before his death, this _Prisoner_ being the first. Holmes and Watson are rendered faithfully, better than any other pastiche I've read, and I've read dozens. If you want a fresh Holmes novel, but one that reads like an original story, full of wonderful Watson-like prose, buy this book and pray for a reprint of Hardwick's other pastiche, _Revenge of the Hound._"},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Devil","review":"Author Michael Hardwick has so aped the writing style of Conan Doyle's Dr. Watson, Sherlock Holmes' biographer, that it is difficult to distinguish between them. His intriguing tale finds the Great Detective in the service of the Queen and heading to Devil's Island to look into the Dreyfuss case; and what he finds, as Watson puts it, \\"is a grim account of treachery, cupidity, repression and shame.\\"So if you are a coinsurer of the very best in mystery fiction likeThe Crime Doctor,Sherlock Holmes : The Complete Novels and Stories (Bantam Classic) Volume I, orThe Last Sherlock Holmes Story (Oxford Bookworms Library), then I am certain that this thrilling novel will provided you with quite a few lively nights of suspenseful reading."},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Devil","review":"Mr. Hardwick has weaved a classic! I am a huge Sherlock Holmes fan (I am 13 and have read all of them) and I saw this and knew I had to read it! Mr. Hardwick has lived up to Doyle's standards and delivered a captivating tale of Holmes! At some points, I couldn't tell if it was Mr. Hardwick or Mr. Doyle writing. Doyle's daughter is was like her father's writing. Mr. Hardwick has captured Sherlock Holmes as Doyle did. When I read Doyle and when I read Hardwick, I get the same picture of Holmes in my mind.

One of the most wonderful things about this book is its depiction of spiritual growth. The narrator appears to gradually come to terms with her mother's condition and the stressful situations it would produce.Though there are situations in this book which would cause despair amongst many people, Ms. Brown is able to find humor and hope in these situations and shares it with the reader."},{"Title":"Peace in the heart","review":"Of all the books that were given me as a child of the 30s, PEACE IN THE HEART, by Archibald Rutledge, is one of my favorites. One needs to be in a philosophical mood, with their thoughts washed clean from mundane things and open to the spiritual lessons Nature would teach us about God and ourselves.Rutledge portrays scenes of nature with broad, prosey brush strokes peculiar to the era in which he wrote. This art speaks of an age of beauty foreign to our current literary world, yet, to me, it engulfs me in a warm, relaxing blanket conducive to deep thoughts.Life on a Southern plantation comes alive for me as Rutledge let's you roam through the dense swamps of the Santee River Delta, or the tall, pine woods along with one of his favorite African-American companions. With him you hear the roar of the bull aligator and feel its vibrations zing down your spine, or listen to the terrifying scream of a wild cat.Throughout the book, many quotable gems spring out of its pages for the patient reader. These weave through the author's anecdotes like pearls. My book is well marked by his deep insights. If you long for the sounds of yester-year this is the book for you. I'm glad it is still available!Betty L. Sheldon, author of OMNIPIECE"},{"Title":"The New York Saga: It Was Like This","review":"I stumbled across I LOVE YOU BECAUSE, which is the first in this series set in New York about the McGlory family, and was amazed how history came alive on the Lower East Side. Now, the hero and heroine's son Billy is 25 years old during Prohibition in 1932, and I didn't want the story to end! He gets into one mess after another, but the historical details are amazing. It's like you're right there, in the smoky speakeasies, watching the gangsters plot their next heist, the bawdy nightclubs, the glittering Broadway scene. Then, the ending is such a shock, I had to read it twice! Diana Rubino's books really put you THERE--right in the middle of Manhattan, and you sweat right along with Billy as he's dragged to a graveyard by gangsters to show what can happen if he doesn't watch his step, as he gets beat up by a crooked cop, and as he meets Al Capone, (who comes to REAL life in this story). I saw Road to Perdition and Gangs of NY, and think this would make a much better movie! It was pure suspense, and parts are very funny, too. I can't wait for the third book in the series. This is a very promising author, I say Bravo!"},{"Title":"The New York Saga: It Was Like This","review":"This is a very unusual historical romance - set in the world of NYC's Prohibition and the theatrical world of the time. It's the story of Billy McGlory, who reminds me of a more innocent version of George M. Cohan, and how his quest for artistic success gets him involved in shady dealings. But at the heart of the book is the bittersweet love story between Billy and his wife, Prue. The ending is a terrific didn't-see-it-coming surprise, the plot is well-paced, and the characters won't leave you for weeks. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The New York Saga: It Was Like This","review":"This is a very unusual historical romance - set in the world of NYC's Prohibition and the theatrical world of the time.

One might be misled by the slimness of the current volume (120pp) into believing it to be his most accessible work; however, it is truly a complex piece that is the descendant of the previous two. The book is described as &quot;an hallucinatory novella&quot; and to the extent that we are presented with a plot we see the portrait of a female photographer as she suffers through an illness; her life appears to pass as a series of pictures - random images and people, sounds, colors, darkness and light. Nadas continues to confront of notions of time, place, and character, stripping these concepts down to their essences in order to explore them. Yet I would argue that this work more resembles a movie - not a silent movie, but a moving picture whose sound is turned down, such that we know that some element is missing from this world; we strain to hear it, but can only discern the screams and the cries as we watch the pictures fly past our eyes. This trick is successful for its limited purpose, unfortunately we are left yearning for more - we are only presented with hints of a love affair, of the woman's fears and her dreams and we suspect that the truth has somehow eluded us in the silence. Thus, I do not believe this to be Nadas' strongest work, but it is a worthy addition to his previous efforts and certainly valuable to any reader who wishes to join Nadas on his search for meaning."},{"Title":"A Lovely Tale of Photography: A Film Novella","review":"This book is very well written in an innovative style - small sections of very visually detailed segments - amazing writing of the world as viewed thru a photographer's eyes. The only narrative dislocation this caused was that it took me some time to place the story in time sufficiently to give the action context and social context is essential to following the story. I enjoyed the book - will probably reread it - but at the end of the book, I still cared nothing about the characters - this may be intentional on the part of the author as it is consistent with the photographer's inability to deal with the world outside the photograph of it."},{"Title":"A Lovely Tale of Photography: A Film Novella","review":"There is a certain melody, or better yet, absence of it, that speaks to the reader as he starts reading this book. You can't point out what exactly that melody is, but your senses tell you that it deffinitely has to be pesent somewhere. And as you focus yourself at those voices lost in the past, pictures start to flicker in front of your eyes, and you feel like you're sitting in a sofa, and your grandmother is showing you an old familiy album.You know what kind of albums are those. People you never met, on a murky background, with twisted smiles and years that separate you. They may be your relatives, and you feel some sort of connection or obligation towards them, but essentialy, you couldn't care less about them. But pages continu to flip themselves.There are no sharp edges of objects in this book, everything is blurred, photographer sees in picture \\"and picture comes before words\\", and yet, as it happens with family album, once it is finished, you walk your own way, and forget about it, ready to return again, when someone pulls it out and starts talking...Peculiar little book, but not of a \\"grand&eacute;\\" sort..."},{"Title":"Reading Comprehension in Varied Subject Matter: Social Studies, Literature, Mathematics, Scienc, The Arts, Philosopy, Logic, and Language Combined Subjects: Book 2","review":"I used this series while home schooling my kids.

It is extremely well written with graphic illustrations showing relative sizes of all of the planets, a calendar for all of the annual meteor showers, comets, asteroids and many other bits and pieces of technical information about our universe. I look forward to receiving my 2010 calendar.John"},{"Title":"Astronomical calendar 1999","review":"My Dad requests this calendar every year. It is well worth the expense. He refers to it often throughout the year. This year we were especially happy with the cover which depicts Navajo constellations. As Dad is an amateur expert on Indian Lore, this was of special interest to him."},{"Title":"Astronomical calendar 1999","review":"Buyer beware: please do not be fooled by the title. This is NOT a calendar, but rather a very thorough (82-page) astronomical almanac. This is arguably the best astronomical resource an amateur astronomer can buy.This power-packed almanac has almost everything an amateur astronomer could want:(a) Monthly sky maps with recommended \\"telescopic\\" tour objects;(b) Monthly observer highlights with date/times of significant astronomical events;(c) Monthly east and/or west horizon & sky highlights charts for each month showing ecliptic and path/location of the evening and/or morning planets, sun & moon with significant conjunctions for the month;(d) Detailed \\"strip-charts\\" of astronomical twilight, hours of \\"dark sky\\" and \\"moonlight\\" (which could interfere with dark sky observation);(e) Detailed chapters re: lunar & solar eclipses;(f) Corkscrew charts of the major Jovian and Saturian moons for each day of the year;(g) Finder charts for Uranus, Neptune and Pluto;(h) Meteor Showers (major & minor) with burst/outburst predictions (dates/times);(i) Asteroids incl. finder charts for the big 5;(j) Comets with brightness predictions and detailed finder charts;(k) Occultations incl. binocular & telescope events;(l) And even general information re: measuring light pollution, magnitude, significant spaceflight information, and a small section on selected deep-sky profiles.And I haven't even mentioned it contains one of the best astronomical glossaries of any astronomy book on my bookshelf.Admittedly, this almanac looks intimidating to beginner's. But the author has an excellent explanation of how to use this publication - and interpreting the data quickly becomes a snap.The only publication out there that comes close to this is the annual RASC Handbook. But mano y mano, this publication packs a greater wallop by giving more information, more detail and definitely more value considering the price of each.This book is published annually in October of each year. I ordered mine in advance and had it delivered in plenty of time (prior to 1 November) so I could start my annual planning in advance.This publication is a must for serious amateurs who own telescopes. But given the detailed information re: the moon, eclipses and sky highlights (and the great glossary), even observers without a telescope will benefit.Bottom-line: if you find that you want or need more detail than the online astronomy magazine sites provide, or you want information you normally fnd from multiple Internet sites, or you wish to plan observations for later in the year - definitely consider buying this publication! But remember, this is not a wall calendar but rather a detailed astronimical almanac - on steroids!"},{"Title":"Astronomical calendar 1999","review":"I have gotten one of these every year for about a decade and every year that I think I can go without, by March I have bought one. Almost a too much information publication, after a bit of reading it is easy to figure the sections that are relevant and those I will not use. The format is large, quite a bit larger that a regular magazine so I don't use it at the telescope-- it's not about star charts as much as it is about times and dates of events. The quality and comprehensiveness astounds me sometimes."},{"Title":"Astronomical calendar 1999","review":"My greand daughter received a new telescope for Christmas so I bought this book.

Each month has an illustration of the evening stars/constellations with the positions and monthly motions of the visible planets and moon. In addition to the sky chart, there is the daily description of the various astronomical events or histories relevant for that month. The latter section of the Astronomical Calendar is filled with in depth topics on: the individual planets, the moon and its attendant eclipses, comets, asteroids, and finally a summary discussion of the various national and international space programs. Perhaps the one noted limitation of the calendar is its focus of the constellations of the northern hemisphere."},{"Title":"Astronomical calendar 1999","review":"Excellently well done and prepared, as usual.

One might ask why such a book is needed. I would reply that this book is needed because it implicates the readers of the Bible in the matters it wishes to bring to bear in biblical study. This book attempts to show (in my estimation) that reading the Bible is a social act, a personal act, a political act and a cultural act. And this book preaches what it practices for it is written by a self-styled &quot;Bible and Culture Collective&quot;, a group of scholarly &quot;young turks&quot; no less, who amply demonstrate that projects worked on together need not end up being mish-mashes of the wants and desires of those composing them.This book has both direction and drive. In seven compact yet thorough discussions we are introduced, in theory and practice, to seven contemporary approaches to the practice of biblical reading. Many, if not all, of these (reader-response criticism, poststructuralism, feminist and womanist criticism) are hardly novel outside of the biblical field but then that seems the point of this book; that is, to attempt (or continue to attempt) to intergrate biblical studies ever more closely with, or into, literary studies and cultural studies. This seems the pervasive agenda of this book.I must admit that I have an interest in reviewing this book, however. I was taught for three years as an undergraduate by one of the &quot;Bible and Culture Collective&quot;, Stephen D. Moore. I can confirm that the Collective, if Moore be an example, do indeed practice what they preach in this book. I have to say it sets the Bible on fire in new and exciting ways. If you want to engage the Bible from some new angles or just want to get up date and clear in your mind on contemporary methods of biblical interpretation then get this book. It has no serious challengers in its field to date."},{"Title":"The Postmodern Bible","review":"If you've ever been puzzled by the formula of 'post-modern' and 'biblical studies,' then you'd be wise to pick up this exhaustive and personable piece of academic fervor. Among others, The Postmodern Bible fuses epistemological, religious, and cultural frameworks into a textual craft that will keep you poised with more questions. I recommend this book to anyone who takes the Bible seriously - whether you're a theologian, academic, or a heady poser, you'll want to have this book on the shelves of your mind."},{"Title":"When God Became ApParent","review":"Well researched and well thought out from cover to cover, this book gives an incredibly clear picture of what the childhood loss of a parent is like for those who have experienced it, and what can be done to find hope and healing.While this book may seem obscure in that relatively few people lose parents at an early age, I have been amazed at the number of people I know who have lived through this experience - my boss at work, several friends, an old high school buddy, numerous acquaintances. It actually took me several months to finish the book, because as I was reading it I kept running into people who had experienced this kind of loss. I read portions of about eight different copies of the book by the time I finished it - I gave so many away and bought replacements. I'm giving the copy I just finished to an old friend who lost his father when he was in the 5th grade.This book is ideal for a large number of people beyond the average individual desiring to understand the childhood loss of a parent - surviving spouses, counselors, pastors, grief recovery groups, foster parents, social workers, college students, those who want to better understand the loss experiences of friends and relatives, and there are certainly others I can't think of right now.This one is well worth reading, even at ten times the price."},{"Title":"When God Became ApParent","review":"I've been in children's ministry for a few years, doing my best to help kids and families in times of loss.

Children's pastors, youth pastors and senior pastors, you need this book!"},{"Title":"When God Became ApParent","review":"This is one of the most touching books I've read - full of life experiences and practical insights.

This is for them too."},{"Title":"When God Became ApParent","review":"Having lost my father when I was young, this book caught my interest.

The descriptions on the back about being &quot;heart felt&quot; and &quot;bringing tears to your eyes&quot; are true. This book is great! Everyone who lost a parent at a young age should read this book, and every parent who lost a spouse should read it. In fact, anyone who knows someone who lost a parent at a young age should read it. Now the author needs to write one for children and teens."},{"Title":"When God Became ApParent","review":"When God becomes ApParent is a great read and very insightful in how God plays such a significant role in your life growing up."},{"Title":"When God Became ApParent","review":"I was most interested in this book; because I too, lost a parent at a very young age. The book was written as a thesis for the author, and then published. Each story is from a real person who experienced the loss of a parent at a young age, and how, if at all, God factored into it. It is not a book that tries to sell God, it simply puts into play, how a young child feels after having lost a parent, if they are angry at God, do they blame Him, and as years pass, if they were able to return to God. For me, personally, I was 'angry at God' for more than 3/4 of my life, and after an epiphany, I decided it was time to let that go. It's a wonderful tool for understanding what happens in the mind of children who have lost a parent young. How they adapt, grow and develop after the loss of this parent. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"When God Became ApParent","review":"When GOD Became ApParent: The Early Death of a Parent and the Lifelong Journey Without a Mother or FatherWhen a parent dies during a child's growing-up years, the change is monumental.

Life is so significantly shaped by the loss that other forces often pale by comparison.The reader will often be moved to tears by the heartfelt insights of adults who experienced the early death of a parent-a parent that cannot be present at graduations, weddings, births, and everyday conversations - a parent that is not available to give advice or be a grandparent.Woven throughout this very personal book are Dr. Darren Daugherty's own insights from the early loss of his father and the recognition of God's grace. Darren's book will help readers to understand this loss and those who live with it. It also offers hope to anyone connected to the early loss of a parent. Included at the end of each chapter are suggestions for surviving parents who desire to help their children through the loss.Darren Daugherty has a B.A. in Pastoral Ministry, a M.A. in Elementary Education, and a Ph.D. in Family Education."},{"Title":"Papa Doc; the truth about Haiti today","review":"What a well-written account. The authors, contemporaries of this vile leader, have written a deeply informative account of the first 10 years of Duvalier's reign of terror. Their journalistic style would appeal to the casual or serious reader. They expose the maniacal, erratic behavior of this crazed dictator. This provides a thorough recounting of the multiple attempts to supplant Papa Doc. The mere facts of these exploits seemed comical though tragic in their failure. As stated by the authors, \\"A ten year review of the Duvalier record drips blood.\\" The book reveals how Duvalier sucked the last of life from of this long-suffering country. Reading it also places a large monkey wrench in the popular liberal theory that the American government actively kept this despot in power. If you want to know facts regarding this evil \\"President for Life\\" this is certainly the book I would recommend. You will also start to understand how the Republic of Haiti remains one of the poorest nations on earth."},{"Title":"Three lives for Mississippi (A Signet book)","review":"I was given this book to read as an assignment in my Sociology class at college. I dreaded reading the book and put the assignment off as long as I could. However,once I started reading I could not put it down. Huie does a great job, through his interviews and quest for the truth, at putting you as close to the people and events of this historical time as one possibly could. It displays the most extreme and openly admitted amount of prejudice toward the African Americans held by the citizens of the state of Mississippi during the 1960's."},{"Title":"Three lives for Mississippi (A Signet book)","review":"What makes this book interesting is that it was written between the murders and the trial. Huie knew who the murderers were, how they did it, and never expected a guilty verdict.The book introduces you in detail to Michael (Mickey) Schwerener and all the details leading up to his murder. This detail will help you understand exactly why and how these murders took place.This latest edition includes updates by the author to compare his early speculation against the results of the trial."},{"Title":"Three lives for Mississippi (A Signet book)","review":"Huie may have written part of the story, but if you're using this for research, be aware that he did selective reporting. The alarm about the missing trio was raised by Louise Hermey, a volunteer who had traveled with the group and who was at the office when the station wagon was overdue. She spent the night trying to locate them.\\"Before her stint ended at the COFO office in Meridian in the summer of 1964, Hermey said she briefly spoke to one journalist, William Bradford Huie, author of the 1965 book, Three Lives for Mississippi.'He hung around the (COFO) office,' she said. 'I caught him making long-distance calls and kicked him out of the office. As he walked away, he said, 'You'll be sorry for this. I'll write you out of history.' 'Her name never appeared in Huie's book.\\"I'm wary of journalists who have personal agendas, especially spiteful ones.A more accurate account of those events can be found in \\"We Are Not Afraid\\" by Cagin and Dray."},{"Title":"Three lives for Mississippi (A Signet book)","review":"Five stars mean \\"I love It.\\" I hate to say this is a book that I love, but it is educational reading as to the mindset of individuals residing in the deep south of Mississippi during the 1960s. The domestic terrorists in this story were bent on executing Michael Schwerner, a dedicated servant involved in getting Mississippi black residents registered to vote. Of course, he was viewed as an interloper from up north sticking his nose into other people's business. Schwerner was the one marked for death, and Andrew Goodman and James Chaney happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.Schwerner wanted to go into neighboring counties that were more poverty-stricken than the one he initially arrived at in Mississippi.I found it interesting how newspapers heralded the Neshoba County Fair and all the virtues of living in the area, and virtually ignored the murders that took place there one week earlier.This is a book about how hate can inflict its poison on the psyche of an individual who believe they are doing the Christian thing in taking the life of other individuals. I find it ironic that the terrorists involved in this dastardly dark deed were interested in suppressing voting rights. That is also going on in various states today to suppress individuals, specifically minorities and the young, who would tend to vote Democratic. We haven't progressed as much as we would sometimes like to think we have. There are those who would have this country move forward and others who would love to take us backwards. It is an ongoing fight, and this book shows us where we once were. Heaven forbid we should go back to those days."},{"Title":"Three lives for Mississippi (A Signet book)","review":"I thoroughly loved this book when I first read it in a mass market paperback edition back in 1967(?). Huie's narrative grabbed my attention from the opening pages and I literally could not put this book down. I was a high school sophomore and as I recall this was the first book purchase I ever made that was not school-related or of the class of literature called \\"juvenile\\" literature. So many other books I read during my high school years I've long since forgotten. But (like a first love) I recall so many of the details of this one: that the cover was red, and that it had a photo section inside, for instance. Reading Three Lives for Mississippi started me on a non-fiction book-reading odyssey that has not stopped. I am 58 years old."},{"Title":"Three lives for Mississippi (A Signet book)","review":"The author of this book, William Bradford Huie, was sent by his editor to get firsthand knowledge of the heinous murders of Mickey Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman outside Philadelphia, MS by members of the Ku Klux Klan and local law enforcement officers on father's day in June 1964. His account is both eye opening and informative of the state of the civil rights movement in the \\"Magnolia\\" state in the 1960's. This state was in another world unlike any other state in the deep south. These civil rights workers knew that their lives were in danger every minute that they lived and worked in Neshoba county. This constant state of fear did not stop them from trying to work with the black citizens of the county who were being denied their Constitutional right to vote. Registering a black person in Neshoba county put a price on your head with the Klan and in this case it was the ultimate price. A very moving and gripping story of the three civil rights workers, their lives and their senseless deaths, simply because they wanted to make Mississippi a state of equality for everyone, not just the white citizens."},{"Title":"Love Roma 1","review":"I enjoyed this volume because it takes an otherwise common formula--boy declares love for girl, girl stumped--and makes light of all of the usual emotional and shoujo-esque aspects of relationships in manga. It's very much like Kare Kano (Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou/His & Her Circumstances) without the emotional baggage, heavy storylines, and occasional complete changes of story focus on what should be minor characters. Granted, this is only the first volume, but it's certainly well-grounded in what it's trying to express, and the upbeat and almost comic-strip-like art keep the series from collapsing on itself with too much drama. Totally recommended, especially if you've just gotten through a far more serious manga series."},{"Title":"Love Roma 1","review":"Negishi thinks of herself as a rather average and plain-looking high schooler until a boy named Hoshino declares his love and asks her to go out as her stunned classmates look on. While put off at first by his open heart, Negishi submits to his attentions because of peer pressure and her own secret desire to fall in love. Volume 1 of Love Roma is mainly about the couple's first bumbling attempts to get to know each other and to carve out their own space in the realationship. It is filled with light-hearted and innocent comedy and some occasional deeper insights into the human heart that alternately craves solitude and company. Adding to the comedy are the friends of the couple, Tsukahara and Yoko, whose deadpan attitudes about life offer constant counterpoints to Negishi's excitibility and Hoshino's one track mind. The story is slow-paced and comfortable and feels like a window into a naive but warm world. The art is a bit more cartoony and American-seeming than most manga, but it suits the story. The author has really drawn and plotted a winner here.I would also recommend the manga Aria, which also has a laid-back plot and mood. Also, the Azumanga Daioh anime and manga. His and Her Circumstances is a good anime that delves into a little more seriousness than is seen in Love Roma."},{"Title":"Love Roma 1","review":"Just the most hilarious manga, ever!The artwork is unique; I didn't like it at first, but don't hesitate! The characters are wild, good natured, and just plain silly. Plenty of laugh out loud gags, over the top situation comedy, and a story line running through it. Plenty of Tsukkomi/Boke.

Now there is no doubt and should be no doubt that the primary interest in the art of D.H. Lawrence is certainly not that of his paintings and talent as an artist, and were it not for his genius with the written word, his paintings would long ago been assigned a position in a dust-bin or hanging on some obscure family members wall. On the other hand, I have to borrow from the author's own words for a moment:\\"There are few, very few, great artists in any age. But there are hundreds and hundreds of men and women with genuine artistic talent and beautiful artistic feeling, who produce quite lovely works - not immortal, not masterpieces, not \\"great\\"; yet they are lovely, and will keep their loveliness a certain number of years, after which they will die, and the time will have come to destroy them.\\"Well, that pretty well sums up Lawrence's paintings. To read Lawrence is one thing; a good thing, but to be able to read the author and view his paintings is yet another, and indeed, an even better thing.This large but thin volume represents 26 of his works and even this small amount was difficult to come by. Many of his paintings have either been destroyed by family members or friends throughout the years and quite a number of the paintings that do exist are again, either held by family members or friends who have no intention of ever sharing them with the outside world. What a pity. Destroying such work or suppressing it is almost (not quite though) as bad as the flame wielding Isabel Burton when she torched her husband's, Sir Richard Francis Burton's papers after his death...unforgivable! One of the most tragic literary atrocities in the last five hundred years.This particular work I am reviewing has mounted color plates for the color reproductions but the black and white photographs of his work are printed directly on the paper. It must be noted that many of the small prints here are actually photographs of prints due to the fact that so often the originals have either been destroyed or lost. Be that as it may, the quality is quite good for this type of work; not as good as gazing upon the originals, but it will do. Of course in this case, we really do not have a choice, do we?As to the work itself...I am not a trained art critic. I am one of those that simply know what he likes and does not like. Many of the paintings represented here are nudes and I can assure you that Lawrence (probably due to his rather prudish nature) has no clue as to human anatomy. That does not matter though. Most of these paintings have an innocent erotic overtone that that leaves no doubt in the viewers mind as to what the painter is trying to convey. Some of the works are blatant copies of the work of others yet Lawrence has been able to add his own original flair to them. His landscapes are certainly as good as any well trained journeyman painter could produce and some of them are quite lovely. But again, this work, like any other work of art, is all in they eye and taste of the beholder.This volume also includes some very nicely written essays by Harry t. Moore, Jack Lindsay and Herbert. I normally pay scant attention to artistic essays but have to admit that the ones found here are quiet good...as such things go. I have a horrid problem with being told by anyone what I should or should not see, like or understand in any given work of art.Please do take note. We do have a bit of a problem, i.e. Western Society, with the subject of homosexuality and while Lawrence is not overly blatant nor explicit, there never the less is a touch of that forbidden subject in his work. I suppose this is one of the reason his family has had their noses out of joint all of these years...again, a pity.Much has been written as to the influence the different schools had over Lawrence the painter; Modernism, Primitive, Impressionism, etc. etc. That, for me anyway, is something the individual viewer must make his or her own mind up about. I will be darned if I can figure it out.A short explanation of origin and circumstance is given with each offering and when appropriate, links painting to the artist's written words.For something a bit different this is a good volume to have around. If nothing else it is an excellent muse to study before reading Lawrence. One of the criteria I have for any work of is \\"would I have it hanging on my wall or setting on one of my shelves?\\" In this case I would certainly answer \\"yup.\\"Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Simply Shakespeare: Readers Theatre for Young People","review":"It's okay, but I expected more of Shakespeare's original language and style to be incorporated into the reader's texts. I know it's intended for younger kids and I like that there's some summary and that the plays make the story very clear. It's also nice that they're so concise and that so many texts are included. However, there's absolutely no sense of Shakespeare's style in the plays. Even famous lines that kids might have heard referenced before have mostly been translated into more modern language. Not bad, but could have been better."},{"Title":"The 13th Black Crusade (Warhammer Novels)","review":"After reading the 13th Black Crusade, I have to say that this is one of those works that any true Warhammer 40k fan MUST have. Detailing the events of the infamous Games Workshop international gaming campaign during the summer of 2003, this book provides a battle-by-battle account of Abaddon the Despoiler's invasion of the Cadian Gate during 999.M41. The book is presented as a compilation of journal entries written by one of Lord Castellan Creed's generals and includes various other articles such as pictures, personal letters and accounts, and many astropathic, Inquisition, and Mechanicus reports, all contributing to give the reader the feeling that he/she is in the midst of a horrible war. I must add that many of the pictures are in a style I've never seen before in a Warhammer 40k publication; the pictures look incredibly realistic, including snapshots of military vehicles and space fleets, satellite imagery, and other images very similar to a 20th century press release. The 13th Black Crusade truly captures the feelings of horror, triumph, and despair that were felt by all Imperial forces throughout that Campaign of Terror."},{"Title":"The 13th Black Crusade (Warhammer Novels)","review":"How often does one encounter a company so invested in its completely fictional setting that they spend significant amounts of money publishing historical tomes, background books really, detailing various conflicts and within their fictional universe? How much rarer is it that said company would spare no production cost to create coffee-table sized versions of these tomes with high quality gloss pages and high resolution photographs. How much rarer is it for a company to have a fan-base that is so fascinated by the diverse science-fiction futuristic universe they have created that these books sell with relative like hotcakes? Safe for perhaps the teeming multitudes of works published regarding the inhabitants of Tolkien's Middle Earth, I would venture the guess that Games Workshop's Warhammer 40k setting is the only one able to claim all of this fame.From the perspective Adjutant General Alexis Grail, staff officer of Cadian High Command, the Thirteenth Black Crusade chronicles the darkest and most dire days of the Imperium of Mankind. The worlds and sub-sectors surrounding the Cadian Gate are invaded by the most feared foe of man, the dreaded forces of Chaos. This invasion of terrifyingly mutated battle fleets, dark servants of ancient malevolent gods, hordes of mutants, and throngs of corrupted faith spewing heretics is preceded by an explosion of cult activity across dozens of worlds. This conflict, which will erupt like a volcano into a war involving hundreds of millions of soldiers from across the Imperium will eventually rip across nearly three dozen worlds, is the setting for the Black Crusade.While some of the photographs mentioned in the another review are obviously taken from terrestrial sources this book is filled with nuance and detail of the conflict and reads exactly like the memoirs of a high ranking general. I would have preferred more detail on the forces and personalities involved in the conflict and their histories but this could be the subject of an entire historical tome of its town. It is interestingly paced and can, with only a little imaginative effort on the part of the reader, allow you to for a moment to envision yourself in this nearly unimaginably horribly and brutal conflict."},{"Title":"The 13th Black Crusade (Warhammer Novels)","review":"i was expecting a lay out of the whole campaign. with pictures and art work. the whole book was from only 1 prosective. and the pics sucked the vast majority of them were real satilite pics of earth and the moon. it was really garbage anyway if your gonna buy this book buy it when its cheaper................i thought it would detail the regiments envolved aswell as the astartes units. it could of used more info on who fouhght and who died. aswell as where and why."},{"Title":"Tarot of Gemstones and Crystals","review":"I have been collecting tarot decks for the last several years. Although the decks are all considered &quot;traditional&quot; the themes of the pictures/artwork are sometimes not to my taste. This deck uses beautifully done photos of stones and gems with each photo showing outstanding examples of each stone often in multiple stages from natural to fully cut/faceted and finished.Rocks and gemstones have always drawn my attention and this special deck includes not only the more traditional card interpretations but the influences of the stones pictured, matching rather well the stone to the card. I now have the deck at work and draw a card each morning, reviewing the stone and card interpretations then leaving it standing next to my computer monitor to meditate on through the day.The deck so intriged some of my fellow employees that they got their own deck and get together on their break each day to draw a card each and discuss the stones in terms of what is going on in their lives.It has been interesting to watch people who might have been intimidated by a &quot;tarot&quot; deck walk by and want to join the discussion, drawn by the stones and the stone lore being discussed."},{"Title":"Tarot of Gemstones and Crystals","review":"I ordered this deck to help combine my interests in crystals and in Tarot. It is a unique deck, consisting of photographs of the different gemstones. It's definitely unconventional, and not a deck for beginners, but it now serves a fun purpose in my professional readings. I ask clients to draw a card from the deck, and then explain the properties of the stone they drew. The results are very nice, many of the people draw stones that are special to them already! I recommend this deck as a novelty for collectors, and as a useful tool for readers to start off a reading with another deck. I do not think it is a good deck for doing a whole reading with, however."},{"Title":"Tarot of Gemstones and Crystals","review":"I really like this deck. I love the photos of gemstones on each card. Tthese are better gemstone images than those on any of the decks designed for crystal work that I've seen so far. The Gemstone explanations in the little pamphlet are excellent. The Tarot is good too. Unless you have the minor arcana down pat it could be a bit difficult to do a traditional Tarot reading. I wish they had numbered the Major Arcana. I teach crystal healing and Crystal Deva Empowerments and I am starting to use this deck for Gemstone readings and for crystal healing guidance in the workshops and it is working very well."},{"Title":"Tarot of Gemstones and Crystals","review":"This is the first tarot deck I have seen that correlates crystals to each of the major arcana and minor arcana. They used some very nice specimens in their photographs. The card stock seems a bit lighter than other decks and the cards don't hold up well after multiple shuffles. Seems better to mix them by hand. Some of the photos are really beautiful and others are on the drab side or the photos are not true to color.We used these in a class and half of us had an allergic reaction to them - something in the varnish or ink I suspect. Might want to open them outside and air them out a bit first as they also smell a little funny.This is the first deck I have seen where trump card #8 is Justice instead of Strength and card #11 is Strength instead of Justice.The interpretations in the pamphlet are insightful so I think this deck is still worth getting."},{"Title":"Tarot of Gemstones and Crystals","review":"These aren't even particular stunning pictures of gemstones; they look like you could find them in any book for rock enthusiasts. It's difficult to connect meaning to each stone, unless presumably you're very much a crystal person when it comes to divinatory meanings.In other words, to me, I might as well have cardstock with the card names on them, and then spend some time looking through a Field Guide to Rocks and Minerals for all I got out of this deck.Card stock is mediocre."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: Altered Images : Transcending Breast Cancer","review":"I first viewed this book as I waited for a retake on a mammogram - a little apprehensive, and very much reminded of my sister, who just marked one year in her fight with breast cancer. I was completely taken unaware by the beauty and courage I witnessed through Art Myers' photography, but was as deeply touched by the bravery of these women of all ages who bared not only their bodies, but their souls. Many of the photographs become portraits not just of an individual, but of their support system, as well. Incorporating husbands (including one of 50+ years), children, and significant others brought tears to my eyes. The text and captions are equally moving, extremely intimate, yet not offensive. By the time I finished, I felt renewed inner peace and strength for what lay ahead for me. I plan to use this as a gift, because I saw my sister on every page - brave, beautiful, and surviving."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: Altered Images : Transcending Breast Cancer","review":"I bought this book as I am an artist who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006 and am going to produce images that introduce my viewer to my breast cancer journey in a positive, intimate but honest way. I thought the book might assist me in mentally prepare for creating work as the front cover and initial review portrayed imagery that was artistic and provoking. Whilst I absolutely applaud the front cover and find the book haunting, the women photographed in it brave, beautiful and positive, the overall content of the book was a bit disappointing. I don't know if it was the actual printing of the book that caused it, however some of the photos were very dark tonally and some of the impact and composition was lost. I would have liked to have seen more works similar to the front cover within the book. The photos of the women were good, but I would have liked to have seen more. Art Myers obviously has skill, empathy and the ability to communicate with the women he worked with but I felt disappointed. The contributions from the survivors was honest, amusing and well done. I have since bought two other books Turning Heads and Art.Rage.Us and found them more useful. For what this book cost me as an international buyer I was disapponted."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: Altered Images : Transcending Breast Cancer","review":"This is a fabulous photo book celebrating women's bodies after mastectomy.

I teach photography and have been loaning out of print books to my students for years. I was hoping this book would serve instead. It will not. Anyone interested in the subject should hunt for the following books: &quot;Photographic Composition&quot; by Ben Clements and David Rosenfeld. This only covers Black and White photography. &quot;Image - designing effective pictures&quot; by Michael Freeman has the best explanation of colour theory for non-techies I have ever seen - were it in print I would give it 5 stars. In the current book, Mr. Wildi's approach is overly simplistic, with important areas ignored, or given such a cursory glance one wonders if he wasn't required to add chapters at the insistance of an editor. The one page explanation of colour theory and relationships is a prime example. His best advice on the subject; go to a paint store and get a few booklets from a paint manufacturer, as they usually have some good examples of colour harmony and were created by people with an understanding of colour. Only a couple chapters of this book actually deal with composition, and they mainly repeat common inanities like the Rule of Thirds - you can get this dog eared advice from any Kodak booklet. Wildi even manages to tell the reader to avoid putting the horizon in the center of the photograph about 5 times. After explaining several times that when a tree is the main subject of a photograph it should be shown from the ground to the top (I didn't make this up), the following page has an example, which shows neither ground nor treetop. The example, while basically a picture postcard, is better than the advice. Many of the short snippets of advice in the book are sound. But it is all material a beginner could derive from any book on basic photography. One of the multitude of titles by John Hedgecoe would serve better, as they all go into considerably more detail and are better organized. A good deal of the space in this thin book with large type, is devoted to repeating what seems to be a mantra - Square format is best, because it can be cropped either vertical or horizontal. All very well and good I suppose, but the obvious audience for this book owns neither a Brownie 620 nor a Hasselblad. Composition, is not a black art. It can be taught - just like any other subject in the commercial or fine arts. Books like this one, which leave the reader scratching his head, only serve to make it seem like incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo. If you wish to learn composition, either find the books I recommend at the beginning of this article, or one of the many on graphic design, composition for landscape artists, etc. This book adds nothing to the available information."},{"Title":"Composition Techniques from a Master Photographer","review":"If you're even considering this book, do yourself a favor, as I did, and go to the library and preview the book. One wonders how a book like this gets published. The only thing that Wildi, the author, masters is how to indulge his ego. He spends much of the book telling you what you should and shouldn't do. He teaches nothing about how to incorporate your own personality. Basically, he would like you to memorize his techniques. He misses the point that, firstly, photography is art. I agree wiht a previous reviewer that, at times when you read this book, it almost seems that he was forced to write it. &quot;Photographic Composition&quot; by Tom Grill and Mark Scanlon is a much better book. Probably any other book on this subject would be superior alternative."},{"Title":"Composition Techniques from a Master Photographer","review":"Whenever I talk to people about photography, the first thing they tell me is, &quot;Oh, my composition is great. I'm just not so good at the technical part.&quot; Then I actually see one of their pictures. It usually isn't just the technical part they aren't good at. Composition Techniques goes over those things that everyone (myself included) thinks they know. He goes over how to do accurate and wonderful shots of the outdoors, indoors and all over. The pictures that Wildi gives, too, are just eye-popping. He truly knows how to incorporate the background of a setting into the picture itself.Not only does he show you what to add to a picture, he also says how crop a scene down so the main subject is really highlighted. Plus, there's a whole bunch of stuff on how to enhance composition digitally.Nature, portrait, architectural, natural light, artificial light...it's all covered, and covered well. Wildi's style is easy to understand, simple, and to the point. Anyone could probably pick up this book and have a good grasp of color theory, composition, shade, and editing.I know I did."},{"Title":"Composition Techniques from a Master Photographer","review":"I looked at the ratings and saw that this book got 3 and a half stars. That sounded good to me so I bought it. The five star review must have been written by the authors mother. Even two stars was too much. This book is just a waste of paper.

This book tells the story of another sort of hero, Franz Jaegerstaetter, an Austrian peasant farmer and husband and father of three daughters, who refused to perform his military service in the Nazi army on grounds of conscience. He was executed in Berlin on August 9, 1943 by the Nazis for his conscientious objection, &quot;in solitary witness&quot; to peace. The author, Gordon Zahn, an American conscientious objector during World War II and a sociologist, does a masterful job of capturing the social and religious context in which Jaegerstaetter's refusal to fight became possible. Zahn interviewed a number of villagers in St. Radegund -- including the widow and children of Jaegerstaetter -- to gain an understanding of the development of this uneducated farmer's faith in God and his convictions against war. The author is able to unravel the mystery of how such a simple man could have withstood the criticism and ostracization of his neighbors, the disapproval of his family, and the unwillingness of his Catholic church leaders (with the exception of his parish priest) to support his objection. In telling the story of a single brave man, the author is able to illustrate the possibility for any of us to stand against the social pressure citizens of every nation feel to support their government's involvement in wars, be they just or unjust. In the Preface, Zahn notes that Daniel Ellsberg has often acknowledged that it was the inspiration he felt after reading this book that led him to release the Pentagon Papers to the media in his effort to end the Vietnam War. It is also interesting to note that this book brought Jaegerstaetter's story to the attention of later Church authorities in Austria, who have begun an &quot;investigation&quot; of Franz's life and death in a first step toward his possible canonization as a saint in the Catholic Church. This story told in this book has moved government and church authorities to rethink their understanding and acceptance of war; it will move any reader to do the same."},{"Title":"IN SOLITARY WITNESS: The Life and Death of Franz Jagerstatter.","review":"I first read In solitary witness: The life and death of Franz J&auml;gerst&auml;tter by Gordon Charles Zahn about 15 years ago. In this fascinating biography of the Austrian peasant who refused to serve in the Nazi armies Gordon Zahn takes the reader into the heart of this Austrian peasant farmer who was the sexton of his small village Catholic church. Through his own spiritual conversion J&auml;gerst&auml;tter learned that to be a radical Christian meant one could not cooperate with evil, even at its most innocuous level. We learn how J&auml;gerst&auml;tter refused all Nazi family and farm aid that, by law, he was entitled. The author also explains how J&auml;gerst&auml;tter inacted with those of other faiths, like Jehovah Witnesses, when he was finally arrested for refusing to be drafted into the German army. After being transferred from Nazi prison to prison J&auml;gerst&auml;tter finally is sent to Berlin. And, even though J&auml;gerst&auml;tter knew it would probably not make much of a difference like Christian martyrs before him he accepted execution quietly. Franz J&auml;gerst&auml;tter is an inspiration to Catholics and non-Catholics. His life showed that with faith in Christ one can make the tough choices, even when those choice mean forfitting one's life. Finally, In solitary witness: The life and death of Franz J&auml;gerst&auml;tter by Gordon Charles Zahn does a wonderful job of telling us the story of this almost forgotten Christian martyr. This is an inspiring and wonderful book."},{"Title":"IN SOLITARY WITNESS: The Life and Death of Franz Jagerstatter.","review":"Zahn's meticulous investigation of the thoughts and conscience of an Austrian farmer over 60 years ago caused me to do some heavy thinking. I realized the basic ethical questions dealt with still apply today. The convictions of this simple man Jaegerstaetter have unexplainedly and very deeply stirred my heart. Whether you agree with him or not, you can't help but admire him for standing by what he believed in the face of the Nazi regime."},{"Title":"IN SOLITARY WITNESS: The Life and Death of Franz Jagerstatter.","review":"I had written a review previously (see above). On June 4, 2007, the Vatican announced that the subject of this excellent book, Franz Jaegerstaetter, will be beatified -- i.e., declared \\"Blessed\\" -- and the normal requirement of one miracle attributed to him will be waived, because he died as a \\"martyr of the faith\\". This is the penultimate step before being canonized, or declared to be a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. It was Zahn's book that brought the public's attention to Franz's \\"solitary witness.\\""},{"Title":"IN SOLITARY WITNESS: The Life and Death of Franz Jagerstatter.","review":"In Solitary Witness by Gordon Zahn tells the story of Franz Jagerstatter. Jagerstatter was an Austrian peasant who, as a result of radical conversion, livedhis Catholic faith and put his own life on the line. The book tells the story of how Jagerstatter refused to cooperate with the Nazi Regime in Austria, even in the most innocuous of circumstances. He refused family aid and after suffering crop losses refused farm aid from the government. Gordon Zahn does a fine job of telling how Catholics and other Christians, who refused to cooperate, with the Nazis were seen. And how the Nazis treated those individuals who resisted the state. The book not only tells Jagerstatter's story, but about others who resisted because of their own beliefs, like Jehovah Witnesses. While many know the story of other Christian martyrs to the Nazi regime, like Deitrich Bonhoffer In Solitary Witness by Gordon Zahn fills in the blanks of that story of our Christian faith. This is a book that should be read by Catholics and others. It shows how one can and should live their life if they are committed to Christ."},{"Title":"IN SOLITARY WITNESS: The Life and Death of Franz Jagerstatter.","review":"This is a lovely story about a simple man whose deep faith and principles brought him before the guillotine during Hitler's war."},{"Title":"IN SOLITARY WITNESS: The Life and Death of Franz Jagerstatter.","review":"It is a shame this book is out of print and I felt very blessed to find a copy.

It is also very telling that some elite minds found it incredulous that an uneducated peasant could not only recognize evil, but also refuse to accommodate it. Very well documented."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I am Belgian. This book was given to me by an American friend while I was residing abroad.

I bought this book when it first came out and it brought Belgium back to me! The recipes are authentic and I love the history behind each recipe, very accurate!!! I have given and recommened this book to many friends. Yesterday, I made the Flemish Split Pea Soup...wow!!!I was in Belgium Nov'09 and bought two more cookbooks. One of them is supposedly the bible of all cookbooks and it does not even compare with this one.This is truly the BEST Flemish cookbook out there in my opinion. I have made countless recipes from it, and they all come out tasting like mom and grandma makes them. A true gem of a book!!!!"},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"This is a great book ! Makes me feel good about being Belgian... (and hungry)There is a wave of interest in Belgian cooking, especially in the UK.

Try it and you'll love it."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"Whether or not one is familiar with Belgian cuisine, the recipes from this book are fantastic. So far I've made the cream of tomato soup (heavenly), the carbonade (delicious), the chestnut-chocolate mousse (UNREAL), the bread pudding (lovely) and got through about 1/2 the recipe for the Belgian (or was it Brussels?) -style pork chops, found I didn't have enough time before the dinner hour to finish them, so served them as-was -- and they were delicious! I'm sad to see that this lovely cookbook appears to be out-of-print, but if you can manage to get a used copy at a reasonable price it's soooo worth it. (Note, I was easily able to adapt the carbonade recipe for the slow cooker, just put everything in to stew and cook on high for 4-6 hours or low for 8-10 hours, like you would with any other stew.)Would also like to note that I bought this cookbook prior to moving to Belgium, and have found that the results I get from the book are usually even better than those I have experienced in restaurants! :)"},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I use this cookbook lots.

My grandfather was Belgian so it inspired me to try the cooking, so glad I did!"},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I purchased this book for a Belgian-themed party I was hosting, and was not disappointed. Although it was a bit sparse on quick, easy to put together party foods, it had enough recipes that I still had a tough time choosing which to make. Everything was delicious, and well-described in the book. My guests were impressed. Nothing I chose to make was any more difficult than Ms. Van Waerebeek led me to believe.My advice is to buy this book for adventurous, Belgian-themed dinners, or if you enjoy reading about a real person who had ethnic cooking techniques passed down through her family. It is just right its descriptions, the author gives great, brief backgrounds to help you decide if you're interested in making each recipe. It's clear she is very familiar with the cuisine.If you have an interest in this type of cooking, you can't go wrong with this book!"},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I have been truly amazed at the authenticity of this Belgian cookbook.

These recipes are not only easy, they are amazing. If you've never had Belgian food, it's like a cross between French and German cuisine. Perfect recipes that will be your new comfort foods of Fall and Winter. Every recipe I have tried (and I have made a ton) was a winner. My family really enjoys the braised red cabbage, the beer-braised stews, and pretty much every dessert I have tried (fresh fruit cake, mousse, speculaas)."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I bought this book used but you couldn't tell - it looks just like new!

I use it more than any of the two dozen or so cookbooks I own."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I have had and used this cookbook with pleasure for over 15 years and wanted to gift it to a friend. I am Belgian myself and love the way the completely unknown cuisine of an equally unknown country is presented, in a very unique and personal style, with a lot of heart and soul, to America and the world. The recipes are very typical and very reliable, the author's side remarks and additional pieces of information and advice are both instructive and helpful. It is a pity the book has gone out of print, it is the most lovingly made cookbook I have ever seen."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I picked up this cookbook because I was curious about Belgian cuisine. I had heard great things in particular about the more stereotypical dishes - fries and waffles - from those who have traveled to Belgium and was curious about how to make these in an authentic manner as well as to learn about new Belgian foods. Overall, this cookbook impressed me. While I cannot speak to the authenticity and breadth of these dishes since I knew nothing about Belgian cooking before picking up this book, I will say it has succeeded in the criteria I normally judge a cookbook by. In other words, I found a good variety of unique recipe, clear directions, and interesting background/stories related to each recipe that made me curious to try them.The only small disappointments with this book were that there were unfortunately no pictures and there was also no recipe for the frite sauce that accompanies the fries that I have heard so much about.Despite that, I thought this was a great book and a wonderful introduction to Belgian cuisine."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I love this cookbook!

I was in AWE of how much reverence they paid to a single meal, but once I tasted the results, I understood what all the fuss was about.I just couldn't afford the airfare to keep eating at Belgian restaurants, so this cookbook was a godsend! Many traditional recipes can be found in here, and they're much simpler to prepare than I had ever anticipated.Do yourself a favor and get this in the hardcover version. If you use it as much as I do, a paperback copy will fall apart in about a month!"},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"This book is fascinating from cover to cover. you will be on the edge of your seat, wanting to know the next recipe. a real thriller!"},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I've lived in Belgium for over five years. When I got here I knew no one. I happened to meet a wonderful Belgian woman with whom I fell in love with and married. This book was given to us by very good friends on our third anniversary a few months ago. My wife laughed at this peculiar present from Americans and put it with the rest of our cookbooks. However, some months ago she was trying to remember a family recipe and was having a difficult time recalling all the stuff that when in it. So she got the cookbook out, found the recipe, and prepared the food according to the book. Now, she cooks from this book on a regular basis and I am the benefactor of this. This was a great present and it truly is a great cookbook. It is very accurate and reflects the fine Flemish and French cuisine of Belgium. I highly recommend this book for lovers of good food."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"When I lived in Belgium, it drove me crazy the amount of attention and respect devoted to food. Why, I would wonder, can't we just pick up a box of cereal and call it breakfast? Now back in America, I realize what a true fool I was. Everything about the Belgian meal was phenomenal: the labor of love, the attention to detail, the combination of taste and texture and the presentation -- but mostly the quest for perfection. I almost did a backflip when I found this book, because I had bought many Belgian cookbooks written in French and Flemish but the conversions were difficult to do. Ruth Van Waerebeek not only makes certain that Belgian recipes can be made with American measurements, but she tells a bit about the culture that comes with the recipes, so you get a complete Belgian experience when you make the recipes. The waffle recipe works like a charm and will make a popular tradition -- these are amazing and authentic -- no frozen food aisle version can even come close. I also recommend the Mussels and Belgian Endive gratin recipes. The secret to amazing French Fries is in this book, as well. There is something amazingly satisfying about Belgian food. It is both simple and rich and it makes for a joyful meal. Everybody Eats Well in Belgium contains a treasure chest of recipes that will become family favorites and dinner party masterpieces. In short, this book is a steal at any price."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I married into a Belgian family, and I have to say, I was intimidated by my mother-in-law's wonderful cooking. How would I ever measure up? In fifteen years, I've learned quite a few of her recipes, but after reading this book, I finally understand where she's coming from. Ruth Van Waerbeek not only introduces Belgian food and cooking, but an entire way of life. The recipes are great, and the stories and anecdotes are even better. This is one of those cookbooks you can sit and read cover-to-cover, even when you're not looking for a recipe. I'm ordering one for my mother-in-law --she'll love it!"},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"My father always said that Belgian cooking is the best in the world. After a trip to Brussels, in which I was absolutely overwhelmed by the wonderful flavors of every meal I ate, I would have to agree with him. Belgian cuisine has its basis in medieval cooking, and favors such combinations as fruit with meat, and beer used to cook virtually anything. This cookbook is full of surprising and delicious food combinations, and these hearty recipes are wonderfully easy to make! Flemish Style Braised Endive is now one of my favorite things on earth to eat. Another big favorite in our household is Chicken with Grapes. The flavor combinations are fabulous."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"This is THE best book in English on Belgian cuisine. People who have visited Belgium, love it's typical dishes: Belgian endives, aspargus, waffles, &quot;Waterzooi&quot;, mussels, fries, ...

Although the cuisine is Flemish leaning (and no disrespect whatsoever meant) and containing no photos (really good cookery books don't need them to visualise the process and end product as the writing is strong enough), I recommend this book wholeheartedly. If you don't live in Belgium (as I do), it won't be long before you think of visiting. The food here is really rather good."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I acquired my love of cooking and fine food while living in Belgium, and this book has every single receipe I enjoyed while in Liege.

The people are lovely, their country is gorgeous, their food superb and their beer un-beatable.This is my very favorite cookbook. I only hope I can learn to grow Belgian endive and white asparagus.If you don't love this cookbook, you don't love food. It is a treasure!"},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I am a Belgian living in the US and I bought this book in 1996. I vouched for it being authentic and still representative of how people cook today. Even busy families know that sitting together at the table at the end of the day is a great way to unwind and to strengthen the body and mind. They value the time to listen to each other while eating slowly (no tv or other distractions). My friends and family in Belgium may sometimes bring ready made food (excellent quality is available there) but all know how to cook, do it often, and enjoy the process as a way to relax and nurture the family.People can keep up because they know that every meal does not need to have many courses. For example, I went to a restaurant-brasserie recently in Brussels where one of the day's specials was a plate of asparagus: 6 big, flavorful white asparagus with a mousseline, chopped hardboiled eggs & parsley sauce, with bread and a glass of good wine it was a satisfying and delicious meal.So, some of the recipes in the book are for special occasions or for the weekend, the smaller dish can be used as weekday meals when time is scarce.I use this book often and all recipes work as described, are easy to follow, and include all the information that is needed for a successful outcome - unlike too many cookbooks with attractive pictures but missing information.I have two friends over for lunch tomorrow and I am going to serve the waterzooi of scallops with garlic bread - quick and easy to prepare ahead of time, always delicious."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I have tried almost every recipie in this book and they are all excellent.

There's a lot of good stuff in here, and it's well worth the purchase. I would only urge you not to read this book as a travel guide! The author must have been away from the country for quite a long time and her cultural information is pretty dated, or she is looking back with rose-colored glasses. For example, for all the romanticizing about Belgian home cooking I don't know anyone under retirement age who actually cooks much - the women are all working just like everywhere else in the world nowadays and most of this stuff gets bought in stores, not made at home. It's telling that she describes learning to cook at the shoulder of her mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, but that she herself is a professional cook - about the only job where people have time to prepare time-consuming dishes anymore, including in Belgium.Also, much to my astonishment she describes Belgium's beautiful coastal villages - a month ago coastal development was voted by readers of 'De Morgen' newspaper as the worst blight of many blights on the Belgian landscape perpetrated by builders and a lack of city planning - a long wall of concrete apartment blocks overlooking the sea that is so ugly it has to be seen to be believed. The beaches are nice, but only with your back to the towns. Similarly she goes on about Belgians' love of vegetables...being from California I can only laugh at this one. Hardly anything interesting is grown in this climate - if you like green beans, cauliflower, endive and leeks you're in major luck, but once you've had them a million times you realize why people drink so much beer here - it puts you out of your misery.The reality of today's home cooking is that it's meat and potatoes, with some boiled winter vegetables. Belgian cooking has moved to traiteurs and restaurants, and with all those people working and not cooking, incomes have improved, and they eat out for both the classics and for upscale cuisine. Restaurants are amazing - the quality is incredible for the price. So this book may describe a bygone era, but still characterizes the culinary heritage very well. It's comfort food for all those dark, rainy days."},{"Title":"Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook","review":"I bought this cook book hoping to use it as a gift, even though it is used.

Every time any present action is detailed, there's always an accompaniment of psychological analysis intended to explain the action. Characters frequently flashback to childhood hallucinations or dreams or problems with parents.I was distracted, and a little disconcerted, by the author's determination to dedicate so much time to the thoughts and backgrounds of each of the five protagonists (six if you count the raging rainstorm as a character). Yes, this gang of five was menacing and dangerous, but did we have to get to know each one so closely? The main character, Sam Preston, seemed as deeply profiled as a cardboard cutout versus the 5 troublemakers.I did love the character of Tom Meade, the fatherly town sheriff trying to be caretaker to all but himself.I would guess that this book would be good assigned reading for a Psych 101 course.

Brief presentations of a more scholarly nature (e.g. examinations of statistics on crime and gun ownership, debates over the advertising techniques of gun manufacturers, law enforcement policies) are interwoven with the personal accounts of a variety of gun women, including police officers, hunters and competitive shooters.The authors of this book state they hope to &quot;open up the conversation about women and guns in America.&quot; From my perspective as a female gun owner and avid participant in the shooting sports, such conversation is desperately needed. I found this book a valuable source of information and support on several fronts. First, it provided insight to the thoughts and beliefs of those people who react with shock and dismay to the discovery that I actually own a gun. Second, it provided some hard facts with which intelligent responses can be made to the disparaging comments of those same people. Third, and perhaps most importantly, I discovered that many more women than I expected share my love for the shooting sports.I highly recommend this book to any woman who owns a gun and participates in any of the shooting sports. It is also an excellent source of information for anyone who is interested in learning about what motivates females to become &quot;Gun Women.&quot;"},{"Title":"Writing Instruction in Nineteenth-Century American Colleges (Philosophical Explorations)","review":"Berlin's writing is geared for academics, but anyone interested in a history of American philosophy or collegiate education would enjoy this book.

I had read this book previously and reread it in order to increase my understanding of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy. It is definitely worth a second read.The first two essays cover Roosevelt's role in the rise of American Imperialism and America's rise to world power. Later essays deal with the cementing of the Anglo-American alliance, China, the Far East and Europe.The two underlining themes of this book are Roosevelt's assertion of the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas and his search for balances of power elsewhere in the world. His defense of the Monroe Doctrine is manifest in the resolution of the Venezuelan Dispute of 1902 during which TR prepared to go to war with Germany in order to prevent it from establishing a foothold in South America.An early major step in TR's foreign policy the establishment an alliance with Britain. This move was a natural, as many in America's ruling class, not including TR, were Anglophiles. TR recognized that common language and interests cemented Anglo-American relations. An alliance with Britain was essential to the establishment of a balance to the power of a rising Germany. TR's restraint during the Boer War, despite his sympathy for the underdogs, was repaid in Britain's cooperation in the Venezuelan Crisis and its face saving, but ineffective, support of Canada during the Alaskan Boundary dispute of 1901-3.The main American interest in China was the maintenance of the Open Door policy, which could have been closed had any one nation attained the upper hand in China. Despite his belief in white supremacy, it was Roosevelt's America which used a portion of the Boxer reparations for the benefit of China. In his effort to establish a balance of power in the region, TR supported China in its struggles against Russia over Manchuria.In the Far East, in addition to China, TR's main interest was the negotiation of the peace treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War, an accomplishment which won him the Nobel Peace Prize. Even more than a general desire for peace, TR was motivated by the desire to establish a balance of power in the region. He recognized and respected Japan, an ally of Britain, and actively supported them in the early stages of the war. He recognized Russia as the greater threat to the U. S. and was pleased to see its thrust into Asia blunted. His intervention with both the Japanese and Czar Nicholas was instrumental in preventing a breakdown in the Portsmouth Peace Conference, an action which saved Japan from bankruptcy and Russia from further military disaster. After the war, TR acted, through the cruise of the Great White Fleet, to impress upon an emboldened Japan the folly of taking on the United States as it had Russia.Perhaps TR's most assertive foreign policy initiatives involved his role in the Algerciras Conference on Morocco in 1905. Ignoring the Monroe Doctrine's provision that America would stay out of European affairs, TR became an active intermediary in a dispute in which America's only direct interest was to keep Morocco open to American trade. America's most vital interest was to keep Germany from obtaining excessive dominance in Europe which would enable it to attempt an expansion into Latin America, particularly into areas with large German populations.An assessment of TR's management of America's rise would have to conclude that he was generally successful in his initiatives. Germany was kept out of Venezuela and power in Morocco remained divided. Japan achieved its sphere of influence in Korea, and the Open Door remained open. It is true that TR did not vanquish America's rivals, but he did maintain the peace and enhanced America's position during his reign. World War I did not erupt until 5 years after he left office and neither did Japan attack America not Russia become a major rival until another Roosevelt Administration over 30 years after TR left the White House.I found Professor Beale's work to be the best study of TR's foreign policy which I have found and, as my Amazon reviews indicate, I have read quite a bit about him. I recommend it for any serious student of TR or the history of American foreign policy."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of America to World Power.","review":"\\"Theodore Roosevelt And The Rise Of America To World Power\\" consists of a series of essays covering major developments, policies and actions through which the Roosevelt Administration guided America into the realm of world power.

Germany was kept out of Venezuela and power in Morocco remained divided. Japan achieved its sphere of influence in Korea, and the Open Door remained open. It is true that TR did not vanquish America's rivals, but he did maintain the peace and enhanced America's position during his reign. World War I did not erupt until 5 years after he left office and neither did Japan attack America not Russia become a major rival until another Roosevelt Administration over 30 years after TR left the White House.I found Professor Beale's work to be the best study of TR's foreign policy which I have found and, as my Amazon reviews indicate, I have read quite a bit about him. I recommend it for any serious student of TR or the history of American foreign policy."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of America to World Power.","review":"Howard K. Beale in his book, \\"Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of America to World Power,\\" (1957) gives a good insight into American foreign policy at the turn of the century and the role played by Theodore Roosevelt in the formulation of this policy. The author covers Roosevelt's feelings for various nations, his \\"personal diplomacy,\\" and his insight into foreign affairs. The book is valuable for understanding Theodore Roosevelt and an era in American history. It is also valuable for the light it throws on the present.The author is to be credited with a product based on considerable examination into Theodore Roosevelt' s papers, his associates, and official correspondence of the state Department. A firm foundation is thus presented for the author's conclusions.IIoward Beale brings an experienced hand for writing such a book. He taught at the University of North Carolina, he was Fulbright professor in \\"Munich, and was professor of American history at the University of Wisconsin until his death in 1959. Other books he has written include: \\"The Critical Years: A Study of Andrew Johnson and reconstruction\\" and \\"Are American Teachers Free.\\"Beale includes a great deal of reference, but the book is written well. His organization is clear to follow. The story unfolds with a minimum of discontinuity. Background material and significances are a strong factor which increase the readers understanding. For example, when discussing the Venezuelan boundary dispute in the late nineteenth century, Beale states: \\"The sharpness of the Venezuelan crisis of the \`90's and the quick recovery of mutual respect illustrate, however, the fundamental soundness of the \\"Anglo-American friendship that was developing.\\"The book is rich in quotes, and includes many details. Roosevelt' s views are well integrated and supported. An example of how the author covers background well, is given in his discussion on Morocco. This leads, the author says, \\"... to an understanding of the Algeciras Conference and Roosevelt's relation to it.\\"The third chapter (Roosevelt and the cementing of an Anglo-.American entent) is particularly well done. It shows that Theodore Roosevelt strongly aided improved Anglo-American relations and that he had strong feelings on the subject. \\"To understand Roosevelt's views on foreign policy it is essential to comprehend this belief of his in the oneness of the American and British interest and his conviction that in combination the Americans and the British could dominate the world - to the advantage of civilization.\\" Britain was isolated on the continent and facing a serious war with the Boers in South Africa. Through Theodore Roosevelt however, Britain found a friend in the United States.Theodore Roosevelt's approach to diplomacy is not only well presented, but interesting. The author states of Roosevelt that \\"He liked directness even in diplomacy. Protocol irked him.\\" Roosevelt was responsible for changing the home of the president from the \\"Executive Mansion\\" to the \\"White House.\\" The simpleness [sic] of the latter appealed to him. A further insight is Roosevelt's demand not to be called \\"Excellency.\\" \\"Let them call me \`The President,' or \`Mr. President,' or \`Sir,' but not a title to which I have no right (and one, incidentally, given to ever third rate German potentate or bureaucrat).\\"Theodore Roosevelt's character today would be enough to cause admiration, but looking back (through such works as Howard Beale's) we can have admiration and respect. Theodore Roosevelt could only be part of an era.Beale's purpose is to answer questions of history which might explain why the world was led to the present as it was. To do this the author focuses on Roosevelt: \\"The lectures are Roosevelt centered. No attempt has been made to narrate the history of foreign relations during his time except where he wss vitally concerned.\\" The question then arises what role did Roosevelt play in the course of history? Beale holds Roosevelt responsible for subsequent disasters in world affairs by attributing vast power to Theodore Roosevelt. The ultimate question then seems to be whether things would he any better had Roosevelt taken slightly different action. No one can tell.The author does not answer all the questions he presents, nor does he claim to have answered them all. But at least he has succeeded in coming nearer to finding answers. In doing this the author has achieved his purpose.[Presented as originally written while a student at George Washington University. Diplomatic History 182, March 9, 1965. My grade was \\"C+\\"]"},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of America to World Power.","review":"I understand that this book is a classic of sorts in Theodore Roosevelt studies, but it was simply too long and long-winded to keep my attention (although I did read the entire book). He examines very carefully much of Roosevelt's foreign policy (see the review below mine if you want to read a couple pages of info), and for that I commend him. I just think it can be done in a more readable and concise manner. I recommend reading the works of Edmund Morris or H.W. Brands on TR instead."},{"Title":"Twin Telepathy: The Psychic Connection","review":"Telepathy is probably the most common form of what are called psychic or paranormal phenomena. But although it has been studied in research laboratories for more than 60 years, it remains in scientific limbo. Partly this is because telepathy makes no sense within the mechanistic world view of most scientists, and partly because it generally does not meet the standard experimental test of repeatability.While telepathy has been demonstrated in experiments, it is (like other psychic, or psi, effects) uncontrollable and \\"shy.\\" It is at the mercy of two forces that are well known by now to subvert consistent experimental results. The first is the \\"decline effect\\": subjects who exhibit psi tend to score lower as experiments go on, probably because they become bored with repetitive trials and this seems to have a negative effect on psi ability. The other is \\"experimenter effect,\\" or the apparent decline in psi faculties when the investigators or the test environment are clinical, cold, or skeptical.Guy Lyon Playfair is a distinguished psychical researcher and writer who has participated in a number of investigations of paranormal phenomena, the best known being of a poltergeist that caused all kinds of bizarre manifestations in a house in Enfield, north London. Playfair's study of the literature, both experimental and anecdotal, about telepathy led him to believe that the best conditions for telepathy involve situations where there is a strong emotional component, such as danger to the so-called \\"sender\\" of a telepathic impression, or when the \\"sender\\" and \\"receiver\\" are closely related to one another.Who, he reasoned, are more closely related than identical twins? This book is an account of his research, both historical and empirical, to find out if identical twins have a special knack for communicating to each other without speech or any other tangible means.What Playfair learned, and describes succinctly in Twin Telepathy, is that identical twins perceiving each other's thoughts or sensations have been recorded at least since Alexander Dumas's novel The Corsican Brothers (1844), which he believes was inspired by a true story. In any case, he reports on many other more recent real-life cases of twins with apparent telepathic links. It is not only thoughts that arise simultaneously in geographically separated twins; they often feel similar physical sensations such as pain in a particular part of the body, and sometimes have identical external symptoms even though only one has been injured. (Among the identical twins he cites are the Kray brothers, gangsters who had blood-stained careers in east London in the 1960s.)Playfair also discovered a handful of surveys and studies of identical twins, some of which are suggestive of twin telepathy, although he candidly acknowledges that most of them are far from methodologically ideal. But he also found convincing, recorded evidence of twin telepathy from a surprising source: contemporary television guest shows, including those hosted by Oprah Winfrey, Robert Kilroy-Silk, and Esther Rantzen in which twins spoke of their own telepathic experiences.Better still, Playfair designed experiments that were broadcast on live TV and recorded. In each case, the pairs were separated so that they had no visual or auditory contact, and one of the pair was given an unexpected, strong (though painless!) stimulus. In each case, the other twin reacted -- which in one experiment was captured by a four-channel polygraph. That's my idea of objective evidence.Twin Telepathy is admirably free of sensationalism or exaggerated claims. Playfair lets the evidence speak for itself. He does not hesitate, though, to verbally sandpaper skeptics he thinks are just plain unwilling to recognize experimental results that are right in front of them. He concludes that, based on the available evidence, about 30 percent of identical twins have some degree of telepathic rapport.The author's smoothly flowing style, accented with witty asides, makes the book a pleasure to read. His analytical integrity will go far toward satisfying the scientifically (open)-minded, and his speculations about the nature of telepathy will be of interest to the intellectually curious.Twin Telepathy can be recommended as an introduction to the subject for those with little background in psychical research, as well as to avid students of the subject and professionals."},{"Title":"Twin Telepathy: The Psychic Connection","review":"I found this book very interesting. I would like to think I am reasonably open minded (without being empty minded) when it comes to issues surrounding the paranormal. I find over zealous, simplistic and badly researched material a trial whichever side it is coming down on (belief in a paranormal or not). Happily this is not such a book. It is well researched and solidly presented. Although you can sometimes get a bit tired of anecdote after anecdote, I guess it does get the point across that something real is happening. The author goes a step further than anecdotes and personal testimonies. He looks for patterns of operation and draws on his own practical experience along with other research in the field to present a practical theory of when and why telepathy occurs.The dry sense of humour is an acquired taste though:)"},{"Title":"Twin Telepathy: The Psychic Connection","review":"If you are interested in telepathy then this book should interest you. It is well written, informative, and just plain interesting. The book is mostly about proving the existence of telepathy and since there is an unusual amount in twins he uses them to site many examples. Easy to read but not dumbed down."},{"Title":"Clarke's Commentary: Matthew Revelation","review":"I recommend this work to all!!! One of the best Biblical exegesis' I have seen thus far. Though I would not entirely agree with Clarke's commentary (Clarke was a methodist, yet back in his day, the late 1700s, they would have been more Biblical than the methodist church of today), yet I have found it to be a tremendous resourse to my Biblical studies. His knowledge of history, and the original languages of the Bible create an inspiring insightful view into the texts of God's Holy Word. I can see how the calvinist would feel threatened by this work, for it destroys the very foundations of their heretical views of the Scriptures. Calvin, Luther, Zwingli, and the rest of the Protestant reformers were just as biased in their doctrinal applications as is the calvinist who would not recommend Clarke's commetary for it being Arminian in nature. Anyone who clearly understands Biblical history knows that the reformation did not return the church to 1st century Apostolic Christianity. Instead, the reformation returned the church to Augustinian 4th-5th century Christianity which was already degenerated to heretical, harlot church filth with such doctrines as predestination, infant baptism, hiearchial church authority, the idea of a just war, the persecution of those outside the catholic church etc. The majority of the Protestant reformation was only an extended arm of the catholic church, hence the term reformed, contrary to what should have taken place: transformation and restoration. The early church knew of no such heresy as predestination of mankind to eternal damnation, or vise versa predestination to eternal paradise. Read the facts...the Apostolic church was arminian; they believed all mankind had a choice, and they believed in following Jesus Christ their Saviour in all things...read the facts, and read them unbiasedly!!! Jesus Christ was Lord, and Saviour to the early church!!! Truth is truth! Today's nominal American churches have apostisized from true Biblical Christianity: no head covering, no nonresistance, allowed divorce and remarriage, allowed jewelry, allowed sin in the church, no true discipleship of converts etc. The Church of today must repent, and return to the vision of the Apostolic Church. Truth is truth, and I challenge you to find it!!!"},{"Title":"Clarke's Commentary: Matthew Revelation","review":"I regualarly use Clarke's Commentaries as they are found on http://www.godrules.net/library/clarke/clarke.htm, for writitng papers, Bible studies, proving a point, etc. It's no more \\"biased\\" than Luther, Calvin, etc., etc., were. PLUS he includes a lot of the historical background of the text, something I don't think the Reformers knew that much about. My NT, professor in seminary was Arminian, but he had no problem with me reading Calvin. Why do you have a problem if others read Clarke? Who's biased here?"},{"Title":"Clarke's Commentary: Matthew Revelation","review":"Clarke is an Arminian, that is he denies the doctrines of protestant reformed theology as taught by Luther, Calvin and all the great names of the protestant reformation. As such, I can't recommend this biased work to the church."},{"Title":"1812: The Great Retreat","review":"In this final volume of the trilogy horror is piled on horror as the remnants of the Grand Armee, of its camp followers, and of the pathetic survivors of the pre-war French colony in Moscow struggle westwards through snow and ice, dogged at every step by swarms of Cossacks and the focus of converging Russian armies. Almost every page finds heights of human heroism and sacrifice contrasted with extreme examples of cowardice, selfishness and cruelty. One always knew that the Retreat from Moscow was an unparalleled disaster, but until one reads this fusing of so many first-hand accounts once never realised just how bad it was. The collapse of discipline, hope and decency is graphically depicted yet in the midst of it perhaps the greatest surprise is how effectively some units, not always necessarily elite ones, still managed to stage effective defensive and rearguard actions, without which the disaster would have even more total. (Readers will inevitably find close and indeed uncanny echoes of Anthony Beevor's recent &quot;Stalingrad&quot;). The story is inevitably dominated by Marshal Ney, who comes across as an even more magnificent battlefield-commander than even his &quot;Bravest of the Brave&quot; title suggests, but Prince Eugene Beauharnais, runs him a close second as a splendid, resourceful and indomitable leader in adversity. The pace of the narrative never lets up and indeed the chapters surrounding the loss of the Berezina bridge to the Russians and the subsequent efforts to get the survivors across by improvised field bridging, in appalling conditions, achieve an almost unbearable level of suspense. It is a measure of the writing that, though one knows the outcome, one still hopes page by page that some miracle will still happen. Many of the personalities whose accounts feature in the earlier volumes appear here again, adding to the reader's sense of familiarity. Like its predecessors, this volume cannot be too highly recommended - it is a magnificent achievement and must surely assume classic status."},{"Title":"1812: The Great Retreat","review":"This excellent volume, superbly documented, paints a realistic, grim, and completely readable picture of the Grande Armee's retreat from Moscow. Much new information has been uncovered and used, and this is one of the best books on the subject available today in English. The third of three books by the same author on the Russian campaign, it tells the tale of one of the most tragic and gripping events of the Napoleonic Wars.The retreat was gruesome. During it, Napoleon reached his nadir as a soldier, but somewhere, possibly during one of the running fights with Cossacks or other Russian irregulars, he regained his identity and courage, and got the remnants of his army out of Russia, the survivors he later proudly nicknamed his 'men of bronze.'Without a doubt, the French and allied survivors were the toughest men in the Grande Armee by virtue of their getting out of Russia. The best and proudest moment for all concerned, except the Russians of course, was the assault crossing of the Berezina River, the last obstacle facing the Grande Armee on its way home.Chased by two, and the river line held by another Russian army, the professionalism and stark fighting qualities of Napoleon's soldiers sorted themselves out and they executed a flawless operation, defeating two Russian armies and outrunning a third. Building the bridges they needed as they went, they fought their way across against almost overwhelming numbers of men and guns, the French and their trusted allies, Swiss, Germans, and Poles, outfighting their Muscovite opponents and leaving Russia as victors.This story has many eyewitnesses, doctors, privates, generals, colonels, and one French actress. They tell of the horror and suffering, of high deeds, and the hopelessness of the snow covered vastness that is Russia in the winter.This book is excellent, and along with its two partners, deserves wider reading. It is a superb reference for study or fun, and all three have now been produced in one volume."},{"Title":"1812: The Great Retreat","review":"I bought this book on the basis of the above review and was looking forward to a gripping tale of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. Instead, I found a book bogged down with with the author's attempt to document too many minute details. The writing style is choppy and confusing. I'm sure as a reference book it is very well researched, but it is not at all what I would call a &quot;good read&quot;. I gave up after several chapters."},{"Title":"The Politics of Urban Planning","review":"Don't be put off by the book being 20 years old. The issues described by the author are still germane to many urban regions. Johnson explains how development is typically done in an American city. You can use this as a top level guideline about how to proceed, if you are in urban planning.The financial aspects are also crucial. Here, various sources of funding are mooted. Most important could be local or regional banks, whose remit or focus might be for urban projects."},{"Title":"Alcoholism and Christian experience,","review":"This is a book that needs to be in print again (hint, hint). It is one of very few works on alcoholism (and addictions generally) that address the topic from a specifically Christian theological standpoint. However, don't let that dissuade the reader who might think this is a purely theoretical tome - Woodruff, in the tradition of William James and Anton Boisen, draws his work from 'the living documents' of the people themselves, their stories and experiences. According to Wayne Oates in the Foreword, 'Woodruff did not \\"treat' these persons as \\"cases.\\" He related to them as persons.'Woodruff first looks at the concepts of 'conversion' (specifically, Christian conversion) and the prevailing ideas and misconceptions around the term 'alcoholism'. Woodruff takes the opportunity here (as he will throughout the text) to remind the reader that 'the most important point to be stressed in understanding the alcoholic is: the alcoholic is a person, an individual, a creature of God for whom God has given himself.' Woodruff likens the plight of the alcoholic to more general existential Christian experience - the alcoholic, like the sinner, cannot redeem himself.Woodruff explores in some detail the different kinds of conversion that take places (psychosocial, limited, restrictive, comprehensive) as well the dynamics in Christian experience with alcoholism. Woodruff looks at the role of personality traits and elements such as pride and humility, shame and sin, confession and forgiveness, loss and recovery of hope, and issues with identity, meaning, importance and value for the person in alcoholic experience. Different kinds of personalities and personality theories are presented to show how different kinds of experiences work, work somewhat, or do not work for the individuals involved. Woodruff particularly notes the personality theories of Andras Angyal and Kazimierz Dabrowski as being able to 'provide a holistic frame of reference within which to build a model of the alcoholic experience.'Woodruff also emphasises the role of community in the recovery of an alcoholic person. The church is particularly highlighted, and its difficulty in understanding the needs of an alcoholic. While I might be inclined to say this is a product of the age of Woodruff's text (it was published in 1968), in fact the advances in church congregational and ministerial sensitivity has grown only somewhat, and irregularly. Some churches are very sensitive and caring toward the issue, whereas others continue to deny or ignore the problem. The case of Mrs. Simmons, highlight in chapter five, continues to happen today - so long as the drinking doesn't become a 'problem' in the midst of the church, it is tolerated; when the person begins recovery (in this case, with the assistance of Alcoholics Anonymous), the church cuts off the individual, who now exhibits an identifiable problem.There have been many studies and much research done since Woodruff first wrote this text in the late 60s, based on research even earlier, but it still stands out as a unique offering in the field, and one that begs to be reprinted, and indeed updated with further research and application of psychological frameworks, pastoral care theory and practice, and the increasingly knowledge (and understanding of our limited knowledge) about addictions problems generally."},{"Title":"Dangerous Friends","review":"How many people are played in their thinly disguised biography by Robert Redford? Peter Viertel was; in \\"The Way We Were\\". Years later he was a character in Clint Eastwood's film \\"White Hunter, Black Heart\\", the novel he wrote about John Huston and the filming of \\"The African Queen\\". (Only Huston and Bogart drank enough whisky to stave off dysentry.)Viertel had a front row seat at Hemingway's feud with matador Luis Dominguin, had a long affair with the most famous model of her time, Bettina, had a quickie with socialite Slim Hayward but never had sex with Ava Gardner though he slept with her every night during the filming of Hemingway's \\"The Sun also Rises\\" for which, incidentally, he wrote the screenplay.He rounded off the fifties decade with an affair with Deborah Kerr to whom he remained married for the next 47 years until their deaths, 3 weeks apart, in 2007.A great read. I don't know why the publisher doesn't reissue it."},{"Title":"Dangerous Friends","review":"It was not what I expected. This book was recommended by Steve Hodel in his books about his father and the Black Dahlia. In his books, the 1940's and 1950's celebs' names kept popping up, including Peter Viertel's. Supposedly, Peter Viertel and George Hodel were very good friends; Steve hinted that Viertel knew that George murdered Betty Short (the Black Dahlia). In the actual Viertel's book, Dangerous Friends, nothing like that is mentioned, directly or otherwise. It's basically just a romp thru the celebrities' lives of the times.Good book; interesting. But not what I personally expected."},{"Title":"Chiropractic Made Simple","review":"Recently I became a patient at a chiropractor's office and upon the conclusion of my first visit the doctor handed me a book entitled, &quot;Chiropractic Made Simple.&quot; Later that same day when I returned home I began and eventually finished reading the entire book. I was surprised how simple and logical the chiropractic approach to healthcare was.I immediately decided to let my sister read this book in the hope that she would consider getting her family under chiropractic care. This book has been written clearly and is easy for the average person to understand. I hope others have the chance to read this book as well. Chiropractic really is simple!"},{"Title":"Chiropractic Made Simple","review":"\\"Chiropractic Made Simple\\" is a great book that examines the subluxation philosophy of chiropractic healthcare. The author's theme that a doctor's ability to work with the laws of nature and not against them in order to best help patients is a very logical point. The author makes reference throughout the text that current allopathic objectives are out dated or obsolete.I totally enjoyed this book and would encourage others to read it as well. Embracing the laws of nature is always a good place to begin when tackling health related issues...."},{"Title":"Chiropractic Made Simple","review":"Dr. Reizer's book, &quot;Chiropractic Made Simple&quot; tells it like it is. The author doesn't dance around the many sensitive issues which surround the chiropractic profession. He dives right into the controversial items and gives laypersons an opportunity to learn the truth about chiropractic philosophy. Very few authors have the courage to write about many of the topics covered in this text. Some will be shocked when they read this book while others will be &quot;turned off&quot; by the author's claims that allopathic medicine has conspired through the years to eliminate chiropractic from the healthcare market.This is an excellent book written by a doctor who has a vision of a very different picture when it comes to healthcare for people in the world. &quot;Chiropractic Made Simple&quot; encourages its readers to perform their own research projects about health related topics. It also encourages people not to rely exclusively on traditional news sources for information about their own health.In addition, this book serves as an exceptional introduction to subluxation-centered chiropractic for both prospective chiropractic students and patients. Many of the philosophical components which are often difficult for new students and patients to grasp are simplified throughout the book. The author obviously has an extensive background in chiropractic philosophy and his unique writing style permits the novice to be able to gain valuable insight about these important concepts.I recommend this book to any person who would like to learn about the true benefits of being under chiropractic care."},{"Title":"Chiropractic Made Simple","review":"Like a fresh breeze of truth blowing away the fog of the \\"medical experts\\"."},{"Title":"Chiropractic Made Simple","review":"Let me start off by saying that I think that many Chiropractors are competent and qualified musculoskeletal specialists that are able to use techniques to help many people. But after saying that...The title of this book should be \\"STRAIGHT Chiropractic Made Simple, and Some General Ranting\\". The author attended the Sherman College of Straight Chiropractic, so its only obvious he would be a straight chiropractor (those who don't know the difference between styles of chiropractic can check them out on wikipedia).While this book had the potential to be a straight's discription of his trade and the theories behind it, very little of those pages are actually devoted to it. There is some mention of sublaxation and some info about how adjustment works and so forth. There is even a nifty part about how to go about choosing a chiropractor including a handy form to fill out information about your DC to help you pick one. Unfortunately that's where the usefullness ends.The majority of this book focuses on the author's war with the AMA. While I believe that there is some truth to the claims that the AMA has been trying to subdue chiropractic to an extent, the author continually makes claims that allopaths (MDs) are conspiring to keep the world sick so they can continually profit from disease. (the author -apparently for maximum irony- also then describes how you should get a spinal adjustment regularly for the rest of your life and that you're being selfish if you think its too expensive.He rants against vaccinating your children, and comments that being unable to move your fingers from arthritis is actually good for you. He condemns any chiropractors who want to work alongside medical physicians saying that they're helping the AMA destroy all that is sacred in Chiropractic.While I was really hoping I would have some good things to say about this book, I cannot. The majority of it is written in a style that is subpar for someone with a doctorate. And the book goes from being what I thought would be an introduction to his trade, and descends into a tirade of fanciful claims about those who have wronged him and his trade (both real and imaginary). It is frankly no wonder this book was self-published.Again, I like Chiropractors, just not this one."},{"Title":"Chiropractic Made Simple","review":"Anyone who feels the need to tear down a profession in an effort to elevate their own's has a problem.

Most of them are in English and read left to right. This one is by Jewish scholars and reads right to left. The concept is different and I really do enjoy it. As far as commentaries go, the bulk of the material in this book is Hebrew and English text of the scriptures. It is almost more like a study bible with a few notes on each column of material than it is like a typical commentary.Essentially this book is really a copy of the book of Isaiah with parallel versions (English and Hebrew). There are (as one review said) some annotations for the text on each page. The sparing comments do not really qualify for the billing as a commentary that the cover page displays in my mind. I would call this a really neat 'annotated parallel bible' that publishes the 'Old Testament' into 14 small volumes.For example, on Isaiah 27:2 the English text says \\"In that day sing ye of her: 'A vineyard of foaming wine!\\".His comments are:that day-the day of Israel's deliverance. a vineyard. Symbolizing Israel. foaming wine. The Hebrew word, chemer, is only found again in Deut 32:14. Several Hebrew MSS read chemed 'a delightful vineyard' as in Amos 5:11.Above this you see a column on the left with the English text and a column on the right with Hebrew text.Let me comment on the prices. Soncino Press offers these volumes in the latest printing for less than some of the used bookstores want for older volumes. I cannot for the life of me understand why the used versions are not about half price of the newer versions. There's really nothing special about the older versions of these commentaries.If you do not have computer aided software for the Old Testament, then these books are a great aid for anyone who reads some or a lot of Hebrew, but compared to software tools like BibleWorks 7.0, these tools leave a lot unsaid that the contemporary software tools give at the passing of a cursor.For Christian students, the view here is interesting, especially in passages like Isa 53 where the suffering servant is viewed as exiled Israel idealized. So incredibly they believe that Israel now is a victim in her suffering as an exiled nation. For excellent insight into this same passage, one would best read \\"Motyer\\" or \\"Oswalt\\" where you receive a plethora of exegetical as well as insightful expository comments and good application ideas.Value: I paid $8 for my copy of this book. I don't think it's worth much more than that, but it is worth owning.Still, I love the idea of this commentary and I do love the layout of the text with notes on the same page.

When I saw this 1967 Citadel paperback for cheap in a used book store, I snagged it for a song. Originaly published in 1843, this French book is not new, but for a long time this was about the only book that made the Kabbalah understandable to the uninitiated.This book concerns itself with Kosher Kabbalah. Hermeticism gets barely a mention. Franck maps out what Kabbalah is, and where it came from. I found his discussion of the Supernals to be most enlightening, seeing stuff here I'd never come across anywhere else. His explanation of the other triads was excellent as well.His examination of where Kabbalah came from was less interesting to me, but might be most interesting for others. While he notes resemblances between Kabbalah and Platonism, Neoplatonism, Philo, and Christianity, he rejects the notion of any close connection between these and the formation Kabbalah. Instead he posits that Kabbalah was influenced by Zoroasterism during the Hebrews' sojourn in Babylon. I found his argument convincing."},{"Title":"It's fun to be a Polak!","review":"\\"It's fun to be a Polak!\\" by Ed Zewbskewiecz, published in 1965, is a revealing example of the virulent anti-Polish bigotry that swept America in the 60's and 70's as \\"dumb Polak\\" jokes were the absolute rage and Polish Americans became the butt of the entertainment industry and American society in general.Some Poles countered the attacks with slogans of \\"Polish and Proud\\" however many Polish Americans denied or minimized attachments to their ethnicity out of shame and embarrassment.With the election of Karol Wojtyla as pope and the defiant stand of Lech Walesa and Solidarity against the Soviet Union, the \\"dumb Polak\\" stereotype lost most of its plausibility in the minds of the public, however, even in this day and age of zero-tolerance and diversity, the degrading cliche still lingers.What's most amazing is that Polish American academia has not yet bothered to address the \\"Polish Joke\\" phenomenon in any substantial way. You will not find a single, decent book on the the subject."},{"Title":"Singing at the Top of Our Lungs: Women, Love, and Creativity","review":"What a wonderfully confirming book this was for me. For those times when I wonder why my desire for a relationship isn't always as strong as my desire to express myself and for those for whom family and relationships are the life force within... this book explores the differences within us all. I was very interested in the stories of women who have chosen to put their creative priorities first, and I was also intrigued by those whose commitment to the nurturing of family was so powerful. I think this book will be a wonderful support to those who may feel that the path they are on is not meeting all of their needs and who long for something more."},{"Title":"Singing at the Top of Our Lungs: Women, Love, and Creativity","review":"This book by Jo-Ann Krestan and Claudia Bepko is just a terrific book.

The author brilliantly combines these three perspectives.His vision of the future, while idealistic, is not based on simplistic &quot;pop&quot; nominations of what the future will be like, rather, he takes a critical look at how children are given the future, and how the futures given to them directly and structurally create violence.Hutchinson offers ways out of the current flat view of the future. Borrowing from peace studies and educational theory, he gives strategies, exercises and models in which to create alternative futures. These models hope to transform the world at many levels: the individual, the social and the epistemological.Excellent for teachers, educators, policy advisors at all levels.I loved this book and use it in my own teaching of history and futures studies."},{"Title":"Cookin': Hard Bop and Soul Jazz, 1954-65 (A Michael Neugebauer Book)","review":"This overview of the hard bop universe is compellingly written.

Fortescue in 1923 until 1962, when Hannibal Bugnini started implementing his Novus Ordo (New Order) service after the first session of the Second Vatican Council (1963), J.B. O'Connell updated Fr. Fortescue's work. That work ended with the 12th edition of 1962, after which the Traditional Latin Mass was supplanted with the Novus Ordo service, written by Hannibal Bugnini and his Committee of Six Protestant Ministers. This is the service offered in most diocesan churches today, although there are a significant number of sites that refuse to go along with the Novus Ordo and instead maintain either the 1962 Mass or earlier versions.This, so-called 15th edition, is quite dishonest. It contains unauthorized changes made by Alcuin Reed. If this edition were for the 1962 rite, why wasn't the 12th edition simply reprinted? This book is not faithful to Fr. Fortescue's 12th edition. It contains three more editions of \\"modernizing\\" changes engineered to conform to the Novus Ordo, not the Traditional Latin Mass.If you want to get the real McCoy, get the Fortescue-O'Connell original 1962 edition as a used book. That way you won't get the false \\"updates\\" injected throughout into this edition. Better yet, get one of the earlier editions before 1962, by which time Bugnini was already implementing changes that were not traditional to the Traditional Latin Mass."},{"Title":"The ceremonies of the Roman rite described","review":"This book has been updated to reflect the 1962 rubrics of the Roman Rite, better known as the Indult version of the traditional Roman Rite, reflecting the changes instituted by the liturgical commission under Annibale Bugnini in 1962. It would be helpful and a lot more interesting if Fr. Alcuin Reid had included in this version the changes Bugnini made in in the context of the earlier practice. To get this information you have to obtain an earlier edition of the book. There is a growing interest in the pre-Indult version of the Roman Rite and this book has had that information edited out.D.

Fourteen intelligent, intense and vividly written short stories challenge our theories of the recent future. It is one of the mysteries of our own time that someone casting as long a shadow as does Ballard, is virtually unknown in his native England, let alone America. This book, with its visions of dystopia, contains some very intriguing ideas: A middle east guerrilla has an idea for ending the fighting there, only to discover that the UN has a quite different agenda. World War III is played out against the larger concerns of President Reagan's health problems. The index from an unknown and perhaps suppressed autobiography provides tantalizing details to the life and times of one of this century's most anonymous titans. Ballard shines brightest in the short form; these stories are no exception. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"War Fever","review":"These are some of the most creative short stories I've read. Ever. A sailor wrecks his chemical-laden ship on a remote Caribbean island, and the island environment reacts surprisingly well. A young assassin escapes an English mental institution and begins targeting astronauts. A man locks himself in his house and locks the rest of the world out...forever. Intelligently written, well-researched, and ever fascinating, these stories represent Ballard at his visionary best. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"War Fever","review":"Ballard novels have never really impressed me - they seem too unfocused and convoluted. I am a big fan, however, of his short stories - generally well-written, interestingly plotted, and providing just the right amount of alienation, making even a mundane situation seem like an otherworldly experience. &quot;The Best Short Stories of...&quot; is a great place to start, with many fiction and sci-fi classics, a great representation of the short story form. &quot;War Fever&quot; is a worthy follow-up. I don't know why it took me so long to try these stories, but they are definitely worth it. Here, he doesn't really go out of his way to write in any established genre (sci-fi, horror), but his stories seem to drift that way ever so slightly, as if trying to just tread the edge of such. He uses some interesting variations with form as well, seeing what the reader will accept as a story: a questionnaire? An index? Both are equally valid, and Ballard uses them to great effect. Give this collection a try and see how well the stories hold up to his more classic works. I think you'll find that his output from the mid to late '80s was just as good."},{"Title":"War Fever","review":"J.G. Ballard is a rare find, a dystopian with a very, very dry sense of humor. The future isn't the bestiality of \\"1984\\" or the state mandated hedonism of Huxley's vision.

Interesting also that the author warns about Asians in the future, especially Japanese, Chinese, and Indians and their future influence in world power (This was written in 1958) . Her book goes into the Japanese part of WWII, but Germany is mentioned only briefly and in passing. She says nothing at all about the German quest for world power during the same war.

Carol Henderson struggles with the alienation that naturally occurs following such tragedies (only women who have lost babies can truly understand the experience), exacerbated by her temperamental/ familial or, as she describes it,\\"WASPy\\" tendency to withdraw in the face of emotional pain so as not to put anyone out. (She learns to cope this way early in life: her mother suggests the same solution to all emotional pain --- lie down and get some rest.) Ultimately, the author discovers real answers that lead to healing: find a community of women that has experienced the same loss, seek out a loving therapist who absolutely understands what she is going through, and, somehow, garner the courage to have another child. Through her painful odyssey, Henderson finds meaning and redemption in Malcolm's short life. This is a helpful book for both professional healers and family and friends of bereaved parents."},{"Title":"Losing Malcolm: A Mother's Journey Through Grief","review":"This is a beautiful book about a very difficult subject, grief.

My heart goes out to you."},{"Title":"Losing Malcolm: A Mother's Journey Through Grief","review":"LOSING MALCOLM has as its subtitle, \`A Mother's Journey Through Grief,' and that is what it is: a journey. Although this memoir deals with that most wrenching of catastrophe's, the death of a child, both in structure and in spirit it walks away from the event. By this I do not mean that the lost child is forgotten, far from it, but the story shows how healthy grieving can heal the human soul. Rather than leading up to and finishing with the death of six week old Malcolm, Henderson gives us his death up front, no punches pulled. But what comes after is what her book is all about. Although she honestly presents the shock and agony of her bereavement, she does not ask for sympathy or pity, but leads the reader step by step along the path she took back to normality and peace. Along that path she experienced mindless numbness, hysteria, frustration, resentment of other women with their children, fear of her own body, and rage at people who dismissed her loss, saying Malcolm was &quot;only a baby,&quot; suggesting she replace him with another, as though babies are, like money, fungible. Even when she became pregnant for the second time, she felt that the new baby was &quot;floating in a womb of tears.&quot; And yet she had the wisdom to embrace all these reactions as natural aspects of the grieving process. Gradually, we see her drawing the scattered pieces of herself together, helped by simple things like the companionship of dogs, the soothing power of poetry, the friendship of a group of older women who &quot;had seen it all,&quot; and, at last, the healing ritual of entrusting Malcolm's ashes to the ocean. This is a brave and most affecting book which shows the workings of the human heart and how it deals with tragedy. It is a wise and simple guide to how to walk through grief and come safely out the other side."},{"Title":"Losing Malcolm: A Mother's Journey Through Grief","review":"Be prepared to read this beautifully written book in one seating.

One needs to be in a philosophical mood, with their thoughts washed clean from mundane things and open to the spiritual lessons Nature would teach us about God and ourselves.Rutledge portrays scenes of nature with broad, prosey brush strokes peculiar to the era in which he wrote. This art speaks of an age of beauty foreign to our current literary world, yet, to me, it engulfs me in a warm, relaxing blanket conducive to deep thoughts.Life on a Southern plantation comes alive for me as Rutledge let's you roam through the dense swamps of the Santee River Delta, or the tall, pine woods along with one of his favorite African-American companions. With him you hear the roar of the bull aligator and feel its vibrations zing down your spine, or listen to the terrifying scream of a wild cat.Throughout the book, many quotable gems spring out of its pages for the patient reader. These weave through the author's anecdotes like pearls. My book is well marked by his deep insights. If you long for the sounds of yester-year this is the book for you.

He was found by a lesbian couple who used humane traps to work with wolves, and they took him home, and began raising him as their own - after hiring a private eye to try and track down who he really was. The P.I. failed, Ukiah lived with the women as a son, and eventually, he and the P.I. started working together. In the first book, you find out a lot about Ukiah's strange origins, and start to realize just what he is up against.'Tainted Trail' picks up where 'Alien Taste' left off, in that Ukiah and his P.I. partner are seeking out a missing person, but the ancient evil alien race Ukiah went up against in the first book may be behind what's going on in the wild woods where his childhood friend went missing.Wen Spencer really upped the ante on this one - the hits land closer to Ukiah's core, the damage dealt is harsher, and the blood and guts got me a bit nauseated in parts. On the plus side (not that the above is necessarily a con), the supporting cast to this book is much more flushed out and interesting, and the mystery itself was complex enough to keep me reading. If you like your science fiction with a mystery twist, and like complex genetic plots, this is the series for you.

Alicia was camping in the forest when she turned up missing. Thanks to Ukiah's awesome tracking abilities--he may be the only one to find her. After two days on the trail and after Ukiah being shot in the process, they determine she was kidnapped and turn to detecting mode to find her. Several days past with the team searching for clues as to what people Alicia encountered in the local town. Ukiah is dismayed to learn that Alicia had a secret crush on him and accidently actually uncovers Ukiah's past after seeing a picture of him in a local museum. Now the team has to race against the clock to save Alicia, as well as Ukiah's real family.I like this book, it keeps me interested and reading. I don't like the science part of it, though, it was a bit far fetched for them to just so happen to find the turtle, the ship, and have the power necessary to run an alien gadget. Oh well. I still want to read the next one."},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","review":"\\"Tainted Trail\\" is a fantasy novel set in the current day US. The fantasy elements all surround two factions of an alien race that is living secretly among us. One faction is intent on taking over the world; the other faction (Ukiah's) is intent on preventing that. Much of this book centers upon Ukiah's search for his forgotten childhood (an interesting twist on amnesia). The plotline is a search & rescue operation for a kidnapped friend.I've not read the book before this, about Ukiah's youth, and found the \\"Tainted Trail\\" stood on its own. This book didn't leave me thinking \\"Wow\\", but I read it quickly and enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","review":"I am currently reading the third book in this series, &quot;Bitter Waters&quot; and it is taking off quite well. I really enjoyed &quot;Alien Taste&quot; and &quot;Tainted Trail&quot;, which I just finished last night. I have to admit that the reason I bought the books was because of the main character's name, Ukiah Oregon. I happen to live in Eastern Oregon &amp; know personally where Ukiah is. I found the story line quite intriguing &amp; thought it was well written, other than a few grammatical errors, which other reviewers also mentioned. But all in all, the story was good. In &quot;Tainted Trail&quot;, the book is centered around Pendleton, Oregon. I live 22 miles from there &amp; recognize the places the author obviously visited in order to get research on the novel. I really enjoyed reading a book that was located close to where I live. Believe me, that doesn't happen. Anyway, the books are fast, fun &amp; remind me of the X-Files before that series ended. So suspend disbelief and have fun reading!"},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","review":"Tainted Trail is the sequel to Alien Taste and continues the adventures of Ukiah Oregon. When Alicia, a close friend, goes missing in Oregon, Max and Ukiah fly out to try and find her. They quickly discover that Alicia's disappearance is a kidnapping and begin a race against the clock. In their search for her, Ukiah finds out that he may be the legendary Wolf Boy that was lost in 1933. He tries to contact the Kicking Deers, who wrote the original newspaper article and offered a reward for information on Magic Boy, but they think he is another fraud and refuse to speak with him. Meanwhile, Max begins to fall in love with Sam, a private investigator whose ex-husband refuses to believe the marriage is over, and discovers that there have been many unexplained deaths in the area. Is there a link between Alicia and the other deaths? How are the Kicking Deers involved? What is Ukiah going to do with his \\"father\\" Rennie when he comes out to protect him? Another great mystery featuring Ukiah Oregon.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I got very attached to Spencer's characters in Alien Taste and was excited to see them again in this book. Ukiah is a fascinating combination of innocence and deadly skills. Readers will enjoy learning more about Ukiah as he slowly discovers who and what he is. It was also great to learn more about Rennie, Ukiah's main Pack contact, and his past. Max Bennett finds a love interest this time and starts to come alive again after his first wife's death. Sam is the object of his affections and I look forward to learning more about her because she is one tough lady. I did miss Indigo and Kittaning in this book, though, as they were back in Pittsburgh.Wen Spencer has a nice, smooth writing style that reads very quickly and easily. She has a great plot that keeps you glued to this book and many subplots that add to, rather than detract from, this book as a whole. For those of you who haven't read Alien Taste, I highly recommend that you do (because I like to read series in order), but, if you haven't, you can read this book and understand everything because Spencer gives nice synopses throughout. However, it does not detract or bore those readers who already know what she is talking about. Tainted Trail has lovely characterization, nice descriptive details, an exciting plot line - in short, this book has it all!"},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","review":"In this sequel to _Alien Taste_, Ukiah Oregon, his friends and assorted &quot;family&quot; are involved in tracing another disappearance. This time, the missing, possibly kidnapped person is a close friend. The action takes place in Oregon, a place where as a young boy Ukiah was found by his adopted parents. The search is not only for the missing woman, but also for the missing memories of Ukiah's youth.As in the previous book, the author creates a combination of appealing characters and involving plot. The beginning of the book is rather slow, but is effective in building anxiety for the missing woman. The adventure accelerates, and sustains a high level of suspense to the end. There are elements of humor, wonder and romance sprinkled throughout. While a little of the humor is a bit forced, many lines are so well integrated that one breaks out into laughter involuntarily.This is science fiction, and inventive one at that. But the main attraction of the novel are the interesting characters and their interaction."},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","review":"Ukiah Oregon and his PI investigative partner Max are back, picking up the action a couple of months after 'Alien Taste' finished. Although the events of Alien Taste are synopsised at various points in Tainted Trail, I highly recommend that you read Alien Taste first, both for the background to this the second book, and because it is such an original, well conceived and executed tale in itself.Spencer continues this excellence in Tainted Trail. Ukiah and Max have come to Oregon to investigate the disappearance of the niece of colleague Kraynak, who is also known to them as she used to work for the agency. Ukiah, with his tracking abilities down to the cellular level, is quickly on the trail. As usual, that's where things start getting interesting. FBI, sheriff, family, Ontongard, Pack, and the recovery of a few more memories. It's great. Twists, turns, unanticipated events - as before, the reader learns with Ukiah as he finds out as much about himself as he does the case he is working on.Ukiah maturing - he's still somewhat of an innocent, but he is becoming more aware of light and dark, and shades of grey. Even Max, always heroic to Ukiah, causes him moments of disquiet here. But the essence of Ukiah is the same - someone who loves fiercely and loyally, and must protect those he loves at all costs. And even those that are Pack come to respect that element in him. I missed some of the characters in Alien Taste, especially Indigo who had to 'stay at home and mind the child' (urgh! Considering Indigo's steely strength I have to say I didn't like this passive role for her, but this is a very mild niggle). But meeting Magic Boy's family more than made up for it, and Max's own secondary story was excellent. Once again, in an author that clearly knows the seedy side of life, I really enjoyed that although bad things happened to good people, for those I really cared about Ukiah was eventually able to make it right - this time with help from Jared. Ukiah really is a true hero, overcoming the odds and fighting for what he sees as right. I enjoyed this book every bit as much as the first one, and am looking forward with great anticipation to reading the next (Bitter Waters)."},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","review":"This book is second in a series and is a much better read if you pick up Alien Taste before reading this book. Other than that its a great book with a lot of back ground on the main character being explained. My biggest complaints about this book are I wish some of my favorite characters from the first book had been included(there are only references to Ukiah Oregon's mothers)and even though it was over 300 pages in length I wish it had been longer because it raised more questions than it answered.If your looking for something different I'd try this alien detective meld, its not too cheezy."},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","review":"Ukiah Oregon's prospective mother-in-law recently described him as a \\"long-haired, teenage, Native American, Unitarian, Wolf Boy raised by lesbians, with an infant son obviously from a previously failed relationship.\\" If she only knew. Tainted Trail, set in a near-present-day United States, is Wen Spencer's second novel. Like her first, Alien Taste, it features Ukiah, a young man who was indeed raised by a lesbian couple near Pittsburgh, after being found as a feral child in the Oregon wilderness. Back in Alien Taste, however, Ukiah learned enough about his true origins to make the \\"wolf boy\\" business look downright tame.Tainted Trail includes enough back story to let it stand alone. The first two chapters are particularly background-heavy, which makes the current plot a bit slow on the start-up. It would be a mistake, though, to skip Alien Taste if it's available. While Spencer has managed to avoid the second-book-itis that often plagues new writers, the current story is more mundane than her first outing. Tainted Trail is a solid effort, and raises several plot points for future books, but Alien Taste is a better indication of why both books are marketed as science fiction.In Tainted Trail, Ukiah is off to Oregon with friend, mentor, and fellow private investigator Max Bennett; plus another friend, homicide detective Raymond Kraynak. Kraynak's niece, Alicia, has disappeared while hiking in Umatillo National Forest. That's the same area where Ukiah spent his feral childhood, so he hopes to pick up on a previous-fruitless-search for more of his personal history. The trio also hook up with Sam Killington, an Oregon PI working a set of insurance cases, part of a localized spike in accidental deaths and disappearances involving 35 people, including Alicia. These three plot threads intertwine to form the overall story. At first there's nothing tying them together except vague coincidences, but a good PI never puts much trust in coincidence.Spencer has chosen to make her protagonist-and virtually every other key character in the book-a man. Far fewer writers are successful at opposite sex point-of-view than the number who attempt it. Luckily, science fiction is more flexible than other writing genres. If Ukiah doesn't always ring entirely authentic as a young, contemporary American male, well, there are obvious reasons on which to pin any false notes. Still, it would be interesting to see Spencer focus on more characters she could fully inhabit from the inside out.She seems to have done her homework on the new locale and other story aspects. Her writing is lean and generally well-constructed. The grammar police note that it should be \\"someone who,\\" never \\"someone that,\\" does or says something. There are also occasional missing or incorrect parts of speech that cause momentary stumbles in the smooth flow of sentences. Finally, cells would propagate through a body, not \\"profligate.\\" Never mind; the story is worth reading and Spencer is worth another look whenever her next Ukiah Oregon book comes out."},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","review":"There is nobody in the world quite like Ukiah Oregon. His genetic make-up is that of an alien sire and an Earth woman. He has heightened senses, which make him an excellent tracker, is almost impossible to kill and is more than two centuries old. Ukiah's earliest memories were that of growing up and being raised by wolves until he was caught in a trap and adopted by two women who set the non-lethal snare.He works with private detective Max Bennett who is one of the few humans privileged to know about Ukiah's background. Their latest case takes them to Oregon where a hiker has gone missing. Her uncle has hired them to locate her but when Ukiah picks up the trail, he discovers that she is the victim of a kidnapping. While trying to locate her despite the attempts of the kidnappers to stop him, Ukiah also tries to follow a promising link to his mother's family which, in turn, leads him to his father's enemies.Containing elements from the mystery and science fiction genres, TAINTED TRAIL is a unique and highly entertaining reading experience. It is easy to believe that the hero is a lovable half-breed alien, which makes the underlying premise for this work easy to accept. The mystery is a tightly woven cerebral puzzle that is almost impossible to figure out until the author reveals the final clues. Hopefully Wen Spencer will continue to write about Ukiah Oregon (the person, not the place).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","review":"Tainted Trail (2002) is the second SF novel in the Ukiah Oregon series, followingAlien Taste. In the previous volume, the alien ship on Mars was destroyed. Ukiah acquired a younger brother -- Kittanning -- from a blood mouse. The Hex Gets were exterminated from the Pittsburgh area.In this novel, Ukiah Oregon is a young alien-human half breed. He has been killed at least twice and recovered from the condition. He is also the only breeder on Earth able to truly propagate his kind.Maxwell Bennett is a private detective. He was hired to discover Ukiah's origins. Although failing that task, Max grew to like the boy and occasionally hired him as a tracker. Now they are partners in the private investigator business.Kraynak is a detective in the Pittsburgh Police Department. He and Max were military policemen in the same unit during the Gulf war. Since they were both from Pittsburgh, the friendship continued after the war.Alicia is the niece of Max's friend Kraynak. She has known Ukiah since he started working for Max. She is slightly older than his official age.Indigo Zheng is an FBI special agent. She investigated the Janet Haze case and became Ukiah's lover.Sam Killington is a private investigator in Pendleton, Oregon. She had divorced her former husband two years before, but has recently gotten a court order to keep him from stalking her.Rennie Shaw is a Get of Ukiah's father Prime and the leader of the Get Pack. The Ontongard Gets have alien blood, but cannot propagate their kind except by making other Gets.In this story, Alicia had come to Oregon with another student. Rose had originally been scheduled to do the geological survey with someone else, but the other student had cancelled at the last minute. Then Rose had sprained her ankle and Alicia went for a hike on her own.After Alicia had not returned in a reasonable time, Rose called the Sheriff's office and Kraynak. Kraynak then hired Max and Ukiah to find her. They had only a few hours to prepare for the trip.Since Kittanning is officially her son, Ukiah feels that Indigo is the appropriate person to mind the baby. He asks her and she agrees. So Ukiah drops off Kittanning on the way to the airport.First they fly south to Houston and then north to Portland. There they take a commuter flight to Pendleton. Kraynak is airsick for the whole trip.After reaching Pendleton, Max hires two SUVs at the Hertz agency. Max and Kraynak take their gear to the hotel.

Then he discovered that the article was dated September, 1933, and ignored it. But now they know that Ukiah is over 200 years old, so he goes to talk with Jesse Kicking Deer.A woman meets Ukiah at the door, but refuses him entry. After the missing boy is mentioned, she tells him to get off her property. When he refuses to leave, she calls her son to evict him from the premises. Later Ukiah learns that her son is Jared Kicking Deer, Sheriff of Umatilla County.Returning to the hotel, Ukiah finds Max and Kraynak in the dining room talking to an unknown woman. Sam introduces herself as a newspaper stringer, but Ukiah remembers from the airport. She then shows them her PI credentials.The next morning, Max, Ukiah and Kraynak drive to the campground where Alicia had been staying. They meet Rose there and find out more about the disappearance. Then Ukiah puts on his gear and starts looking.Local searchers had covered the whole area and found nothing. Ukiah starts at the tent and soon finds Alicia's trail out of the campground and into the hills. He follows the trail for miles while Max and Jared parallel him on the road.Ukiah finds signs of a man herding Alicia to the nearby road. Then he finds where Alicia has fallen from a cliff and waves at the others to show them the location. Someone shoots him twice with a high powered rifle, but the bullets are stopped by his kevlar vest.Later Ukiah finds where two men and a woman had grabbed Alicia at the road and put her into a car. Ukiah can only follow the car for a short distance. The local police and the FBI gather the available physical evidence and start looking for the abductors.Ukiah tells the police what he has discovered from the traces. But he does not tell them about the DNA samples that he has found on the way. Only he knows that the man herding Alicia was blonde.After Ukiah calls home, he learns that the shooting in now known in Pittsburgh. His foster mothers know and so does the Pack. Rennie is on his way to Pendleton.This tale finds Ukiah recovering many of his older memories. He even convinces the Kicking Deer family that he is their Uncle. He also finds Gets in Oregon.Ukiah is injured several times in this story, but recovers before they return home. The next installment isBitter Waters.

Every single teaching of the JW's are directly from the Bible. Let them bring any bible they wish to bring to disprove any teachings, as well as any interpatation of the Hebrew and Greek languages as an aid to their quest to disprove that the JW's teach only from the bible. The Real Fear that these people have is the knowledge or fear that once they know the Truth you cannot deny it, which having an acurate knowledge of the teachings of Jesus Christ the Only Begotten Son, not a trinity as many religions try to teach and the Father, who Does Have a name, one that has been removed by most part from bibles used today to hide the name of Jehovah. Isn't the the term god a title such as governor or priest? Everyone has a name and would we not want those who we love or who love us to use our name, or call us hey you. Jehovah is the Grand Creators name, and he revealed this was His name to use so that we would know His name as we know Jesus' name, so when we worship him, it is as personal as a relationship can be, as He knows us by name, even to the number of hairs on our head. It is easier to what is easy, that is the way Satan wants it in his last remaining short time he has left to take with him. But doing what is required of Jehovah God to be acceptable is not easy but having an accurate understanding of his inspired Word will not just \\"get you saved\\" as many religions believe is all that is required of us, but getting to know Jehovah, and His perect love for us by sending His only begotten Son, to come to earth and live a perfect life and to die for us, and to be our Redeemer, in the presence of God is not easy, but was hard but loving for all of us."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"All in all, I was disappointed in this book. I left the religion after 45 years so I know the teachings well. Many of David Reed's comments on the verses were not proven with enough conviction that you could actually answer a Witness with his thoughts.He has a lot of opinions, but without biblical backing the Witnesses would not even question their beliefs. I have trouble believing he was ever a devout Witness.All of us have opinions, but without scriptural support, a Witness would not listen.I believe the books by Ray Franz have much more force since he was on their Governing Body and wrote much of the literature. I really enjoyed his two books and believe what he said."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"David Reed's book is a powerful tool in the hands of Bible believers who need to know what to say to a Jehovah's Witness who is bent on pushing the Watchtower's interpretation of Scripture. Mr. Reed exposes the New World Translation of the Bible as a perversion in a short, but concise chapter that every Christian should read. Another chapter gives a brief but crystal clear summation of the Watchtower's interpretation of various doctrines and eschatological events. The real beauty of Mr. Reed's book is his ability to reveal what the witnesses will say when they are on my front porch, and what my response will be if I am to reach them for Christ. I was glad that I had I read it when I was visited last Saturday Morning by some people from the local kingdom hall. Mr. Reed's book is simple to read yet extremely informative."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"I thought I should inform people looking for contorversial literature on Jehovah's Witnesses that a reviewer who claims to be &quot;A Reader&quot; from America, or various cities or states, is really a JW.

At 17 years old, I began searching for the love of God which I had not yet found. Asking Jesus to live in your heart is the only way to truly understand what the Holy Spirit reveals to us through the Bible.

This is a great book that will aide you in coming to your own conclusion on what the Bible says, not what the Watchtower Society wants you to believe it says."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"I read this and \\"How to answer Jehovah's Witnesses Subject by Subject\\" by David A Reed and \\"How to Answer Jehovah's Witnesses\\" by Dr. Robert Morey. All three are excellent resources but all different in the approach they take to teach the reader in this area. This book is good for the verse for verse answer's but did not have the answer for when they use Proverbs as an example for the creation of Christ. The answer was addressed in Dr. Morey's book for that verse. Additional resources can be found at David Reed's internet site- Comments to the Friends. I have purchased original books from the Watchtower Organization (1968 Watchtower, 1972 Awake, 1975 Jehovah's Witness Yearbook etc.)just to verify for myself some of the information stated in Dr. Morey's book and everything that I have checked does confirm what has been said.In addressing the JW who wrote above, see my response for the book written by David Reed on Jw's answered subject by subject. In addressing the person who wrote that it does not matter what other people believe and we should get a life I ask him to consider the following. Paul said to tell the TRUTH in love, not just to love. Jude 1:3 says to defend the faith. Titus 1:9 says to rebuke those sharply so that they will be sound in the faith. Galations chapter 1 says that anyone who preaches a different Gospel than what Paul taught was accursed and 1 Corinthians chapter 15 does not say anything about Christ returning in 1914 as JW's assert. Jesus rebuked the Pharisees publically and continually to show their errors (Mathew Chapter 23 & many others. Consider for a moment that we actually care about JW's, Mormons and other false religions and try to tell them about the only true gospel of Jesus Christ. Consider that people have died from not recieving blood transfussions from the watchtowers teachings and ask yourself if you should keep quit. We ask JW's to look at the scripture as the final authority to see if what they believe is true as the Bereans did in the book of Acts. Go to James Whites site(alpha and Omega ministries, where you can get a MP3 download that shows how they changed the Bible into the New World Translation and edited sections just to match their beliefs. This book is a great resource and I strongly recommend it and Crisis of Conscious."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"This book begins with a short introduction. It then has short chapters outlining the basic teachings of the Watchtower and critiquing the Watchtower's \\"New World Translation.\\" Then the bulk of the book is an index of verses from both the Old and New Testaments that are relevant to JWs. Then the last three chapters contain a short outline of Watchtower history, \\"Techniques for Sharing the Gospel with Jehovah's Witnesses,\\" and Reed's testimony of how he came out of the Watchtower.The verse-by-verse evaluations are excellent. The cover both verses JWs cite that they claim support their doctrines and verses showing that their doctrines are false. For the former, Reed gives a concise explanation of how the JWs are misusing the verse. For the latter, Reed explains what doctrine of the Watchtower the verse refutes and why.This is a very helpful resource to have around when a person gets \\"stumped\\" by something a JW says. He or she can look up the verse in this book and be prepared for the next time. And the JW, if he or she is open enough to listen, can see what \\"the other side\\" has to say about important verses.The opening and closing short chapters also contain helpful information. But given their brevity they do not provide a lot of detail. For further study on such subjects one would have to consult other books. But Reed's testimony is very interesting.Reed's companion book \\"Answering Jehovah's Witnesses: Subject by Subject,\\" would be another helpful resource to have around. It provides further details on subjects addressed in this book. And for additional Biblical study on subjects relevant to JWs, consult my book \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\" It contains three chapters on the Trinity and one on various other Watchtower teachings."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"David Reed, a former Jehovah's Witness elder, did a wonderful job writing this book in an extremely easy to read and follow manner. Not only is it informative and very helpful, this book does not simply tear down the JW's beliefs. This is not a book that just trashes someone else's beliefs.One of the excellent points made in the introduction of this book is worth mentioning here. As Christians, we send millions of people to the most distant destitute countries where they learn the most difficult languages all in order to lead the lost to Christ. If we are willing to do all of that long-distance evangelism, shouldn't we also spend as much time and effort in reaching the lost and misguided in our own communities?An interesting fact to know in the beginning is that the JW's use a translation of the Bible that has been created and printed by their headquarters, Watchtower, in Brooklyn, NY. This translation is used by their organization so their followers do not have to go to much effort to take out of context and distort the Scriptures; the work has already been done for them by Watchtower. Talk about cencorship! Their translation, New World Translation, also adds and removes words and entire verses at will to support their beliefs.One of the best parts of this book is that it guides you verse by verse through a conversation with JW's, using their own translation. Yes, that's right, this book lets you learn how to disprove their beliefs while letting them use their own distorted translation of God's Word. That's pretty impressive!You have to understand that JW's spend countless hours studying and preparing for their encounters with us at our doors. It's not that they are extremely knowledgeable, it's that they have prepared! This book will even the playing fields. You must read the entire book (very quick read) to be fully equiped to counter a conversation with a JW, but even after the first chapter you will have a solid stance of their beliefs and the distorted smoke screens they will attempt to confuse you with.Another great point made in this book is that JW's are simply trapped under the wing of an abusive and censoring multi-billion dollar empire. They believe things because they are told to from birth, not because they believe them. It is our job as followers of Christ to help the misguided just as much as those who know nothing about God. This book is more of a guide for \\"how to\\" reach those people.I recently organized an outreach event in our community to meet some of the people in our church's neighborhood. This type of evangelism is crutial to any church's survival. In any type of community event such as this, you are bound to encounter JW's who will tell you flat out you are wrong! They will be nice when they speak to you, but they will tell you you're going to hell. You need to be just as prepared as they are in order to correct their misinformation.Highly recommended to anyone, especially Christians!"},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"I felt this book did an exceltent job at telling its reader what the Jehovah's Witnesses believe and explaining what is wrong with each incorrect belief. He tells of blood transfusions, the cross, Michael, and other things, and he gives his personal testimony. This was a wonderful book, but the only problem was that now I don't know how to apply this information! I know more than many JW's do, but now I am like a computer to a caveman! It would be really useful, if only he could plug it in! I think this is a great first time book to prepare you for defensive warfare against the JW's that come to your door."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"I've been meeting with JW's almost every week for the past several months. Recently a neighbor has joined us in our meetings and he got me this book. For me, this book was most useful in simply trying to understand how the JW's have formed their beliefs: because some of them seem quite strange to me.Though I don't disagree with JW's on all of their stances, and I don't find many of them to be worth arguing about, there are a few key issues that are worth discussing more deeply. For those issues, you can turn to this book for some help when needed. It makes a great quick reference guide.My main complaint about this book is that it is a bit dated, and many of the references that Mr. Reed mentions are dated as well. But it is still a very worthwhile book since the JW's beliefs have hardly changed in the past 26+ years since the book was published.The part that I enjoyed the most was the author's own testimony at the end of the book. It reinforced the message that God has been trying to teach me: I'm not going to 'convert' them through a cleverly crafted argument about the trinity or any other theological topic. The author states that he simply started to read his Bible more often due to a challenge he received to read it more than Watchtower publications.In my meetings with the JW's I hope and pray the same thing happens: that I challenge them to get into God's Word more to lookup the questions that I ask them; and then in the end, may Jehovah's truth be more fully known to them."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"This is a great book for those people who want to see what the Bible teaches compared to what the Jehovah's Witnesses teach."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"This was a fantastic well written book. The author did his research. David Reed rationally explains the irrationality of Christians witnessing to thousands of people for recruitment purposes and association with a religious cult. I really appreciated all the back up. The book is well organized with sufficient research and documentation. The bonus is the addition of the history and split up surrounding the Watchtower Society.At times I run in the opposite direction of Jehovah Witnesses just to avoid the dialogue. I also refuse most times, to answer the door if I know it's them. However, I am now better prepared as a Christian to deal with their rhetoric and insistance upon being heard while ringing our doorbells early in the day.I just hope that most of them will soon realize that no one has the right--except God to tell another Christian that they cannot enter into heaven because it is full. Also not one of us has been provided with the names on the list for Judgement Day. No man has dominion over another. JW's must realize the prophecy business is not working for them; they are recieving and communicating false information and prophecies to already lost and confused souls needing a Saviour. Please continue to share the Good News in accordance with the the original writings of the Holy Bible so that souls are won for Christ."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"Just look at all the reviews from Jehovahs Witnesses attacking this book. This book threatens them because it teaches people the TRUTH about the bible. Thats why these \\"Witnesses\\" have posted here because it undermines their Watch Tower doctrine. You know if these people are posting here, attacking this book, then this is one book that is not only good, but definitely something that needs to be read. I saw one person on here say, \\"You dont need to read this book.\\" Of COURSE they will say that! Talk about censorship. Hey fella, should we just burn this book? Right...One man says that we should just love them. I agree with that, but to love them is to show them the truth. If you love them, you will WANT them to know the truth and show them how their doctrines they teach are wrong. There is ONE way to the Father and its not by any global Watchtower society. Its through Jesus Christ. Read your bible and stay away from the literature they provide. Just TRY it for a month. Come to your OWN conclussions and not by ones that are thought up by a group of men who think they have it right. No, you dont HAVE to read this book to come to the truth but I HAVE read this book and found it to be excellent. I wonder if THEY have read it before they bashed it."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"It's dangerous to pull out individual verses without doing enough comparison, because that's how all the different church doctrines got started in the first place, by selfish interests seeking out scriptures to prove their point rather than the way Jehovah's Witnesses do it, which is to examine a BUNCH of scriptures on the same topic, plus considering the context. Enough of the hate-mongering products, Amazon, please! Why does the author build himself up by tearing Jehovah's Witnesses down? Money? Or, perhaps he is sincere, but if so, this is not the way to go about sharing what you believe with others. We could use more loving attitudes in this world and less urging to hate others who are different from us.Jehovah's Witnesses have shown nothing but love to me from the first time they ever came to my door years ago, in answer to a heartfelt prayer for answers. By their love in seeking me out, I was able to recognize the truth, since the Bible explains that would be the identifying mark of the true faith--love. Now that I have become one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I would never write a book like this about my FORMER religion... Even though I think they are wrong and I'm glad to be out of it, that's not the way of love.What you think will be an honest scriptural discussion, turns out to be primarily the authors personal biased opinions and misapplied scriptures. I feel Jehovah's Witnesses have the best way of studying the Bible topic-by-topic as they strive to look up many verses on that same topic, to make sure the true meaning of God's word CLEARLY shines through."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"I am not a fan of \\"how to witness\\" books; I believe that the main problem with this sort of guides is that the Scriptures are often used as a weapon to attack cultists, rather than as a tool to lead them to Jesus' salvation.Witnessing is an important duty in every Christian's life, but I believe that the Bible should never be used to attack; if the Bible is used in such a way, its freeing power will lose its effect.However, I think that reading books such as this one could be useful to gather as much information on cults as possible before witnessing.This book is a collection of Bible verses commonly misquoted by Jehovah's Witnesses to prove their doctrines, followed by the same Scripture correctly interpreted in order to refute their erroneous teaching.David A. Reed's strategy to lead the Witness to Christ includes:1)showing them contradictory teachings published in old Watchtower's publications in order to help them realize that the Watchtower is not \\"God's channel of communication\\";2)once the Witness starts to question the Watchtower's authority, reason verse-by-verse through the various arguments they previously believed to support their doctrine.This book is designed to help you with the second point.Personally, I am not convinced of this organized approach, as I believe that, if you ask Jesus in prayer, He will give you words and wisdom to answer Jehovah's Witnesses."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"This book provides helpful biblical analysis in light of Jehovah's Witnesses Interpretation of the Bible. Mr. Reed helps the reader to answer JW's objections about the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the authority of the Bible; yet from a biblical and theological perspective.

Demeaning people is a dishonest way of building yourself up. I would like to know what David Reed did to get expelled from the organization of the Jehovah's Witnesses. He is very welcome to obtain my email address from the controllers of this website. I know people of this religion and they only expel you if you continue to practice sin. (2 Thess 3:13,14). I have seen different religions speak about abstaining from defilements of the flesh ( 2 Cor. 7:1 )then go right outside after preaching and fire up a cigarette. They believe that they will be forgiven if they ask afterwards to be forgiven for something they are at their own free will doing, knowing it's a sin. As a matter of fact, I can't think of one religion that has not be downed or someone not found something wrong with it. One can read a scripture in the bible and interpet it differently than someone else does. Only God knows one's heart. (People can hide who they really are at heart). Bottom line is Psalms 83:18 reads that Jehovah is God's name and he knows your heart. Psalms 139:16 reads God knew us before birth. I know that the bible does state that you will be judged according to what you know,(forgive me for not knowing that scripture by heart). You see different religions on the news that have engaged in wrongdoing but I don't see David Reed writing a book on them. All this so called money that the Organization of Jehovah's Witnesses have is received by donations only. They don't ask you to pay so much of your paycheck or donate a certain amount of money. It is strictly up to you to donate money to help take care of literature expenses and bills that are due at their place of worship. I know that I have been treated better by witnesses than any other people in other faiths.

I dont think you need a book like this to tell you how to treat Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormoms, Catholics, Buddists, Jews, or any other religion. The Bible already told us how to treat our fellow man - as ourself! Just love them.

David Reed breaks down each of the most common JW misinterpretations and answers them from a Biblical perspective. His biblical responses are solid, for the most part, although flawed in some spots. Overall though, this book is a solid resource for those interested in understanding JW doctrine and the JW mentality .Reed also includes a brief history of the Jehovah's Witnesses, his personal testimony (how he got in, and how he got out), and a section on how to share the gospel with Jehovah's Witnesses.

The JWs spend several hours each week studying and practicing for such encounters... It is to this end that the present volume has been prepared. In it I have set out to examine closely the Jehovah's Witnesses' favorite Bible verses... Each verse is considered from several angles... Other verses selected for discussion include the ones Jehovah's Witnesses ignore---the ones that their leaders carefully ignore when conducting followers on a guided tour of the Bible.\\"Here are some quotations from the book (page numbers refer to the 139-page 1986 edition):\\"But you do not have to be a Greek and Hebrew scholar to prove that the Watchtower Society has twisted these verses. Jehovah's Witnesses' own study Bibles prove that Jesus was claiming (in Jn 8:58) to be the I AM. Their 1984 large-print (NWT) has a footnote on Exodus 3:14, admitting that the Hebrew would be rendered into Greek as 'Ego eimi'---'I am.' And their 1985 Kingdom Interlinear Translation ... reveals that Jesus' words at John 8:58 are the same...\\" (Pg. 27)\\"Jesus never started out his prayers by saying, 'Jehovah God...'---as JWs so. Rather, Jesus began his prayers by saying 'Father...'\\" (Pg. 28-29)\\"How did the New World Bible Translation Committed punctuate the expression ('truly I say to you') in every other place where it appears? Where did all the commas go? There is a very easy way to find out... (in the 1973Comprehensive Concordance of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures) the commas all line up, EXCEPT for Luke 23:43. This is the only verse that they punctuated differently.\\" (Pg. 69)\\"Did ONE nail fasten Jesus' hands above his head, or did TWO nails hold his hands to the opposite ends of a cross beam? At John 20:25... Thomas spoke of the 'nails' (plural) in Jesus' hands---not a single nail, as in Watchtower illustrations.\\" (Pg. 83)\\"Revelation 7:15 places the 'great crowd' before the throne of God in heaven... there is one other place where Revelation talks about the 'great crowd.' Would you please read Revelation 19:1 in your own Bible to see where it locates the 'great crowd'?\\" (Pg. 109)"},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"This is definitely a starter book for those that want to get into the subject. He doesn't go deep into it as much because of the tone of the volume.

The Author stays on point and attempts to be as unbiased as possible, although it is sometimes impossible to do when dealing with this subject."},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","review":"One Saturday morning I had a JW stop by my house. In the past, I have always been eager to engage w/o knowing the facts of their beliefs, all I used to know was that they didn't believe in the trinity and that their door to door work was their way to salvation. Ephesians 8 clears that right up but when I saw this middle aged man with a 8 year old boy named Marcel, who was adopted from infancy and taught this false doctrine, I felt led to seek out some answers on how to plant some seeds to the next visitor. David Reed gives you the resources and also a simple way to deliver, like some other reviewer wrote, first and foremost, with love.Reed gives you FACTS in regard to failed prophecies (Christ return, Armageddon), revisions made in the NWT (new world translation)to suit their beliefs such as the changing of the verbage in Exodus 3:14 and John 8:58 where Jesus references \\"I am\\". Their own 1984 NWT study bible w/references has a footnote stating the original greek \\"ego eimi\\" means \\"I am\\". However the new watchtower translation does not even make the correlation!This book is not just for the Christian wishing to share the good news to the JW but it is also a wake up call to the JW to read the bible, not the watchtower, all scripture is God breathed why not read it instead of ANYTHING else."},{"Title":"Guy Noir: Radio Private Eye","review":"I love GK's Lake Woebegon stuff, but this tape is even funnier!

Since most WWII Allied aircraft carried some sort of code to identify the unit, this work comes in very handy in helping with that bit of information.The one negative is that the codes are broken up into various groupings, such as the different countries, the different air arms and branches, which makes it a bit harder to identify a code. I was expecting this to have a complete single alphabetical listing that I could just scan and quickly get the answer I need.There is a basic listing similar to that, but it then directs you to another chapter or appendix to get the actual info. The book does provide more info than just the identification of the codes, which is nice. Had the book been a little easier to use I would have given it five stars.There are some web sites that have some of this code information, but I've yet to find a single site that has all that is in this book.

As far as imagined events- I happen to be Wiccan, so naturally I was drawn to the book for the title- and I was not disappointed on the magic side of the story. The land of fairie is very accurately represented from the Celtic folktales I've read- there's an encounter with the Wild Hunt, an interesting take on Clan symbolism, and of course, the occasional fun conjure. When there were sex scenes in the book, I found them to be quite in keeping with the story and not gratuitous.The fear of torture, real to any woman who's studied the time period, was portrayed very well also.Go for it- the only thing you'll be sorry about is that there is no sequel!

I can not wait to give it to my neice for Christmas."},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT, by Beatrix Potter, has enchanted both children and adults for generations. An exciting adventure book for the wee ones, THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT is the story of Peter, who is very naughty. Peter disobeys his mother, and goes to Mr. McGregor's garden, where he gets into all manner of trouble. While Peter does eventually make it home, he is wet, sick, and has lost his clothes (his second set of clothes in a fortnight!), and his mother gives him chamomile tea for supper. His sisters, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who are good little bunnies, get bread and milk and blackberries for supper.THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT gently teaches children to mind their mothers - good little children are given rewards, naughty children get into trouble. This simple tale engages and captivates youngsters who can easily relate to Peter's mischievousness. And while that lesson and Ms. Potter's story are both timeless, it is Ms. Potter's charming illustrations that are the true star of this book. Peter is drawn to look like a real rabbit; a rabbit that wears a very dapper jacket and a little pair of shoes. The soft colors and rich detail of the original drawings continue to delight children throughout the ages.My three year old adores hearing this story. Whenever we read it together, she loves to shout \\"Stop thief!\\" with Mr. McGregor and to sneeze \\"Kertyschoo!\\" with Peter. She clearly gets great fun and joy out of this classic tale, as do I.

This interesting monstrosity takes a book that was previous perfect and renders it perverse. I am reviewing the original Beatrix Potter edition of this tale, but because Amazon.com doesn't like to differentiate reviews, I'm fairly certain that this review will also appear for the McPhail book as well. Please, dear readers, do not in any way shape or form purchase the McPhail version if you want the original adept \\"Peter Rabbit\\"! Where Potter is adept and charming, McPhail is syrupy and doe-eyed. Where Potter is subtle, McPhail is over the top. Where Potter succeeds, McPhail fails. To locate an original edition of \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" click on the author \\"Beatrix Potter\\" as it appears at the top of this screen. That should bring you to a selection of choices, one of which is the original \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\". Oddly, the only way to purchase that particular original version of the tale is to select her name. I don't know why. Call it a flaw in the Amazon.com system, if you will.Now, why doesn't Peter Rabbit age? I'm not being literal here, people, so please don't inundate me with explanations that patiently explain that fictional characters in books cannot get old. I won't hear a word of it. Reading \\"Peter Rabbit\\" today is just as fresh and new an experience as it was one hundred years ago. Author Beatrix Potter created the story of Peter Rabbit for a young boy with whom she was acquainted. Using the novel idea of drawing animals as they appeared in nature, just in funny clothes and talking, her books are remarkable because she had a dual talent for both illustration and clever narrative. Now after all these years I opened up \\"Peter Rabbit\\" to see why I loved it as much as I did as a kid. And the fact of the matter is, it hasn't aged a smidgen. A remarkable and astounding feat for a story originally published in 1903.Peter lives, as many of us know, in a large fir tree with his mother and his siblings Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail. His father was baked in a pie (a fact that many parents have decried as too dark for children, and that many children have shrugged at without a second thought). Though instructed by his mother NOT to go digging in Mr. McGregor's garden, he's a naughty little thing. His tasty trip is brought up short, however, when he stumbles across the farmer himself. In the course of their chase Peter loses his little blue jacket with the shiny brass buttons and must return to his mother (after a series of close shaves) without it or his shoes. He is promptly put to bed with a cup of camomile tea (a fate we non-camomile tea drinkers must assume is harsh) while his siblings eat the tasty blackberries they picked that morning.Beatrix Potter claimed that though she was adept at illustrating animals, she had the darndest time (my words, not hers) drawing people. You will note, therefore, that Mr. McGregor is a bit of a featureless wag. The story was remarkable in that it was the first time (I believe) that animals drawn in a picture book actually looked like real animals. Peter is exactly the kind of bunny you'd expect to catch in your yard, except that he's occasionally wearing jaunty spring wear. The similarities in this tale to that of the Brer Rabbit tales of the American South is interesting but due to the fact that Potter was writing this story in 1903 Britain, she probably didn't steal the plot. The book is a classic in the purest sense, of course. If you can get a copy that is small (intended from the start to be the size that little hands could open easily) do. It's a beautiful tale that is as fresh and green today as it was when written long long ago. A classic."},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"Although it's presented as if it were \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" by Beatrix Potter, this is actually a HEAVILY edited version that bears little resemblance to the original. It's terrible. Compare, for instance, a passage from Beatrix Potter's original \\"Peter Rabbit\\":\\"Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate. He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes. After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.\\"In this board-book version, this becomes: \\"Peter was very frightened. He rushed all over the garden and lost both his shoes. Then he tripped and got caught in a net.\\"All of the charm of the original story has been lost, replaced with a clunky and hamfisted summary of events. It's like the Cliff Notes version of \\"Peter Rabbit.\\" It's ridiculous--the original story is already short, and has been beloved by small children for generations. There was NO NEED to butcher Beatrix Potter this way."},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"I purchased this book for our daughter when she was about 6 months old but she wasn't at all interested in it, unlike 95% of our other purchases. Then at about 12 months she picked it out for me to read it to her, and it has increasingly become a favorite. I think the reason she didn't like it earlier on was, ironically, the same reason I readily purchased it - the beautiful watercolor illustrations. While they are very beautiful, they are somewhat muted resulting in a look that blurs all of the detail together. Of course, this is just a guess. At any rate, she now very much enjoys this book, and anticipates the action, such as Peter sneezing, or the &quot;scr-r-ritch, scratch&quot; of a hoe. Board books with a storyline are somewhat more difficult to find than the counting, color, alphabet, opposites, etc. kind, and my daughter has always definitely enjoyed stories. Additionally, this book teaches us there are repercussions for our actions, but in a tone that is mild and appropriate for young toddlers. If this is what you're looking for, and you're not looking for storybooks for a younger baby, this would be an excellent choice."},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"For those with very young children who love to read, the Penguin Books series of the original and authorized edition of Beatrix Potter's classic tales are as appropriate as they can be. My 3 year old prefers books sized perfectly for his small hands, and the fact that each tale is here reproduced one book at a time (as opposed to treasuries and collections in one tome) makes it all the more appealing to him.Beatrix Potter doesn't shy away from more difficult words to tell her story, respecting the ability of children to absorb all kinds of material at an early age. The illustrations in the Frederick Warne and Company Original Edition are just right in detail and tone, neither overwhelming nor detracting from the text.The story of a naughty young rabbit who decides to disobey his mother by trespassing into Mr. McGregor's garden is told with a sensitivity to the reality of the lives of animals that is rare in today's children's books. It doesn't go out of its way to recite platitudes, contenting itself to simply telling the story of what happens when young Peter finds himself lost in the farmer's garden, in grave danger of turning into rabbit pie like his father before him, and with nothing but his wits to save him. It's a great story about the consequences of disobedience and the importance of courage, that is, not giving up however dire the situation may be. It makes for great discussions during and after readings, and the straightforward events that resonate in the physical world of children makes a wonderful springboard for encouraging tots to retell the story in their own words."},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"This is a nice version of this classic. I had not read this story before and enjoyed sharing the tale of this naughty rabbit with my three year old daughter.

He escapes and returns home to his mother who puts him to bed after dosing him with camomile tea.Please be aware that this ebook version does NOT contain the lovely original illustrations by Beatrix Potter that we are all familiar with. Instead, it is the 1916 edition with illustrations by Virginia Albert. While her drawings are very nice, the book just is not the same without our familiar Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, and Peter.The Vook edition is nicely formatted with colored drawings (for those viewing with an iPad or device that is not a black and white Reader.)"},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"Now that I'm working on my fourth edition of this classic title, I thought it was time to merge the reviews to make comparison easier. Each edition has its own star rating, below, before the review text.First, the standard recap: Peter disobeys his mother and sneaks into Mr MacGregor's garden, despite knowing that his father ended up in a pie. Spotted and chased, Peter barely escapes and returns home wet and sick and is dosed with camomile tea. (I have yet to find a version that's so Americanized that it's spelled chamomile, which I think is a cool detail.) His siblings feast on bread and milk and blackberries.ISBN 1403753911The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Based on the original art and story)4 stars - Board book edition. Very small, about 3 1/2 x 3 1/2 inches, excellent for taking along. In this edition, it's spelled McGregor. Not that it matters. This edition doesn't mention Peter's father's end as pie filling, a plus for the squeamish or over-sensitive. Or vegetarian. In this version, the clothes Peter loses are put to use by Mr McGregor as a scarecrow. Mother wonders about his clothes, but no fuss is made. And, of course, Peter feels unwell and is put to bed and given some tea (just tea, not camomile tea). Cute, great for little ones and the text hits all the relevant points. The illustrations are a bit on the dark side, and are a bit small.ISBN 1569870217The Tale of Peter Rabbit(3 stars) - Hardcover edition. This is the basic story with few frills. The illustrations are average and have nothing in the way of surprises. Not a bad book, but certainly not a great re-telling of this tale.ISBN 1569870675The Tale of Peter Rabbit(5 stars) - This copy is a hardcover, most suitable to children whose little fingers can handle the pages. It's also 24 pages long - just long enough for beginning readers. Father still ends up in a pie, Peter still disobeys his mother and goes into Mr MacGregor's garden. The chase in this book is better written than 1569870217 (above), with a mention of Peter's cousin, Benjamin Bunny, as a nice way to introduce your children to other Potter books. Peter still ends up barely escaping, losing all his clothes to Mr MacGregor, and arriving home sick. This copy has more detail, and much nicer illustrations than others. Peter, when caught up in the gooseberry net, or with a tear in his eye as he tries to ask directions of the mouse, are wonderfully done. I'd never have thought there could be such a difference between various copies of the same story, but you learn something new every day - unlike Peter, who just can't seem to learn and has lost his second set of clothing in a fortnight (nice detail)!ISBN 0723244324The Tale of Peter Rabbit Story Board Book (Potter)(4 stars) - Board book binding, best for very young children whose fingers can't manipulate paper pages easily. There are a couple differences in this book: Father and his ignoble end as pie filling aren't mentioned. The fact that Peter returns home sick is left out, so his mother merely puts him to bed with camomile tea for no apparent reason and no fuss is made over his missing jacket. This version is greatly abridged, but is an okay introduction for little ones. The illustrations are full of lots of details and are very much on the pastel side, which I don't like, but that's common with Potter's tales.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"Though the subtle watercolors attract my baby less than some of the brighter illustrations in other books, the realistic depiction of animals is fantastic as I'd like her to recognize actual animals rather than pink elephants, etc. And it's a classic story that I'm glad she'll grow up with."},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"Peter Rabbit is one of four rabbits in his family.

Peter slips away from his brother's and sister's while they play in the fields and decides to see this wonderful garden. While in the garden, Peter fills his stomach with delicious carrots, lettuce and other various vegetables. While eating, Mr. McGregor finds the somewhat stuffed rabbit and chases him around his garden.

Peter keeps sneaking into Mr McGregor's garden and eating his lettuce, but he has to make a quick escape, before Mr McGregor catches Peter.My favourite character is Peter because he's daring and sly just like most of my friends. The most exciting moment for me is when Peter Rabbit goes back for his jacket and shoes. It's hard for Peter not to get caught here because his clothes are right near to Mr McGregor's house and Mr McGregor has an observant eye.The author (Beatrix Potter) grew up looking after animals so she started to write about them. Beatrix lived in the Lake District and she was very famous (she still is now) for the tourist and the locals.

This story tells one of the iconic Peter Rabbit's adventures. Beautifully illustrated in full color, and told with a sense of harsh honesty not often present in other children's books of this time.Peter Rabbit, despite the warnings of his mother, enters the dreaded Mr. McGregor's garden and feasts upon the man's forbidden vegetables. When Mr. McGregor sees Peter, he begins a pursuit of Peter that lasts most of the story. Frantic, Peter does everything that he can to avoid Mr. McGregor. Peter almost gets caught, but thankfully, due to a little luck and some motivation from friends, Peter is ultimately able to escape.The story ends with Peter hopefully having learned a lesson. He pays for his misbehavior by being too sick to enjoy dinner. A true classic, and one that I highly recommend.Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare, a children's book.The Mischievous Hare"},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"When this was published in 2002 on the occasion of the original's Centennial, it included never before seen artwork.

Flopsy, Mopsy and I think Cottontail are good little bunnies who listen to there mother while Peter does not.I do think this book could've easily had pictures but I guess the people who had decided to re-write this thought it was easier to leave them out. Like the original, this book is full of fun for little kids and I think kids my age (ten yrs) might still like reading this after getting older and older and older!I think that Potter's literature was very well written and full of lots of expression.

Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottaintale obey their mother, but Peter, the mischievous of the four rabbits, ignores his mother's warning and ventures off for some tasty food from Mr. McGregor's garden. While Peter is greedily eating some radishes, he is spotted by Mr. McGregor. Peter tries to dash out of Mr. McGregor's way, only getting further and further away from the garden gate. Will Peter get away from Mr. McGregor, and find his way out of the garden? What will happen when his mother hears what he has done?Personal Response:I have loved this story since I was little, probably because any child can relate to Peter's mischievous ways. I have not met a child who could not attest to getting in over their heads after doing something they were told not to do. Beatrix Potter does an amazing job illustrating this well known tale. She brings life to the characters with her beautifully detailed illustrations. The illustrations have soft lines and curves to give a pleasant fell to the story. The pictures go along with the pages of the story as well as adding detail to the reader's mind about the plot and setting. The reader can see the vastness of the garden by looking at Beatrix Potter's illustrations.The author's ability to suspend disbelief is not very great, because of the nature of the story. This story is made to be a fairy tale, which is not usually believable to children or adults. Children are accustomed to talking animals in stories at the age they would read this book. However, the plot of the story is very realistic to the child. It is realistic because the child can relate to disobeying their parent, and getting into trouble of some sort. They can also relate to the punishment that Peter gets at the end of the story."},{"Title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Read and Hear)","review":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter was an excellent book. I would recommend it to people of all ages even though it was s targeted towards younger children. The book was about four little rabbits that all wanted to go down the lane or into the fields. The only place that they were not allowed to go was Mr. McGregor's garden. Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail were good little bunnies and went down the lane to the field. But Peter was very mischievous. He went to Mr. McGregor's garden!! When he got into the garden he saw the best sight of his life. There was food galore! He started to eat and eat and eat. He couldn't stop.

Interestingly, I discovered that Beatrix Potter was a botonist who was one of the earliest to note the interrelationship between fungi and algae in lichen.

While being a work of speculative fiction, the book manages to address some tough and very real subjects. The taboos within these pages tend to be in the closets of many families. Without giving too much away, I can tell you that it evokes quite a few emotions (so get out your tissues.) It is a very fast and enjoyable read and is highly recommended.Pamela Walker WilliamsPageTurner.net"},{"Title":"A Sunday In June","review":"From the author of \\"Stigmata\\" comes the long awaited prequel, \\"A Sunday in June.\\" The story takes us through an amazing journey through the lives with three sisters who each have a special gift of \\"sight.\\" Born two generations after slavery ended, the sisters each endure a terrible secret that threatens to destroy their family.Phyllis Alesia Perry does a wonderful job creating characters that we want to share their struggles. This journey takes us through rural Alabama with a voice so strong that the reader is immersed in Johnson's Creek rooting on Grace, Mary Nell, and Eva--the Mobley girls, in hopes that they will each triumph over their individual adversities.Although the novel had a slow start, by the fifth chapter the reader is strapped to an speedy rollercoaster ride as your emotions run the gamut. Once you learn the sisters' secrets, it is difficult to put the book down as you desperately will each sister to save themselves and resolve issues that are bound to tear their relationship apart.This is an incredible read for discussion groups as you will study such issues as family secrets, sisterhood bonds, and how much does the past affect our future. After completing this novel, a reader is bound to pick up \\"Stigmata\\" if they haven't already to find out how some of the issues are resolved.All in all, Perry does a magnificent job creating such a difficult tale about \\"A Sunday in June.\\"--Review by **Tiffany**"},{"Title":"A Sunday In June","review":"A Sunday in June is the long awaited prequel to Stigmata. It is the story of the Mobley's \\"curse\\" that has besieged their family for generations. Set in 1920's Johnson Creek, Alabama and spanning four decades, the novel largely focuses on the two younger sisters, Mary Nell and Eva, who possess psychic abilities and often experience the same visions. Their visions throughout their childhood are prophetic and accurate, but one vision involving Mary Nell's future husband terrifies the girls and threatens to tear the family apart. Their destinies collide one Sunday in June and the sister's relationship changes forever.At the same time, the oldest sister, Grace, discovers a trunk that contains artifacts from her ex-slave grandmother (Ayo). Ayo's spirit visits Grace causing her to relive Ayo's horrific middle passage, experiences as a slave (beatings, rapes, etc.) and will eventually drive Grace and her descendants to madness as detailed in Stigmata.The book chronicles the lives of the sisters as they grow into adulthood and how their \\"gifts\\" severely influence their choices in life. It shows how ill-equipped the parents were at handling their daughters' talents and chose largely to dismiss the signs as insomnia or bad dreams. While I loved Stigmata, I liked A Sunday in June; although both books were well constructed with compelling plots filled with lyrical prose. A Sunday in June is not a quick read; it is one that must be absored slowly. The author's message is deep but rings loud and clear - the pasts affects us all and she emphasizes the importance of seeking resolution and healing from family trauma.Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClub, The Nubian circle Book Club"},{"Title":"A Sunday In June","review":"In a world of the unseen, The Mobleys are plagued by gifts that are not privy to the norm. Grace, Mary Nell and Eva, the daughters of Frank and Joy, are constantly driven to odds against the world. Amongst shattered dreams and stolen moments, the three girls are brought full circle through turbulence, turmoil and adulthood.Mary Nell and Eva share the sight of knowing the future. As little girls, they were inseparable; from the bed they slept in, to every waking thought. The painful process of growing up leads them through a whirlwind of events: Mary Nell gets married to the town's bad boy, her husband rapes her sister Eva at thirteen and Eva gets pregnant and has a baby. Although Mary Nell witnessed the rape with her own \\"sight\\", she still blames Eva for her husband's disloyalty. After being raped, Eva is never the same and longs for the same sisterhood bond she shared with Mary Nell. Through all of this turmoil, Mary Nell develops a deep-seated resentment and steals the very same baby from Eva that she could never give her own husband, developing a life of hatred and bitterness towards Eva.Grace, the oldest, has the gift of knowing the past. Through this gift, she experiences hardship and pain, as the spirit of her dead great-grandmother Bessie and her alter-ego Ayo completely engulf her on a regular basis. Not only does the spirit give her insight and depth of the struggles she endured as a slave while in Africa and the States, Grace also has the ability to feel the same pain as her grandmother did, complete with scars, blood and bruises. Grace gets married, has kids and tries to move on, but eventually has to leave everything behind, trying to run from the one thing that has always had full rein over her life...Phyllis Alesia Perry does an excellent job of giving a true-to-life depiction of how the myth of having \\"the sight\\" may actually be true. A SUNDAY IN JUNE is a well-written, captivating story with depth, feeling and compassion. The characters portrayed in this novel are finely-tuned, keeping the readers entranced within the story. A refreshing look into the mystical realms of the unknown.Reviewed by Belindaof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"IMPROVISATION FOR THE CONTEMPORARY MUSICIAN (Text)","review":"This is a wonderful book. The ideas presented as keys to improvisation are 1) changing note values, 2) adding notes to a melody, and 3) using chord tones. These are fairly basic ideas, but what makes the book so useful is that the author presents lots of examples based on some classic tunes, and provides analysis of them. This is a really fun, engaging effort that you will stimulate your creativity. The book will engage your interest and lead you along the path of competence.

I encourage to buy this book, is an investment you will never regret!"},{"Title":"Inside Story: Official Real Estate Manual","review":"Even if you are just starting out at real estate, as I am, you could get away with not reading this book. Barbara Nash-Price does a very basic job explaining some techniques and ideas for selling real estate, finding buyers, and getting listings. She spends FAR too much time, however, using long, useless lists that include: what to give your 'personal assistant' to do (that's almost two pages - and WHO can afford a personal assistant??), how to organize your daily planner (this takes up nearly a chapter), and even a list of sample &quot;ads&quot;, which is nice, but do we really need pages and pages and pages and pages of that?The book is written probably at a 6th grade reading level, and is punctuated with lots of double spaced text, lots of quotation marks (which she uses LIBERALLY), lots of CAPITAL LETTERS, and plenty of red text. You can read this book in one day if you sit still for a couple of hours. This book also includes an utterly useless guide to purchasing a computer. It is evident that Ms. Nash-Price has no computer knowledge (to be fair, she does state this in the book) since she boldly tells us that a 286 with a 20-40 MG hard drive should be sufficient. If you can find a 286 for SALE these days, I would be shocked. Despite the age of this text, I would think that anyone using a computer on a daily basis would be able to suggest something more sensible. She also gives completely useless names of vendors and software programs to use. Again, she is too specific. Instead of suggesting purchasing a high power word processor, she boldly suggests Microsoft Word 5.5. Is that even for SALE now? Because of this, her text dates dramatically. Perhaps she is writing to an older, less computer literate crowd, but there's no excuse for these kind of mistakes! If Ms. Nash-Price had the lack of knowledge she claims in her book, maybe she should have skipped that chapter alltogether, or at best, passed it along to someone who could write meaningfully on the subject.This book, although it was written in 96-97, mentions NOTHING about the internet and its valuable uses. The book does go into some detail about self promotion, but it doesn't really go far enough, leaving the reader asking more questions.Finally, it is evident that the author believes full well in HER techniques, and HER TECHNIQUES ONLY.....if you don't use RED TABS for listings and WHITE TABS for buyers, you can't &quot;WORK EFFECTIVELY&quot;! If you don't like color-coding your life, forget it! These are nice suggestions, but it would be nice if she suggested things that are adaptable to different work styles.This is not a total waste of reading, but be prepared for VERY trite text and only basic ideas. Still, some are worthwhile and a few, even interesting. Try to get the book used, like I did, however....I wouldn't pay the price for new."},{"Title":"Inside Story: Official Real Estate Manual","review":"I thought this book was on the \\"kindergarden\\" side but aside from that, there was good information through-out the book.

Not all brokers have time to train a newbie, so this book will surely be a great help.Barbara Nash puts the information out there so it is up to the sales associate to gather that info and use it to make their career efforts easier.If you want to look into this book before buying it, check it out at your local library and then decide for yourself.

Gripping, absorbing and incredibly realistic. If you ever wanted to know what it would be like to be chased and hunted down like a wounded animal then this is the book you should read. In my opinion it is considerably better than John Buchan's thriller The 39 Steps.The nameless hero 'Rogue Male' is stripped of all identity and forced to flee from the clutches of Hitler's henchmen.He must leave the civilised world behind if he is to survive. His only ally being his finely-tuned subconscious,primitive instincts.This book is definitely one of the classics - one which I have re-read at least 6 times and one which I look forward to reading again in the future.Geoffrey Household's story is so believable that often you are left wondering - did this really happen?The story is extremely well plotted and, if you are reading this book for the first time,you just can't tell what is going to happen next or how the hero will escape from countless near death experiences...Some people may find the story a little slow by modern high-octane hollywood standards. For example, the hero is a reserved 'English Gentlemen' and the death count is minimal (but hence much more realistic). Others on the other hand think the 'old fashioned' style is one of the book's strengths.Basically, if you want something faster paced then try John Buchan or the modern SAS hero Andy McNab. But if you want the daddy of thrillers and one of the most absorbing and intensely rewarding reading experiences of your life then read this near-perfect thriller!Now!"},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"This is Household's best book. But to truly understand it you have to rewind the decades back to a pre-War England when loyalty, honor, ones word as ones bond, all counted supreme. The protagonist is a Rogue Male, the self-sufficient loner who takes on the world and in this case Hitler and his secret service. It's the 39 Steps, it's Scouting for Boys, and you have to meet it on that level. While Dornford Yates is prissy, Household is visceral. Read the book and then see the Peter O'Toole made for TV movie. The escape from Germany, the tube murder, the flight to Dorset, the eventual showdown between the hero and smooth, smart, accomplished villain, will take your breath away. Read and re-read. Then read the follow-up he wrote 30 years later, Rogue Justice, which is truly a worthy sequel."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male is a classic thriller. Household was a British writer, born 1900, who spent some time in the US \\"just in time for the Depression\\". He began writing in the US, then returned to England. This is his second novel, published in 1939. He spent the War as an Intelligence Officer in Rumania, then returned to a fairly successful career writing. Rogue Male remains his most famous novel, though Arabesque (made into a movie with Gregory Peck, as I recall) is also well known.Rogue Male opens with the never named first person protagonist aiming a rifle with a telescopic sight from 550 yards at a certain Head of State. It's never made precisely clear who that is -- a country on one side or the other of Poland, which leaves two pretty evil candidates as of the late 30s. It's pretty likely that Hitler is the real target, but the book takes care never to reveal which of Hitler or Stalin was the target -- on purpose, I think.The protagonist claims he had no intention of shooting -- he was just \\"stalking the most dangerous game\\" for the fun of it, to see if he could be successful. This doesn't play well with the local secret police, who torture him and leave him for dead. But he rather incredibly escapes, and makes his way down a river, soon pursued by his enemies. He stows away on a boat for England, but soon is again pursued. When he is forced to kill one of his pursuers, he becomes wanted for murder by the British police. He flees to the country, planning to literally hole up for the duration. But even his careful plans aren't quite enough -- some bad luck leads to the British police getting a lead, and though he can elude them, the bad guys are able to track him down.It's pretty good stuff. Exciting, not too ridiculously implausible, and at least somewhat interested in exploring the moral basis of the protagonist's decisions. (Though there is plenty of guff, too, in particular lots of stuff about the wonderful ineffable qualities of the English Upper Class.) (Some of the book is the protagonist's own coming to terms with his real motives and intentions.) It helps of course that the protagonist's target is a real-life maximally evil sort -- even if we continue to disapprove of his assassination attempt, it's hard not to sympathize at some level. The book is also quite dryly funny on occasion. The ending is interesting in retrospect. The protagonist, having again escaped, decides his only recourse is to finish the assassination job. And there the book ends. But it was published in 1939. Then it was a very \\"open\\" ending. Now -- any time since 1945 really -- the ending has closed somewhat -- we can only conclude that the protagonist failed in his attempt and was presumable summarily executed. (Though I understand there was eventually a sequel.)"},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"The book set in the early part of this century tells the story of a seasoned famous hunter. The culmination of his hunting passion has a unique nature, the only befitting king of animals - man. But it is not any ordinary man either, it is the most well-protected dictator in the world. But, since Providence has a special hand on the Rogue Male, the hunt is fouled and the hunter becomes the hunted. Now he must think ahead of his enemies to save himself. Through the conflicts of morality and the acts that he is forced to do, emerges a new man. I would heartily recommend this beautifully narrated book to everyone."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"G Household's appreciation of the furtive nature of a quarry being hunted on his own ground is worthy of a naturalist. His zen like descriptions of creeping black shadows on a moonless night, the whisping pant of a disturbed badger and the near silent flight of an owl - all the while as deadly man hunted hidden man in a landscape long since built over. An utterly English work and a book to be read many times."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Rogue Male was meant as a thriller. One could put it in the same genre as books by Dan Brown, Michael Crichton, even Elmore Leonard. However, there is one distinguishing feature that separates Rogue Male from the dozens of thrillers filling the aisles of bookstores and that is the quality of writing. None of the above can measure up to RM in terms of language and syntax. The difference in quality is palpable. Basic descriptions and plot devices are figurative. Sandra Stotsky writes about this in her book, Losing Our Language and I am starting to agree with her. Books fifty years ago were better written on average than books today. Books written 100 years ago are an even better deal if one likes quality. Very few present day writers of even serious fiction (I am excluding Cormac McCarthy, J.M. Coetzee and Toni Morrison,) can stand comparison. I am not sure whether many writers write down to their audiences or whether this is what our education system now produces. Rogue Male reminds us that good writing is getting harder and harder to come by."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Like the dictator he attempts to assassinate, the protagonist of \\"Rogue Male\\" remains unnamed throughout the novel. For most of the story, all we learn of our narrator-hero, beyond his physical appearance, is that he is upper-middle class, an experienced hunter, and perhaps famous. Beaten, left for dead, and chased down like an animal, his character is a combination of raw survival instinct and cool rationality, without extraneous motivations, attachments, or desires. It is only during the novel's final third or so -- which I read, engrossed, between 1:30 and 3:00 am one morning -- that our hero confronts his motivations, his past, his beliefs, his politics -- and his enemy. Another reviewer wrote that the book's conclusion relies on \\"somewhat dated notions of loyalty, honor, disgrace, and so forth\\", but this is not the case: the \\"dated notions\\" he refers to are approached reluctantly, from a position of cynicism and disillusionment. To reveal any more would spoil the story, but the discussion of motivation is more complex and fascinating than the other reviewer's comments make out.The storytelling is pacey and suspenseful, even though the setting is not a tropical rainforest but the lush English countryside, and the protagonist is a tweed-wearing huntsman rather than a John Rambo-style commando. The book is realistic, at least in tone, and the narrator is entertainingly resourceful. Unlike some other survival stories, \\"Rogue Male\\" leaves you feeling grateful for civilization.This is an example of literary genre fiction that is accessible, entertaining, and substantial. It's the kind of book you want to reread and recommend to others. I certainly will be doing both, and I'm glad to have bought it."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Although the book is a little old-fashioned, which makes the it hard-going in places, it's well worth persevering. I particularly liked the dark, paranoid atmosphere and the single-mindedness of the gunman, which meant he was willing to live in a hole in the ground rather than give up. The way the enemies are unseen and the lack of any major characters except the narrator give the book a claustrophobic feel which is really memorable."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"I read this book first in the 50's and found it a thrilling yarn. Decades later I saw the xx movie and was relatively pleased but felt that the book must have been better. So I read it again and have read it again twice, the last time going on to read several more books by this author. All of them have the flavor of a skilled man placed in an almost impossible situation and having to live on his wits, with constant improvisation and countering moves by opponents. In the later books the author brings a great appreciation of countryside and the advantages it provides in single-person maneuver.In this early book, the idea is that a skilled international hunter/author decides to make the ultimate stalk--to maneuver himself into position to get a foreign dictator in his sights. He does so, is caught, beaten, thrown off a cliff, and left to die. Not dying, he begins his attempt to return home, with his pursuers not far behind. The rest of the book involves his experience as a prey animal, hunted by another international hunter who has read his books, and must analyze or anticipate the moves of his pray.Needless to say, this is my favorite fiction book, its only rivals being non-fiction escape stories, equal in luck and unusual incident. A true classic."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Bored, a professional hunter decides to see if he's capable of assassinating a national leader. He's caught in the process, badly beaten and left for dead. But he survives, and the rest of the book is a cat-and-mouse game with the security forces scouring the globe for him.This is a humbling book, for a couple of reasons. First of all, it's a damn gripping read, great fun on a strictly superficial level. Second, it's loaded with political musings on class and social structure that ring as true today as they did when it was written in 1939. Finally, though, it's humbling because it's a reminder that time just keeps ticking. When it was released, the London Times declared it \\"Simply the best escape and pursuit story yet written.\\" Yet if I hadn't come on a link to it from a blog, I'd never have heard of it, and I don't think I'm alone.Which is too bad, because it's a great, thoughtful read."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"If you are looking for a good, fast-paced thriller, here it is. Household , who wrote this novel in 1939. was a pioneer of the modern novel of suspense, action, and intrigue. Rogue Male has an added dimension of psychological depth and insight, a feature often lacking in contemporary examples of the genre. The story concerns a marksman with sharp survivalist skills who stalks and attempts to assassinate an unnamed Central European dictator. (One can safely assume it is Hitler.) The would be assassin is caught but later escapes and flees across Europe with various agents in pursuit. As they close in , he literally goes underground. From this point the narrative takes more surprising turns which I will not divulge. There is a fairly decent movie version of this novel (starring Peter O'Toole) which I believe came out in the 1960s."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Somewhat dated suspense work about a big game hunter who sets his sights on a notorious dictator--presumably Hitler--in the early pages, but doesn't fire. He then spends the rest of the book on the run or in hiding. The technical side of all this is pretty fun and suspenseful stuff, the book's weakness lies in the character of the hero, whose motivations for both stalking the dictator and refusing to appeal to his friends and government are a little tough to understand for the modern reader. Part of this remedied in a nice twist near the end where we learn the real reason why he first trained his sights on the dictator. However, we are forced to lean on somewhat dated notions of loyalty, honor, disgrace, and so forth in order to accept his playing the lone wolf in trying to escape retribution. Still, worth a read in front of the fireplace."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"The Pre-Socratic philosophers of Ancient Greece were wonderfully keen to the notion and, dynamic of the 'nous', meaning simply: the mind. These men were the first to postulate on man's capacity to mentally 'travel' (from a stationary body of course) regardless of time and space, into the realm of past, present or future events - actualized or imagined, local or distant.One may embarrassingly state that these ancients were humbly defining the simple mode of 'imagination.' Well yes, they were. However, it was more than that. They were highlighting the power of the 'visceral' and its manifestations. Though all this sounds very basic to just about everyone - it is that kind of manifestation taken to the ultimate degree by Geoffrey Household's 1939 book, 'Rogue Male.' Without my referring to the main character and plot, this impactful short work of historical fiction is saturated with ethereal juice of excitement, melancholy and above all, that classical emotion we've all experienced at one time or another: heart-stopping fear.From beginning-to-end one will have nothing but pure empathy for the protagonist constantly facing a highly-dangerous environment. The 'nous', will surely be exercised by this exceptional thriller. Thank You, Pre-Socratics. And, if you are still alive and well, Thank You Mr. Household. May God keep you warm."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"The paranoid testoserone classic thriller"},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"See paperback edition for this review: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=999312198"},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Household's upper class hero is both offensive and attractive. He would snub you as a peasant, but we delight in his approach to the Nazis as he hunts the biggest game of all - Hitler and then is hunted by the Nazis. The final sequence in the pit is a delight. A superb book to be read and enjoyed. Both versions of the film are excellent as well."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"I felt this novel would have been more gripping had the author not made the main character so &quot;perfect&quot;. From one scrape to another, from one type of surveillance to the next, this character just keeps on going. A little human error here and there might have made an otherwise average read into a dynamic one. While he did get caught by the German agent, the account of his &quot;home away from home&quot; in the mud where he has his tinned beef and whiskey was just a bit too unbelievable. Sorry to let anyone down."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"I read this 1939 classic of British adventure writing as part of an occasional quest to revisit some of the books that were popular in my childhood. Or in this case, to visit for the first time, since although I had often heard of Household's book, I had never read it. It was a particular pleasure to do so in this beautiful NYRB reprint, with its splendidly evocative cover. Alongside the pleasant confirmation of a familiar world, it brought me an almost equal measure of disappointment and delighted surprise. Let me explain.The book was familiar because of its place in the family tree of spy/adventure stories with such ancestors as RL Stevenson'sKIDNAPPED, Erskine Childers'THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS, and the John Buchan series beginning withTHE THIRTY NINE STEPS. The hero is typically an upper-class Briton possessed of independent means, an enquiring mind, and certain outdoor skills which he uses to great advantage. Household's nameless protagonist is even more independent, less a party man, more strikingly inventive. As a reviewer quoted on the cover suggests, the lineage to Frederick Forsyth'sTHE DAY OF THE JACKALor (crossing the Atlantic) Stephen Hunter'sPOINT OF IMPACTis clear.The novel also took me to the vanishing countryside of my birth. Although it opens with the hero in an unnamed European state, stalking its leader (obviously Hitler, but note that this was written before the war) with a telescopic rifle, just as a sportsman's challenge to prove it can be done, most of it takes place in the fields and hedgerows of rural England. At the start of the book, the hero has already been captured and tortured, and survived an \\"accidental\\" death. He escapes to England, but finds himself pursued there also, and has to go to ground -- literally so, living for weeks in a burrow converted from an animal's earth. The spy-story elements at the start of the book soon give way to the situation of hunter and hunted each trying to use their knowledge of the countryside to outwit the other.Hence both my disappointment and my surprise. Although the protagonist will reveal more complex and believable motives later, you have to accept his initial exploit at face value, and moreover to agree with him that he cannot simply seek police protection when he gets to London. On the plot level, the book is thin. Yet what I had not imagined at all, and what intrigued me immensely, is that once all the spy and counterspy business drops away, one is left with a novel that comes as close to later Existentialism as to earlier adventure stories. As the interest focuses on the man living like an animal and virtually becoming one, it raises deep questions of humanity and ethics, so much so that it is almost a pity to see it turn back into a spy novel again for the finale -- though even that ends with a curious ambiguity that is as satisfying as it was unexpected."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Rogue Male is essentially a game of Cat and Mouse with much political intrigue. It turns out that he is on a revengeful mission to assasinate the Great Man himself, a person we can presume is Hitler. The book from then on is based on complications which arise from this. The Character is pursued for the whole book until at the final, chilling climax when the roles are reversed. The book's weakness is that it does not clearly state why the chraracter acts the way he does. Some of his near-death experiences are extremely lucky as well."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"This was a good book overall... When there was action, it was well written, and kept me at the edge of my seat. What I did not like was when there was no action... things became a little drawn out and boring. Overall painted a good picture and kept interest."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"If you'd like to disappear, consider reading this book for the least appealing methods at your disposal. It's a tale of a man's endurance beyond the ordinary and it becomes so microscopically focused on his effort to disappear that it effectively loses the broader picture of his rationale for having become a fugitive.In spite of its dark nature I never considered giving up on the book because it offers outstanding glimpses into the games our minds often play with us. This isn't the book for everyone, but it's worth the \\"getaway\\" for those who enjoy negotiating British personalities and mannerisms."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Written in 1939. Not unlike \\"39 steps\\" in a setting of British wit and endurance in a test of survival with pre-war German agents.There are English country side, lanes, fields, farmers, a fellow club man & solicitor in London City and a deviously clever and patient opponent. A kind of swash-buckle tale, very much a male perspective, very lively, with an often too detailed look at the country side and/or London underground setting but it kept my interest on the kindle. It was not a long tale. If you like classic British spy stories this is one you will read!"},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"This is truly one of the first masterful thrillers and an incredible psychological examination. Foiled before he can pull the trigger and bring down a vicious European dictator, the main character is captured, tortured, and exacts a harrowing escape. The description of his wounds and the calm demeanor he exacts to flee speak to his strength and commitment to a hidden motivation. Back in his home country he is forced to \\"go to ground\\" literally and figuratively. This sets up a fascinating part of the book dealing with his \\"hide\\" and a confrontation with enemy agents that makes the pages turn with speed. A very impressive novel that resolves itself with cunning like the hunter it portrays."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"I read about Rogue Male in a men's magazine listing of recommended \\"action\\" books for guys. It was at the top, and having never heard of it I pursued it. It is a taught story full of amazing details about the eponymous protagonist's survival and planning as he manages to escape his staged suicide after an attempted assasination of a leader clearly based on Adolf Hitler. From his journey back to England from Poland to his hiding in an incredibly imagined catacomb of his own creation in Dorset, England, Household's language and eye for detail impress and terrify. Rogue Male was written in that memorable year, 1939-the same year Hitler invaded Poland and stands as a grounded and gritty precursor to that proud and bombastic Englishman the world knows well, Bond, James Bond."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"This 1939 suspense thriller was his first big hit. It is written in the form of a journal or confession by an Englishman gentleman sportsman who hunted the most dangerous game. The writer was caught, tortured, then thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident. But he survived and escaped from a central European country. However, the agents of this country were put on his trail in England.The unnamed hero withdraws funds from his account, then disappears into the country to hide in solitude. But in his escape an enemy agent dies, and the English police are on his trail too. The foreign agents can now use police reports to locate this fugitive. The story tells how he escapes, how he hides, and what happens after his is tracked down by a secret agent. The good guy escapes, assumes the identity of this secret agent, and lays a false trail out of the country.This story records the thoughts of the hero. Dialogue is sparse. Parts of this story explain the operations of a secret agent. The author served as an Intelligence Officer in Rumania and the Middle East during WW II. His \\"Rogue Justice\\" is the sequel to this book. If you can accept the premise that his captors wouldn't finish him off in the beginning, the rest of the story follow. It reminds me of \\"The Great Impersonation\\" by E. Phillips Oppenheim, and a John Buchan story (hunted in the mountains)."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"I had to read this novel as one of the set books when I was at school. At the time, I really didn't appreciate it but then, many years later, I came across a copy in my local library and so I decided to give it another go. It was only then that I truly appreciated what a fantastic adventure story Geoffrey Household had written. I am pleased to see that this novel is still available through Amazon - check it out."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"There are a few things that give away the fact that Geoffrey Household wrote Rogue Male over 70 years ago, but his clever plotting and the relentless pressure he places on his reader are not among them. Of course the setting is from a very different time and rural life in Europe and England would be unrecognisable to him now, but his characters are real people and the story he tells of a man on the run, is as fresh, realistic and topical as it was in 1939. Tyranny, terror, espionage and clandestine operations still dominate the affairs of state with devastating consequences for people and communities across the globe. Household's unnamed protagonist is different only because he chooses to act on his own from deep personal motives to rid the world of a dictator threatening world peace. He quickly runs foul of the security forces of the unnamed country (neighbour to Poland). So begins a sinister manhunt calling for every ounce of strength, fortitude and cunning from the desperate fugitive. Sometimes the narrative runs on a bit and one could do with a little less of the psychological ramblings, but for the rest it is a brilliant read, guaranteed to keep you up at night until it is finished. The ending is masterful."},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"An exciting quick read that I really enjoyed, though some of the mundane details seemed a little too much sometimes.

However, unless I imagined this (it's years since I read the book, so I must catch up), there's another aspect no-one else has mentioned.Whenever I see someone powerful and truly monstrous in the world, this is the book I think of. It's childish, and it is wishful thinking, but wasn't this what the hunt for Osama Bin Laden was all about? Sadaam Hussein? Eichmann? The relentless pursuit of something who is patently too harmful to live. This is the thinking behind so many of the popular movies of the day--Inglourious Basterds just to mention one. Yet no other reviewer has mentioned it--???And it's directed by a love story. He loved a woman, not specifically identified as a Jew, as Hitler is not specifically named. She went into the underground to exterminate or at least counter Nazi evils. She was caught, and killed. Almost unwittingly, the protagonist picks up her mission. Almost unconsciously, this is what motivates him.I find these two aspects elevate the book from its Boy Scouts life-in-the-wild process.I'd be interested to know if anyone else feels the same.(I'm so glad this book is available on Kindle--I wish his others were as well.)"},{"Title":"Rogue male (Armed Services edition)","review":"Full of twists and interesting detail, this book is also occasionally ridiculous in a hilarious kind of way. The protagonist (narrator) has a unique wit from another era. Its really funny if it you like his elitist wit. The book also has a lot of psychological insights, the narrator is fairly thoughtful and sagacious in an, again, haughty, elitist way. Depending on how you read a given line on one side its kind of a joke on the other its down right thoughtful and clever. All in all the story flows well and was an altogether pleasant read.

I read this commentary cover to cover, but it was many, many years ago, so I apologize that the accuracy of my review is partially conditioned by my memory (though I have it right next to me as I write for quick glances and reminders).Kidner was a fine scholar who was equally at home with the Bible, the Ancient Near East, and Classical Hebrew. Thus, for the casual reader, he can get you up to speed on much valuable information that will enhance your understanding of the text. Why then, only three stars?The reason for the mediocre rating is that Kidner's commentary on Genesis is not as helpful as many other commentaries available today on Genesis (e.g., Walton or Waltke). Also, Kidner's commentary on Genesis is weaker than many of the other commentaries in the Tyndale series. Finally, and most importantly, I remember distinctly as I read through Kidner's commentary that as I left each section, I had many questions about the text that Kidner either did not attempt to answer, or glossed over too briefly. This is not always the case. Often after a section, he'll have an excursus that covers certain relevant topics in more detail. However, by contrast, I have been using Walton's commentary on Genesis and find that he seems to know the kinds of questions readers bring to the text and he addresses them quite well.If only a modern revision could be made of Kidner's work. It could be a real benefit to the Church. Don't get me wrong. Kidner's commentary will give you much help in understanding Genesis.

The characterisation is good, if not excellent, but the dialogue is apposite to the characters, and the theories concerning the impossible murder on the part of an English novelist are good. Despite an alibi business which would have made Freeman Wills Crofts drool with envy (though it's not that dull,) the book must be one of the masterpieces of the Van Dine school - and, taking into consideration the fact that the Van Dine school included such people as S.

I'd reccomend this especially to any fantasy lover who wants a break from dragons and the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"American Taste (Cook's Classic Library)","review":"\`American Taste' is the first book of culinary writer extraordinare, James Villas, who has served the exposition of American eating by producing cookbooks of Southern cuisine with his mother, major books of great American comfort foods such as casseroles and biscuits, essays on American cuisine such as this work, and a better than average book of memoir essays entitled \`Between Bites'. While not as dominant a figure as either James Beard or Julia Child, he has thereby succeeded at just about every recognized form of culinary writing, especially when you add his food column which ran for decades in \`Town and Country' magazine.By covering so many culinary bases, Villas has created a niche for himself in American culinary writing which is not as scholarly as John Thorne, Jeffrey Steingarten, or Paula Wolfert, less personal than Jim Harrison, better informed and more involved than Alan Richman, but with certainly the strong opinions of Harrison and Richman, with the authority of having worked full time in the field for over thirty years now. For readers just discovering this book, it is important to recognize that the essays were published over 20 years ago and were probably written in the ten (10) years before that. Therefore, they represent something of a time capsule where one can read about the culinary world of almost a generation ago when Julia Child was important but not yet deified, James Beard was the biggest influence in writing about American food, Alice Waters was still getting her bearings at Chez Panisse, Paul Prudhomme had just left Commander's Palace in New Orleans and Emeril Lagasse was still a very minor player indeed. This is also a time just before the iron grip of the culinary police grasped our food conscience and made us fearful of all things tasty due to fats, eggs, or carbs. At least, that is how Villas makes us feel, with his rapture over good French fries, pates, terrines, gumbos, and Brunswick stew.It is no surprise that Villas, a North Carolina Tarheel to his core, largely equates American cooking with Southern cooking. His very first essay deals with that paragon of Southern cuisine, fried chicken. He here claims that no one except a native Southern cook can do true justice to fried chicken and proceeds to give the gospel on how it is done. It is notable that his recipe disagrees on some important points with many other experts on Southern fried chicken I have audited, especially those with such heady credentials as Edna Lewis, James Beard, and \`Cooks Illustrated' magazine. What is interesting however is not the differences, but the similarities. While Villas calls for a marinade in sour milk, acidulated with lemon juice, Lewis and \`Cooks' use buttermilk, which is simply a natural sour milk. Beard also uses mild, but no acid, and all agree on the importance of cutting whole chickens rather than using precut parts and using a cast iron frying pan. I am certain that Villas' recipe will produce primo fried chicken, but I am also certain that his approach is not the ONLY way to achieve Southern fried perfection.Villas takes a similarly strong position when it comes to that quintessentially American technique, barbecue. From many hours in front of the TV watching Al Roker, Bobby Flay, and Steve Raichlen, I know that the centers of the barbecue religion are North Carolina, Memphis, Texas, and Kansas City. Needless to say, Villas elevates back country Tarheel techniques to the level of gospel and, in his first essay on the subject, relegates all that stuff they do in Texas to the footnotes of culinary consideration. To be fair, in a later essay, he visits some prime Texas barbecue eateries and recants, allowing that beef can approach the great taste achieved from a well barbecued piece of pork.To also be fair about his regionalism, Villas does give a fair amount of time to non-Southern specialities such as native American cheeses and true caviar, harvested from American bred sturgeon. He is especially fond of the national love and creativity with the lowly sandwich, most especially the hamburger; the bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich; and the glorious club sandwich. In spite of how important the sandwich is to American eating, Villas bemoans how poorly the hamburger is served in so many fast food outlets. If I were to cite one aspect of this book with which to encourage you to buy and read it, it would be for Villas' advice on sandwiches. Like so many of his opinions, I cannot follow him to create an inch and a half-thick burger with close to half a pound of carefully ground meat. I am much fonder of Julia Child's recipe using five ounces and a liberal enhancement from encapsulated saut&eacute;ed shallots. But again, Villas strong opinions are always sound, especially with his advice on how to acquire the best meat for his tasty burger.The very best thing about Villas' essays is the fact that he pokes his discriminating nose into some of the more obscure corners of American gastronomy. I found his essay on Bourbon especially interesting, as he reveals that the rules for distilling and aging Bourbon are about as strict as any French, German, or Italian rules on crafting beer, cheese, and wine. Among other things, it explains why Jack Daniels product is not really Bourbon, but simply a \`sour mash whiskey'.Unlike Bourbon, these essays are Villas without the effects of aging which may have mellowed his writing in his later books. Villas' writing is entertaining for his strong opinions. These opinions may shorten the shelf life of his writing, but I personally find his thoughts as nourishing as more moderate writers such as Thorne, Colwin, and M.F.K. Fisher.Very highly recommended vintage writing on food.

To be honest, I don't know, I haven't tried a single one. I'm writing this review because I found the book listed under the section 'cookbooks - vegan'. However, even though the book contains some vegan dishes (nicely marked as 'vegan') it is also covered with lamb, lobster and other gross and cruel recipes. So this review is for other vegans like me that don't want to have this cruel stuff in their cookbooks."},{"Title":"Tao of Food","review":"The book is beautiful, but could food so simple to prepare really taste special? Indeed it can. I'm working my way through the recipes since getting this book for Christmas, and not one has been a miss. The recipes use easy to find seasonal ingredients, although some are in British terms. For muscovado sugar, just use brown. And &quot;pudding&quot; means desert, usually fresh fruit based. I've finished most of the &quot;winter&quot; dishes, half the &quot;fall&quot; ones and can't wait for the season to change and bring new fresh fruit and vegetable choices so I can try the rest. For the first time ever, my husband--Mr. Pasta and Fish-- and I--Miss Butter and Beef--have found light, satisfying recipes that make us both happy. All of the recipes are excellent, but some of them are almost magical in the way they leave you feeling satisfied but not stuffed when the meal is over. This is quite an accomplishment in our house where pasta meals make me feel sleepy and fat while pot roast makes pleases me anytime and makes my husband feel overstuffed. And so far, every recipe has been extremely easy for us (we are experienced cooks) to make. I'm sure less experienced cooks will find the directions complete, accurate and clear enough to follow with the same great results.

The print is cramped, the translations are hideous, and the selections are indeed rooted in a view of Great Books and Great Ideas that, while still quite vibrant, is less robust than it was in 1955. But no one in full control of their senses would sit down and read from cover to cover the Dante, the Homer, the Aristotle found in this set.All true. But none of that matters. What you are buying here is the first three volumes (especially volumes 2 & 3) and their attendant reference set. I've owned the set for 20 years and found it invaluable because of those three first volumes. Here's how they work:Volume 1, The Great Conversation, is essentially an inspirational text centered on the importance of a broad Liberal Education, as set against other views of education. You may take or leave it. The treasure house is the next two volumes.The Syntopicon (volumes 2-3 of the set) is an index of 100 fundamental concepts that built the Euromerican mind and cultural vision. To give you an idea, here is a sample of the Great Ideas:Art, Beauty, Cause, Chance, Democracy, Desire, Emotion, Eternity, Family, God, Good and Evil, Government, Habit, Happiness, History, Immortality, Infinity, Justice, Labor, Language, Life and Death, Love, Mathematics, Matter, Memory, Oligarchy, Progress, Prophecy, Quantity, Religion, Rhetoric, Sin, Soul, State, Time, Truth. War and Peace, Wisdom.... you get the idea: Big Ideas.Each of the 100 ideas is introduced with a brief essay that explains it and attempts to sketch out how it has been viewed throughout Western history. The essays are not dumbed down, but most of them are perfectly accessible to most of us. After this introductory essay, there follows an index of virtually every significant reference to that idea in every author in the set; you are given page numbers within this set of books.THAT is what you are buying.Want to see how Plato's idea of \\"Punishment\\" differs from Rousseau's? Just look it up in the Syntopicon, and follow the indexed references. Want to know how \\"Animal\\" was dealt with in Montesquieu, William James, and Freud? Go to the Syntopicon.Certainly, once I have looked up the references in the GBWW volume on Plato, I will give the text a read there; but if my interest leads me to want a deeper view, I'll also go to other sources -- more accurate translations, even the original texts, if I have that language -- and read the better translations &c; in those books. But I start with the Syntopicon. If tracing out the history of the main ideas that shaped Western civilization appeals to you, this is your set of Great Books.Thus: this is not a set of books you buy to read for pleasure, curled up by the fire on a rainy day. By that standard, this set would be an abysmal failure. But this IS a set of books you would use as one of the most powerful reference libraries you can put on your shelf. By that criteria, you cannot find a better anywhere today, online or otherwise."},{"Title":"Great Books of the Western World (54 Volume Set)","review":"The Great Books of the Western World are the birthright of each member of western civilization.

I never thought much of it and admittedly I don't believe my parents ever really opened any of the books.Both my parents have passed away (my mother just recently) and now I have the collection.I was about to sell it but was listening to a podcast on GNOSTIC MEDIA about the TRIVIUM and they mentioned this specific collection.. Not just because of the books in the collection (such as Plato, Aristotle etc) but for the 1st 3 volumes that comprise THE GREAT CONVERSATION and the SYNTOPICON (which is a summary of various main IDEAS (HISTORY, DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, LOVE, DIALECTIC etc) and then a cross reference of all the works to help direct the reader to specific locations where the great writers discussed these issues. PLUS additional works not included in the collection).These 1st 3 books alone are worth their weight in gold.I am a Liberal and really feel that these ideas should be studied.This is NOT to say that I do not feel that Works from the East or ideas from women and other cultures and minorities should be overlooked..by all means I think we can expand upon the Great Conversation by investigating newer material and incorporating and contemplating within our thinking.. but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Many times I find myself reading another book and coming across a reference to an idea from an early writer. Wanting to know more of his thought, his work is generally among these. Having them collected in a series is an excellent means of having the references right at hand. The University of Chicago did an invaluable service to Mankind in compiling and printing these books. Every serious student of thought will benefit from having this collection.I am generally not a fan of collections of similarly bound books on intellectual subjects that are for appearance and never read. Hopefully, these will be more than that to you. If you are concerned that your friends may think you are elitist or a mere poseur, hide them in the closet and read them privately.Not to be forgotten is the amazingly well written two volume Syntopicon, which is a collection of essays categorized by ideas. These are very valid studies of the ideas themselves with references to the various works in which the subject is addressed. A wonder resource in and of itself."},{"Title":"Great Books of the Western World (54 Volume Set)","review":"This review will aim for two results: to discuss whether you should buy this series, and the philosophical content of the series itself. As to the first goal, are you really going to spend anywhere from $600 - $1000 for a collection of books that will easily take up more than ten feet on your bookshelf? (That said, if presented with the choice between Kindle and Hard copy, go with the latter). Secondly, while I realize the irony in writing an *amazon* review of this, the reader can probably find this whole selection for 1% of 1% of the price (I found mine at Goodwill for $15!). Almost every public library sale in the country has at least five of these volumes for 25 cents a volume.Also consider the content of the material you are getting. While the editor is correct to place Plato, for example, in the series, you can easily buy his dialogues for $5 at any book store and said volume will fit in one's coat pocket. The same can be said for the volumes on Aristotle, Gibbon, Tolstoy, Dostoevskii, and a few others. The reader must also consider something else: you are spending $700+ on a collection of books, and of these 54 volumes in all honesty you will probably only read 4 or 5 in as many years. Ask yourself if it is the most practical use of time, money, and space.Now for the selection itself. It's not fair to criticize an editor including \\"this volume\\" and excluding \\"my personal favorite.\\" On the other hand, the editor's choice also reveals a number of philosophical commitments. It is interesting that the editors, for example, did *not* include Nietszche's works. Few men had such an impact on the 20th century as Freidrich Neechee. Further, was not Nietszche's philosophy a systematic dismantling of much of the Enlightenment, which itself finds representations in this very series? Even if one doesn't believe F.N. destroyed Enlightenment philosophy, he at least revamped the conversation.While I am glad they included Hegel in the series, I am curious as to why they included *Philosophy of Right.* They also included his philosophy of history, and that is not too difficult, but PR is one of his more mature works and presupposes that one is intimately familiar with all of Hegel's rather unique terminology. Even advanced philosophy students will be lost. It would have made more sense to at least include Hegel's *Outlines of Logic* where he explains all of his terminology in a rather simple manner!Another interesting omission is Einstein. If Galileo and Kepler find representation, why not Einstein?The series is quite valuable for a number of reasons: you do find included several selections which price would range over $100 (think Thomas Aquinas' Summa, for example). The final choice to buy will be decided by the reader's pocketbook and own philosophical proclivities."},{"Title":"Great Books of the Western World (54 Volume Set)","review":"This is another collection I have longed to find for years and years.

Scott Fitzgerald was a champion of this book when it was first published in 1937. He described it as \\"a break-through into completely new and fresh literary terrain; a turning point in the American novel.\\" Fitzgerald was absolutely right. I CAN GET IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE was published when its author was 24 years old. It is a cold-hearted, tough-as-nails rags-to-riches story told in first person narration by a hero who has no scruples. It tells the story of Harry Bogen who rises from $15-a-week shipping clerk to become the president of 7th Avenue's top clothing line. He will stab anybody in the back to get what he wants. His early success gives him the joy of being able to buy his mother some new furniture and new clothes. But as he gains money and power, that's not enough. Ultimately he meets his downfall. Or does he?Weidman writes with great economy and psychological insight. His characters' speech rings true to the ear from the Yiddish inflections of Harry's mother to the theatrically affected speech of his actress girlfriend. This fast-paced novel is extremely entertaining, but quite unsettling as well.This is a great book and it is shocking to think that so important a work is out-of-print.

This brief book probably could be briefly summed up as one set of principles:+ Be present to the one needing care+ Focus on them, and not on yourself+ Listen, and listen actively, which means remembering the principle to+ Focus on them, and not on yourself+ Don't be afraid of silence+ Don't pass judgment+ Seek care and support for yourself when you need itThese principles are amazingly simple to learn and state, but often get ignored. Giving advice is not pastoral care. Empathising by telling your own story is usually not helpful.Arnold recounts the story of a visit with a person in the hospital when he was on call as the chaplain. He went into the room of a critically-ill patient, said hello, and then she began a very long story, alternately laughing and crying, and then, when finished, patted Arnold's hand and thanked him for his help. The only word he had said was 'hello' -- but he had listened, something others had been too busy to do.This is a book that can help anyone who wants to learn how to be truly helpful. It is not just for clergy -- as church members come increasingly to learn that ministry exists at all levels (and indeed some of the most important ministry of a church is that which members in the pews give to each other), this kind of book should be more widely used as a good introduction to some of the do's and don'ts of being pastoral and helpful, and what in the end is effective ministry."},{"Title":"Venus and Serena Williams: A Biography (Greenwood Biographies)","review":"With all the action tennis sisters Venus and Serena Williams have brought to the sport, it's near certain Jacqueline Edmonson's Venus And Serena Williams: A Biography will bring added attention and a ready audience.

When the book starts it explains how Sara's mother died when she was small and how it is Nanny and Papa taking care of her. She must leave Montreal, her &quot;Kingdom&quot; and move to a very natural and untouched town that her Mother grew up in King Edward island. Her Mother is also buried in the King graveyard, that Sara discovers, honors and respects. Sara is not welcomed by her King cousins but realises, in the end that nothing could get between them. This book really is *the* starter of the series"},{"Title":"The Journey Begins (Road to Avonlea Series, Book 1)","review":"Novelizations of television episodes are basically what we make due with until they come out on videotape. But in \\"The Journey Begins,\\" the novelization of the first episode of the \\"Avonlea\\" series, Dennis Adair & Janet Rosenstock provide some actually depth to this retelling of the tale. Specifically, they get into what young Sara Stanley is thinking when her life is turned upside down. Her father is threatened with financial ruin and Sara is shipped off to her late mother's relatives on Prince Edward Island. Sara arrives in Avonlea with her Nanny Louisa is tow, only to meet up with the formidable King family, headed by the imperious Aunt Hetty, who also happens to be the local school teacher. Adair & Rosenstock take pains to explain the complex dynamic that exists between Sara and her relatives on PEI, undoubtedly filling in some holes for young readers who saw the pilot episode and were not sure what to think about what was going on.This first volume in \\"The Road to Avonlea\\" series is based on the Sullivan Films Production written by Heather Conkie, which, in turn, was adapted from the novels of Lucy Maud Montgomery. \\"The Story Girl\\" was Montgomery's favorite novel and its sequel \\"The Golden Road,\\" along with two collections of short stories known as the Chronicles of Avonlea, are the material from which various episodes are developed.What becomes fascinating in this first episode is how the premises of \\"The Story Girl\\" are redeveloped for this series. In the books Sara would come to visit her King cousins each summer, heading back to Montreal in the fall. However, the situation needed to be altered so Sara was a more permanent part of the Avonlea community. They could have made Sara an orphan, in the grand tradition of Montgomery's most famous literary creations Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon, but it is important that at least on some level Sara WANTS to stay on PEI. At the heart is one of Montgomery's strongest themes, how a young girl forges bonds of affection with a spinster. Aunts Hetty and Olivia certainly recall Emily's Aunts Elizabeth and Laura and there are strong echoes of that novel in this story.Consequently, whether you are a long time reader of Montgomery's works eager to devour new tales using her literary creations, or a young reader who is working their way through these books and then on to the one actually written by Montgomery, you will find these tales to be kindred spirits. I used to have the Disney Channel just so I could watch \\"Avonlea\\" and honeymooned last year on PEI, staying at the \\"White Sands Hotel.\\" So, it is pretty clear that I am just one of countless millions of enraptured fans."},{"Title":"The Journey Begins (Road to Avonlea Series, Book 1)","review":"I absolutely love the TV show Road to Avonlea, and I was unaware of these books until a few weeks ago.

It elucidated the history and underlying logic of my mother tongue to a degree unmatched by any other popular guide I've come across, and with a genial curiosity about the ways by which we manage to express ourselves that I've always found impressive. But I can really do no better conveying its virtues than by quoting the description on its back cover:This book, by a noted educator and linguist, is an illuminating and practical guide to English grammar and usage. The treatment of the subject is concise but thorough, covering important and distinctive features of the language that are overlooked by many texts.Controversial and difficult points are clarified by a lucid discussion of meaning. For instance, the author supports judicious use of the split infinitive because, he says: \\"Older usage with the adverb before 'to' is often ambiguous. 'He failed entirely to comprehend it.' This sentence is ambiguous since we do not know whether 'entirely' modifies 'failed' or 'comprehend.' Thus the much censured split infinitive is an improvement of English expression.... At present it is widely used by our best writers, who feel its advantages. It is avoided by many, especially our minor writers, who here follow the instructions of their schoolteachers.\\"English grammar is here presented, not as a fixed body of rules, but as part of an evolutionary process. Numerous examples of literary usage show how the language has developed through centuries. As all materials are methodically arranged, fully indexed, and provided with cross references, the volume is suited for either reference use or systematic study. It is an ideal text for an intensive course in grammar. (end quote)And so indeed I have always found it to be.

It was a delightful find to complement my collection of wildflower field guides, though not quite what I was expecting from the title \\"Fall Wildflowers.\\" I was envisioning a book about plants that bloom during autumn. Instead, this book concentrates on fruits and seedpods and even includes some seedless plants such as ferns and horsetail. There are very few actual flowers in any of the pictures except for a few accompanying fruits and seeds more or less by accident. The book is not only useful for fall season either, but rather many of the fruits and seedpods shown can be seen starting in May and throughout the summer and fall and well into winter in some cases. It was published in 1987, and consequently some of the taxonomy is outdated by now. However, I have not yet found any other more up-to-date source that provides equivalent information and images.The book contains beautiful full page (4x6 in.) photographs of fruits, seeds or equivalent structures of 100 species including trees, shrubs, vines, herbs and as mentioned above some seedless plants. Combining these pictures with details about similar plants in the descriptions, it claims to provide a guide to the identification of 224 species. It is designed to be user friendly to a lay person with no prior knowledge of botany. Plants are organized by fruit/seedpod/sporangium color into four sections, with colored tabs on the edge of the pages: green-white-yellow (green tab), red-pink-orange (red tab), brown-black (brown tab), and blue-purple (blue tab). Within each section, plants are sorted roughly by the time they fruit or set seeds or spores, listing early-fruiting plants first and progressing into fall and winter, though I find it is sometimes not quite clear when each plant is fruiting. Most of the descriptions mention the month(s), but some don't. Each full-page photograph is accompanied by a description on the opposite page, written in non-technical language and including information such as the appearance of the plant, similar species, possible uses and toxicity, habitat and suitability for planting and propagation in wildflower gardens. The book ends with a pronunciation key for the scientific names and an index of common and scientific names.In summary, this is a delightful field guide to some of the fruits and seeds found in the wild along the Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains. It wasn't quite what I was expecting from the title though, but it does fill a unique niche on my shelf full of wildflower field guides."},{"Title":"Sir MacHinery","review":"The story is one that combines the Magical with that of the coming future of Robotics.

Without this I would not have been turned on to fantasy. Recently I reread this book and although it is not as sophisticated as I remember it was totally original and in an odd way wonderful in the sense of good triumphing over evil. The plot is simple and stereotypical, but classic. The idea of a robot, a wizard, and the modern man teaming together to fight demons just gives you a marvelous feeling of content, no matter how cheesey the dialogue. I would love to see this as a book once again in print or a movie, and if the rights are still around when I'm grown I would like to take on an adaptation myself. If you get the rare chance, definitely read this book."},{"Title":"Sir MacHinery","review":"I have searched for this book for years after loaning to a fellow teacher and never getting it back! I used to teach in a one-room school and my students there enjoyed the story much that they would act out scenes on the playground at recess. It is rare to have students' imaginations activated by a story but this one sure did it for my students. It's been at least tens years since the book was lost and I still mourn for it. Why on earth doesn't this publisher bring it back out into publication. I also feel it is truly a modern day classic that many kids and adults would treasure if only they had access to it. I have found one copy of it in my search over the years, but it was a copy at the Boise,ID public library, I hate to admit I entertained thoughts of checking it out and never returning it, but I couldn't bring myself to do it."},{"Title":"Sir MacHinery","review":"I discovered &quot;MacHinery&quot; waaay back in grade school and found the characters to be fascinating, especially the Seargeant-Major.

Sr. JoAnn, my 6th grade teacher, refused to take any money for it and simply gave it to me, knowing how much I loved it. Thank you Sister!Why this hasn't been discovered and made into a movie is beyond me. With the popularity of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, this would be a natural. And why isn't it being published anymore? The dialogue is crisp and believable and the scene where Merlin raises the ghost of William Wallace and the other Scots warriors is funny and priceless! When MacHinery rescues Merlin from the lake and it's guardian, the dragon, is funny also. It's a scene I've &quot;seen&quot; and laughed at many times as I reread the book.If you get the chance to get a copy of &quot;Sir MacHinery&quot;, read it.

Ms Faye Hanley, my 6th grade teacher, had a bookshelf set up in the corner of the classroom and we were encouraged to read any of the books we wanted. I have always been fascinated with the King Arthur legend, so the presence of Merlin in this book made reading it a no brainer. I read and re-read it several times that year. I finally got my own copy which I have re-read many, many times over the past decades. It is a wonderful melange of science fiction and fantasy.

He wants me to read it to him again.This book has a lot of action, fighting, clever escapes, magic, hand grendes and all kinds of fun stuff.This book is out of print, unfortunately, and I suspect it's going to stay that way (unless someone edits it). It is violent, even graphically so at points. (Demons and a dragon die horrible deaths.) It's not politically correct, and probably won't be for some time to come.

One of the first books that came to mind was Sir Machinery. My father and I read this book more than once when I was in grade school. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that this book is no longer in print. For those parents and children who enjoyed the highly creative stories and use of science and legend by Rowling - check out Sir Machinery. The book is very well written and a lot of fun. Hopefully, as more people look to capture the thrill of the Harry Potter experience - the publisher will consider re-releasing Sir Machinery. I would rank right up there with the Chronicles of Narnia, Tolkien's books and, of course, Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Sir MacHinery","review":"Tom McGowen does an outstanding job of combining the logic of science with the wonder of magic in this book for young readers. The story is that of Simon Smith, an American scientist, who goes to Scotland to complete work on his &quot;mechanical man.&quot; When his robot is stolen by dwarves, however, and pressed into battle against the evil demons, Smith finds himself forced to accept the reality of magic - and the re-birth of the legendary Merlin - as he joins the fracas himself.

Reunited forty years after first reading it, I still enjoy the book as much now as I did then.The author artfully and skillfully weaves science and fantasy, ancient times and modern day into a captivating tale that is a must read. It is a classic story of good triumphing over evil and an odd lot of characters banding together to accomplish something that really seems impossible.Whatever your age, it is worth your time to get lost in the 155 delightful pages set in the highlands of Scotland."},{"Title":"Sir MacHinery","review":"I remembered reading this as a child after my older brother had read it. It was a borrowed copy and I was only able to read it once or so...Recently I went to the library to see if they had a copy, as the price of a copy is prohibitive unless it was in poor condition. I found that I still enjoyed the story, and that as I read it I recalled several scenes and how I had noted them when I read the book as a child. The story was much simpler-seeming than from what I remembered, and I read it in a few hours, but it was well crafted and not only was it fun to remember it, but I enjoyed just as much as when I was young. An excellent book, and one that you should have your children read if you want to spark the love of reading. It should be put back in print."},{"Title":"Sir MacHinery","review":"John - My friend (of 24 years) and I have both recently realized that the book 'Sir Machinery' was/and is one of the greatest children's books of all-time.

It was just something completely unique, and remains so: a children's science fiction robot fantasy adventure fairy tale. I don't understand why this book isn't in print in perpetuity.

I still remember the characters, even some of the scenes, and wish I could get my hands on a copy. Publishers, if you are reading this, please send out a new edition!

Up until reading this book, I worried about my daughter passing her classes, wondered if she didn't understand the material, fretted over her lack of interest. But now I am back in the driver's seat - and she gets to do the worrying!Dr. Gray gives many examples of how to help your son or daughter. There are several chapters, just a couple of pages in length, which explain the various techniques you can use with your kids. It is a book you can grab and quickly find something that will help.The other benefit of the book is that he describes the process of setting up a motivational plan for the student. He, obviously, has heard all the excuses for not getting school work done and can help a parent set up a system which is hard to sabotage.

Without going into detail of the plot (and ruining the story), this is a perfect world for Logan. If you have followed the life of the man called Logan, you will know only too well that his life has been cursed with tradegy, marred with the failure to find happiness. In this story, in a messed up world filled with familiar messed up people, it brought a tear to my eye to see his one true mission succeed. He is battle hardened, scarred, tortured, not the Logan we know. This would be reason enough to despise the world in which they put him. The only thing available to him which makes me love this world so much is his sidekick, his companion, his soulmate, his best friend and his lover. This book is worth ten times it's cost to see Logan &amp; Jean Gray together. What a perfect world."},{"Title":"Weapon X (X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse Gold Deluxe Edition) (Wolverine)","review":"When the Legion Quest storyline ended, an alternate universe was created due to the fact that Legion went back in time to kill Magneto but accidently killed Charles Xavier. Since Xavier died, there was no X-Men to stop Apocalypse from taking over America and most of the world. This alternate reality, The Age of Apocalypse, put all the regular X-books on hold for four issues and replaced them with they're AoA versions. Weapon X (Wolverine) tells the storyline revolving around Logan (he is not called Wolverine in this alternate reality) who in all his long lifetime in the regular X-universe was never able to find happiness. In the Age of Apocalypse, Logan is finally with the woman he loves: Jean Grey, and he couldn't be happier (then again he is missing a hand). The intense love and emotion between the two should be seen to be believed. Logan has an early run in with Havok, and we learn the past between Logan and Cyclops (in this reality Cyclops and Havok are servants to Apocalypse) and how Jean Grey ties in (to find out a bit more read the X-Man TPB). Eventually Jean must leave Logan to find out some info, and Logan has a few battles with Pierce and other cyborgs. Carol Danvers and Gateway make some appearances, but sometimes the action lags and the story can become a bit incoherent. The art is great and Logan's narration is as well, and is sometimes darkly hilarious. All in all, this is a good chapter in the Age of Apocalypse saga."},{"Title":"Academic Writing: How to Read and Write Scholarly Prose","review":"This is an out of print 1st edition of a text now in its 3rd edition.

If you play poker at anything less than the professional level, you should add this book to your library. It covers Hold 'em, Seven Stud, and Omaha as well as variations of these games. The discussion of how to play the games are brief and concise. The strategy sections are fundamental, yet powerful. There's not a lot of fat here, just clear writing and practical tips.

It covers other variations of poker as well, but in even less depth.All that being said, I bought it because it qualified me for free shipping. Shipping would have been about $5, the book was $6, so I essentially spent $1 on the book - it was worth the $1. It's worth the $6 if you want a basic primer to get you started - simple to read, easy to understand.

However, \\"Balsamo\\" and \\"Memoirs\\" are often confused. For instance, if one were to look on Google Books, the book that comes up for \\"Memoirs\\" is actually only the first half of \\"Balsamo\\". For quick reference then, \\"Balsamo\\" starts with the chapter titled -Introductory-, and \\"Memoirs\\" with -The Field of the Dead-, which is exactly where the former lets off. My advice - don't read the second in the series unless you've read the first, as they actually form one continuous story in two parts.As far as a review goes, I would unflinchingly recommend any Dumas book. If you have already read \\"The Three Musketeers\\" and \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" then I would suggest finishing the Musketeers series first. But, if hungry for more, take this series on. It has all the romance and intrigue typical of Dumas's novels, though lacks in some measure that one illimitable character which make his more popular books so well loved, a la D'Artagnan or Dantes. In return, however, it rewards you with some fun little history lessons (and, of course, that oh so wonderful elitist feeling of having read a Dumas novel most people don't even know exists).Buy it - you'll like it."},{"Title":"The memoirs of a physician","review":"After reading Alexandre Dumas' popular works &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;, &quot;The Vicomte de Bragellone&quot;, and &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, continued reading to delve into his more obscure novels is a rewarding experience. &quot;Memoirs of a Physician&quot; proves to be an unexpected detour from the standard type of intrigue in Dumas' most noted writings. After reading &quot;Memoirs&quot; one would almost find it appropriate to label the twists and turns in the aforementioned works as &quot;shallow&quot;. In this book, the first in the series of the Marie Antoinette Romances, the reader experiences a look into darker and more sinister events which ultimately led to the French Revolution. &quot;Memoirs of a Physician&quot; exudes suspense, alliances and betrayals, humor, romance, longing to be and the becoming itself - all of the qualities that place Dumas' novels among the greatest works of all time."},{"Title":"The memoirs of a physician","review":"I have done a bit of research and the news is not good. This review refers to the version of the book whose cover just has a picture of a guy with a beard. No idea who he is, but he is not the physician (Joseph Balsamo) nor is he Dumas. Anyway be careful. I rated three stars, because it's a good book even if it has a misleading title. Some people will tell you that the proper order is Joseph Balsamo then Memoirs of a Physician. That is not always something you can count on. I bought a version of Joseph Balsamo, then I bought this thing only to find that it is the same text. The closest thing you can get in English to the full version in paper back is to make sure that the second book begins with the chapter \\"The Field of the Dead\\". Even this may not take you all the way to The Queen's Necklace. I settled on reading the second book online. After reading Joseph Balsamo, I went to [...] and started reading Memoirs of a Physician vol. 2. It started in the right place but even that stopped short. So I switched to reading the version in The Works of Alexandre Dumas Vol. 7. This is about the best you can do these days. Even reading this one left a huge hole in the story. So I did more research, and I found that only one English translation has the whole story. That translator was J.M. Dent in the early 1900's published by Little Brown. It has 30 chapters that are missing from every single other English translation. You can get this from rare book shops and look for it on Ebay, but good luck. No modern version seems to have these missing chapters. These missing chapters cause a bit of confusion when readers get to later parts of the story as the missing events are referred to, and you find yourself thinking \\"Why is this guy an adult now?\\". None of the Project Gutenberg sites have them. None of the scanned versions at [...] has them. Apparently these chapters contain a rape, and not just any rape but a rape of a girl in a hypnotic trance.

It starts where Joseph Balsomo leaves off, with 'The field of the Dead'. The version for sale here, is a very shallow, condensed and actuallt re-written novel that does not represent the real novel in the least. I have learned to seek out the older copies of Dumas, they are much more complete and original."},{"Title":"The memoirs of a physician","review":"The book is great, everything by Dumas is, but every single book published by Boomer Books is absolutely horrible. The names are mis-spelled, the punctuation is all over the place, the words are changed so they don't make any sense, it's awful. At least one typo per page and up ten. Another thing is the Boomer Books version is the first book in the series, usually the first book is called Joseph Balsamo but Joseph Balsamo is also published as the second book sometimes, so be careful."},{"Title":"The memoirs of a physician","review":"Memoirs of a Physician begins whereJoseph Balsamoleft off as all Paris panics after a fireworks display goes awry and Andr&eacute;e is almost crushed to death beneath the mob. Andr&eacute;e's brother Phillip desperately searches for her and is feared dead - until she is returned unharmed to her family by the mysterious Balsamo. Lower born Gilbert is still madly in love with Andr&eacute;e and he follows her (working as a gardener) when she is taken into service by Marie Antoinette. Madame DuBarry continues her schemes, as does the mysterious Balsamo working with the Freemasons to stir unrest against the monarchy and lustful Louis XV takes one look at the beauteous Andr&eacute;e and he plots with her father to make her his latest conquest.Actually, there's a whole lot more to the story than that but this is Dumas and it would take another novel to try to outline the story better. Suffice it to say that as in the first book in this series, the opulence and shenanigans of the French Court, the manipulations of the politicians, Balsamo's hypnotic control over his wife Lorenza and Andr&eacute;e, secret rooms and hidden staircases, a mad desire by Balsamo's master to obtain the one horrific ingredient needed to complete his elixir of eternal life culminates in a thoroughly unputdownable tale that had me reading well into the wee hours of the morning. I especially loved Gilbert's antics (ROFL, Hollywood would have a field day with this) as he spied on Andr&eacute;e and the way Dumas used her contempt of his lower status as a way to emphasize the growing disparity between the classes. Next up in the series,The Queen's Necklace (1902).Side note on the first two books in this series - as I understand it they were originally published in one volume called Memoirs of a Physician and are now published separately as Joseph Balsamo and Memoirs of a Physician. I've noticed some complaints from other reviewers on the quality of editing and translation of some of these newly published editions and went searching for an older used copy and was quite happy with that."},{"Title":"The Colt from the Dark Forest","review":"Karl Madsen rescues a little red foal from death in the forest and is ecstatically happy when the owner gives it to him to keep.

If you are interested in this question then you should read this book. Given the poverty and population growth rates in the Middle East, it is hard to imagine any long-term solution that is not based on economic growth and broad-based prosperity. Unfortunately the Arab world currently lacks a viable economic model. But what economic model? Should it be based exclusively on the Western model or are there others that would be more easily accepted in the Arab world? Schlossstien lucidly argues that the Arab world should look to East Asia, not the West, for their model. The economic transformation that has occurred in East Asia is based on an economic model that embraces Asian cultural values. And, as he describes, it has been remarkably effective in rapidly moving these countries out of poverty. By analogy with East Asia, Arab countries can develop models that include their values. By providing an alternative, Schlossstein dramatically raises the level of discussion in an area of critical importance where there are few new ideas - just a continual rehash of the problems. It is a fascinating read because Schlossstein makes his arguments by taking the reader on a journey through history and comparative religion, with Islam at the center. He deals with issues in a straightforward, often provocative, and occasionally witty style. Schlossstein is clearly someone who is interested in solutions, not ideology. I hope that all those working and making policy decisions in the Middle East will read and discuss this book. Schlossstein has provided the case for a much more positive and constructive discussion about how to move forward. For general readers I also strongly recommend this book. It provides a comprehensive overview of one of the most important issues of our age."},{"Title":"Endangered Species: Why Muslim Economies Fail","review":"Endangered Species is a lively, provocative look at why Muslim economies fail-and what to do about it. Schlossstein applies his recent studies of the Muslim economies to his encyclopedic knowledge of the Asian tiger economies to urge that Muslim economies follow those models rather than attempting to ape western democratic capitalism at this stage of their development. Enroute he succinctly surveys economics, religion, culture, institutions and education in several leading Muslim societies, notably Turkey, Egypt, Iran and Morocco. He sees Egypt as perhaps the most likely to reform itself toward a success model. The bibliography is outstanding.

Jim Grover) discusses different kinds of less than lethal weapons for self defense, improvised weapons and OC sprays (\\"pepper gas\\"). The emphasis is on OC sprays, as McCann thinks they are superior less than lethal weapons.The film starts with a survey of different kinds of less than lethal weapons on the market. McCann presents several designs of many types of weapons. He also gives advise on how to choose a weapon best suited to your needs and circumstances. This portion lasts for some 15 minutes, and a large portion of this is used on OC.The next section handles improvised weapons. This is very interesting stuff, and therefore it is sad that this section is mere 7 minutes long. Someone who wants more information about improvised weapons should read Pool ques, beer bottles and baseball bats by Marc MacYoung. I, for one, would be interested if McCann would make a film entirely on improvised weapons.The rest of the film (almost 30 minutes) is devoted to OC sprays. McCann gives advise on how to choose a good OC spray (they are not created equal). After that, he gives information on proper use of the spray. At the end, he present some neat tricks on how to deploy the spray.As other films by McCann (Jim Grover) that I have seen have been of good (or even excellent) quality, I was somewhat disappointed with this film. The overall impression of the film is that it is made very hastily. The film consist of McCann lecturing on a practise hall floor, and the whole film might have been shot on a single day. There is very little action in the film, so all of the information could very well have been presented in written form (and with a much lower price tag). Also, I expected that there would be less emphasis on OC sprays. While OC is a very good defensive weapon, I expected to get more information on other weapon systems, as well.Run time: 0:50"},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"i don't often read historical fiction, but i thoroughly enjoyed the experience of \\"east wind rain.\\" in addition to beautifully detailed scenes of a place that i never before imagined, it has a truly singular cadence that carried me easily through its final, gripping, conclusion. afterward, i realized how sorry i was to part with the story and its characters."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"This book is in a league with MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA and SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS. Really. And if you loved those books, you'll love this one. An exquisite love story, a wonderfully-evoked sense of place, and the backdrop of history--they all unfold, gracefully and vividly, with a style you'll want to savor.Paul has taken a true story, that of a crash-landed Japanese aviator on an obscure Hawaiian island on December 7, 1941, and wrought a work of fiction that nevertheless remains consistently real. The characters of Irene and Yoshio, the island's sole Japanese inhabitants, torn between wavering loyalties and obligations, are the emotional heart of the book, but one also meets many memorable characters: A boy named Little Preacher. Alymer Robinson, the outright owner of the island, who has his reasons for keeping the islanders out of the mainstream of 20th Century society. And Nishikaichi, the downed Zero pilot at the center of it all. But the most enthralling character is the island of Ni'ihau itself: a place out of time, which gives EAST WIND, RAIN a timeless air.Highly recommended, particularly for readers in book groups. This is one to read, discuss, and enjoy."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"This is a fabulous idea for a story: a real event, buried in the history of the WW II attack on Pearl Harbor, involving an island and a people that have long been hidden from the rest of the world. Paul's treatment of this event scores on several counts: First, the language is wonderfully evocative, full of powerful descriptions, and entirely void of cliches. Second, her account sheds new light on the genesis of the U.S. policy of Japanese internment -- for it was here that the concept, or its approach, first hatched. And third, she does what every novelist hopes to achieve. She makes you wonder about how individual people really dealt with a huge event. All of which makes the book a true pleasure."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"This is a story set in a magical, distant place -- a small, private island in Hawaii where slow, predictable lives are wrenched one day by the crash of a Japanese Zero and its pilot during the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Absorb yourself in the world Paul has created...!"},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Paul has written a rich book with a deceptively simple style and plot line. While exploring the intrusion of an outsider on a closed society, the book delves into topics such as racism, technology, paternalism, marital relations, modernity, and tragedy in the classical sense. Because of its richness, East Wind, Rain would make a fine book to incorporate into a high school curriculum; the novel might pair nicely with works such as The Lord of the Flies. The book would also spark great discussions in adult book clubs."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"The story is a new twist on the \\"caught behind enemy lines\\" concept. It could only be believable if it really happened - and it did. Just the idea of it reeks with excitement. The story is historical fiction and well written, but needs more work with an editor to maintain the necessary suspense of the storyline. The middle portion of the book slows the story down to the same pace as life on the remote island. Many pages pass without advancing the main theme of the story. From the first page the reader wants to know, \\"What happens, what happens to the pilot?\\" The ponderous middle section of the book nearly kills the suspense of the story line. Eventually the excitement does return, and again, for the first time since the beginning of the book, I read each word with a yearning for the next. The conclusion does not disappoint; it is not an ending you would likely to have guessed before hand."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Although the story takes place on a remote Hawaiian island at the beginning of WWII, the subject matter is very topical in todays social climate. The story basically addresses the issue of national allegiance. The interplay between the downed Zero pilot and Yoshiro Harada, an American of Japanese decent, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor is riviting. The reader is drawn into a veritable \\"time warp\\" and experiences the thoughts of the pilot, the Harada family and the Hawaiians as they experience a series of betrayals and miscommunications.This icing on the cake is that this story is based upon an actual event."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"I just finished this book. While the premise was strong, the book was too slow-paced. Paul could have done so much more with almost everything. The character sketches were weak. The reader wasn't allowed to get close to anyone. Everyone was distant, almost a fictional figure rather than appearing real and popping out of the pages. There could have been a couple of characters with their own intimate story weaving a thread through the main distant story, that helped the story move along. Some of the events were true in history, but none of the incidents in the book seemed imminent or made the pages turn. I couldn't understand how a single lone pilot, and such a young and inexperienced one at that, had command of the island and wasn't overpowered by the locals. To add more sympathy to him, there could have been more detail added to his background - perhaps more to the story with the fishmonger's daughter.This was not worth a read at all. I had to finish it because of my book-club, but we had a unanimous verdict on the book."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"A surprisingly good novel based on fact - Dec. 7, 1941 on a small island in Hawaii. I have passed this on to a friend who will appreciate it's culture."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"I ordered this book because we were going to Hawaii and I wanted to read something with local flavor. I had never heard of this incident before and it sounded like it would be interesting. (I also have a Niihau shell lei (necklace) from my mother-in-law, so that added to the interest.)Apparently there is not enough fact to write a true account, but Caroline Paul conjures up a story to fill in the blanks. I was amazed to learn about the continued isolation of the residents of this island TO THIS DAY. THAT was an eye opener! They still are not allowed to have telephones, TVs, radios, or newspapers. There is only solar power. Horses provide transportation as there are no cars either. All this in order to preserve the Hawaiian culture and traditions.There were many ways the story could have been written, but of course, it seems no one knows how it actually went. Since Paul was never able to visit the island and speak with them, it is all conjecture. I don't know if she knows the Hawaiian ways well enough to know whether this is how they might have resolved this issue."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"An anguishing, deep and well-crafted novel that packs lessons and intimations into practically every page. Essays could be written based on ideas and conflicts proffered freely by Paul but sopped-up painfully by the thoughtful reader. Symbols and stub-thoughts abound, evidently worked over and thought over (perhaps fought-over, since Paul may have been associated with the SF writers workshop). If you can stand the lessons (and the beauty), it's a delightful and thoughtful torture.For example, the insidious and hatefuly anti-Japanese prejudice (which today is only an echo of the fear and loathing against \\"orientals\\"), a very tough topic, is drawn out in the conflict of one of its victims for his loyalty to the country that fostered the racists who taunted him vs. his fear of his wife's hectoring and his admiration for the power of his \\"despised\\" ancestral homeland. This issue is one that those who remember might well wish to escape. Today, Taiwanese-Chinese-Americans are torn by admiration for their great ancestral country and their fear of its leadership and certain events -- evinced by reactions to Hu's recent visit.But that's a macro issue; each page has some lesson, well-thought out, such as the conflict between primitive and modern, preservation vs. development, the value of \\"philanthropy\\", the panic and herd-mentality of people in crisis, and literally dozens of others, subtly available to the wary reader.To write an essay on this short, brilliant book would take about three times the space as the book itself, and be less stirring.It's a window not just on historical events, but on the awful lessons from those times for the present ... when, for example, we wonder just how easily people can be manipulated to vote against their own interests (as the \\"welfare\\" states such as Mississippi, which receive more than the \\"donor\\" states such as California, voted to put into power those who pretend to stopping all such federal largesse).Despair, too, when you start to wonder just how gullible and stupid are the masses. The entire sequence of World Wars, including the interregnum and in particular the demarche of Japan, is a macroscopic lesson in massive folly. How even gentle people are maneuvered into hating each other and serving the interests of the powerful."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Interesting if read as fiction. Many annoying factual errors. I wish the author had more familiarity with the topic."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"A noted historian of the early twentieth century, Charles Beard was notorious for his non-traditional interpretations of economics as the driving force behind major historical events. In 1913, at the time of the original publication of this book, he was even considered to be a bit radical. Certainly, the main thrust of his monograph ruffled a few feathers, as it called into question the motives of our founding fathers, placing their feet firmly on mortal, fallible, self-interested grounds, as opposed to the lofty pedestals where they were usually enshrined.Beard argued that although the delegates to the Convention had many diverse interests, they could actually be grouped into two main categories of economic self-interests: mercantile and land ownership. From a detailed analysis of their biographies, Beard identified a pattern that indicated an economic line of demarcation between Federalists and Anti-Federalists. Those with large property assets or investments in trade unanimously supported the fledgling Constitution, while its chief detractors were the debtors, that majority of new Americans who were among the \\"have-nots\\" and who placed more faith in the loose confines of the Articles of Confederation.This book offers a compelling array of data, which the author himself refers to as a \\"long and arid survey' with the \\"nature of a catalogue\\". However, far from benumbing the mind of the reader, this use of simple exposition allows one to assess the proffered information and arrive on one's own at a conclusion that validates the author's thesis. Beard lists the material assets of each delegate, as well as their class status; not one was from a farming or mechanical class. Paired with evidence that many (including George Washington) were land speculators in the Northwest Territory, and that the implementation of the Articles of Confederation suppressed land values, a damning stain of greed and self-interest threatens to taint the motives behind the drafting of the Constitution.Beard goes as far as to intimate that the creation of a constitutional government was in effect a \\"coup d'etat\\" in which a wealthy interested minority abused and exceeded the authority granted them by the government in order to create a legal document which would bolster their businesses and profits. Evidence is supplied that indicates delegates were restricted by property ownership, cash assets, and in some states by religion. Clearly, only a certain type of man was to be permitted to have a voice in the decision. When the debate opened up upon the quest for ratification, Beard offers anecdotal evidence of goon squads and thuggery to force votes into the Federalist camp. Clearly, this is a view of the nation's origins that goes against primary school heroic notions of 1787.The most surprising thing about this book is that it was originally written in 1913. Charles Beard was often considered to be controversial amongst his fellow historians. Yet this monograph is shocking in that it is basically an accusation that the founding fathers indulged in a self-motivated and greedy overthrow of a government, which although weak and decentralized, was the preference of the downtrodden masses. He indicates that simply because future generations may have benefited from the decision s taken in 1787, the decisions were not necessarily just.In an era where conspiracy theories abound and Americans are ever eager to point the finger of blame at any select few, this book seems to fit popular tastes. Yet it would be foolish to dismiss the evidence supplied in this text as pure conjecture or the patterns as easy coincidence. Even today this founding document can be used to interpret the rights of the individual as equal to the rights of a corporation; surely it must have had in its origins the seeds of economic self-interest. Based on the conclusions made apparent in this book, it is hard not to view the Constitution as an economic document, securing in cold verbiage the rights of the wealthy creditors, while incidentally providing for the protection of the debtors. Madison's noble sentiments in Federalist #10 ring hollow when taken in equal parts with Charles Beards Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"I can't fault Beard for reaching the conclusions he did with what little evidence he had at the time (or as some might argue, what evidence he did not intentionally neglect), but historical scholarship since the 1950s has disproved Beard's thesis as presented in this book.Beard tells us that the Framers and ratifiers of the Constitution talked big when it came to America's founding values, but were really in it for themselves economically, framing our system of government in a way that would both enlarge and ensure their own economic hegemony over their fellow citizens. Yet, comprehensive review of historical documents, both by Forrest McDonald inWe the People: The Economic Origins of the Constitution(which attacks the economic prong of Beard's hypothesis), and by Bernard Bailyn'sThe Ideological Origins of the American Revolution(which convincingly demonstrates the sincerity of the beliefs in liberty our forefathers held), has revealed Beard's economic interpretation to be not anywhere remotely near historical truth.This is not to say that Beard's book is entirely without worth, however. When it was published, and for decades afterward, it was academically accepted and impacted many Americans' understanding of their own history. It also played a notable role in energizing and sustaining the Progressive movement into the New Deal era, with Beard's thesis lasting until better scholarship emerged in the 1950s. In that sense, then, it is valuable to any comprehensive understanding of early twentieth-century and depression-era politics."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"To better grasp the true history of our country, please read this book. Cultural and societal myths tend to grow over the ages and the myth of the Founders is no exception. Beard studied the founders and used their own writings in developing his theory. Along with the 'Federalist Papers' and the 'Anti-Federalist Papers' Beard has captured the true nature of the making of the Constitution. Beard does not attack nor condemn the Constitution or those that drafted it. He merely puts into its true historic prespective and removes the Founders from the elysian fields of mythology. Please read this book and you might want to also consider reading it along with C Wright Mills 'The Power Elites' and Suzanne Keller's 'Beyond the Ruling Class.' All three books put into perspective why the current economic chaos of 2008-09, as well as all past economic crisis, resulted in the bank and corporate bailouts while unemployment, foreclosures and depletion of retirement and pensions still flounder. It also explains as to why the Corporation was later proclaimed by the courts to exist as a person and enjoy the protections of the Constitution. Charles Beard was no myth nor a crank historian, as some would want you to believe."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"At least one reviewer has complained about what dry reading this book makes, especially the chapter entitled \\"The Economic Interests of the Members of the Convention,\\" which consists of seventy or so pages (roughly a quarter of the volume) of biographical sketches--some in thumbnail form, others (such as that, understandably so, on Hamilton) a few pages long--of the men who took part, as the title makes clear, in the Constitutional Convention.At first I was inclined to agree with these reviewers: reading one biographical sketch after another starts to become tedious pretty quickly. But then I started looking at it differently. What this chapter was doing, I soon realized, was fleshing out the characters behind the drama of constitution-making in a way that traditional history books rarely do, and in particular specifying the financial situation of each conventioneer along two main lines: those from the north, whose wealth tended to derive from stocks and bonds (which depended on a strong national government to bear financial fruit), and those from the south, whose wealth tended to derive from inherited wealth, primarily large tracts of land maintained through slave labor (and whose holdings were potentially threatened by a strong national government). Not surprisingly, the former tended to support the efforts of the Constitutional Convention, the latter to oppose it.We witness, then, the north vs. south lines being drawn up many decades before they took their more conspicuous form in the decade or so before the Civil War. Thus, what at first seems, as the other reviewers claim, to make for rather dry reading, turns out to provide a fascinating glimpse into the profound self-interest (although, as subsequent scholars have argued, this doesn't necessarily preclude authentic patriotic motives as well) of those in whose personal interest it was either to support or to oppose the efforts of the Constitutional Convention."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"Charles Austin Beard (1874-1948) was an influential American historian in the first half of the 20th century. He (sometimes with his wife Mary) also wrote books such asHistory of the United StatesandThe Rise of American Civilization. His reputation was seriously damaged by his opinion about Roosevelt's role in the United States' entry into World War II (see his book,President Roosevelt and the Coming of the War, 1941: Appearances and Realities).This book was originally published in 1913; this edition has an excellent Introduction by historian Forrest McDonald (who wrote a thoughtful book-length critique of it,We the People : The Economic Origins of the Constitution (Library of Conservative Thought)).In essence, Beard suggests that the Constitution was primarily supported by merchants, money lenders, manufacturers, capitalists, financiers, etc., and was opposed by farmers and debtors; thus, \\"it does not follow that the vague thing known as 'the advancement of general welfare' or some abstraction known as 'justice' was the immediate, guiding purpose ... the direct, impelling motive ... was the economic advantages which the beneficiaries expected would accrue to themselves first, from their action.\\" (Pg. 17-18)He wonders about the Constitutional Convention, \\"Did they represent distinct groups whose economic interests they understood ... or were they working merely under the guidance of abstract principles of political science?\\" (Pg. 73)He summarizes, \\"the concept of the Constitution as a piece of abstract legislation reflecting no group interests and recognizing no economic antagonisms is entirely false.\\" (Pg. 188) Later, he adds, \\"The movement for the Constitution... was originated... by four groups of personality interests which had been adversely affected under the Articles of Confederation... No popular vote was taken directly or indirectly... The members of the Philadelphia Convention ... derived economic advantages from, the establishment of a new system... The Constitution was not created by 'the whole people' as the jurists have said...\\" (Pg. 324-325)Whether one agrees with all or some of Beard's creative but controversial thesis, this is definitely a \\"must read\\" for students of the origin of this nation."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"whether or not you agree with what is said, you must read for its historical significance alone"},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"I feel it best to summarize, in outline form, the positives and negatives of this book:Positives1.) Thuroughness: The author goes into tremendous detail to document not only how the people of each state (indeed, the people living in distinct *regions* of each state) reacted to the effort to draw up and ratify the Constitution, but also how their reactions (and ultimately, wether or not they supported the new government) tied into their economic interests (personalty vs realty), and thus determined if they approved or rejected the Constitution. On top of that, he examines each of the delegates to the convention to show what economic interests they had going into the convention that might have influenced their drafting of a new national government.Negatives1) Editing: Here are some examples of how this book could really have benefitted from having an editor:a. there are pages in the book where footnotes are in German, French, or another foreign language; now maybe back in Beard's day, it was common for people to be bilingual or trilingual, but I imagine that's not so much the case today. So if you put in footnotes from a foreign language sources, and you want your readers to see how the material in the footnotes relate to your overall thesis of your book, then wouldn't it be immensly helpful to translate said footnotes for your readers?b. page 34: \\"funded sixes\\", \\"deferred sixes\\", \\"funded threes\\", \\"deferred threes\\" .... what does any of that mean? I figured out that \\"sixes\\" and \\"threes\\" are interest rates, but I had to go to my dad, who's an accountant, to learn what \\"funded\\" and \\"deferred\\" meant. On the same page, Beard talks about pounds and shillings. Well, how about explaining how much a shilling was worth, relative to a pound, in those days. Was a shilling equal to what we know as a quarter? A dime? Half a dollar? It would've helped tremendously to have someone translate Beards words into layman terms for those of us who do not have an economic background.c. The text in the book referred (I can't remember the page number) to a map showing the sections of a particular state that supported and fought against the Constitution, but there is not a single map in Beard's book. Where did it go? An editor would've spotted this and worked to correct it.2) Dry reading: While most of this book is quite readable, some portions - particularly the chapters examining each state's delegates to the convention and the later fights within each state to ratify the document - are almost torturous to go through. Don't get me wrong, I still admire Beard's thuroughness in examining everything in detail, but he could've peppered his narrative to make it more interesting.3) What's the point?: Historians and activists on the left (ie. Howard Zinn) have referred to Beard's work to document how the Constitution, and our current form of government in general, are inherently undemocratic and need to be \\"altered or abolished\\". But what's interesting, to me at least, is that while reading Beard's book, there didn't seem to be any of that same moral condemnation or calls for change - even after spending the entire book showing how the Constitution was an economic document meant to advance the interests of its supporters. So then one is left to ask, what was the point of writing the book? To simply do an objective historical study on the nature of the Constitution? To get people to stop treating the document as holy scripture written by men seeking to establish the best government possible for the American people, and view it more realistically? To provide historians with a reference source they could use to begin their own lines of inquiry?I debated on giving this book 3 or 4 stars. On the one hand, 2 and 3 in the negatives column are minor complaints that are far outshined by the research that went into this book; but ultimately, I only gave it 3 stars because a book dealing with the economics of that period needs to be understandable to those without an economic background, and sadly, the author assumed the reader would already have that knowledge. I'd still recommend this book as a reference source - especially for those who wanted to start lines of research on individual convention delegates or state ratification efforts. I tend to think that Woody Holton's \\"Unruly Americans\\" does much of the same work that Beard did, but Holton ties his conclusions into why we have a Bill of Rights and also tried (albeit unsuccessfully at times) to translate economic terms in ways that lay people can understand."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"All the founding fathers were the leaders of their community otherwise nobody would follow them, as always leaders had some form of money or property and therefore they would benefit from stable government.

It doesn't really explain why some of the wealthiest colonists and statesmen such as George Mason and Elbridge Gerry refused to sign on. Moreover, I'd recommend that any student of the Constitution, study the writings of the framers and the Constitutional debates to answer these charges. I also recommend _The Founder's Constitution_ set, edited by Phillip Kurland and Ralph Lerner. It is an excellent tool for examining original intent.

But ultimately, no one could deny that Beard's interpretation was grounded more in fancy than in fact, and that his book's thesis was absurd.In academia, this absurdity has been agreed upon for at least the last two generations. \\"An Economic Interpretation\\" is therefore notable for the historical context of its publication. In its substance, though, the book is never taken seriously anymore, nor should it be."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"Jumping to the end of Charles Beard's book, his conclusions state the following:i) The US constitution was enacted to protect the interests of: a) the moneyed classes (the rich), b) the bond and stock holding classes (the rich speculators), c) the manufacturing interests (rich capitalists), and trade and shipping interests (the rich capitalist speculators).ii) The constitution was the result of an elite group of men representing the aforementioned interests.iii) The constitutional convention held in Philadelphia was organized undemocratically by the aforementioned elite group of men to secure the aforementioned interests.iv) Those not holding the aforementioned interests (the poor) were excluded from participation in the constitutional process.v) Those participating in the Philadelphia convention personally benefited from the outcome of that convention (the constitution).vi) The US constitution is a document protecting private property rights over that of a democratic people and/or its government.vii) These assertions are on record as evidenced by the property and monetary interests of those who proposed and passed the US constitution.viii) In the ratification of the US constitution, 3/4 of the qualified voters were excluded by some means or another, aiding the 1/4 who benefited from the passage of the constitution.ix) The ratification of the US constitution was further narrowed down to where only 1/6 of the qualified voters participated in its passing.x) Therefore, the majority of qualified voters did not participate in the ratification of the US constitution.xi) This 1/6 who ratified the constitution were the same minority who held large holdings in money, bonds and stocks, manufacturing, and trade and shipping.xii) The main societal divisions in the ratification of the US constitution were among classes cited in i) and the farming and debtor classes at that time.xiii) The constitution was therefore not created by \\"the people,\\" but by the those motivated by the monetary interests cited in i).To see why Beard thought this you must read this book, which is a laundry list of those participating in the Philadelphia convention and the ratification process, and a catalogue of their documented monetary interests.After reading Beard, then you can read the introduction by Forrest McDonald holding Beard's thesis up to the crucible of historical criticism.After reading Beard and McDonald you can begin to reflect on the implications of Beard's materialist hypothesis and the host of corroborating and refuting philosophical considerations, then form your own conclusions, then repeat the cycle over and over.This is probably a good departure point to begin examining your personal beliefs and expectations of what it means to be an American."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"Beard's origional thesis form 1913 remains that the forming of the United States Constitution was an effort by the economic well-to-do of the newly formed American social class to establish a government that would protect their interests and raise the value of the government's obligations in their possessions. Beard's goal is simply to re-establish the idea of the aforementioned economic interests as the primary, not secondary cause of the U. S. Constitution. Through a topical analysis of interests, that seem contrary to the work of his historical mentors, Beard weaves his interpretation of the economic history. Throughout his book Beard consistantly refers to his work as fragmentary, but it appears extensively researched through primary documents such as the Federalist Papers, early Treasury Department records, and Madison's convension notes. Beard does an excellent job in presenting all necessary facts for the reader to follow his argument. Little, if any information is left to the supposition of the reader. Whereas the work can be dry at times, it does provide scholars with alternative, not necessarily new, interpretations of early American historical events."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"Beard was a courageous man, not afraid to say the truth, not afraid to look into reality of American life and see the abuse of power, the denial of justice, and the real social interests at stake. This book establishes the real context of the constitution, displacing the usual hero worship of the \\"founders\\" as demigods and showing them as real men who served their class interests. Beard situates the constitutional convention in the great social struggles that went on in the period after the achievement of independence. Without such an understanding the struggle over the adoption of the constitution, and the role of the Bill of Rights are simply not understandable.Post independence America was a place of economic crisis for the farmers, workers, and small tradesmen who had been the bulwark of the revolutionary struggle. Montarization of economic exchange in villages and towns where a large amount of the exchange had been based on barter, a massive inflation, and a growth of the power of the banks and other money lenders spread like a plague, particularly in the Northern States, especially New England. Farmers were losing their land; tradesmen were losing their shops; goods not made on the farms and villages became too expensive for many working people and farmers.The power of the state governments, squarely in the hands of the merchants and planters, stood behind the seizure of the lands of farmers who could no longer pay the banks and merchants. Farmers and small tradesmen rose against this. Desperate farmers and their supporters shut down courts that met to authorize confiscation of farms. With no Bill of Rights, in Massachusetts set up kangaroo courts made up of merchants and bankers that made no attempt to be fair to the farmers. Newspapers and speakers who criticized the state government and the banks and big merchants were charged with treason.Full-scale civil war broke out in Massachusetts, with the plebian rebels coming close--it is said only prevented by the delay of one detachment by a snowstorm--to seizing the national arsenal in Springfield. It was these threats to property that threatened the power of the wealthy and the order that had been established after the revolution. This is why the constitutional convention gathered, not some abstract interest in more ethereal and philosophical forms of government.Whatever is said about divine motivations, the constitutional convention which gathered the wealthy and powerful, would have had to have been a bunch of insane dreamers, not to have had the interests of their wealth and power first in their minds in this situation. This Beard shows with abundant documentation.Beard documents that this was by and large a gathering of the wealthy men of the country who had profited from the revolution and who had profited by the economic disaster farmers and tradesmen faced by buying up certificates for land in compensation for services to the revolution, many farmers and tradesmen had to sell in order to keep their own land. Beard indicates that the concern for a secure state that could safeguard these interests was the dominant question for constitutional convention. He also notes that the few delegates who were sympathetic to the popular struggle opposed the constitution. Others among the leaders of the American Revolution who opposed this trend stayed away.Beard's book has been pilloried because it challenges the public myth about the constitution and the government that is needed to maintain the continued rule of the wealthy and powerfulThe constitutional convention did not write a democratic constitution. There is no provision for national elections. There are only provisions for the state legislatures to select electors that would meet to select the president in what the constitutional convention thought would be another gathering of the wealthy and powerful.The Bill of Rights was not part of the constitution they wrote or proposed. This was not an oversight, but because the authors of the constitution did not support these rights or democracy as it is understood today. As I mentioned above, in Massachusetts rather than a \\"jury of their peers,\\" farmer rebels were tried by juries packed with merchants and bankers; rebels in Western farming communities like Springfield and Pittsfield were tried by juries from Boston. In states like Connecticut and Massachusetts, the Congregationalist church was an established church and membership in it was required to vote. Writers and speakers could be charged with treason for attacking the state governments.Most people in the United States opposed the constitution that came out of the Philadelphia convention. Many cited as \\"founders\\" opposed it. The bill of rights was proposed as a compromise addition to safeguard the rights of the popular majority. Without it, the constitution would not have passed.Even so, many provisions of the Bill of Rights were not actively enforced, some until the 20th Century. The establishment of religion continued in Connecticut and Massachusetts as states until 1820s and 1830s, and establishment of the Congregational churches by town government continued in many areas of New England until the late 19th and in a few places the early 20th century!!! Massachusetts's courts still charged and convicted newspapers for blasphemy in the 1840s.Popular voting without property, religious, or other qualifications was not me insured in this constitution. This came only with the amendments others that followed the Civil War, which Beard famously termed The Second American Revolution.Beard tells the real story here. For that, he was pilloried. Similarly, during and after WWII he documented, using congressional hearing testimony for the most part, how Roosevelt took the US into the Second World War. Again he was pilloried with new attacks generated against this book, even though this was written decades before.We are lucky for a man like Beard who wasn't afraid to tell the truth, even when the truth clashed with myths that are propagated in the interests of the billionaires who run this society."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"This book was first issued in 1913 during the Progressive Party era. Theodore Roosevelt questioned the power of the judiciary to declare laws unconstitutional and suggested the people should have the right to recall that decision (\`Introduction to the 1935 Edition'). [Abraham Lincoln had similar concerns.] James Madison wrote Federalist Number 10 to speak on how politics are based on economic interests. In the late 19th century historian talked about \\"state's rights\\" or \\"a strong central government\\". Charles A. Beard investigated the original sources and found the discussions over economic interests. His book was praised by Progressives and condemned by conservative Republicans. Beard just gathered the facts in an impartial manner. This is not a biased outlook (p.xlvx). The idea of economics affecting politics is in Aristotle's writings and the Federalist paper No. 10. You can decide for yourself what part economics plays in \\"protective tariffs, foreign trade, transportation, industry, commerce, labor, agriculture, and the nature of the Constitution itself\\" (p.xlix)! [Your local newspaper may report on zoning changes but not who benefits from them.] Ignoring economic issues in history leads to confusion (p.lii).Law is primarily concerned with the ownership of property and the way it is passed from one person to another. Different kinds of property creates different classes with different views (Chapter I). Investigating the economic interests of the supporters and opponents of the Federal Constitution will test Beard's theory (p.17). Chapter II lists the difficulties in learning about the state and continental public securities and their owners, and other facts. Merchants and manufacturers wanted a protective tariff. Four powerful groups wanted a new government: the money powers, holders of public securities, manufacturers and shippers, and speculators in western lands (Chapter III). The men who wanted the new Constitution chose to have it ratified by state legislators rather than popular vote (Chapter IV). Property qualifications limited the electorate.Chapter V discusses the economic interests of the convention members. Would they benefit under the new Constitution? Were they working under the guidance of abstract principles of political science? Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey was a notorious speculator (p.86). Alexander Hamilton organized the groups to support the new Constitution (p.101). George Washington was the richest man in the US (p.144). The Constitution was created by lawyers and the wealthy (p.151). \\"The Federalist\\" shows an economic interpretation of the Constitution (Chapter VI). The Supreme Court was designed to check the Legislature (p.163). Chapter VII discusses the political doctrines of the convention members. The Constitution was a compromise by a committee. It was a revolutionary plan (Chapter VIII), but would be ratified by popular votes for delegates to a state convention. Chapter IX discusses the percentage who voted. Large numbers were anxious for betterment (p.251). Many would benefit from the Constitution (Chapter X). Many who fought in the War of 1775 supported the Constitution (pp.276-278). The small farmers on the frontier rejected the Constitution (p.285). The arguments from that time discussed the economic conflicts (Chapter XI) due to Treaties, paper money, and contracts. Those who worked the soil were generally opposed to the Constitution, those who were merchants of bankers favored the Constitution. This latter group adopted a Constitution that served their interests (pp.324-325).The \`Introduction' by Forrest McDonald notes that political events are incomprehensible unless they are considered in the context of their social and economic realities. [Names and dates are \\"barren\\".] More research since the 1940s has modified some of the views in this book."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"Charles Beard caused a minor scandal when this book was published in 1913. He argued that the Founding Fathers had foisted the Constitution on the country in order to protect their property interests in land and public securities. This was strong medicine 90 years ago when the public still thought of the Founders as demigods rather than conspiratorial politicians.Despite its age, the book reads well and is refreshingly iconoclastic. Since rightwing politicians and jurists still talk as if the Constitution had a divine origin, Beard's message hasn't lost its relevance. However, there's no denying that his book is a one-sided lawyer's brief, which selects and presents only the evidence that supports its thesis while ignoring everything else. No one who has read The Federalist would even recognize Beard's description of it.Modern readers who want a balanced and comprehensive history of the origins of the Constitution should look to books by Forrest MacDonald or other historians."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"Charles Beard's thesis held sway for decades --and was not attacked in a significant way until after his death in 1948.

I feel that some of Beard's positions are tenable, but to look at history from a purely economic standpoint turns you into what I like to call a \\"historian of robots.\\" These scholars forget that people are complex and capable of great ideas, and not always slaves to the whims of economic decisions. Also, they forget that man-made ideas like wealth and class are very ambiguous. Keep this in mind as you read Beard or related thinkers. Please comment for further discussion."},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","review":"Glancing through most American history textbooks, many students would read stories of the Founding Fathers having been intellectuals, statesmen, and individuals striving for justice in protection of their fellow Americans. \\"These framers are represented as untainted by economic or financial interests, founding a government on abstract speculations of political philosophy.\\" However, Charles Beard's account offers very different ideas and conclusions on, what he feels, the true intention of those who are credited for the creation of the United States and it's Constitution.Likely one of the most important works on early American history, Beard makes several points in An Economic Interpretation. His original 1913 argument is that the forming of the United States Constitution was an effort by the newly formed, affluent American social class to establish a government that would protect their interests and raise the value of the government's obligations in their possessions. Other historians have refuted this idea claiming it to be secondary in the goals of the framers, however Beard asserts this as their primary intention in creating the Constitution.Not only was the Constitution created to protect their interests but Beard argues that it was a direct assault on the lower and middle classes and \\"not one member represented in his immediate personal economic interests the small farming or mechanic classes\\" (149). The Constitution has no mention of a Bill of Rights (later ratified on Dec 1791) and was opposed \\"almost uniformly... from the agricultural regions and from the areas in which debtors had been formulating paper money and other depreciatory schemes\\" (291). Beard does receive some criticism in that \\"the controversy was based in large measure on state pride, state patriotism, state jealousies and state dislike of a nationalism which would devour the state\\" rather than placing the mistrust in economics. In addition, the Constitutional Convention was never submitted to a popular vote nor was it submitted for popular ratification (239).Beard's ideas are well supported and documented with extensive research of primary documents such as correspondence, treasury documents, newspapers and a careful analyzation of the Constitution. \\"The correspondence shows the exact character of the evils which the Constitution was intended to remedy; the records of the proceedings in the Philadelphia Convention reveal the successive steps in the building of the framework of the government under the pressure of economic interests; the pamphlets and newspapers disclose the ideas of the contestants over the ratification; and The Federalist presents the political science of the new system as conceived by three of the profoundest thinkers of the period, Hamilton, Madison and Jay\\" (152-53).In his summation of An Economic Interpretation, Beard voices what he has intended to say throughout, the largest of which that the Constitution was designed to protect the wealthy, bond and stock holders, and manufacturing, trade and shipping interests. Those interests were protected by a document produced by an elite group that was organized undemocratically, excluding those not holding those interests. Post convention and ratification, those interests were seen as protected from the outcome and to uphold private property rights first and of the people at large, secondly. During ratification, three-fourths of qualified voters had been denied because of technicalities and the societal divisions made it that much easier for it to be adopted as law. Therefore, \\"We the People,\\" is extremely inaccurate according to Beard, as \\"the People\\" is a small minority driven by financial interests.Beard attempts to maintain an objective opinion and his ideas are based on documented facts and has strived to refrain from any judgement on moral issues. Social issues are intertwined with those of economics during this time period, but information is presented strictly in an economic sense. It is unfeasible to sense that Beard is not passing judgement on the framers for their actions, but is hidden well within statistics and documentation and has restricted his hypothesis to the true reasons in the creation of our Constitution."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Italian Pb","review":"I used this book to learn enough Italian to visit Italy twice, the second time living with Italian people who spoke not word one of English.

One of the reasons for their success in life is because Lila taught them to be independent young men who could make good decisions for themselves, but knowing she was there for them when they needed her guidance. I feel, in this difficult situation, she did what she needed to do for her son as well as herself. Some of your reviews seemed to portray her as a cold hearted mother who thinks only of herself. This is far from the truth! Sure, she could have quit her job and her life and moved to take care of her son. This is probably what most of us would have done. But, this probably would have made an invalid out of him. She knew, no matter how it hurt, that she had to help him recover by helping him to be independent and make his own decisions. This is how she participated in his rehab as I see it. I feel this book gives a mother the strength to help a child recover by helping them be independent and able to make their own decisions concerning their recovery.

My mother spent 24 hours a day with my brother during the first week of his injury -- why is this ignored in three reviews? Further, who has ever chronicled such a difficult crisis for the benefit of others and then been held in such harsh judgement? No doubt, though, this is a realm where extreme feelings are a daily reality. However, if everyone who posted a review here had compassion and the ability to understand what a harrowing undertaking the writing of such a book would be for a parent in this situation (no doubt the reason no others have ever done so), perhaps they'd see how unfair, unqualified and cruel their negative comments and ratings appear. Based on the three reviews below, it's clear that this book is not for everyone... maybe it's not even for fathers of the spinal injured, nor for parents who face this situation with a school-age child. It is my mother's unique story detailing her means for coping with the predicament she and her adult son faced, and her telling of how reality REQUIRED her to be away to keep her job -- during which time she still made a caring difference for my brother (an undeniable reality) -- has so far proven to be as valuable to others in her situation as the details of the occurrences during the vast amount of time that she spent with my brother 24/7... providing a beginning-to-end net of support that saw my brother and herself through this crisis -- which is certainly among the most difficult any loving parent could ever face.

I look forward to reading your book on this subject...."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"Until suffering a spinal injury to a loved one, no one has any knowledge of how to deal with such a situation. This book presents the unique perspective of a mother through the early stages and the first year of her adult son's spinal injury and their paths to a new life -- a life that most experiencing such a trying situation will be surprised to know still holds much joy and happiness. It's meant as a guiding light for those who are facing such an ordeal and yearn to know what to expect."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"Due to this book's unique insights into the emotions and thoughts of a mother dealing with her adult son's spinal cord injury, it has recently been added to the patient libraries at several major spinal cord injury rehabilitation centers across the United States. It is recommended for parents in similar situations and as a resource at domestic and international spinal rehabilitation centers."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"and relates her perspective, having never personally dealt with paralysis in the past. This review is being posted in reply to the two posted by \\"reader from USA,\\" which I feel incorrectly skew the rating for this important book. Not to dismiss 'reader's' input, I'd just like to address a couple of the questions the two reviews below raise. First, the author of the book was indeed extremely important in the rehabilitation of her son, despite having her home and her \\"life\\" 1,000 miles away. Admittedly, that requires a special person who is capable of impacting someone from afar when reality doesn't permit the fulltime dedication of one's life to being a coach throughout the process of rehab. So, perhaps this book IS more helpful for adult parents who love their adult kids but live some distance from them. This is not a day-by-day, blow-by-blow account nor pattern for dealing with every nuance of paralysis... other books along those lines do exist. This is a mother's account, more specific during the first week (when the [stuff] really hits the fan for her son) and more general over time. A question is raised as to the book's claim to being non-fiction -- which is poorly concocted, like several of the other points raised, leading me to wonder who posted those reviews and what their motives truly were. Regardless, the fact is that the book is indeed non-fiction, a point which can easily be corroborated through basic online research. 'Reader' also wants a book written by the injured subject of the book and by others who were closer during rehab -- but how fair is it to rate this book poorly for what it is not? Indeed, as 'Reader' finally points out, 'This book is about how the Mother felt mostly,' so -- at least in my opinion -- in that this special woman took the time to write from her heart on such a difficult subject and offered real insights -- the book deserves a much higher ranking."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"My name is Roger Darnell, and in addition to being an amazingly talented, independent young man, my brother is a c-5/6 quadriplegic who suffered a spinal injury (diving) in 1991. With news of the accident, I and my immediate family all wound up at a hospital in St. Louis, and we began the process of dealing with my brother's new life. To say the least, that path is difficult... and my mother has been there, learning what she could to help my brother and herself through this ordeal. A very caring mother with a strong sense of survival, she not only learned to eventually transfer my 6'-4&quot; brother herself (!), she has written a brief but passionately detailed book that covers the period from injury through my brother's independent life six years later. Part therapy, obviously, this book is also meant as a means of coping with spinal injury for parents and those whose loved-ones suffer such a life-altering tragedy, so they can begin to sort out the actual details of their new situation... and see some real light at the end of the tunnel. As far as the books themselves, we believe you'll find each paperback copy from 1stBooks Library to be truly splendid. My mother has worked to make this book available for those who need to gain as much control and optimism as is possible when facing this difficult fate... which despite its obvious challenges, still offers much joy, encouragement and hope -- believe it! -- for everyone. You and your family can get through this, and our family is very proud to think my mother's efforts and insights may help you. Here's hoping they do, and that somehow, someday, every spinal injured person regains full use of their completely mended bodies once again."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"my best friend's daughter was in a car accident about a year ago and has not been able to walk ever since. i can say that my friends experience as a mother was not at all like the mother in this book. there are some good moments, but overall not very helpful to people actually going through this sort of thing. many of the &quot;mothering&quot; moments, that the mother seems to want patted on the back for, are so obvious and basic to mothers that her feelings and thoughts were just not useful."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"For anyone searching for information, the author wrote &quot;Sudden paralysis is a circumstance no one wishes to get intimately familiar with, but such tragedies do unfortunately occur. In my own experience, I've learned that a mother will search desperately for the tools of education whenever they're required, but when my son was involved in a life-changing accident, I could find no shared experiences written of by another parent. After living through the experience of the accident's aftermath and the many months of rehabilitation, I was eventually able to sit down and put words onto paper in the hope that another mother or father would one day find my experience helpful during their own times of learning and searching.&quot; This should help clarify what this book is about and why it was written. I am another parent and until I read this book, I didn't think anyone else knew how I was feeling when the same thing happened to my own son."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"My Mother's book...there are plenty of accounts available as to the victims take on this journey, but words are sparse when contributed by those placed in a support role. My Mother dealt with my situation as a tower of strength. Some may question that, considering the \\"time spent\\" and \\"distance\\" mentioned in a previous review, but those two points combined to show the true love, strength, and courage my Mother displayed throughout this journey. My Mother arrived to find her son completely powerless as to the current goings on in his life. One of the few requests I could still make, and expect to be honored, was that my family not disrupt their lives, but continue living them as best they could under the circumstances. Despite Mom wanting to be by my side throughout, she respected me enough to allow me to do it my way. This book details the struggle of a Mother to do everything she could for her twenty-seven year old child, and to then do for herself. Although every case is dramatically different, \\"The Ghost Behind The Wheelchair\\" may produce for you a bit of logic...a little understanding...some comfort...and hope...from the perspective of a loving Mother. If you are looking for an account rendered by others...your search continues."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"A complete waste of time to read this book. It seems as though the mother was expecting a martching band and blue ribbon for actually helping (at least some) her son to get re-hab!Uh, note to the author ---- that is what you're suppose to do!"},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"Wow! Not sure who you are in NY, but you obviously are either connected to the publisher or are not remotely intrested in logic. I have to agree with &quot;reader from USA&quot; 100% about how bad this book is. It is not only poorly written -- I question how accurate it is. &quot;Reader from USA&quot; is correct when they point out how bogus it is for the Mother to make the claim of how she participated in her son's re-hab when she wasn't there! Enough said about that. This is the first time I have ever rated anything I have ever read, or saw (a movie review), or heard (a CD review). And honestly, the only reason I am now giving a review is because of how stunned I was about how bad this book was. I can't believe a publisher actually bought this book! I have read many books in my life, some not so good I will admit. But this book takes the all-time-worst championship hands down. The thing that really gets me and I guess that so dissapointed me was --- that it could have been a good book. The book, as written, should have been called something like &quot;A Mother's Feelings,&quot; certainly not what it was titled. And for it to have been a good book, all the auther had to do was include quotes from all the players; their feelings and thoughts about what was going on in their own words; advice, comments, do's and dont's from all of the &quot;inner circle&quot; people involved in this tragedy. Without a doubt, that book would be more entertaining and USEFUL to people going through the same experience."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"I read this book last night and I must say, I have never read anything so bad. I really feel for the young man that lost his freedom and I am glad to see that he did get some freedom back. None of us knows how we would react to this sort of injury. But this book is about how the Mother felt mostly. Although she makes it out like she was a vital part of his recovery, I find that hard to believe since she was a 1,000 miles away, and &quot;visited&quot; every few months in the first year, and then less as time went by. This book, or one like it, should have been written by the injured youung man, or his girlfriend (which we never found out if they got married, or what happened to them!), or by his Father, who lived right next to the son....who certainly must have been more involved in the son's life than the Mother was."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"I just read this book last night and I must say, it is very bad. I feel for the person that was injured because no one knows how they will really respond to this sort of injury if it happens to them. And I am glad that he has found a new life. As far as the writing goes, it amazes me that it got published in the first place. It is also amazing that if this book claims to be non-fiction, then why wasn't any of the stories confirmed by those people involved? It seems to me, that this book is about how one person (the Mother) remembers the events. I find this confusing since she lived 1000 miles away! By her own admission, the Mother was hardly even there during the events in the book! I thought this book might give an insight into how to deal with this sort of an injury to a loved one. It doesn't at all. The more I read, the more it seemed to be about how the Mother was affected and how she dealt with it. The Mother talks about how difficult it was to go back home, (back to her life!) in only a week or so after the accident. I guess what I would like to know is ---- just how many times did the Mother actually see her son after the accident occured during the first year? Maybe 4 times? Does this sound like someone who was a vital part of the Son's rehab? Apparently, the wrong person wrote the book. It seems to me that the girlfriend, the nurse, the father, or the brother could have given better insight in to the things you have to deal with concerning this sort of injury than the Mother could."},{"Title":"The Ghost Behind the Wheelchair","review":"The tragic figure in this book wrote the last review and made the following statement &quot;One of the few requests I could still make, and expect to be honored, was that my family not disrupt their lives, but continue living them as best they could under the circumstances.&quot; So my question to you is --- did you make that request to anyone else? From my reading of the book, the girlfriend Rachel must have certainly disrupted her life to give you daily care...not the pat on the back every few months care that the mother gave. Where would you have been if not for the girlfriend's care of you? Did the mother give you baths, take you to the bathroom, feed you, clean for you? The girlfriend was given a samll bit of credit for your recovery in the book...but not nearly as much as she obviously deserved. After all, family is SUPPOSE to take care of each other, but this girl was nothing to you and she still CHOSE to help you as much as she could.

Amazon's ill-conceived policy of mixing and sloppily denominating reviews of various editions is presumably once again the culprit.I have a copy of the comprehensively annotated University of Georgia edition, but prefer the easier to use, bare-bones Dover edition. The UGA edition contains a dry, academic history of the work and includes appendices featuring notes and additional definitions that Bierce himself chose to omit when he supervised the 1911 publication of his collected works. There's really not much need for a pricier copy. In fact, the Dover edition's format is superior in its use of boldface for the word entries and a smaller typeface to present Bierce's illustrative stories, poems and quotations. Like the author, it is also a triumph of economy, taking only 139 pages to present the exact core content that the UGA edition requires over 100 more to set forth (with its use of larger fonts and broader line spacing).Buy the maximum three copies of the Dover for the price of one of the other editions and give the other two away.

Most publishers seem to feel the need to delete some of the politically incorrect definitions that were part of the time and place of America around the turn of the twentieth century. Others can't seem to help themselves; they add their own definitions which are often not funny or clever and are nowhere near authentic.

Bierce has a sharp wit and a cynic's eye and he uses both well in this anything but ordinary dictionary. Not all of the definitions are funny, but the majority of them really take no prisoners and it is very good at pointing out the little things we all still see in this modern day and age -- those little things we think to ourselves but dare not say outloud.The only problem with it is that, true to its time, there are some racist and mysogynistic overtones to some of the definitions [the only reason it didn't get a full five]. But if you can see around these as simple dating of the text to the acerbic, razor sharp wit that permiates the pages of this book you're sure to get a good snicker or two out of it yourself.My personal favourite? The definition for \\"Saint\\" [def: \\"A dead sinner revised and edited\\"].

I'd also recommend his short stories. He was just one of a kind. Like someone else noted, he was the only writer of his time to actually fight in the Civil War - and it showed!

It's surprising the Latin knowledge of Bierce, although I feel that sometimes he does not use it properly. The same for his ancient Greek Mythology skills.Unless you have a mature mind, you need to be cautious when reading Bierce. Sometimes he is shocking--but hilarious!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Ambrose Bierce was unique in being the only major writer to have served in combat during the American Civil War. In fact, he was actually invalided out of the Army after being shot in the head, and only after that did he become a writer. Perhaps his experiences in the war generally, and that catastrophic wound in particular, did something to his mind, because his writing remains unparalleled in the annals of dark, sardonic wit.Not least among the products of Bierce's twisted view of the world is his famous (or perhaps one should say infamous) \\"Devil's Dictionary\\". Like most of Bierce's work, the diabolical entries in his dictionary originally appeared in a series of newspaper articles, and only later were collated into a single volume.Bierce was primarily a journalist and short story writer, who did not write novels, and perhaps that explains the principal reason why he is not as well remembered today as are many of his lesser literary contemporaries. The fact that his \\"Devil's Dictionary\\" defines the novel as \\"A short story padded\\" speaks volumes of the author's disdain towards that particular literary form.Nevertheless, no person who considers himself truly literate and educated can afford not to be acquainted with the work of the incomparable Bierce, and most particularly with his unique \\"Devil's Dictionary\\"."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"I've got several editions of this, most recently on my Kindle.

Bierce is satirical and puts his finger right on the nub of the thing!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"I first acquired this book about five years ago, after reading Bierce's fictional works. I could not put it down. You don't read this book sequentially, but rather it is a book to leaf through, stopping where you find a word that interests you. With the format of a dictionary, Bierce sets up the look and feel of the official word, which is what we expect from a dictionary. Then, reading the definitions, you at first think, &quot;Bierce is being a wise guy.&quot; But after a few more definitions, you realize that Bierce is actually delivering a concise treatise on Western Culture by giving you a shot-by-shot commentary, using as his basis the essential element of any society -- its language. Birece may not have realized it when he wrote the book, but The Devil's Dictionary aligns with some 21st-century literary experimentations with concise presentation, irony, and non-linear exploration. Even reading it non-linearly, however, you soon find you've read every entry in the book. Then, of course, you'll want to start again...My favorites are the definitions pertaining to religion."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Beginning in 1881 and continuing to 1906, Ambrose Bierce created a series of sardonic word definitions of his own. Many of these were collected and published as The Cynic's Word Book, which he later protested was \\"a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve.\\" So in 1911, he pulled together a collection that was more to his own liking and called it The Devil's Dictionary. The entries are a tad uneven in quality, but most are amusing and some are great. Each reader will have his own favorites, some of mine are as follows : ACQUAINTANCE, n. A person whom we know well enough to borrow from, but not well enough to lend to. A degree of friendship called slight when its object is poor or obscure, and intimate when he is rich or famous. ALLIANCE, n. In international politics, the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each other's pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third. BIGOT, n. One who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not entertain. BORE, n. A person who talks when you wish him to listen. CONSULT, v.i. To seek another's disapproval of a course already decided on. CYNIC, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision. DICTIONARY, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work. DISCRIMINATE, v.i. To note the particulars in which one person or thing is, if possible, more objectionable than another. EDUCATION, n. That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding. FUTURE, n. That period of time in which our affairs prosper, our friends are true and our happiness is assured. HISTORY, n. An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools.... A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling... He has the last word in everything; his decision is unappealable. He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line. POLITICS, n. A strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles. The conduct of public affairs for private advantage. And, my choice for the very best among them : CONSERVATIVE, n. A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others. By all means, read it and pick out your own; you're sure to find a few that tickle your fancy. GRADE : A"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"'The Devil's Dictionary' is an interesting, very intellectually cynical collection of proposed definitions to words collected by Ambrose Gwinett Bierce, a journalist, writer, Civil War veteran, and general misanthrope, who disappeared without a trace in Mexico about 1914. In the words of H.L. Mencken, Bierce has produced 'some of the most gorgeous witticism of the English language.' Bierce delights in irreverence and poking fun at all aspects of life.Bierce's own definition of dictionary gives some insight into his general thought patterns:'Dictionary, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work.'This would lead us to conclude (most correctly) that Bierce is a world-class cynic. What is a cynic?'Cynic, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision.'Originally published under the title 'The Cynic's Word Book', most of the definitions in this book originally appeared as part newspaper columns. There have been many imitators, but this is the first and finest collection. Arranged as a dictionary, it provides an interesting writer's tool for finding a unique perspective on words and phrases. There are more than 1000 entries. A few examples include:'Outdo, v.t., To make an enemy.''Universalist, n. One who foregoes the advantage of a Hell for persons of another faith.'Fair warning -- those who do not like cynicism and scathing wit will find this book irritating, and sometimes offensive. Bierce is a product of his generation; political correctness wasn't in vogue then, and, even if it had been, Bierce would have been one of the sharpest critics.As a Christian priest, I take great delight in the insights from Bierce's criticism of religion in general, and Christianity in particular.'Christian, n. One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspired book admirably suited to the needs of his neighbor. One who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life of sin.'Why does this ring so true? Of course, there is the old adage that if you scratch a cynic, you'll find an idealist. Bierce would undoubtedly have described himself as a realist, but buried beneath many layers of cynicism, one can sense the idealism.Why did Bierce go to Mexico? Perhaps his underlying idealism led him to a country that was awash in revolutionary ideas; perhaps those ideas are what cost him his life. Perhaps he went underground? It is possible we will never know.The publisher of this volume, one of but many reprints of the text over time, says: 'The caustic aphorisms collected in \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" helped earn Ambrose Bierce the epithets Bitter Bierce, the Devil's Lexicographer, and the Wickedest Man in San Francisco. The words he shaped into verbal pitchforks a century ago--with or without the devil's help--can still draw blood today.'This book is very useful for generating ideas for writing and reflection. It is a good counterpoint to 'guides to positive thinking' kinds of material, and can serve as a tempering agent on such collections."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"I'd skip this and purchase the UNABRIDGED version. Some of the definitions left out in this version are among Bierce's best. Also, the complete work is not so long: no reason to abridge something that in full length is only 100 or so pages long."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Bierce's misanthropy and glorious cynicism remain a breath of fresh air, never having lost their ring of truth for the better part of a century. His aversion for hypocrisy, formal education (He was of humble origins and self-educated), and religious self-righteousness are appropriately barbed. His disillusionment with concepts such as patriotism (&quot;The first refuge of a scoundrel&quot;), are particularly interesting, considering his rural midwestern upbringing and heroic service in the Civil War. The most consistent and I think interesting theme throughout this volume is his disdain for the institution of marriage. Long before marriage was seen by many as a burden and divorce became unstigmatized and commonplace, Bierce's definition seems prophetic for his time: &quot;An institution consisting of a master, a mistress, and two slaves, making in all two.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"This edition doesn't obliterate all the merits of a literary classic, but it comes remarkably close.Do yourself and Ambrose Bierce a favor: purhcase a copy of The Devil's Dictionary put out by a reputable publisher instead. Whoever released this version didn't see fit to identify themselves, possibly for fear of crmininal proscecution. Defiling a literary masterpiece may not be a crime in the United States, but this release makes a good case for it becoming one.Overlooking the fact no biographical or editorial information was deemed necessary for inclusion, the thugs involved in this crime weren't even responsible enough to check the accuracy of the text. In one instance, the use of the word \\"is\\" for \\"if\\" is obvious enough for the reader to reconstruct Mr. Bierce's original intention, but in other cases, his words are so carelessly mangled, his meaning is beyond comphrehension.As written by Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dicionary is a uniquely wonderful reading experience. If I could rate this version with a negative number, I would gladly do so. As it is, one star will have to do. Avoid this at all costs."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Ambrose Bierce was a man of many distinctions - writer, journalist, humorist, and Civil War veteran. We all remember reading his classic story &quot;An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge&quot; in eighth grade English class. Bierce is best known for his ghoulish horror tales, which were on a par with Edgar Allan Poe, but his greatest work was The Devil's Dictionary. A scathing parody of Webster's dictionary, Bierce's volume was a showcase for his brilliant, caustic wit. This is Bierce at his best, mixing comedy with social commentary, unleashing his anarchistic convictions to the hilt! Bierce blasts away at God and country and all that is respected and proper. He defines patriot as &quot;the dupe of statesmen and the tool of conquerors&quot;, a Conservative as &quot;a statesman who is enamored of existing evils&quot; and a clergyman as &quot;a man who undertakes the management of our spiritual affairs as a method of bettering his temporal ones&quot; and so on. Nothing is sacred and no one is safe in this classic work of 19th century American literature which continues to attract just as much controversy and outrage today as it did when it was first published. A must read for all students of literature, dissenters, and fans of caustic humor!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"The book is wonderful if you are a cynic or would like to know how they think.

His use of English as both an artistic medium and a weapon is almost unrivaled, though British greats John Cleese and Douglas Adams often evoke some of his elegance and economy of wording. His writing style often may seem dated to modern readers, and sometimes the references completely pass us by, but the majority of the book is both timeless and of the choicest quality.&quot;Magpie - a bird whose thievish disposition suggested to someone that it might be taught to talk.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"This was first published in 1911.

Excellent quoting material and fun for a leaf through now and again, this book is a bargain for all its interior wealth."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Any reader,particularly of history by Ambrose Bierce,will greatly enjoy this book. Little wonder, Bierce (1842-1914),an American journalist,satirist -\\"it was said that a bad review from Bierce could break a writer's career;and writer of short stories who earned the nickname \\"Bitter Bierce\\" for his sardonic views and his vehemence as a critic\\".While the thoughts and definitions in this dictionary were written many years ago;they remain sharp,revelent and cuttingly satiric today.What I find so surprising is that these ideas have not become dated.While few,if any ,dictionaries lend themselves to reading or simply just spending time leafing through;this is certainly an exception.Just to give an idea of what awaits in this tome;try these for size;mausoleum- The final and funniest folly of the rich.martyr- One who moves along the line of least reluctance to adesired death.blackguard-A man whose qualities,prepared for display like a box ofberries in a market-the fine ones on top-have been openedon the wrong side.An inverted gentleman.amnesty-The state's magnanimity to those offenders whom it would betoo expensive to punish.grapeshot-An argumentwhich the future is preparing in answer tothe demands of American Socialism.And last but not least;nonsense- The objections that are urged against this excellentdictionary."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"A veteran of the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War who mysteriously disappeared during the 1910-20 Mexican Civil War, the caustically irreverent Bierce was the H. L. Mencken of the 19th century (or Mencken was the Bierce of the 20th century). His timeless and ego-deflating observations of Homo Sapiens reminds us that today's 21st century politics and pop culture were well-known to this 1842-born iconoclast. For instance, he defined a conservative as, \\"A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others\\" (1993 p.18). He defined a homeopathist as \\"The humorist of the medical profession\\" (p.51). He defined a clairvoyant as \\"A person, commonly a woman, who has the power of seeing that which is invisible to her patron-- namely, that he is a blockhead (p.16).

He was awarded the nicknames 'Bitter Bierce', 'the Devil's Lexographer', and 'the Wickedest Man in San Francisco'. It is a compilation of Bierce's favourite definitions from his magazine, the Sting. They remain cuttingly true today, although they were written at the end of the nineteenth century. For example:Monday, noun. In Christian countries, the day after the baseball game.Monkey, noun. An aboreal animal which makes itself at home in genealogical trees.The Devil's Dictionary is great not only as bathroom reading, but in helping one muddle through today's society. I only wish Bierce had written more.More, adjective. The comparative degree of too much."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"The Devil's Dictionary is the first book by Ambrose Bierce I've read and I think it's one of the most brilliant in American literature. It is timeless in a rare, hilarious way, yet chances are you have never heard of it unless you are an AmLit scholar working on satire or found it by chance like I did while prowling the web for free ebooks.Bierce took no prisoners; the book is both politically incorrect and timeless. This is not a contradiction in terms. It is as relevant now as it was a hundred years ago, and will remain relevant and funny for centuries to come, because human character doesn't change on such small time scales. By the standards Bierce sets to intelligent humor and satire, Mark Twain is a bumbling schoolboy and whoever spawned South Park is an aspiring amoeba.In a different country, The Devil's Dictionary would be taught in school and university, and the author would have streets and landmarks named after him. (I know, because I'm from such a country, and we have a Bierce equivalent who lived in the same period and is now considered a classic.) The reason why \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" is virtually unknown, ignored in the classroom, and excluded from the list of American classics is that the US is such a God-fearing country. There are two obstacles to this book being afforded its rightful place among the best in American lit: the devil in the title and the atheism of the author. (One can only guess what Bierce would have written after putting together the Biblical story of Jesus throwing the businessmen out of the temple and the decision to inscribe \\"In God We Trust\\" on American money, for example. Ambrose, we need you so badly!)"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"The Devil has nothing on Bierce, (except maybe a pretty good blackmail file with color photographs). Bierce plays with the English language and presents his cynical and humorous view of the world. Biting satire would be appropriate here if the use of an ordinary dictionary were permitted. With Bierce's included definition: \\"Satire, n. An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the authors enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness.\\" However, this book isn't obsolete, but becomes more evidently true as time goes on. An excellent list of definitions that insult everyone in general and everyone in particular. This book is a necessary tool to carry in your pocket and correct people's definitions at cocktail parties. You could tell people the definition of a Saint, 'n. A dead sinner revised and edited'. Someone should start a movement to canonize Bierce, since he qualifies for Sainthood by his own definition."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"This book is an absolute gem, and here is a wonderfully cheap edition, even allowing for conversion to non-USA currency. I like to go to sleep with a smile on my face, and this little tome was my bedtime reading for a while. Yes, I laughed my head off every night. Bierce's biting wit and skill with language are such a joy. His observations are as relevant now as when they were written, which was quite a long time ago. I particularly enjoyed his comments on religious and church matters. I have already given a copy to a friend who shares my love of language and wit.

Following the purchase of the 'Sorrow and the Pity' I had a lot of questions. I ran across 'The Devil Still Laughs', the third novel in this trilogy, and found it engrossing enough to purchase the first two and then reread the third a second time to better appreciate the conclusion of the story. If you have not read the three novels in the order in which they were written, the fabic of the story as the charicters weave in and out of Lea's life during the occupation cannot be fully appreciated. It is a French 'Gone with the Wind', and the plot line and character similarities are blatant--but none-the-less very enjoyable. At times sensual and humorous--the story is very dark, and the author is extremely successful at drawing the reader into the story. This is only a book that could have been written by a French author--anyone else would be called into question as anti-French. I know that there is some literary license on the part of the author in the characterizations, situations, and plot, but her detailed research is apparent. Real dates, actions and people are woven into the fabric of the narrative and it doesn't take much research to find out that Deforges' story is largely true, even if the primary characters are fictional.

Profoundly affecting."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"We, Christian School teachers, read this and found it very informational. Additionally, it was quite helpful as we learned things that were very helpful in growing and nurturing young leaders of the future."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"Brief SummaryThe major thrust of Spiritual Leadership is toward those appointed leadership responsibility within the church and the corporate sector. The content calls leaders to take seriously the role of leading people to God's agenda for churches, organizations and communities.Major FeaturesThe authors' stated ideology applies beyond a Pastoral or Missionary vocation (Blackaby, 2001, 14). The focus of illustrations, personal anecdotes and stories support this assertion favoring an audience of professional Clergy, those with organizational leadership responsibility and the non-professional Christian, intent to impact their marketplaces in partnership with God.Chapters 1-6 establish something of a theology of leadership to support the book's thesis \\"Spiritual Leadership is moving people on to God's agenda\\" (2001, 20). Chapters 7-10 offer practical advice regarding the role, work and challenges for those in leadership.Clinton's leadership emergence theory shapes chapter 3. A summary of major points and scriptures conclude each chapter so a careful reader can further explore and develop major concepts.The central thesis is intended to remind the reader that it is the responsibility of a spiritual leader to move people onto God's purposes. The conclusions offered are shaped by symbols, concepts and language indicative of the more conservative end of the evangelical spectrum.StrengthsThe theocentric focus is refreshing. Following God's revelation rather than generating and following anthropocentric vision is the vocation of a true leader (2001, 71).The discussion on statesmanlike vs popularist leadership (2001, 6) is helpful in an age where people are looking for leaders who lead with integrity.The content is supported by pertinent historic, contemporary and bible illustrations.WeaknessesThe following four examples illustrate what may be considered weakness. The first explores a concept of definition; the second identifies an area of confusion, the third canvasses an opportunity missed; the fourth raises a question of discernment.Example 1. Any definition that insists there are two different kinds of leadership (2001, 20) approximates dualism. Secular or non-Christian leaders are repeatedly referred to as unspiritual leaders (2001, 21, 43, 88-89). If biblical support for a premise is debatable, all definitions and conclusions also come under scrutiny.The bible says that all people are made in God's likeness and image (Gen 1:27). The account of the fall (Gen 3) states nothing to repudiate that. Romans 8:16 declares that God's Spirit testifies to our human spirit. Though separated from God, all human beings are still spiritual image bearers. Certainly, the incidence of sin introduces a flesh factor to deal with, a challenge for both the Christian (Gal 5:17) and those yet to discover the wonder of a Christ-centred life, but this doesn't make the secular or non-Christian leader an unspiritual leader. This argument is a challenge to all definitions and conclusions.Example 2. The authors recognise that \`secular' leadership authors advocate spiritual principles (2001, 11). History reveals that sensible responsible leaders, Christian or not, centre values and practices in those of the Kingdom of God (justice, mercy, kindness, compassion, forgiveness, love, etc) in a way that serves the common good, whether they are aware of it or not. The Holy Spirit leads people to God's agenda regardless of where the leader themselves stand. Consider King Cyrus of Persia. As a gentile, the Jews considered him pagan, devoid of God. Yet Cyrus is called the Lord's anointed (Isa 45:1) accomplishing all God placed before him (2 Chronicles 36:23, Ezra 1:2, Isaiah 44:28; 45:13).The authors state, \\"There are numerous biblical and secular examples of men and women whom God affirmed as genuine spiritual leaders\\" (2001, 93). This confuses previous statements that secular leaders are not spiritual leaders.These first two examples are challenged by the dualistic language and construct.Example 3. A qualifier in the following statement: \\"at times, embracing the status quo is the greatest enemy to advancing in Christian Maturity and it is the leaders task to keep people from becoming complacent\\" (2001, 18) fails to identify the not \\"at times\\" liminal spaces in people's lives.Transitioning, liminal or threshold experiences is part of the journey of life. Liminal space is where confusion, dislocation, disorientation and immobilisation are encountered. It may appear at that point a person is going nowhere, yet a deep and important work is happening within and around them. A liminal experience of some sort always precedes a new calling, vocation or ministry task (John 15:2b; Acts 9:30). Genesis 15:12 reveals Abram in a liminal fog immediately preceding God confirming the covenant.Stillness is part of a process of faith and discernment. The status quo statement is unbalanced and alienates a person who has been immobilised while working through the challenges of liminality. Failure to bring balance is a missed opportunity.Example 4. Speaking of Moses perseverance with the Israelites when they rebelled against God in the wilderness, the authors conclude \\"so true leaders stay with their people until they have successfully achieved God's purposes...to abandon followers because they refuse to follow is to forsake the sacred calling of a leader\\" (2001, 20). This is one of many sweeping, stereo-typing generalisms.Clinton identifies a perseverance principle (1988, 109), however, he also identifies a negative preparation for leaders to move them into a new setting (1988, 135). When a leader continually experiences intransigence, obstinacy or inflexibility within a leadership group or congregation a process of discernment needs to be entered to seek God's purposes.Jesus said there was a time to \\"brush the dust off your feet\\" in the face of opposition to moving people onto God's agenda (Mark 6:11). The generalization that a leader who walks away in the face of opposition \\"...forsake[s] the sacred calling of a leader\\" lacks a process of discernment.The are many similar generalizations, exclusive and alienating statements elsewhere in the text that caused this reader to become quite discombobulated and detached from much of the content.ConclusionThe theocentric focus and the sentiment intended by the general direction of the discussion are worthy of consideration. However as it stands, the use of exclusive language, the presence of sweeping generalizations and constructs that approximate dualism narrow accessibility to the pearls in the content for this reader."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"This is a great book that will open your eyes and move you towards God.

Free your soul."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"Having read several leadership books as an Air Force Officer and seminary student, I can honestly say that this is the best book on the subject I have ever read! Blackabay's fluent writing style is consistent with his other titles, notably \\"Experiencing God\\" and \\"The Power of the Call\\". At the very beginning Blackaby differentiates between worldly leadership and spiritual leadership.Throughout the book Blackaby describes his own leadership experiences and includes interesting stories of famous leaders (Truman, Reagan, Churchill, Thatcher, Napoleon, and Iacocca). As a minister, Blackaby also draws upon several examples from the Bible (Moses, Abraham, Joshua, David, Paul, etc.) and how they prospered and struggled in their God-called responsibilities.Particularly compelling were the descriptions of: the 3 types of worthy and misguided goals, how a leader influences, time wasters, pitfalls of leadership, having God's affirmation, God's ways are different from the world's ways, improving decision-making, taking time for rest, and relying on the Holy Spirit/prayer/God's Word/wise counsel to make and stick with hard decisions.Whenever I read a book I like to list on the inside front covers the page number and synopsis of a particularly interesting point or thought for easy reference. When I finished reading this gem the entire inside front cover was chock full of notes! Needless to say, this text will be referred to several times in the future.Everyone will greatly benefit from this book: the Christian believer will gain great encouragement to lead from a biblical viewpoint while the non-Christian will be encouraged to consider life from the Christian point-of-view. With the failures the world has recently seen in religious and secular leadership, Blackaby's text is a timely arrival. His book is a welcomed relief from the rah-rah-rah motivational hype of other \\"leadership\\" books.I recommend anyone in a leadership role (and everyone is a leader in some way) to buy the book, get a pen/pencil to take notes with, and learn how to become a better leader!!!!!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"I found this book very engaging and was able to read through it without multiple pickups. By this I mean, that I didn't put it down for a few weeks and then pick it up again. Instead, I read through it in about four days. Overall, the book was very good. The only area I would have liked to have seen greater depth was in the decision making process. This was one of the shorter chapters and I felt the authors could have gone a little deeper here.From a Christian perspective on leadership, this book would definitely be in my top five choices along with The Revolutionary Communicator, The Book on Leadership, Lead Like Jesus, and Christian Reflections on the Leadership Challenge. These other four are fine reads as well."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"I have been a secular (although I am a Christian) Business Consultant and Leadership Development Consultant for over 14 years and this is BY FAR the best I have yet read. This book has become required reading for ALL of my Leadership Workshops and I have given the books to many Business Leaders as a gift. The Blackaby's have delivered their message in a clear, easy to understand format and totaly absent of the &quot;Author Focus&quot;,(diverting the attention to the brilliance of the author rather than the importance of the message)often found in so many contemporary writings. They accurately discribe modern &quot;man made&quot; leadership ideologies and with equal accuracy point to the flaws and shortcommings of those leadership methods. Most all leaders are constantly wrestling with question &quot;why don't more people do what I would like them to do?&quot; and we are forever looking for new and more meaningfull methods by which to lead those entrusted into our care. Simply put, we always are reminded of the shortcommings of our leadership skills, otherwise, why would we be looking for a new book in the first place. The Backaby's challenge all leaders with this dilemna with a simple, yet brilliant question...&quot;What is it about YOUR leadership that makes others NOT WANT to follow you?&quot; Instead of chasing yet another brilliant theory or yet another brilliant method, the authors challenge US... what is at the center of our motivation and what, if anything, is our guidance system? Spiritual Leadership answers that question and brings to life an ideology that will render any future pursuit of a &quot;new way of looking at things&quot;, un-necessary. Above and beyond all (the point which literally changed the way I feel, think and teach)they clearly send the message that no matter how brilliant our leadership theories may be, how well read on the subject we all are, how articulate we may be on the subject of leadership and no matter how well intended our leadership efforts may be,if our leadership is not lead by the holy spirit and we as leaders don't ask for his guidance in our roles as leaders...we simply will fall short of where we could be. If a Leader is in fact dedicated to being the absolute most EFFECTIVE leader that he / she would like to be, then this book is an absolute &quot;must read&quot; whether you're a believer or not."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"This work by Richard and Henry Blackaby is the absolute best book on leadership I have read. Having recently graduated with a doctorate in evangelism and church growth, and possessing a passion for reading pastoral material, I have read numerous books on leadership. All of them pale in comparison to this volume.The authors focus upon a leader's relationship with God as the key to effective leadership. From this relationship flow a leader's vision, goals, influence, and decision-making. All of the basic leadership principles are covered in this book, but they are addressed from the perspective of one's relationship with God. This perspective is what makes this work so unique and so valuable.I strongly recommend this book to all pastors, church leaders and even to Christian leaders in secular organizations as a &quot;must read.&quot; Before reading the volumes of material available from Maxwell, Schaller and other noted leadership authors, try this one! It will transform the way you view leadership as a Christian."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"Having recently graduated from a Theological institute with a degree in Leadership, I have come quite well read in the area of Christian/Spiritual Leadership. Richard and Henry Blackaby handle this topic in a fashion unlike any other author. They focus the Christian leader's attention on their own personal life, causing the reader to reflect on their life and their relationship to Christ - and that's where Spiritual leadership begins. In a field inundated with discussion on &quot;Visionary Leadership&quot; the Blackabys remind us of the &quot;vision-giver&quot;. We, as Christian leaders &quot;do not sell visions, we share revelations.&quot; I would recommend this work to anyone [CEO to pastor, father to deacon] seeking to better their leadership abilities in the Christian arena."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"I am a big fan of Blackabys Experiencing God and was looking forward to reading his book on Spiritual Leadership. It was not what I expected. It is an excellent book on leadership, but it is more of a primer novice for leaders than a book for experienced leaders who want to sharpen their leadership skills and character.But as a primer, it is excellent. Blackaby leads the reader though a list of topics to equip pastors to be spiritual leaders. It runs the gauntlet from The Leaders Challenge to The Leader's Pitfalls and just about everything in between. Like Experiencing God, the Blackabys intersperse their personal experiences with Spiritual Leadership as application.What makes this book unique is Blackabys emphasis on the spiritual part of leadership. They reject the influence of business models of leadership, specially Collins and Porras advice in Built to Last (BEHAGs - Big Hairy Audacious Goals) and urge the reader to recognize the work of God in the world and to join God in his work.The authors discussion on vision gives the reader an example of how the Blackabys view spiritual leadership. They criticize leaders who try to get people to buy into their vision. Spiritual leaders should not sell vision, they say; rather, they share what God has revealed to them and trust that the Holy Spirit will confirm that same vision in the hearts of their people. So the job of the leader is to bring the people face to face with God so they can hear from God directly and not through the leader. The Blackabys, however, fail to adequately inform the pastor how to do this. The obvious consequence of this kind of vision casting is that pastors with weak leadership skills would observe where God is at work, ineffectively communicate that vision to their congregations, meet internal resistance, and then conclude that this must not be where God is leading them.For instance, the Blackabys are Baptist. The averaged Baptist pastor stays in his church for only about 2.5 years. There is a reason for this. Although most Baptist churches are board led, they are for all intents and purposes congregational in their polity. Thus, in many churches, even the most inane proposal must be but through a relentless series of committees and votes. This kind of governance does not tolerate strong leadership very well. If the pastor has a vision from God, he must communicate that vision and trust that the Holy Spirit will confirm it in the hearts of a committee system. This assumes that everyone on all those board and committees is listening to God and is seeking God. In reality, the pastor gets something else; he gets an agenda that is set by the least spiritual, most obstinate member of the congregation.There is an ethereal quality about leadership that many good leaders do not understand. They have it and they assume that the rest of us, if we just do what they do, will have it. But leadership is much more difficult than this. In this regard, John Maxwell, Oswald Sanders and Bill Hull do a much better job equipping pastors to be leaders. It is a good book, but my fear is that weak, timid leaders will use it as an excuse to do nothing."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"The book differentiates between worldly leadership and spiritual leadership, the leader's relationship with God being the key to his/her ability to lead effectively and appropriately. The author's move through eleven chapters each focusing on one key aspect of the leader's life, from The Leaders Challenge (chapter 1), to The Leaders Character (chapter 5), to The Leaders Pitfalls (chapter 11).List strengths of book.I found the emphasis on the spiritual aspect of leadership to be very refreshing, not to mention accurate! The book is rooted in biblical principles and is focused on helping the leader to make godly decisions in all that he does. The definition of leadership was also very refreshing: \\"Spiritual Leadership is moving people on to God's agenda\\" (p. 20). I liked the parallel with Robert Clinton's book on \\"The Making of a Leader\\" concerning how God develops leaders. I also found the \\"Concepts and Scriptures for Consideration\\" at the end of each chapter to be very helpful.List weaknesses of book.I found very little to consider as a weakness of this book. The only issue might be that at times it was not always practical. There are times when the authors will share how something needs to be in the life of the leader without following up with clear practical ways/steps to accomplish the desired issue. However, I did not find this to be the case very often in the book."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"I found this book very thought provoking. It is a must read for all leaders who aspire to be led by God and his agenda in all aspects of life. It exposes the baggage that comes with human motivation rather than motivation led by the Holy Spirit. A must read for all church leaders!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"The Blackablys have done a thorough job in researching and summarizing today's secular leadership teaching then contrasting it with spiritual leadership. They point out that many of the principles of secular leadership are of value but the underlying principle of spiritual leadership that differs from secular leadership is that we are to seek God's agenda and not our own. To make their point, early in the book they discuss Jesus as the model for spiritual leadership. Jesus, the very Son of God, did not seek His own agenda, but rather spent hours in prayer to align himself with God's agenda.The Blackabys also do a great job teaching that spritual leadership is not just for leaders in the church. Spiritual leadership is also required of Christians that are in secular leadership roles. They give us many examples of US Presidents as well as military and corporate leaders that have aligned themselves to God's agenda and have been effective.We are living in a world that is growing in complexity and the demands on leadership are ever increasing. The Blackabys have shown what an advantage spiritual leaders have in being able to align ourselves to the agenda of a wise and loving God rather than attempting to create our own agenda."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"I can't imagine a harder job than writing a new book on leadership - there are millions and most are pretty stale. But Blackaby's book is different and there is a very simple reason. Instead of 21 of this or 10 of that, this book walks through biblical principles that lead to spirit-led leadership.My favorite section is Blackaby's talk on how a leader can hear from God and then share new vision. It has changed how I view vision-casting from a biblical basis.A must read for leaders looking to model biblical principles."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"I bought this book for a class and I still own the book.

She is a teacher when her students learn. Likewise, neither credentials, skills, position, nor good intentions make a leader. A leader is a leader only when his followers follow. Furthermore, for a spiritual leader, getting people to follow you is not the goal--leading them to take up God's agenda and effectively do God's work is. Thanks to Father and Son Blackaby for this tremendously insightful book which has shaped my thinking as a pastor and spiritual leader."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"Great book. Easy to read.Very insightful.A must read for people in leadership roles or pursuing leadership."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"From the beginning of the book it is clear that leadership can be exercised in \\"the church\\" as well as outside it, as Spirit-led leaders respond within the body as well as their homes and workplaces. Chapter 1 helps the reader recognize that saying you're a leader doesn't make it so. It also helps the reader recognize that worldly wisdom in regards to leadership does not match or come close to making up for a failure to follow God's voice and character. Further chapters will further erode the idea that all the business-leadership buzzwords and techniques can be harmlessly transferred as-is, even common concepts like goals and vision statements.Chapter 2 is built around helping the reader recognize that spiritual leadership is, \\"moving people on to God's agenda.\\" Using Jesus as the example, we read that leadership is not found through his methods, but through his obedience to his Father's will. Chapter 3 follows this and helps the reader grasp what makes a leader - the experience, character, calling by God that help identify a leader and prepare them for leading.Chapter 4 is probably the hardest to read for someone steeped in corporate leadership principles. Spiritual leadership is not about large goals, huge motivation. It is about communicating what God has shared as the direction for an organization - Christian or otherwise. So leaders must learn how to communicate vision effectively - but remember that they are not the source of vision, God is.Chapter 5 discusses both improper (though common) and proper sources of influence. It is filled with a number of readable examples of believers and businessmen who moved their organizations forward because they recognized where influence should come from.Chapter 6 discusses goals. The goals usually suggested for the church are weak compared to the goals God desires. Not only weak, but often misguided. God didn't ask for bigger, faster and more -change for the sake of newness. God doesn't expect perfection or \\"excellence\\" - he desires our best effort, which is not quite the same thing. God certainly isn't about numbers, as if the count at worship is what pleases God. God IS interested in spiritual maturity in the body. God does desire that leaders raise up new leaders. And he does desire that his people bring him glory. These are all worthwhile goals, as laid out in this chapter.While Chapter 5 focused on the sources of influence, Chapter 7 discusses how leaders use influence. One of the most overlooked uses is prayer - for people, for the organization. Leaders then work, leading by example. They communicate, and finally serve - following the example of Jesus who was a servant. Being a servant is not a rejection of leadership, nor do followers misunderstand when leaders serve their followers correctly. Jesus served the disciples, even becoming a servant to them by washing their feet. Not one of the disciples was misguided enough to think that they were now somehow elevated above their master.Chapter 8 looks at decision-making, both the good and bad. Some leaders are quick to make decisions, while some are reticent to make them at all. Both are an abdication of the leader's true role. Wisdom and faithfulness require a leader to use every bit of truth available to them to make decisions, even when it is difficult; and spiritual leadership includes sticking with decisions based on God's revealed will. It makes no sense to be tossed about, confusing the organization, when we already are clear in God's direction.Chapter 9 deals with scheduling. This involves delegation - not taking all the work on oneself. In light of the priesthood of all believers, this is always a timely message. The Blackaby's are clear that scheduling is a boon to the wise leader, helping them to be more effective with their limited time resources. But they do not suggest a slavish attention to the schedule. People's interjections may not always necessitate breaking a schedule, but God always has the right to interrupt. Recognizing when an interruption is a distraction, and when it is God breaking into view, is the job of a good spiritual leader.Chapter 10 helps leaders grasp the significance of sin in their lives. No leader is immune from its consequences, so every leader must be vigilant. Pride, a sense of not being susceptible, is one dangerous way to ruin effective leadership. Sexual sin is especially damaging based on its inter-personal and highlighted character. Leaders must surround themselves with other believers who can be honest and direct with them. The unfortunate fact is that many leaders at some point are disqualified by activities that could have easily been avoided. The book closes in Chapter 11 with the rewards of leadership - satisfaction in completing God's calling for our lives and satisfaction in the commendation of God himself. This provides the right response in light of the risks and possible pitfalls presented in the previous chapter.Overall, this is a wonderful book. It is not an easy read. As you read, you will likely identify both good and bad examples with leaders you have had connection with in your past. Hopefully, you will be introspective enough to see how you have failed, and maybe even succeeded at times, to follow God and move people on to his agenda.Even if you are leader in the corporate world, you will find that God wants to use you as he has gifted you. Spiritual leadership is not confined to the Church. Spiritual leadership can be exercised by anyone God calls to move people onto his way of thinking. It is about submission, not skills. As well, even if leading is the farthest thing from your mind and background, it should provide some bit of help in understanding the incredible burden leaders often feel. The struggle to be faithful, to avoid living to meet people's expectations; the struggle to point others to God's way of doing things when it is uncomfortable and even unpopular.This is a worthwhile read for every leader, refocusing the leader on God as true leader, the real king."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"This is a great book on true leadership born of sound biblical doctrine.

Blackaby and Blackaby, in \\"Spiritual Leadership\\" recognize the practical wisdom contained in such books, yet seek to ground their arguments in the foundational concepts of service to Christ and fervent prayer.Indeed, prayer and submission to God are the central elements around with the rest of the book turns. The authors argue that \\"creating a vision\\" and reliance upon human wisdom are foreign concepts Biblical teachings on leadership. They argue that man does not determine his own paths, but rather God prepares activities for his servants, works through them to accomplish these tasks, and then follows up to produce the success (defined by God himself) of the endeavor. To determine what this pre-determined activity is, Blackaby and Blackaby argue that prayer is essential.The message is simple--seek God's will in strengthening your faith, in your major life decisions, and even in your day-to-day activities through prayer, then (once God's will is determined) humble yourself and faithfully carry out that will. Yet, the message is not simplistic. The authors present the concept thoroughly, addressing growing prayer life and leadership style; showing what spiritual leadership is and is not; addressing short-term issues and long-term ones; showing how this style of leadership plays out in a variety of settings; and providing pastoral encouragement. Although the simple message is consistent, the book never becomes repetitive or boring; rather the prose is fresh and stimulating throughout.Now, I must admit skepticism based on certain doctrinal and practical principles. On the doctrinal side, I confess my belief that God communicates and communes with man through means--Scripture and Sacraments. On the practical side, I fear that people will simply imagine that God is \\"telling\\" them what they want to hear anyway--that is, that people will ascribe to God their man-centered ideas.Although I still believe both hold water, I decided to follow Blackaby and Blackaby's advice and pray more fervently in the way they recommend to see if any change comes about. Indeed it had. Consistently praying (both prayers common to the church like the Lord's Prayer, Luther's Morning Prayer, and the weekly collects as well as idiosyncratic prayers), I found that my perceived connection to God strengthened, stress reduced, major decisions made with a strong sense of peace as I acknowledged God's direction, and even new, exciting opportunities presented.While I would have liked to see this book focus a little more on holistic spirituality (e.g. the role of worship, daily Bible reading, Sacraments, etc) in the thorough way they presented holistic leadership, the fact remains that \\"Spiritual Leadership\\" is a positive, paradigm-changing book. This is true on the intellectual level (faithful servant versus rugged individual paradigms) and the spirituality level (my spirituality has deepened as a result of following the advice of the book).How the arguments of \\"Spiritual Leadership\\" will play out in my life beyond the month trial or how my opinion of the book will shift as I increase in my understanding of prayer remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the command of our Lord to pray fervently remains, and Blackaby and Blackaby do a great service in showing how this command can be practically lived in a variety of situations."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"Excelent book. Every leader should read this book. Many good examples of leadership, including President Truman."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"Drawing from examples of leaders in the Bible, leadership theories, testimonies of ministry and secular leaders, and their own experiences, Henry and Richard Blackaby present a refreshingly helpful and insightful resource on leadership in their book, Spiritual Leadership. Recognizing that Christian leadership today sounds more and more secular than Christian, the Blackabys call on Christians in leadership roles, both inside and outside of the church, to \\"seek to lead God's way\\" (17). They define this type of spiritual leadership as \\"moving people on to God's agenda\\" (20).Three main aspects of Spiritual Leadership set it apart from other leadership books and make it highly commendable...First, it is intended for a broad audience. It is written in a way to be just as helpful for Christian CEOs and other business people as it is for pastors and ministry leaders. In fact, the authors state that they intend this work to be for all Christians who want to make a difference (14).Second, and most significant, Spiritual Leadership is theocentric in its approach, not anthropocentric. This book is not a do-it-yourself guide to leadership nor is it a self-help book. Instead, it is a refreshing focus on God in the vast sea of \\"Christian\\" leadership books today. From the outset, issues such as goals and influence are all presented in terms of God's will. For example, influence is defined as moving people from where they are to where God wants them to be (20). Even popular leadership concepts are reframed in order to present the issue from God's perspective, such as noting how time management really is personal management in order to stay on God's agenda (200). All throughout the pages of this book the Blackabys paint the picture of leadership in terms of God's plans. It is not about advancing one's personal goals. Rather, it is about obeying God and moving people to be in line with His will. The authors conclude that since \\"God is on mission,\\" the task of leaders is to join Him in that mission and bring people along to join that mission (70). In light of this reality, leaders are urged to make decisions with the reminder that they will give an account before God. The authors remind the readers that the goal is bringing God glory while the reward is finding joy in knowing that they pleased God. In being God focused, this book also recognizes that leaders can accomplish nothing without God. Instead of providing a checklist to be used to achieve goals, the Blackabys encourage leaders to depend on the Lord. In fact, from the outset they state that God calls leaders to do things that only He can do; thus, spiritual leaders must depend on the Holy Spirit (21). Such dependence on the Lord requires a leader to have a vibrant prayer life as well as seek guidance in the Word, from other believers, and even from looking at how God is moving in the circumstances of life. While the repeated stress on dependence and prayer may cause the reader to think \\"I've heard all of these things ten times already!,\\" such an emphasis prevents the reader from missing the most important theme of the book as well as challenges him or her to remember Jesus' words that are so counter-cultural in the leadership world today: \\"Apart from me you can do nothing\\" (John 15:5).Third, Spiritual Leadership focuses more on being than on doing. Instead of offering a program to implement, a check-list to do, or an attitude to embrace, this book challenges leaders to be faithful to God. As in the other themes, the Blackabys are straightforward in this assertion, as seen when they say within the first several chapters that \\"leadership is more about \`being' than about \`doing'\\" (31). The Blackabys believe that being holy and faithful and modeling obedience to God's will are necessary since leaders cannot take their followers deeper than where they themselves are. As such, spiritual leaders must spend much time in the \\"conscious presence of God\\" (170). By abiding in Him, spiritual leaders can then encourage their followers to grow in their relationship with God. In addition, such abiding is shown to be necessary since spiritual leadership comes through revelation, not from vision. As leaders and followers seek God, they will be able to join together in accomplishing the work to which He calls them.All of these themes are repeated throughout the book. By stating them directly in the introductory chapters and repeating them throughout, it is hard to imagine how any reader could miss this counter-cultural, yet solidly biblical, approach toward leadership. By the time readers turn the last page, they can easily articulate the thesis that spiritual leadership is moving people on to God's agenda. They can articulate the reality that leadership is about pleasing God. They understand that such leadership requires abiding with God more than doing certain tasks. Most of all, they recognize that such spiritual leadership, while hard work, is a high calling and a \\"God-given privilege\\" (236). Whether you find yourself in a leadership role in the church, in business, in education, or even in your home, the timeless, Biblical principles articulated by Richard and Henry Blackaby will motive you to discern God's will, be faithful to follow the path He has set before you, and do everything you can to bring others along on the exciting adventure of knowing and following God."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"Henry Blackaby is the epitome of a lifelong learner and leader. He has extensive experience in pastoral ministry and is a consultant to CEOs and various Christian organizations, such as the Southern Baptist Convention. He has written various books, is a sought out speaker, and currently leads Henry Blackaby Ministries. Richard Blackaby, the son of Henry Blackaby, is also a writer and a sought out speaker. In addition, he has pastoral experience and is currently serving as the president of the Canadian Southern Baptist Seminary in Cochrane, Canada. Consequently, what stands out clearly is that both have strong ties to the Southern Baptist denomination.The thesis of this book is that spiritual leadership is all about moving people from where they are to where God wants them to be.There are differences between general and spiritual leadership principles, but the authors state that those who will lead according to spiritual principles will be far more effective in their leadership (14). Tied to that statement is the belief that God is the one who calls and equips individuals to be spiritual leaders (46). Throughout this book, the authors present nuggets of wisdom that have been gleaned from their own leadership experience and that of others. As a result, this book almost seems like a compilation of essays exploring a variety of leadership issues. Generally though, the book begins by exploring why leadership is needed, the difference between general and spiritual leadership, and how leaders are developed. After covering those introductory issues, the authors continue to explore a variety of issues that leaders need to be aware of, such as: vision, character, goals, influence, decision making, scheduling, pitfalls, and rewards. What holds this book together is the common thread that true leadership originates from God, points people towards God, and reflects the heart and action of God.The pragmatic focus of this book is a strong point. The authors do not discuss leadership theory, but they share from their leadership experiences. As a result, this book definitely contains years of experience and nuggets of wisdom that every leader can learn from - secular or spiritual, and young or seasoned. For example, the direct correlation between effective leadership and authentic character is true for both Christians and non-Christians (53). Character development is a leadership issue, not only a faith issue.Although secular leaders can still learn from this book, the authors are unapologetically writing for Christian leaders. They suggest that leaders not seek promotions, but God, since God is the one who ultimately grants the promotions. This only makes sense when one acknowledges the existence of God and understands the Gospel. I agree with the authors that Christians need to seek God and that he is the one who ultimately grants leadership positions to individuals, but in our North American culture, I believe that it is okay to pursue leadership positions and advancement as long as one understands that God is ultimately in control.It is so encouraging to hear that \\"the best thing leaders can do for their organization is to grow personally\\" (31). As a result, I need to constantly grow as a leader. One way that I am currently working on continually learning is by being part of a team that is creating a leadership pathway at my church. We have been developing the leadership pathway for adults, but after reading this book, I now have to go back to the team and talk about how we can incorporate teenagers into this pathway (32). Consequently, although this book does not outline an explicit pathway for leaders, it is filled with nuggets of wisdom that can be applied to many, if not all, leadership contexts.I give this book a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"Spiritual Leadership: Moving People on to God's Agenda","review":"Excellent book and very practical.

This approach makes this an excellent resource for leadership training, small group applications, or for personal application.

A John & Mary Bolt Mystery","review":"Way out in west Texas, someone's setting fires around the dusty little town of Paloma Blanca and the sprawling Little River Ranch. Despite their frequency, the events are seemingly unconnected. That's why John Bolt, indepedent arson investigator, is dispatched by the rancher's insurance company. Again we are engrossed by Bingham's knowledge of the subject as well as her engaging narrative style. There's the elderly deputy who's more alert than he looks. A plain-jane wife and an alluring widow. A young foreman with an agenda. An unemployed volunteer firefighter. And a ranch for at-risk girls that seems to catch the blame for everything.In this novel, we only hear from Mary Bolt by phone. In Kansas City directing a Deaf Theater production, she offers her observations and analysis during their evening calls. We follow along as loose ends continue to dangle and more buildings burn.I understand there are two more Bolt mysteries yet to reach print. What say we light a fire under the publisher?"},{"Title":"Poison Darts: Protecting the Biodiversity of Our World","review":"This is a two-volume book about a hypothetical contraceptive, the \\"Take It and Forget It Contraceptive\\" (TIFIC) which Russ Finley believes is just what the world needs in order to stem its population and prevent the loss of biodiversity.Here's how a hypothetical TIFIC might work: a vaccine is made that \\"creates antibodies that deactivate sperm cells by interfering\\" with \\"the operation of their little tails.\\" (Vol. I, p. 20) This works for both men and women. Fertility would be restored by having both prospective parents take a daily antidote pill until conception is achieved. Finley's idea is that nearly everybody would want to have the vaccination so that they wouldn't have to worry about unwanted pregnancies--the \\"take it and forget it\\" aspect.In Volume I Finley writes a novel in which a rain forest frog and its tadpole supply the contraceptive and its antidote. The problem with the novel is that it lacks tension and is rather flat emotionally. The characters and the story are primarily vehicles for the dissemination of Finley's ideas. However, Volume Two, which is a collection of Finley's writings on overpopulation and allied concerns, contains some of the best writing on this subject that I have ever read.Finley's main point, and one that few in the environmental debate seem to get, is that we are NOT going to save the biodiversity of the planet by good intentions or any combination thereof, simply because human nature is such that we will always look out for our own welfare first while the welfare of other beings, especially if they are distant, will be of secondary importance. I once asked a student of mine who wanted to have half a dozen children, if she would be willing to forgo having one of them to save the tigers. She said no.At least she was honest. Most people would not even give up the convenience of their SUV for the tigers (if such a thing were possible). Indeed, another one of Finley's points is that \\"There is no mechanism to shift resources\\" from those who have them in the US to those in, say, Africa, who do not. He believes that the profit motive and status-seeking behaviors of humans override \\"most ideologies that do not have those drives as part of them.\\" (Vol II, p. 16)Note well that Finley wants our population to stop growing immediately because the more people there are, the more they will expand and bring about the extinction of other forms of life. Indeed, Finley believes we already have too many people on this planet. I agree with him and his assertion that both Malthus and Paul Ehrlich will ultimately be proven right, and that sophists like the late Julian Simon will be proven wrong.Here are some examples of Finley's insight and his considerable expertise (page numbers are from Volume II):\\"...[O]verpopulation has always been a local problem...When the people of Easter Island were starving to death, the planet was far from overpopulated. The archaeological record is rife with example of populations that have crashed because of overpopulation...\\" (p. 24)\\"I prefer a definition that says you have overpopulation whenever you have people living at the subsistence level. If you assume that people who live on less than $2 a day are at the subsistence level, then roughly half of the people in the world are living in overpopulated boundaries.\\" (p. 53)\\"Once a Chinese peasant can afford a scooter, he will obtain one, and when he can afford an SUV, he will obtain one of those too. The instinctive urge to continuously seek higher status does not satiate itself.\\" (p. 56)\\"The economic systems available to us fall into a spectrum. At one end, you will find unbridled capitalism and the use of slaves...As you move toward the middle, you will find regulated free markets. This is capitalism with rules in place to limit how badly people with power can abuse those who are making them rich.\\" (p. 76)\\"Attempts to reduce CO2 levels are treating the symptoms of what ails our planet, not the cause. The cause is overpopulation--the needs, and the desires of billions of people...Giving aspirin to reduce the discomfort of a fever--global warming--is not as effective as prescribing an antibiotic--the TIFIC--that would reduce the number of agents that caused the fever--us.\\" (p. 92)\\"...[T]he people in China and India have an average ecological footprint that is many times lower than yours or mine...[Yet] China's and India's destroyed ecosystems are the perfect experiments showing that lowering one's ecological footprint all the way down to that of a rice eating peasant will not save the planet.\\" (pp. 113-114)Finally, let me quote from the Prologue to Volume I: \\"...[How] do you allow people to satiate their status-seeking urges (which are closely related to sexual urges) without allowing them to advertise their prowess with trophies--books, published papers, houses, remodels, or cars? The answer is revealing--you can't. Tell people that they must stop having sex and seeking status is no different than telling them that they must stop walking upright. You couldn't call yourself a normal healthy human if you stopped doing all of those things. You cannot change human nature.\\" (p. iv)This work would be more effective if Finley would publish the second volume (with the prologue to Volume I) separately. It would also help if he would hire a professional editor. His writing is incisive and persuasive, and what he says needs to be heard. His refutation of Julian Simon was especially instructive. His metaphor that frogs are the canaries in the coal mine that is our planet (and that frogs can save us) is well taken and alarming. Ask yourself, when was the last time you saw a frog?"},{"Title":"Poison Darts: Protecting the Biodiversity of Our World","review":"For those of you who haven't read Bjorn Lomborg's writings, the title of my review is a (sarcastic) play on the Danish statistician's controversial book, \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist,\\" a title which really should be renamed, \\"The Lies of a Former Environmentalist Gone Over to the Dark Side.\\" In contrast to Lomborg's Panglossian view that the state of the Earth's biodiversity (and everything else, for that matter) is wonderful and getting better all the time (his statistics \\"prove\\" it!), Russ Finley starts right away from the obvious premise that Lomborg is terribly wrong, and that, unfortunately, the Earth's ecosystems are dying fast.Unlike many other environmentalists, Finley doesn't waste his time -- or the reader's -- dreaming of a world in which human nature miraculously changes, turning everyone into nature-loving, tree-hugging, bike-riding, commune-living, hemp-wearing, granola-eating, self-sacrificing angels. Instead, Finley simply accepts human nature, warts and all, as a given and proceeds from there with his thoughts on \\"attacking the problem [of massive biodiversity loss and environmental devastation] by channeling human desires.\\"Finley's refreshing, clear-eyed view of human nature allows him -- unlike many other environmentalists -- to get right to the heart of the matter: there are far, FAR too many humans on the planet, and as long as that's the case biodiversity is doomed. The only question, then, is what to do about this situation. Edward O. Wilson, one of the world's greatest living scientists author of twenty books (including The Future of Life, The Ants, On Human Nature, Sociobiology, and Consilience), winner of two Pulitzer prizes plus dozens of science prizes, and a man known as \\"the father of biodiversity,\\" has stated that we currently find ourselves in a \\"bottleneck of overpopulation and wasteful consumption.\\" Wilson further believes that we are in a race between \\"technoscientific forces that are destroying the living environment\\" and \\"those that can be harnessed to save it.\\" Essentially, that's where Russ Finley takes the baton and runs with it.So, what does Finley suggest? First, and most importantly, that we develop and distribute a \\"take it and forget it\\" contraceptive (\\"TIFIC\\") as soon as possible, in order to reset the default human reproductive setting to \\"off\\" (don't worry, it can be turned back on again with another pill), thereby slashing unplanned pregnancies to a bare minimum and reversing human population growth before it's too late. Second, and nearly as importantly, Finley suggests that we forcefully and creatively defend the remaining islands of biodiversity for as long as it takes until absolute human population levels decline substantially (perhaps to 1-2 billion?). Third, Finley argues that we should harness human nature -- competitiveness, greed, acquisitiveness, status-seeking, sexual desire, religious belief, technological prowess, whatever it takes -- in SERVICE of the biodiversity protection effort, not at ODDS with it. This, in and of itself, is a strikingly different, far more powerful and effective approach than most environmentalists have employed in the past. Unlike most of those other approaches, Finley's ideas actually have a chance of working, albeit just in the nick of time to save the bulk of the world from a final, great mass extinction, possibly taking humanity down with it in the process.As a book, \\"Poison Darts\\" is organized into two main volumes, the first being a rollicking, enjoyable, swashbuckling adventure story about a fictional \\"think tank\\" (of brilliant oddballs and other assorted characters) which sets about to save -- and goes a long way towards doing so -- the planet's biodiversity. Volume 2 is a series of thought-provoking essays on overpopulation, human nature, and \\"Environmentalism - American Style.\\" Finley is clearly an engineer in the best sense of the word, with his rigorous, logical mind taking apart the system, diagnosing exactly what the problem with it is, and figuring out a solution - or at least a temporary patch.Fortunately, and unlike many engineers, Finley doesn't just throw facts, figures, and techie solutions at the reader. Instead, Finley's brings to the table a good deal of writing ability (although a more rigorous professional editing job would be helpful to work out a few kinks), with an excellent feel for politics, science, economics, and human psychology/society. In addition, Finley turns out to be a fine storyteller; I read the fictional Volume I in just a few hours and could hardly put it down.Like the rest of the book, Volume II is refreshing, honest, reasonable, even courageous in its willingness to tell it like it is and to take on powerful forces of intolerance and ignorance, including certain well-known religious movements and institutions. Finley explains his ideas clearly, in a straightforward, passionate, at-times humorous manner ((sly references to Frank Herbet's \\"Dune,\\" for instance), and has an outstanding ability to boil complex topics down in a way that is helpful but never patronizing. This is a very useful combination of abilities - deep technical/scientific knowledge plus strong communications skills -- that few authors possess.All in all, I would say that \\"Poison Darts\\" is an enjoyable, edifying, important book that should be read by everyone who cares about \\"protecting the biodiversity of our world.\\" I strongly recommend it, and look forward to joining the (fictional) \\"Ecosystem Protection International\\" organization sometime soon!"},{"Title":"Poison Darts: Protecting the Biodiversity of Our World","review":"If professional editing is indeed what this book needs to ensure that its message is heard, as some of the reveiwers seem to think, then let us hope a professional editor who cares contacts Russell soon.As a relatively undemanding reader with a quest to know more, I simply found it easy to read, funny and refreshingly down to earth, realistic and human. I was looking for solutions rather than problems, and solutions that recognised that what drives most adult humans, for better and worse, is greed.I am someone who has happened rather belatedly upon a concern for the environment, and the critical importance of maintaining bio-diversity, due to finding out about Peak Oil. Having grasped the implications of resource depletion, I immediately fell into a doomsday depression, coupled with a burning desire to impress upon everyone the urgent need to restrain their consumption and live a simple life. Not long after that, I realised the futility of \\"rioting for austerity\\". I therefore decided to be optimistic, and place my faith in human ingenuity, like my father's hero Paul Simon, despite mounting evidence that the Ehrlichs were right in all but timing.One of the many encouraging points that Russell makes in this book is that both Simon and the Ehrlichs were right, and what is more, Simon's point about the potential of human ingenuity to overcome problems means that one plank of Russell's solution - creating well protected reserves of bio-diversity - simply gives humans the opportunity to demonstrate that ingenuity sooner rather than later. (Unfortunately, just to prove how urgent the message is, since publishing the book, the agreement to develop ANWAR has gone ahead - enough oil to last the US 200 days in exchange for an arctic wilderness of inestimable value to future generations. Go figure).As a former marketing professional, I can quite see how the other plank of his solution - the Take It and Forget It contraceptive (with antidote), for men or women, is a winner - and worthy of investment in research.When I understood that the likely investment to bring this contraceptive to reality (it is already a partial reality for animals), coupled with the costs of preserving 70% of the world's current biodiversity, is less than the cost of a few days war in IRAQ, I wished I was Bill Gates."},{"Title":"Poison Darts: Protecting the Biodiversity of Our World","review":"Humans are a very successful species. They are so successful that they have circumvented evolution and ecology to a point where significant selection pressures applied to the human population have been nearly severed. With the simple act of passing along DNA, the human population has exploded to an unprecedented level. Over the past several thousands years of human existence on the planet earth, several major technological events occurred that have bumped up the carrying capacity of the population.For thousands of years, humans were supposedly hunters and gatherers - but, if the truth were known, they were probably more like gatherers and scavengers, since some recent evidence has debunked the image of the \\"mighty human hunter.\\" At any rate, this lifestyle can only provide support for a limited number of people - and as a result, the human population remained low for thousands of years.Agriculture was invented around 8 to 9 thousand years ago, no fewer than 10 times by various cultures. Along with this paradigm shift in food management, came stabilized living areas (as opposed to a nomadic existence) and the domestication of animals. The invention of agriculture bumped the carrying capacity significantly - a population increase began.With the stabilization of humans came cities, industrialization, and manufacturing of goods - first with simple metals, initiating historical periods, like the Bronze and Iron Ages, to the Industrial Revolution, that allowed the population to grow even more.The Industrial Revolution gave way to the Age of Medicine, and the Space and Computer Ages. These later periods led to the greatest human population explosion ever witnessed. These historical events were the necessary paradigm shifts that allowed the short-changing and short-circuiting of evolution and natural selection.As a result of this snow-ball effect of passing DNA along from generation to generation, and the lack of a natural \\"check\\" on the population that can significantly keep the population to naturally manageable numbers, the environment on earth has experienced a catastrophic and detrimental decrease in biodiversity.In order to support such a massive and \\"out of control\\" human population, natural resources need to be harvested, mined, gathered, and processed at a phenomenal rate. Most of these materials are not renewable, and those that are, cannot be renewed at the rate the human population is growing. With the gathering of natural resources by an irresponsible species, with a lack of understanding of basic biological principles, ecological doom is soon to occur. The earth can handle only so much manipulation. The organic and inorganic cycles of the planet can only function to a certain limit - the biogeochemical cycles have their thresholds - and humans are pushing these cycles to their limits.Not only is the harvesting of resources detrimental to the planet - but so is the destruction of natural ecosystems to make room for more humans - urban sprawl, city growth, and the development and construction of canals, dams, highways, and related infrastructure are only a few examples of how the environment is being manipulated and fragmented for the benefit of humans.The past few years have witnessed the explosion of the \\"Information Age\\" - the invention of the Internet and the ready exchange of ideas via electronic means. People have the ability to access tons of information that they otherwise would not have access to. Using this to their advantage, environmental groups are reaching out to an otherwise ignorant population, and educating them on the perils of human meddling in the natural systems of the planet. A faint cry can be heard - a cry of concern, shame, and worry. The environment is falling apart, and a crippled scramble is manifesting an attempt to address the environmental damage created by humans. But is it enough? Will humans maintain the status quo of being a creature that doesn't react to a crisis until the 11th hour?Enter Russ Finley. No doubt he has fretted with these questions throughout his life. What is the solution to this looming \\"end of the world as we know it?\\" He is rich with ideas, and he successfully created a means to communication his ideas for the greater good - he wrote a book entitled \\"Poison Darts.\\"In this brilliantly written book, divided into two sections, Russ Finley addresses the looming doom head-on. Although part I of the book is science fiction in nature, it presents plausible and reasonable solutions to the human over-population problem. Once the speeding human population freight train is under control, the rape of the earth can stop - and the healing can begin. Part II contains a series of essays of an intellectual character that concentrates on many of the issues discussed and explored in part I.The first section is about a non-profit group that engineers a pill to neutralize sperm cells and switch the cells over to a non-viable form. This allows the prevention of un-planned pregnancies. It's a clever strategy and if distributed properly, can be very effective in inserting a \\"check\\" back into the human population. In addition, the group also starts to set aside and preserve the last undeveloped tracts of land throughout the world. Of course, the group also ensures the properties are protected from poachers, loggers, etc. with an elite team of soldiers, trained to keep the peace and the land safe from unscrupulous people.As a result of placing a control on the human population, many of the environmental problems and issues have a chance of being reversed. But, it will take a tremendous effort to maintain this new \\"way of doing things.\\" Russ Finley has thought of nearly everything when writing this fictional account. The story provides plenty of \\"food for thought\\" and allows the reader to ponder the fate of the human species, and the planet earth.The book is sprinkled with scientific facts, which makes it interesting reading. Also, the book is supported by a web page. Uniform resource locators (URLs) are cited throughout the text, and the reader can refer to these URLs for updated links and information. This allows for the text to never be out of date.The essays in Part II continue the discussion with focused queries into the many environmental issues facing the planet today. The essays can be read independently from Part I and can be read in any order. If you are avid student of the world with an environmental twist, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Poison Darts: Protecting the Biodiversity of Our World","review":"A thoughtful, accessible plunge into the subject of human nature and our impact on biodiversity.Russ Finley, evoking the wit of Studs Terkel, the scientific eye of Jacques Cousteau and the wisdom of Dr. John Gray, takes the reader on a free ranging tour through the historical and current debates on population, biodiversity and the male-female dynamic. Entertaining, educational and always insightful, this well referenced work will have you chuckling as you reassess commonly held beliefs on the environment, politics and the choices we all make in life."},{"Title":"Poison Darts: Protecting the Biodiversity of Our World","review":"\\"Poison Darts\\" is really two stories in one. Volume I, a quick read, is an entertaining fictional story. It illustrates a world where a clever think tank of specialists, each devoted to protecting the environment in their own special way, basically save the world from certain environmental catastrophe. It all revolves around the \\"TIFIC\\" or the \\"Take It and Forget It Contrapceptive\\" as it is named in the book, and the effects our ever growing population has on the environment. The story lays out in detail Finley's theory on why our environment is being destroyed and his solutions to many of the most challenging problems our world has ever seen.Finley, is more realistic than many environmentalists I have ever read the work of. Working on the proven but unaccepted idea that the \\"noble savage\\" is a myth, Finley bluntly tells the story of future environmental degredation at human hands. His solutions to the difficulty encountered in preserving the environment are quite different. Instead of the all too familiar approach of just roping off the wilderness, and making laws against environmental damage, Finley proposes that the reason for the destruction of our eco-system is mostly because of the amazing growth in world population over the last 100 years. His pushing for the development of the \\"TIFIC\\" is a main theme in this book and he continually discusses the connection between a rapidly growing world population and environmental destruction. His theory of reducing the world population by all but eliminating unwanted pregnancies (using the TIFIC) is the key to saving the environment from human destruction. If there are less people, they will not use as much of the Earth's resources, and thus there will be far less environmental damage. Volume I is a witty, interesting story that gives the reader hope that a solution to the problems that come with preserving biodiversity are possible to impliment.Volume II is downright scary. Instead of taking place in a fictional world, Finley is dead honest in describing what is happening in our world and why we must act quickly to save the Earth. Finley doesn't tree hug, or say we shouldn't destroy eco-systems because they are beautiful. He explains point blank why the destruction of the eco-system will really hurt human kind and the environment alike, and will most likely lead to irreversible destruction. Finley, and engineer, takes a more analytical look at the problems we face as a planet, and the difficulty caused by not making any attempt to solve such problems.This book (Volumes I&II;) is essential reading for those who care about preserving the planet's biodiversity, and are interested in solving the problems caused by its destruction. This book does not do much finger pointing, just analyzes the main causes of environmental destruction, and presents solutions to such problems.Finley's analysis of our world and human kind's effect on the environment is well written, descriptive, and realistic in its attempt to solve the problems we will face in the future. This is a great book, I recommend buying this book, and circulating it among your neighbors and friends after you finish reading it.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Poison Darts: Protecting the Biodiversity of Our World","review":"I just can't say enough about this book.

Then an applications of these new ideas."},{"Title":"Icelandic: Grammar, texts, glossary","review":"I begin with telling this is not a book for beginners. To grab the basics, buy Daisy L. Neijmann's Colloquial Icelandic. After you have completed that, this book will become your ultimate authority on this difficult but beautiful language. The reason for that is, this book assumes you have a fairly comprehensive knowledge of language in general, needed for learning the Icelandic language as well. The Colloquial Icelandic book introduces you this very gradually, whereas it is presented in bigger fragments in Stef&aacute;n Einarsson's book.The book is: very good-looking, very thick, very complete. However, is also very old (written around the second world war), so for newer words, you have to look elsewhere. This said, its biggest impediment is also its biggest advantage: everything is presented in a very thorough way (like only could have been done long ago), accompanied by beautiful pictures of various texts and exercises.The book has been devided in various parts, and not in chapters:---------------------------------------------------1) INTRODUCTION (page I - XXVII)* preface* preface to the second edition* how to use the book* topical index* bibliography* abbreviations* contents* list of illustrationsThe target of the introduction is to learn how to use the book. Everything is well done here, but it's a pity that the bibliography does almost only mention books that are out of print.---------------------------------------------------2) GRAMMAR AND TEXTS (page 1 - 293)* contents of grammar* grammar* texts I* texts IIThis is of course the actual heart of the book. The grammar is build up of three parts: pronunciation, inflexions, and syntax. The pronunciation is very profound and every possible sound is mentioned. The inflexions teach the possible forms of ANY wordtype (and is therefore very valuable), while the syntax focusses on WHEN everything is used, and also explains what \\"cases\\" are, etc. etc.The texts come in two varieties, the one kind being texts with references to which grammar to learn, the other kind being texts without that. While the themes of the first are sometimes unsignificant, the latter are really about parts of Icelandic society. And, remember, each text comes with a separate glossary to learn.---------------------------------------------------3) GLOSSARY (page 295-502)The glossary may be the best reason to buy the book. In fact, it's an Icelandic/English dictionairy, with reference to the grammar part for the inflections of the words. Honestly, this is the only book which contains (something close to) a dictionairy, with the full forms of any word. Too bad it isn't English/Icelandic!---------------------------------------------------I hope I've helped you with my review, just remember that you won't regret buying this book! =)"},{"Title":"Icelandic: Grammar, texts, glossary","review":"If you have an interest in the Icelandic language, you've definitely been frustrated by the lack of learning materials for English-speakers. Looks like Routledge is coming out with a &quot;Colloquial Icelandic&quot; sometime this summer (finally!), so that will definitely fill a huge void. Even so, I believe Einarsson's book will still fill a need.It employs an interesting methodology. In my 1945 edition, pages 1-31 give a very thorough introduction to the pronunciation. (too bad there are not accompanying tapes.) Pages 32-104 give the grammar (nouns, pronouns, verbs, in table form). Pages 105-180 covers syntax, with English translations of all sample phrases and sentences. Pages 181-246 is the pedagogical &quot;heart&quot; of the book; it consists of &quot;aefingar&quot; (exercises, drills). They are short readings with vocabulary. Before each of these, the author tells you what sections of the grammar and syntax sections you need to learn before going through the reading. For example, for the very first reading, you are instructed to learn the present indicative of the verb &quot;to be&quot;; the personal pronouns; and the weak declension of masculine and feminine nouns. So what you do is dip back, again and again, into the grammar and syntax, gradually learning more and more. At the same time, you're learning vocabulary through the readings.This &quot;learning&quot; section is followed by about 50 pages of readings, and there is a complete glossary at the back.Bottom line, it's a big book (about 500 pages), and if you work through it conscientiously, you'll have an excellent READING knowledge of Icelandic. For spoken Icelandic, you'll have to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Icelandic: Grammar, texts, glossary","review":"The good points first:- Very complete. Everything is included in a huge grammar.- Lots of readings. Not just the sagas, not just the everyday dialogues - actually, you get a lot of both.- quite a lot of exercises.- much better than the OTHER book. (which, I believe, you should have as well.)- a glossary so large that it would cost about the same if you were to buy it separately.- where else do you get 500+ excellent pages for this price?However, this book is not written the way you would expect it. Of course, it is about as old as my grandmother. For starters:- A topical index and a bibliography at the very BEGINNING of the book.- A rather thorough and very technical grammar before any introductory exercises. (Yes, I know, it says right after the preface that the absolute beginner should start by the exercises, but it is not very usual to start a book on page 181)- No discussion of vowel changes before a lot of exercises where they are needed. &quot;Teach yourself&quot; has the same problem. However, it is not something easy to explain, but future authors should at least try to either discuss each vowel shift just before it is needed or to use as few as possible in the first exercises.- You need a good memory. As an example, in order to go through the first group of exercises, you have to memorize (I couldn't do it in any other way) 6 different forms of the verb to be, about 40 different pronoun forms and about 12 different kinds of endings for nouns. Of course, no one said it was going to be easy. Icelandic has three genders, four cases and a huge amount of different verb forms... but this is HARD.- An old-looking rather small font that makes you read slower than on a modern book. Besides, it does not have a lot of white space. Pages are thick with text. This gives you the impression that you are going very slowly."},{"Title":"Icelandic: Grammar, texts, glossary","review":"Icelandic is not an easy language to learn and this book is a real antique in its approach to language learning, so I can imagine the frustration of a student whose previous experiences are high school or college courses (say beginning Spanish or French) or a Berlitz or Teach-Yourself course with tapes or CDs. Be warned, this is not that kind of book. If you speak native-level English and have studied Greek, Latin or German, this book will do you much good. If you know something about grammar and linguistics, so much the better. No phonetic descriptions are going to teach you to speak Icelandic or any other language. For that you'll have be around a native speaker, and you might do well also to get a phrase book and tapes. If, however, you want to learn to read Icelandic(and also old Norse)this is the best book I've found. It's surely an indispensable reference work to accompany other Icelandic programs as well. I don't know where else you'll find so much information to help unravel the complexities of Icelandic. Get it, but be prepared to work. It will take even an experienced language learner a couple of years to digest half of what it has to offer."},{"Title":"Icelandic: Grammar, texts, glossary","review":"Though I have carried &amp; used the Glending grammar for many years in my isolated study of Icelandic, this book, by Einarsson, offers direct &amp; enlightening descriptive explanations of the orthography of Icelandic and examples of usage. I consider it an impotrant asset to anyone studying Icelandic on their own."},{"Title":"Icelandic: Grammar, texts, glossary","review":"As was mentioned above, this book is best for people who already have the 'sound' of the language in their heads. It's not worth the trouble to try to use the pronunciation guide in the beginning of this book; with easy access to CDs, etc., it's quicker to learn from them.After that, however, this book is a great resource. I recommend skipping over the grammar sections (at least at first) and beginning with the first text. What I did was I looked at the words in the word list and said them all out loud with their definitions, then went and read the text out loud right after that. This helped me remember what the words meant as I read them, and so the text was comprehensible right from the beginning.I didn't bother with the exercises (as they necessitate using the grammar portion of the book, which is too abstruse for most learners, I think). I just happily learned about Icelandic culture reading the texts.I went all the way up to the end of Texts I (the part with the wordlists), then went back and did it again, this time only using the wordlist to check words I couldn't remember. After that, I took on Texts II (which don't have wordlists and rely on the glossary). This meant that I needed to look up the words in the glossary when I got stuck. It was a bit slower than using the wordlists, obviously, but this was outweighed by the enthusiasm of being able to read and enjoy real Icelandic after only about 75 hours of learning (that includes learning pronunciation through the Teach Yourself series)!My plan after this is to finish going through all of Texts II, then pick up an Icelandic-Icelandic dictionary along with a real Icelandic book and I'll be on my way! I'm certainly not done yet, but this book was a vital step and much appreciated."},{"Title":"Icelandic: Grammar, texts, glossary","review":"A bit dated, originally written in 1949, but everything is covered.

I beg to differ. This book has serious shortcomings. Contrary to the opinion of many reviewers, the grammar (inflections + syntax) is not huge, it's a mere 150 pages. This isn't much to cover a very difficult language like Icelandic (my favourite German grammar runs to 600 pages). The noun classes are presented in a very disorderly and confusing manner. Instead of giving the paradigm for every noun class, the author gives the two or three most important ones and then accumulates footnotes to account for possible variations. The tiny Teach Yourself volume by P.T.J. Glendening is much clearer and more methodical: its \\"Appendix\\" gives all the classes at a glance.On the other hand, the phonetics are very complete and exhaustive, but then no beginner needs that much, and nobody ever learnt to pronounce a language by reading a description of its sounds, no matter how thoroughly the job was done.Unlike Glendening, Einarsson doesn't provide any key to the exercises. How can the beginner check his answers? Here again Glendening is better.But then, given the dearth of available material on Icelandic, it's good to have another textbook to browse in when looking for some particular grammatical detail. In addition, there are a few nice pictures in it. The cover has a nice blue-green colour. Just make sure that you have a strong reading lamp on your desk: the print is tiny, and in the dictionary part the diacritics are difficult to make out."},{"Title":"Icelandic: Grammar, texts, glossary","review":"Having learned Icelandic previously, I found the texts/readings at the back of the book to be extremely useful and fun reading."},{"Title":"Icelandic: Grammar, texts, glossary","review":"I have read on the other reviews that the main problem of this book is the lack of cd or cassettes to listen to the pronunciation.

The linguaphone course comes with audios, a reading book, and a course book with instructions for use, vocabulary and notes, and this last book is the one which refers you to the \\"Grammar, text and glossary\\" book for extended explanations on grammar in each case.

I didn't feel like that information was there- the family could have just as easily been in Oregon or Tasmania for all I knew. Nothing made me feel like I was really there in Lapland with them.Considering what the book was, instead of what it wasn't, it was ok. The Franzons had a powerful faith that was present in their everyday lives. They seem to have been Baptists, rather than Lutherans, the current Swedish majority. They lived by their faith- it was a regular part of their daily life. The writing style was very simple and that made the characters seem very simple also. At times I felt that I was reading someone's *idea* of what the people were like, rather than what they were *really* like.Mama's many pregnancies and births were lightly glossed over, so anyone looking for insight into that would find it lacking. Their ideas on why the children looked like they do would have been comical if the parents hadn't taken them so seriously. Some children were more &quot;fleshed out&quot; than others and there was absolutely no explanation given for the source of their nicknames. Beating, switching and hitting the children were taken for granted, and I am very happy that it is now illegal to hit children in Scandinavian countries. Even the children knew the switchings didnt' help their behaviour but the parents didnt' figure that out.Food and housework were mentioned more often than just about anything else. Maria (Mama) was obviously Supermom to maintain her immaculate house and to bake and cook regularly for the family. They didnt' do laundry except in the summer so maybe that's how she kept up.References to the yard mystified me a little. A more thorough description would have helped as I still dont' understand the sand yard.The sea voyages to America were hardly mentioned. I would have loved to know more about how they really felt and how they lived day-to-day on the ships. I would have liked to have &quot;met&quot; some of their fellow travellers- after all, my Grandparents could have been on the same ship as they were.If you view this as a light book about a girl who gets her (older) man, lives the life of her dreams as a Preacher's Wife who gets to emigrate to America, then you will be satisfied. If you're looking for insight on early 20th Century Swedish life, look further."},{"Title":"Papa's Wife","review":"I found this book to not be about a young woman getting her man and having children. It's a beautiful depiction of a simple life that reminds us to take a step back from all of our ambition and things that we find important. It's a testemant to Mama's faith. She focused on what was important to her in life, which is what we all should do. She shows us how the jobs like mother and wife, which are often thought lightly of in the current time and play second fiddle to professions, are the most important of them all. Mama makes me want to be a better person."},{"Title":"Papa's Wife","review":"This captivating, wholesome story is a refreshing respite from our often hectic, sometimes violent existence in the late 20th century. Pontus and Maria are completely devoted to each other and their family. They don't merely &quot;put up&quot; with each other's differences.

As an adult now, looking to review books based on whether or not they portray true Biblical Womanhood, I have to give this book a thumbs down. Maria, or \\"Mama\\" is absolutely the initiator in her relationship with the preacher. She totally traps him, and is happy with her success, because she now gets to live the life she dreams as the preacher's wife. I guess the end justifies the means.The problem with this book lies deeper than a simplistic style of writing, in my opinion. One Sunday when the Preacher is sick, Mama pushes him back in bed, and herds the children off to church -- she will just go ahead and take care of that sermon for him. The Preacher is pretty frequently made out to be a simpleton, and perfect, sweet Mama just runs circles around him.I do not recommend this book, even to a young teen who doesn't care what she reads as long as the girl finds true love in the end because there is so much better literature out there that will paint a truer picture of Biblical Femininity as well as expand one's mind."},{"Title":"Parliamentary Diaries of Sir John Trelawny, 1858-1865 (Camden Fourth Series, 40)","review":"From his election in 1857 until his resignation of his candidacy in 1865, Sir John Trelawny served as a Member of Parliament for the borough of Tavistock, in the second of what would eventually be three periods in the House of Commons. A radical Liberal, he was too independent to serve in government and was best remembered as a back-bencher who took the lead in the effort to abolish church rates. Yet Trelawny also kept a diary of his activities and observations while in Parliament, one which gives its readers insight into the political world in which he operated..As the editor, T. A. Jenkins, notes in his introduction, the diary is limited in its scope. There is little attention to the debates in the House of Lords and even less to any committee work he performed. What it does offer, though, is a commentary on the House of Commons from the fall of Palmerston's first government to the end of his second administration. Trelawny's entries flesh out the debates in the Commons, adding color to the black-and-white columns of Hansard's while offering us characterizations of the leading political figures of his era from his perspective as a maverick back-bencher. Making all of this accessible is Jenkins, who guides the reader through the intricacies of parliamentary politics and identifies the myriad figures populating the pages. The result is a unique window into the politics of mid-Victorian Britain, one that is required reading for any student of the subject."},{"Title":"Last Vampire Pb (New Windmill)","review":"This was a very good audio book.

I recall seeing his paintings, which at the time were almost considered graffiti, around Manhattan in the early 1980's, and, being charmed by his trademark faceless little expressions of mass humanity. He became the artist most identifiable with the 1980's. But, he was much more than that. He was always very aware of his role as an artist, and, without any conceived pretention, what that role meant in society. Some artists are very insular, and develope their art in total privacy, for later viewing. Keith Haring was an artist who wanted people \\"involved\\" in the happening of his creativity. These journals, which he began sporadically from his teens, until his death from AIDS in 1990, show someone far more serious, with a sincere social conscience, than his often whimsical style suggests. He had a huge and unquestioning admiration for children, having a connection to them which could be described as what he called a mutual joy in the \\"gift of life\\", not yet jaded or corrupted. There are excerpts here which sometimes read like a tedious travelogue, of his shows worldwide. But, they are worthy reading overall because of his observations about people, politics, and the publics reaction to what he was trying to say through his art. He hated the \\"business\\" end of the art world, but acknowledged it as a necessity, if you wanted your art to be seen. He especially viewed businessmen and politicians as inheritantly evil and corrupt, making the astute observation in 1987 that white men in particular use \\"religion and business as a tool to fulfill his greed and power hungry aggression...\\"Expansion\\", \\"colonization\\", \\"dominitation\\", are all filled with the abuse of power and the misuse of people.\\" (Some things never change...) His very sensitive side can be seen in his reaction to the death of dear friend and mentor Andy Warhol. It is very moving, and pays tribute and appreciation to one of his first supporters. He believed in the good of SOME people, in a corrupt world, and in the hope of change for the better in mankind. His art was a reaching out, which he prophetically foresaw as outlasting what he always felt would be a short life. These journals are the entertaining account of the life of a very talented, very intelligent, dear man, and I feel they'd be an interesting read even if their author were anonymous.There are lessons here, and not just for art students.

It's candy for the mind. While they suggest that you put a copy in your bathroom for reading upon the throne, I'm pretty sure that anybody who starts reading it while taking care of business will keep reading it afterwards (after washing their hands, of course).I'll admit that some of the information in the Bathroom Reader series is inaccurate. For example, in the &quot;Legendary Lost Bathroom Reader&quot; book, they said that the most commonly used letters in the English language were, in order, ETAOINSKRDLU. The &quot;K&quot; should have been an &quot;H&quot;. However, there's so much material in these books, covering such a wide variety of topics, that it would be impossible for them to get everything right. To me, the main value of this book is to expose me to new topics that I didn't even know could be interesting.I think that the highest compliment you can pay to a book is that when you flip over the last page, you wish you could have that experience all over again. Since there are several BR books, you can certainly do that!One thing deserves mention: the creators of these books do not skimp. They cram every page full of reading matter.

Things I liked:- The simplistic approach to training (I just don't have time to break down my build phase into 5 periodized segments :-))- The emphasis on establishing *realistic* goals- The creative training log formats- Many good ideas & suggestions to take away and use in a way that works for *you*.There simply is no one-size-fits-all, magical training program out there that will turn you into a better triathlete.

I think that this book is good both for those new to computer science and those who have been involved in computer science for several years.For those new to computer science, I would not use this as a first book (this is made clear in the introduction, as well). The expectation is that the reader will already understand the basics of programming, so prior experience or an introductory course in computer science would be appropriate. Many of the examples make use of pointers, which can occasionally be confusing to students unfamiliar with programming, so it would definitely be a good idea for the reader to be familiar with a language like C or Pascal before starting this book. Once that foundation is in place, this is an excellent book to learn the basics of the field of computer science.For more experienced readers, this book serves as an amazing review and does a good job of collecting lots of information in one place. Explanations are solid, so the book can serve as a good reference for multiple topics. Note that the level of detail is not appropriate if you are just interested in one thing -- if you are interested only in details of algorithms, a book like the MIT Press Algorithms book would be more appropriate."},{"Title":"Foundations of Computer Science: C Edition (Principles of Computer Science Series)","review":"This is the best all-around foundational book covering Computer Science and Discrete Math; I wish it was used when I was a Computer Science student.

Not everyone who writes code is interested in these concepts, but serious students of computer science should be exposed to and have an understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of the field.

Obviously, the author of this book is a computer scientist, but this shouldn't be the excuse for writing such a terrible book.

Mathematicians may enjoy having this one on their shelf since they are probably the only ones that would enjoy the arcane, obfuscating language of the material. Since computer science is a practical application of mathematics, it would help to have a book that sets the foundations for newcomers in practical language with practical examples. This book does neither. I cite from page 370: &quot;Suppose a relation R, from domain A to range B, has the property that for every member of A there is at most one element b in B such that aRb. Then R is said to be a partial function from domain A to range B.&quot; This is just a small example of the author's droning about set theory. A computer science major would be better served by, &quot;A function cannot produce more than one answer&quot;, but nowhere in the text is this practical application mentioned. It's as though the publisher offered the author a bonus for long-windedness and theoretical prattle. This book should be in a graduate seminar on how NOT to write computer science texts."},{"Title":"An Unsocial Socialist","review":"As the previous reviewer has noted this book is hard to put down.

The theme was a total surprise and I really enjoyed the book as the 19th century has been the focal point of most of my reading. I only gave it 4 stars because in the end, though the book had me laughing throughout and was very entertaining, it both began and ended abruptly with the oddest of situations. The story didn't seem complete. But I'm not a big fan of fiction anyway so take it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"An Unsocial Socialist","review":"This reads like an infomercial for socialism.

Many women have been able to have children and STILL work. As a matter of fact, out of all my friends, the oens who work are the ones who are happiest. They feel like true partners in their marriages and their kids can actually do things for themselves rather than relying on MOM to do it. Another thing? The women in the book claimed that they felt like they were partners in hteir marriages. I disagree. If they were really partners in their marriage, then why couldn't their husbands stay home? Or better yet, why did their husband's careers have to conme first, often at the expense of their own? THat's not a partnership in my opinion. Like I mentioned previously, the book is a very weak attempt to justify laziness. That's all it really is."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"&quot;And What Do You Do? When Women Choose to Stay Home by Loretta Kaufman and Mary Quigley really encompasses what many women who have chosen to put off their &quot;careers&quot; to stay home feel today. A sense of under-appreciation and misunderstanding of what it takes to make this decision and still feel self-worth. So many of us, myself included, made a decision to stay home to help our husbands and families flourish. Not knowing the challenges that faced us not only with the adjustment of being home, but what &quot;people think&quot; of stay-at-home-moms. Well this book is a story of many women, along with the authors, who have made this choice and have reaped the benefits ten-fold. Please if you are considering staying home or have made that choice, this book will truly inspire you. Thank you ladies for sending me such a great read!"},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"This book gives you examples of lots of women who have made something of their lives at home. It is inspiring and affirming for those considering choosing home over career, either temporarily or permanently. The authors have chosed a wide range of women so one can find many reasons for staying home and examples of women who find being home a fulfilling career in itself. I would recommend it for any person considering this life-changing option.In the interests of full disclosure, I should mention that I was interviewed for this book and am mentioned in it. I was thrilled to be a part of this book, and delighted by the diverse group of women portrayed. It's nice to see that there are many people who value this choice, since so rarely are stay at home moms portrayed positively *and* realistically in the media."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"This book reflects what it's like for me to be a stay at home mom. Multi-tasking, on the go, and always questioning whether it's a valid or important job to be ceo of my family. It's so disheartening to be at a social gathering when someone asks &quot;And What Do You Do?&quot; When you tell them you take care of your family full time, they walk away. Maybe this book will help people to see a more complete picture of todays full time mom. Probably it will help women who are at home not to feel that they are alone. You go girls!"},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"I was excited when I read the title of this book and bought it without reading any reviews. I shouldn't have done so because I agree with most of the reviewers in the point that this story doesn't represent the average stay at home mom. It would have been so much more powerful to read if they would have taken the time to go out of there own little circle and interview some middle class and lower class moms as well as the upper class they chose.That being said, I was APPALLED to read the review that said that stay at home moms were lazy and needed to get out there and work for a living. It is sickening to see that some illiterate people still believe that staying at home isn't a worthwhile choice. If your beliefs are such, then why did you even read this book in the first place??? I would like to point out that I am \\"working\\" all day and on call 24/7. While I don't think there is anything wrong with being a working wife and mother, I feel that my most important job as a mother is to raise my children myself...not have them raised by babysitters or day care centers. I would challenge anyone who thinks being a SAHM is lazy to come spend a day in my shoes.By the way...money is not power. Knowing one's own self worth is power!"},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"I think this book fails to touch a broad spectrum of SAHM's. The women profiled in the book were affluent and so the idea of staying home to raise children is more socially acceptable for them. I think its based more on social aspects than on a real desire to nurture the child. Still after hearing about all the activities these women involve themselves in, I don't see how they really have time to raise and nurture their children. IN essence they are staying homew because they don't want to actually hold down a job. I was very disturbed at the constant mantra of putting your husband and children first. By the end of the book, if I were a weak person, I would wrongfully think that if I have children and don't stay at home, that not only will I be a bad mother with children who hate me, but my marriage will fail because I did not coddle my husband and put his needs abouve mine. Why, I have to ask, would anyone want a marriage of this kind? The authors justify husbands taking a less active role in making the marriage work and in raising the children. Frankly I do not appreciate the jibs at working mothers. A good book about SAHM's would show a broad spectrum and also would focus on celebrating staying at home rather than knocking working mothers. The authors make a great deal of generalizations that are really not true. The happiness they generally speak of that SAHM's moms have is just not something that I have encountered when being around SAHM's. They are the women whose husbands are having affairs because the wife has no interest in intimacy or because the husband is no longer intrigued by the wife. They are the ones who begin to feel burned out and moan about people taking them for granted. I resent the authors blatantly saying that having a woman at home makes for better and more stable marriages. I fail to see how these marriages are TRUE partnerships. All in all I think the authors wasted a great deal of their time in writing this bok and its disappointing because both of them had carrers in writing and s I would expect better work from writers."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"I recommend this book for any former career woman who sacrificed her job for the sake of the kids. As an educated, former workaholic who is taking a few years off to raise two small children, I found &quot;And What Do You Do?'' encouraging. The authors tracked down dozens of women who made the same choice I did, and learned that their former illustrious careers didn't in fact suffer much when they decided to re-enter the workforce. I've been out of the rat race (although not completely; I work part-time) for three years now and still fret whether I've squandered my hard-earned career. This book gave me the assurance I needed - that my skills will be in demand after I've shepherded my children through their early years. One anecdote made me laugh out loud: After one mom announced she was going back to work after a 16-year absence, her teenaged son lamented: &quot;But mom, we'll be latchkey children.'' The mom replied, &quot;At your age, you'll be latchkey adults.'' The book also serves to remind stay-at-home moms that we're not alone, that there are thousands if not millions of us out there sacrificing for our kids and feeling oddly old-fashioned about our lifestyles. Of course, the book chose not to focus on women whose husbands care more about their careers than their families. Nor did the authors interview women who stay home because they live with men who think that &quot;women's lib'' is the devil's handiwork. The book also ignored families whose religious beliefs dictate that the woman stay home to tend the hearth. But I suppose a discussion of every type of family situation would have made this book very long and not particulary new."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"For all the women who have left a career to stay home with their children, this book will ring familiar chords. The authors, both journalists, have interviewed dozens of professional women who have \\"backburnered\\" their careers in a conscious choice to raise families at home full time. What Do You Do? is not only a dreaded question for the formerly professional, but in this book it is a segue into examining the more interesting element of bringing the professional skills and experience into the home in order to enhance family life. These women have chosen to stay at home with their families, but they are not fading away or losing touch with their professional abilities. The focus of this book is the way in which these women use their professional skills and abilities, education and experience to great advantage in the organization and running of daily Family Life. Many of the women interviewed refer to themselves as the CEO or COO of the Family.The stories are inspiring and thought-provoking. If you've wondered how professional women can \\"give up\\" their careers to stay home with their children and remain sane, these women will teach you that there is much more to being a SAHM than the stereotypes we've all heard. If you are one of the many women who have chosen this path, this book will both validate many of your own feelings and experiences, as well as inspire you in. This is a book about women who give of themselves to the people they love most. Most do not consider they are \\"sacrificing\\" their careers, but rather they are using their abilities and experience to enhance their own lives and the lives of those they love. Worth a look. Christina Raley Managing Editor..."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"I found this book very disturbing. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind women who choose to stay home and take care of their children. It's their choice. However, plodding through this simple book, I was horrified when I got to the chapter where it was implied that working mothers were responsible for the Columbine massacre as well as the rest of the country's current tragedies and troubles. I personally find this female backlash very insulting. My mother worked from the time I could crawl and I have never thought about suicide, bringing a gun to school, or ever harming another human being. I have never been in jail and I am a successful, well-adjusted and content individual. Kaufman and Quigley should be recognized for their achievements in the fields of education and freelance writing, however, they don't understand how things work in the real world. In the real world, people can't just decide to write a book or an article after raising their kids. For them back to work means much, much more and many of them, when they return to work, are pained to find that their jobs have been given to much younger and much more experienced women who did not spend too much time out of the job market. They realize that they've lost years of valuable experience and now they are too old to re-learn (or learn, for that matter) what everbody else already knows. Getting back in is really tough. A long hiatus is definitely not recommended. I guess if you've married well and you don't have to work for a living, you can enjoy the luxury of being a stay-at-home-mom (and yes it is a luxury - my mom worked full-time, while raising a family)."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"First of all I think that most of the women in this book are degrading themselves by saying that they are not capable of handling a job and taking care of children. Second I don't understand why the women don't insist that the husbands take a more active role in parenting. Third i don't appreciate these women trying to throw stones at working mothers. I certianly have more respect for working mothers. Sorry, but you will never convince me that those kids in Columbine shot up that school because their mothers didn't stay home. THAT in itself is a whole different issue of parenting. Quite frankly the book is sickening and takes women all the way back to the 1950's as far as women's roles. I was particularly appalled when the women claimed that in their partnership marriages, their husbands careers and lives came first. What is equal about that? I'm sure the men DO support their wives staying home because they are getting spoiled out of the deal. I threw my copy away."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that this is just an excuse for lazy women who don't want to join the REAL world and work for a living. Most women today work full-time and do all the household chores and tend to the children. It's also time for husbands to take on some of that responsibility as well. Also, we set a better example for our daughters when they can be proud of their mothers who are not simply &quot;hubby's little helper&quot; (unpaid prositute, cook and house-cleaner). Get out and earn your way in the world ladies. Money is Power!"},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"Although I believe it is important for women and men to be reminded that more women are choosing to stay home to raise their kids, I don't feel this book added much value to the discussion.While this is a critical issue for our society today, the authors really stay at very superficial level of discussion. They choose to provide an endless set of examples of women who have chosen to stay at home but do not delve into any real discussion of identity, self worth, finances or career impact that women face. I liken this book to the level of a Cosmo article. It assumes the attitude that &quot;if you make the right choice&quot; (i.e. to stay home) all will work out magically in the end. Not only will the time out the workforce not impact you negatively but it will most likely enhance your career by allowing you to uncover hidden talents that you didn't know you had. Much of the examples ended with women becoming authors, starting a business or becomming vitally important volunteers of some type - not just stay at home moms.I found most of the examples pretty irrelevant to my situation in that they presented scenarios of women who's husbands were not only the primary wage earners but also superstars in their fields such as sports figures, well known authors, leading surgeons, well known political figures. Not to minimize the choices that these women made, but they represent a single class of scenario where the decision was not financially based and the husband clearly had the stellar job.Along those lines, I do not fit this profile. I am very successful at the age of 38. I make (at least)twice as much as my husband. Therefore the choice for me does have a very real financial component. I firmly believe that my choice would be different if my husband were in fact CEO of a Fortune 500 enterprise. While it is my personal conviction that staying at home to raise children is one of the most important roles a women can take on, I am still very much struggling with the impact to my life - from an identity, self esteem and perhaps social perspective. This book provided no new insights, no new information per say that would help one transition to part time work, job sharing, launching a business, etc.I would only recommend this book as a &quot;feel good&quot; read for women who have made the decision and want more validation that they made the right choice. I would not recommend it to women looking for a serious dialogue about how to make the transition and handle the impact to their career, self esteem and finances."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"I purchased this book after seeing the authors at a book store lecture and book-signing event sponsored by my local Mothers and More chapter. Even then, it left some lingering doubts, but reading the book increased my doubts and brought up many more criticisms.I don't disagree for a second that it is a worthwhile endeavor to be a full-time parent and raise your child(ren). I am a veterinarian and worked half-time after the birth of my first child and left paid employment altogether for 18 months after the birth of my second. What disturbed me about this book were the generalizations the authors made about women who do the same thing or the opposite and why women can and should make this decision.I really doubt that most women stay home after they have children in order to support their husband's career, but the authors seem convinced that this is a primary motivator. They also discuss the myriad of activities these women are engaging in to the point of not being at home. I must be missing something, because with a preschooler and a toddler, my volunteering opportunities are pretty limited. This corresponds quite well to other reviewers' comments that the women selected are not particularly representative of working women as a whole. In fact, many of the women interviewed are in highly selective fields such as runway modeling or the wives of very public or well-off men, such as professional athletes and coaches, Cabinet members, or world-renowed surgeons.I also felt that the authors failed to address an important societal/political/economic issue - that being why only women are expected to be and allowed to be full-time parents. While they mention that it just doesn't seem acceptable for men to take advantage of parental leave options, they don't even suggest that this may be something requiring change. Nor do they address the fact that only women seem to face significant economic costs imposed by child-bearing and -rearing.They also do not address very well the difficulty in staying home for those in highly technical and rapidly evolving fields. Anyone in medicine or other scientific areas knows that keeping up with new developments is very challenging and it is almost a given that you will have to bring your technical skills back up to speed after time away.Finally, after I finished the book and was comparing my thoughts to those of others who wrote reviews here, I was surprised to see at least 2 of the reviews written by women who were surveyed and interviewed for the book, and yet that fact was not mentioned in their rave reviews.Overall, while I am glad that the authors have highlighted and praised the option women have to leave paid employment and raise their children, I found their other conclusions less edifying."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"All of the stay at home moms in this book are very affluent, and either had very successful careers high on the corporate ladder or in acting or modeling, or their husbands are very wealthy (ceos, doctors, sports stars, actors). While it would be interesting to read a few stories of women who formerly had great careers and decided to interrupt them to stay home with their children, most stay at home moms are not like that. This book made me feel like I have never done anything with my life. Just not very useful to the normal mom, although if you are a millionaire CEO you might get something out of it."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"After reading this book and then reading the reviews on it I am so saddened and appalled by some of the responses. What I am reading are women that unfortunately get a sense of self-worth through punching a time clock as opposed to raising the children that they &quot;had to have.&quot; This book is inspiring to women who are struggling with this decision and hopefully they will see that the &quot;true and meaningful&quot; job in life is raising your child. I have the rest of my life to work and in the mean time chose to volunteer in the community, chairing fundraising events, sitting on 2 Boards and &quot;amazingly&quot; feeling a great sense of self worth. And the best part--my daughter knows that I chose her and not a job to validate myself."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"No one has a chance to ask me just what it is that I do, they are too exhausted after listening to the list of daily chores, tasks, and responsibilities, and that's just for my volunteer jobs! I am one of many &quot;Mothers at Home&quot; interviewed by Mary Quigley for this most excellent book. While I choose to be at home with my children in order to raise my own children, it soon became clear that inbetween meals and laundry that there was some time to participate in the community at large (as long as I could always have a baby on my hip.) By the time Mary got to me, my life was filled with opportunities that never came my way when I worked 9 to 5. And I'm not the only mother to have discovered this.&quot;And What Do You Do&quot;? is a book that has looked at women like me to find that by staying home women have created incredibly interesting lives doing everything but waxing the floors. Of course, we knew that already. But if you are considering staying home with your babies, if you are working the numbers trying to decide if your family can afford for you to be at home, if you are tired of the daycare routine, if you are in love with your baby and you don't want to leave, then this book will show you that there really is a whole other world out there. It is called real life."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"After having worked and prospered in my career for 10 years, I found that I was hitting a ceiling. No, it wasn't the famous glass &quot;salary&quot; ceiling. It was the satisfaction ceiling. I could not seem to squeeze anymore joy or satisfaction out of my job no matter where I was, who I worked for (even myself), or how much I was paid. Motherhood is a whole new ballgame and I have found NO ceiling of satisfaction here. Even though the hours are long (24x7), I know that raising one member of the next generation is one of the most important jobs I can possibly do. This book sheds a new light on a new way of doing business - that being the business of raising our children. If you are considering - even for a minute - staying at home for a while to raise your young children, spend some time with this well-researched book."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"I think this is an excellent book. It profiles lots of different women who have chosen to stay home and take care of their families. I can assure you that none of the women profiled is &quot;lazy&quot; as one cusromer reviewer put it. As one of the women interviewed for this book, I would like to say that I am certainly not. I work very hard. In fact, I work harder now than I did when I had a full time job outside of the home.I think the book is well written and has helped me reconfirm my belief that I made the decision to stay at home full time for now to be home with my young children."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"The problem with this book is that these women are not representative of most SAHMs. It would have been a better book if it had been a real look at SAHM in a less affluent environment, and a discussion of having relationships with employed mothers. I belong to an informal network of working and SAHM mothers, and the lack of conflict is great. These women refuse to allow their husbands to slack off, and they have to do things to protect the family finances as well as keep their training up. They recognize reality (as my family did when my husband was out of work); if you step out of the workplace, you will have to retrain. They also recognize some people can not afford to stay at home. Some women make so little at unskilled work, the family would not have much left over after daycare. Others are training for jobs to raise the family income. It really is a decision that has to be made within the constrainst of what's best for the family. SOmetimes that's employment, sometimes not.The key here is that SAHM and employed mothers have to understand that neither choice is &quot;wrong.&quot; Once they understand that, they can make common cause and help each other. As for the Columbine thing, one of the mothers was a SAHM, and one was employed. The boys were mentally ill. Blacming mothers for that is back to the old 50s mentality we NEED to get rid of."},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"This book provides a platform for women behind the scenes and do not get the fame they deserve. Motherhood is the toughest job anyone will ever have and the women in this book are selfless enough to put their families first instead of a career. To comment on what one reader called lazy women is to say that person didn't truly read what these women do. One who works for her husband's liver transplant patients and their families to make sure they are provided for during difficult times. One who is a navy pilot's wife whose husband is away for six months at a time and for 9-10 months total out of the year and who has to be both a mom and dad. These women are anything but lazy. They are working 24 hours a day seven days a week to raise responsible little people and who are true partners in their marriage. I commend the authors of this book, the woman in the book as well as the women who struggle with this decision everyday. These women are all courageous!Thanks for such an amazing read!"},{"Title":"And What Do You Do?","review":"This book really connected with me.

Primarily, Goldberry Long presents this story in such a way that I feel right there beside Juniper Tree Burning. I'm with her on that school bus when the kids ridicule her and throw her book bag out the window. I'm also there when Ray whips her in that chicken coop all because of his own shortcomings and frustrations.I grew up in the era of hippies and I thought a lot about them, then and later.

But it's brilliantly done -- precision prose, a raw naked dive into her character's emotions at the moment she suffers a near-psychotic break when her brother suicides. Part way through I thought the subtitle should be &quot;How I Became a Control Freak.&quot; Perhaps the people who don't love this book had perfect childhoods, weren't Ugly Chicks, didn't dream of a Fairy Godmother. It's a great story with wildly imaginative detail, and she writes poetic prose. I'll be reading everything else she writes."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"As I began writing my next novel, Goldberry Long inspired me to discover a clear voice for my main character. She cleverly wrote a novel that felt like a fabulous and poignant poem. The flow was rhythmic and soothing. The pain is passionate and gut wrenching, and you want so badly to help Jennie overcome her fears. I fell in love with Sunny and had hoped against all hope that Jennie's own wish of his survival were true. I ached for the resolution of their relationship. Jennie is tough as nails and not easily likeable as a person. But you find yourself being dragged along in her pity party and self destruction.

A beautifully detailed novel which explores the various pains and joys families are uniquely able to bring to or inflict upon each other. Given the depth of such pain and joy, forgiveness is both harder to earn and to bestow. Juniper Tree Burning is a fully realized character, and it is a tribute to the author's talents that no matter how low Juniper sinks or how crazy she seems to get, we sympathize with and can even empathize to a certain extent. Everyone's heart is in the right place in this book but that doesn't mean they always do the right thing."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"I think this book is very well written. Its strengths definitely outweigh its weaknesses. My main complaint is that it's so long. I think that perhaps the story could have been \\"condensed\\" a bit more? Because it seemed to drag on, I almost quit reading the book about 2/3's of the way through it. However, it isn't my general practice to \\"abort\\" books; and I honestly think this book is very good. As for the subject matter, I welcomed a book that deals with anger (in this case, a woman's struggle with it). Anger is such a \\"taboo\\" emotion, yet it's an emotion that most people commonly feel in varying degrees. As such, it should be as valid a topic in writing as any other human emotion. My personal opinion is that if you don't \\"tell the story,\\" the perpetrator gets off scot-free."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"This is the kind of book that makes you feel more alive and makes you love the experience of being alive.

Ms. Long had the guts to stick to it and write it all; the least I could do was stick to it and finish reading it. But omigod...it's really a tiresome read. Are the rave reviews just puffery? The story just plods along with its feet stuck in the murky mud of childhood disappointment, long after the mud should have been scraped off and left behind.

Too bad she didn't extend the same delicate touch to the horrifically over-wrought characterizations. It read like a depressing cartoon. But it was an excellent cure for insomnia."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"I had the pleasure of hearing the prologue to this effective novel read to me by Goldberry many years ago at Christmas time. It was so beautiful, I cried. My mother had to leave the room; she didn't like the idea that the youngest in the Davis family killed himself. We have a young brother, who at 24 was still the baby. I think Mom was afraid of the possible prophetic effects of the words. Even today, I don't think Mom has finished the novel; too close to home.Jennie Braverman, formerly Juniper Tree Burning Davis, doesn't have the luxury of leaving the room or closing the book. Sunny Boy Blue is dead. This is her reality and she can't hide anymore. This death sends her on a quest to come to find the answer to the question of who she really is, and to come to terms with the influence she has had (and is still having) on the people in her life and theirs on her.In the manuscript, Goldberry told many stories from all the generations that influenced Jennie's current behavior: stories of the grandmother she never knew, the mother she never knew, and the Jennie she never knew. I laughed and cried aloud, and as I did, the words became my reality. Memories of my grandmother and her relationship with my mom were suddenly vivid. The fact that they are fictitious doesn't bother me; these are cathartic memories all the same, ones that help me understand my own behaviors.The novel is pared down from the manuscript: trimmed for printing and sale. (Have you ever bought an 800 plus page novel?) I miss the stories that didn't make it into the book. But the journey that remains, in memory, fantasy and reality is focused on giving Jennie (and the reader) the answers sought.This is a wonderful novel, written by someone with a wealth of knowledge and advice, and who is sharing but a smidgen of it with the lucky reader who experiences it."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"I don't believe we really know what we were all about as a generation until our children tell us what it was like for them. Why did we choose voluntary poverty? Why did we choose to live among and be instructed by Indians? Why did we bake our own bread, learn about herbal medicine, and live with outhouses, without running water? Why did we give birth to our children at home and why did we name them after the flora and fauna of the places where we were? Names like Cedar, Sage, Juniper, Coyote, Sunflower, Chamisa? Names like Goldberry? Lady Goldberry was a golden girl in the Tolkein Trilogy, *Lord of the Rings* which we had all read. We were living in a fantasy, to be sure, but who is to say that our fantasy was not lovelier, lighter, and more compassionate than the fantasies of the '50s in which we'd grown up - except our children.*JUniper Tree Burning* is in novel form, but it tells the truth about our generation as well as the author's generation. &quot;You need not tell all the truth, unless to those who have a right to know it all,&quot; said Horace Mann, &quot;but let all you tell be truth.&quot; Ms. Long has succeeded admirably in telling the truth about her own slice of space-time from the '60s on to the present.The book is deeply psychological and intensely autobiographical even though circumstances, events and characters are altered by the magic of a sure novelist's art. The author changes only the closest geographical names, for instance, but accurately portrays the life and landscape of Arroyo Hondo, Taos, Santa Fe and Albuquerque. She changes names and edits events, but you hear Goldberry being told that &quot;you don't think - you just barge ahead like the Capricorn you are&quot; - her mom's self-fulfilling prophecy. You can see her hiding beind her own face. &quot;It's a good trick to have. You turn your face into a mask and then you are safe behind it, especially when your mother calls you a stupid name which is not yours, and which you hate.&quot;And you look into the eyes of Juniper/Jennifer/Goldberry's father and brother - &quot;pale green, so light they almost seem transparent. See-through eyes I've always called them.&quot; But you could easily read the whole book and not have a clue that the god-medicine, the sacred host of the Meeting Way - is peyote. The word is never mentioned, because it does not need to be mentioned in the interests of truth.The truth is, &quot;That's how to be a woman. You cook for a hundred people on Christmas Day.&quot; The truth is in &quot;the confusion of loving and hating, leaving and arriving, leaving and arriving, like the ocean, the tide, the waves.&quot; The truth is that &quot;...he'll never be a woodsman in the forest who saves the children. That is why he is so sad.&quot; The truth is contained in the very real problems and persecution the little hippie kids experienced from both teachers and students in Northern New Mexico at the time. (I know. My own children suffered similarly.)The truth is in Ms. Long's self-awareness. Her alter-ego, Juniper, got into a private school on scholarship, &quot;by hawking my sordid past, making it seem tragic and lovely, and painting big idealisitc plans for the future...because you tell the part of the truth that gets you what you need. You make them believe they should be astonished.&quot; And she knows what she's doing. &quot;You can't have it both ways, you teenage monsters. You don't get to act like you know everything and then cry, But I didn't know!&quot;Reading the first half of this book, I was struck by how the author skillfully uses various literary devices - moving fluidly between third and first person for instance (you never have to go back as you do in a Russian novel to figure out who is saying what). I marveled at the lyricism, the true voices in her dialogue, and the penetrating psychological insights. I felt a fair amount of generational pride. This girl - this incredible young woman - can really write! Having been so dismayed by so many children-of-the-'60s and children-of-the-children-of-the-'60s stories that capitaize on half-truths and downright lies - this was a breath of fresh air. And not only that - it's honest-to-god literature!But then, I became caught up in the STORY - and read it in immense gulps right through to the very moving and redemptive end. It made me cry (and I'm a tough old bird - not much can make me tear up like this). Goldberry was able to appreciate her family - the parents who taught her how to live on the land. &quot;I will say to my father and mother, I think I understand. You did your best. You loved this valley, nestled into the mesa.&quot; They taught her so much and gave her so much of themselves, and the love that shines through all this is dazzling. Redemptive. The fact that she kept her name, Goldberry, speaks volumes.This is a splendid first novel by a mature and insightful young woman who knows whereof she speaks and doesn't tell lies to pander to any literary styles or expectations. Critics have said that it's too long, but I maintain that not a single word is wasted. Even if you're going into it cold - not knowing anything at all about the space-time coordinates of the story - its appeal is universal. That's the mark of great writing by a master craftsman and artist. Bravo Goldberry! Keep on keeping on. May you live LONG and prosper...."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"Juniper Tree Burning is one of those books that I hesitate to praise too much because it is so good, so courageously told--and I don't just mean the subject matter, which includes a poverty-striken childhood among hippies, suicide, and a not-entirely likable main character--but the literal telling of it. Ms. Long weaves back and forth in time masterfully, gradually revealing the reality behind the half-truths that Jennie, the former Juniper Tree Burning, the self-named Ugly Chick, has told us with more than a mere glaze of rosy glasses. The story also blends points-of-view, sometimes in Jennie's own voice, in a third-person storyteller, and often in a stepped-back voice of Jennie, admittedly speaking of herself from the outside.This is, at its most essential, a book with a beating heart. Let this complicated woman into your life--watch her play pool as a bloodsport, let her husband finally pierce her toughness with how lovingly he makes guacamole for her, and weep for the determined resilence of the young Juniper Tree Burning struggling to make breakfast before school--you will not soon forget her, and her many journeys through these pages."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"I love this book. The main character, Jennie, is one of the strongest female characters I have read in fiction - tough, smart and intent on re-inventing herself from the hippie child she once was. The novel weaves between the present - a road trip begun when Jennie's brother commits suicide - and the rich past of Jennie's hippie parents who invented their own new life in New Mexico. The prose is lyrical and lush, and each scene is so beautifully rendered that I felt I had lived it - the book draws you so closely into Jennie's world that, upon closing the book, I would sometimes find my own world a little disorienting.Most important, I felt that Jennie is engaged in a task that faces each of us - carving an identity within a family and a marriage, sorting through the past to find the pieces that have meaning and truth for the people we are now. The book is wise and rich in the ways of grief and forgiveness, family, and, most important, love. A rare and unalloyed pleasure."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"This is the best book I've read all year. It burns with passion, but quietly, a long, smouldering read that is so artfully executed you barely know you've just read 400 pages representing almost 30 years of life for one woman. The heroine is tough--a big heart carefully guarded, a strong personality (not meant to appeal to those who prefer blonds dumb and sweet), with painful memories and a huge complex to work through.... And somehow, Ms. Long gets us through it all with finesse and a sense of the greater beauty of Juniper/Jenny's world, saving us from despair and handing us over to hope, in the end. Buy this book. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"Goldberry Long's first novel, entitled Juniper Tree Burning, is a forceful tale of one woman's struggle to love herself. After enduring a childhood of cruelty and ostracism, including her hippie parents' scorn and derision and her community's contempt for her hippie upbringing, Jennifer Braverman (a.ka. Juniper Tree Burning) embarks on a pilgrimage to the site of her younger brother's suicide and, in the process, confronts the memories of her own tortured past. While the story is certainly one of compassion, Long dares to challenge her readers. Braverman is unusually bold, angry, and unapologetic. In other words, she is difficult to love, like the people in our own lives often are. In addition to Long's mastery of microscopic truthfulness with her characters, her writing is radiant and unflinching. She manages to describe the ugliest of humanity with the most beautiful of metaphors. Brilliantly written, powerful and moving, Juniper Tree Burning is a sparkling debut from a first-time author."},{"Title":"Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel","review":"I just spent two days sitting on my couch unable to do anything but read this book. This impressive debut novel bounces the present off the past (and vice versa) with an ingenious narrative that tells the stories surrounding Jennifer Braverman's struggle to cope with the suicide of her brother. It explores how we use memory to define ourselves and how emotional growth involves not only confronting our past, but the stories we tell ourselves about the past.

However she was not the only focus, all the other characters, small and large, were also great mix, complementing her and making her a great villain.As time goes on you will understand that just like \\"Juniper\\" we all have our personality flaws and we must try to correct them to become a better person. &quot;Juniper&quot; does things with out really thinking about how/who it will hurt and not looking at the future consequences they may have, but don't we all?

I wanted to somehow jump into the story myself and hug or scream at the lead character; she is that compelling.

OAS was astonished to find itself dealing with more than 10,000 fighters -- they called themselves Comandos, not Contras -- and 80,000 unarmed supporters.These could not possibly have been ex-Somocistas, as there had never been so many. But it did not seem to occur to anyone else but Brown to ask, who were they?Brown, now at the Hoover Institution, surprised himself with the answer.Contrary to the \\"Black Legend\\" of the Contras as a small band of mercenaries, Brown discovered that the counterrevolution was started by Chibcha Indians who make up 52 percent of Nicaragua's population, that the revolt started in 1979, that it continued for almost three years before outsiders and ex-Somocistas joined and that it had the unanimous support of the highlanders.\\"Alone among the major antagonists in Nicaragua's recent wars, the MILPAS (the name the rebels gave their combat units) of 1979-82 had no foreign military support. . . . The much-feared and widely demonized 'Contras' turned out to be only poor dirt farmers from Nicaragua's equivalent of Appalachia, historically marginalized but insistently independent mountain 'hillbillies.' \\"Brown traces this revolt back more than a thousand years, to the collision of Nahua Indians expanding from Mexico to Nicaragua's Pacific lowlands and Chibchas expanding from South America to the highlands.Though the Chibchas were defined out of existence following a revolt in 1881, when it became national policy in Nicaragua to claim that there were no more \\"indios,\\" only mestizos and \\"espanioles,\\" the Chibchas themselves knew who they were.In oral interviews, Brown discovered that the anti-Sandinistas identified themselves as \\"indios\\" or even \\"indios puros,\\" versus the mestizos and \\"whites\\" of the lowlands.The question arises: Can the analysis of a Reaganista be trusted?The answer is yes. Brown conducted a sociological-ethnological inquiry using standard academic research protocols, and the documents are on deposit at Hoover for inspection.Some of the most important points can be cross-checked with outside, even with Sandinista publications.Of all the proofs Brown offers, the most extraordinary and persuasive is the question of the Literacy Brigades.We know from many studies of peasants that in societies divided between literate and illiterate, peasants will extend a great measure of goodwill to a regime that teaches their children to read, even if the regime is harsh otherwise.Observers as various as the historian Alexander Werth writing of Stalinist Russia and University of Hawaii sociologists Geoffrey White and Lamont Lindstrom writing of Micronesians under Japanese rule have commented on this phenomenon.Thus, the admission of the Sandinista regime, in a broadcast on April 9, 1980, that it had sent soldiers and special militias to the mountains to protect the teachers from their students suggests an extraordinary popular revulsion against the revolution.This is understandable, as the Sandinistas came in murdering, raping and robbing.No one, from any political position, thought it necessary to ask the indios what their opinion was. Oxfam America, in a document called \\"A government we can work with,\\" explained that the Sandinistas were committed to \\"empowering\\" poor women.Poor men who saw their wives and daughters molested by Sandinista soldiers and cadres did not agree, and they took to the jungle.If the Sandinistas had had any knowledge of the history of their own country, they would have left the independent farmers of the highlands alone and turned their energies to the many problems of the lowlands.But they were Marxist-Leninists, and their intention was to instruct history, not be instructed by it.Later, after a genocidal ethnic cleansing campaign in the Atlantic lowlands, other indios (Miskito, Rama, Sumu and so-called \\"Black Creoles\\") joined the rebellion.With five separate armies in revolt, the Sandinistas lost at the polls in 1990.Even then, according to Brown, the new Conservative President Violeta Chamorro united with the Sandinistas against the indios, who were Liberals.They were Liberals in the 19th century sense, individualists; they had nothing in common with the statist views of American Democrats.The Sandinistas, with Chamorro looking the other way, continued a campaign of murder against the indios leaders until the election of 1996, which both the Conservatives and the Sandinistas tried to rig by faking the census and refusing to register the highlanders.International observers thwarted that plot, and the indios voted 90 percent for Liberal Arnoldo Aleman, who won the presidency, the first peaceful change of power in the country's history."},{"Title":"The Real Contra War: Highlander Peasant Resistance in Nicaragua","review":"In Nicaragua, as in the United States, there are still holdout areas of Marxists, still waiting for the Great Revolution to show the world that communism should be the way. In Nicaragua, it is in Leon where there are still murals of Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas on many buildings. In the US, it's places like Seattle and college faculties.But for those who don't find it &quot;reactionary&quot; to hold the belief that communists are the bad guys, this book is a great source. Instead of still fighting the war for the Sandinistas, this book offers a well-researched and documented history.Having a brother that is married to a Nicaraguan from Corinto, where the CIA mined the harbor, it has been surprising to learn how much the majority of Nicaraguans appreciated Reagan's decision to fight the communists in their country.For those who don't remember, when the Sandinistas were forced to hold elections, the US media and most of the world had predicted a resounding Sandinista victory. They are still bitter that they were wrong, and that the Nicaraguan populace kicked their fellow leftists out of office.For those interested in a rational view of the Contra war and the Sandinistas, this book and Glenn Garvin's &quot;Everybody had his own Gringo&quot; are the best bets. For those who still aren't sure which side to believe, do a little research on what the Sandinistas did to the Moskito indians. And to see who it was in the US that supported, and still supports, the Sandinistas as well as Castro's dictatorship, read &quot;Covert Cadre&quot; by S.

Yet these movements did not grow like the Contras, nor last ten years, and the reason is obvious, although discounted in Mr. Brown's book.And that is because the original hypothesis - of being financed and controlled by the CIA and rich exiles - is still valid.

While the Sandinistas were murdering thousands and thousands of people, and exiling over 1/2 million people out of the country, the Contras became Nicaragua's first line of defense against this abuse. The American media, looking to hurt Mr. Reagan, who supported this freedom fighting group, engaged in a massive campaign to destroy them.The fact is that a large portion of the Contras were FORMER SANDINISTAS, and the majority opposed the Somoza dictatorship. These people felt betrayed that what was supposed to be a democratic revolution in 1979 turned out to be a bait-and-switch communist take-over.The vast majority of the contras were fighting to once and for all liberate the country from dictatorship and get out of the battlezone between east and west that was destroying the country. They came from all walks of life. From Mr. Calero, who led the contras without a wish for political office after the conflict, to the thousands of Mizquito indians who led the fight in the Atlantic coast.What is amazing is that they won, but they have never been acclaimed as winners in the US media. Nicaragua has been a democracy for the last 13 years. As the contra detractors claimed that Mr. Calero wanted to become the next dictator, he graciously vowed completely out of politics, as did comandante zero and other heros of the resistance. Those freedom fighters have let the democratic process work, and have watched as the country takes root in democracy, and fights on to get rid of the legacy of the last two dictatorships: heavy debt, poverty, and corruption.It's about time someone told the truth!"},{"Title":"The Real Contra War: Highlander Peasant Resistance in Nicaragua","review":"but a bunch of self-rationalizing and self-deceptive propaganda to ease his guilty conscience for the genocide he and we have done.

In addition, his work is very thought provoking.Unlike other biographies, which tend to paint the subject as larger than life heroes, van Creveld paints the life of this extraordinary man in terms that almost anyone can relate to. Not only can the reader get a sense of Dyan's extraordinary exploits, one can also relate to Dyan as a down-to-earth human being. One of the best examples of this quality how the author revealed Dyan's ability to relate (and in some cases sympathize) with his Arab adversaries.I would encourage every young military leader (especially those fighting the Global War on Terror) to read this biography.

This is an informative and interesting book, although no new ground is broken. Much (too much in my view) of the text is devoted to Dayan's role in various military campaigns, of which mountains have been written elsewhere. I found the discussions of Dayan's life outside the military sphere to be the most illuminating parts of this book. He had diverse interests outside of his professional life, and complex (turbulant?) relationships with his children. Dayan's interactions with many other Israeli statesmen and military leaders are also detailed.

She is also very well-known as a speaker and is one of the select group of people who has driven forward our understanding of ourselves, our organizations and our society as complex adaptive systems. With her holistic view of the world, she is very sensitive to the connections or failures of connection that have such an impact on society and the lives of individuals. This book has as its primary focus the disconnection between the deepest needs and aspirations of humans and acceptance of the single-minded pursuit of profit as the sole imperative on business other than staying within the law.She argues that maintenance of this disconnect is ultimately unsustainable both for society and for business. She sets out to show why, and how it is possible to move toward sustainability by accepting the creation of 'spiritual capital' as a parallel goal with building material capital.The basic concepts on which the book rests include:People, society and business form a system made up of interconnected sub-systems. For such a system to be sustainable requires that the elements cooperate in producing a balanced environment that nourishes the whole. They are holistic ... self-organizing, and exploratory.Sustainable capitalism and a sustainable society depend on recognition and nurture of higher motivations:* We need a sense of meaning and values and a sense of fundamental purpose (spiritual intelligence) in order to build the wealth that these can generate (spiritual capital).* People, organizations and cultures that have spiritual capital will be more sustainable because they will have developed qualities that include wider, values-based vision, global concern and compassion, long-term thinking, spontaneity (and hence flexibility), an ability to act from their own deepest convictions, an ability to thrive on diversity, and an ability to learn from and make positive use of adversity.She identifies three forms of wealth and three kinds of associated intelligence:* Material capital, associated with thinking and rational intelligence, the wealth expressed in money;* Social capital, associated with feeling and emotional intelligence, the wealth that makes our communities and organizations function effectively for the common good;* Spiritual capital, associated with being and spiritual intelligence, the wealth contained in our shared meanings, values and ultimate purposes.Much of the book is concerned with identifying the states of being in which a person or an organization can find itself and the principles required for transformation to a state in which higher values can be met and higher needs satisfied and the system remains sustainable. The principles are based on observation of the behavior of (non-human) complex adaptive systems plus principles for human sustainability taken from spiritual thought through the ages.The qualities that the author identifies as central to a sustainable organization will be familiar to most readers - self aware, vision and value led, holistic, celebrating diversity and similar qualities. She argues that these are the qualities necessary to maintain a system in the dynamic but self-sustaining state we describe as a complex adaptive system - neither stuck in steady-state inflexibility nor falling over the edge into chaos.Maintenance of this state requires particular behaviors on the part of enough individuals acting as leaders to induce the organization as a whole to behave in that way. Her belief is that, in spite of the system pressures (such as those from the financial markets) to behave otherwise, a sufficient minority of aware people can bring about the necessary changes."},{"Title":"Spiritual Capital: Wealth We Can Live by","review":"This review is an adaptation of my review published in Personnel Psychology, Summer Issue, 2005.Zohar is broadly trained and thus taps into diverse resources such as classical literature, physics, religion, and psychology. Marshall is a Jungian-oriented psychiatrist and psychotherapist. Married to each other, the authors would make, I think, engaging conversationalists at my imaginary dinner party, provided that at the table they didn't repeat from their book the following tale by Ovid.The Greek poet's tale is about Erisychthon, pronounced Erisyathon for any name droppers, a mythological character who, because he was so greedy, was cursed to eat everything in sight including him self after all else had been consumed. He symbolizes, the authors believe, the essence of materialistic capitalism, an insatiable \\"monster devouring itself.\\"The authors' main theme is that a \\"critical mass\\" of individuals can make a positive difference. This theme seems to have been influenced by Jung's philosophy that \\"great transformations\\" in history are a summation of positive changes in individuals.The authors argue that material capitalism, the kind that predominates in Corporate America and Wall Street, is unsustainable and thus \\"in a state of crisis.\\" It's depleting our natural resources, creating political and social instability, eroding our moral standards, and degrading the very meaning of life in terms of its deepest values and aspirations. Rather than reject this conventional capitalism altogether, however, the authors advocate transforming it into a more positive, sustainable economic system that they call \\"spiritual capitalism\\" in the secular, non-religious sense.It's defined as the amount of knowledge and expertise available about \\"meaning, values, and fundamental purposes.\\" It produces not material wealth that ultimately consumes itself but a self-sustaining wealth \\"that enriches the deeper aspects of our lives.\\" The authors list 12 qualities that companies \\"high in spiritual capital\\" would possess. For example, they would be \\"self-aware,\\" \\"vision and value-led,\\" and \\"compassionate\\" and would \\"have a sense of vocation.\\"Are there any companies high in spiritual capital? The authors don't cite any companies that possess all 12 qualities or even most of them, which is an opportunity missed because they developed a set of descriptors that could have been built into a good survey instrument.The auhors argue that material capitalism is in a state of crisis, which they say is one of negative motivations, with the four primary ones being self assertion or competitiveness, anger, craving or greed, and fear. Most of the book, therefore, is devoted to explaining Marshall's \\"Scale of Motivations\\" and in speculating on how it, along with emotional and spiritual intelligence, can be used to raise motivation to a sufficient level among a sufficient number of business leaders to produce a \\"great transformation\\" first in their own companies and then for capitalism as a whole.For his scale, which he has been using in his clinical practice for some 40 years, Marshall expanded Maslow's hierarchy of six needs to eight positive and eight negative motivations. The highest positive motivation is \\"enlightment,\\" and the lowest negative one is \\"depersonalization.\\" A person needs to be emotionally intelligent enough, the authors say, to be aware of their own motivational level. This is necessary in order to be able to raise motivations to a higher level. When two persons interact, the authors contend that if one is at a higher level on the scale, then that person can raise the level of the other person. The authors speculate that 2-5 percent of the leadership of any company need to be \\"knights\\" at Level 6 and an additional 10 percent need to be \\"masters\\" at Levels 4 and 5 in order for the company to start acquiring spiritual capital. It would be rare and impractical to expect anyone to reach the two highest levels, the authors say. This, I have just given you, is a small sample of the authors' very elaborate speculations.There is much about this book that appeals to me. I agree with their view that the capitalism prevailing today is unsustainable and thus needs to be transformed, not totally dismantled. The authors are creative thinkers who forced me repeatedly to think outside my own relatively narrow paradigms. Some of their ideas are interesting enough to warrant further exploring their possible application throughout business. I've already mentioned the missed opportunity. Another possibility, for instance, would be to do more applied research on their measure of spiritual intelligence beyond a small pilot test that the authors conducted.Now that I've read the book, I would like to learn more from the authors over a glass of wine and gourmet dinner."},{"Title":"Spiritual Capital: Wealth We Can Live by","review":"The collaboration of Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall, Spiritual Capital: Wealth We Can Live By offers a highly critical view of the business and ethical practices of capitalism as it is practiced today, with its amorality vested in short-term self-interest, reaping profits, obsession with shareholder value, isolationist thinking, and reckless disregard of long-term consquences. Arguing for the need for a radical new philosophy for corporate governance that adjusts the meaning and purpose of wealth creation, and using the principles of \\"spiritual capital\\" and \\"spiritual intelligence\\" to define the needs of humanity and human government, Spiritual Capital is a passionately presented charge for people to make a difference"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"Virtually everything that addresses the presumptive subject of the book, namely \\"the psychology of poker\\", is good stuff that I haven't been able to find elsewhere. Getting into your motivations and the motivations of your opponents in particular is helpful. Some of the stuff is covered in other material on \\"tells\\", but Schoonmaker goes into more detail about the general psychology and less into the specific observable mechanics.However, Schoonmaker is extremely annoying in several ways. He repeatedly derides GREAT PLAYERS (not by name) for being morons who just happen to be tremendously gifted. Again and again he says he doesn't want you to be a great player, he just wants you to grind out a little more edge. The inadequacy complex he displays is an interesting psychological study in and of itself.He says he's not going to try to teach you to play poker, but unfortunately he doesn't stick to that promise. Some of the advice is actually quite good, especially how to adjust to different players (in limit games, though it's mostly applicable to NL). Some of it is just the whinings of a gutless player. Some of it comes from a much weaker theoretical framework than you would expect. In particular, he claims that \\"all maniacs are heavy losers\\" and recommends that players use the absolute tightest and most aggressive style possible. He calls these players \\"Stone Killers\\" which I assume is some sort of 60s slang. I will briefly explain why this is not the case. Imagine the most tight aggressive player possible - always raises with \\"the nuts\\" and check/folds everything else. Does that sound like a Stone Killer to you?In defense of the author, for most limit players getting tighter and more aggressive equals an automatic improvement in their game. So generally his advice is sound, even if his theoretical understanding of the concepts is flawed. Also, despite how whiny he comes off, virtually every player would benefit by concentrating on the hundreds of mundane decisions that are made every session rather than the one \\"great play\\" opportunity that we might see a Phil Ivey make on YouTube.In total the book is a bit of a mash of psychological material which is helpful to experienced players and play advice which is suited to uninformed players (who would benefit more from reading a book on strategy). With some inferiority complex ramblings mixed in. If you don't mind being herded into becoming a tight aggressive limit player this may actually be the book for you.I don't know of a book that is as good on the psychological topics without the downside of this book, but I'm going to keep looking."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"I've decided to give Dr. Alan Schoonmaker the nickname Dr. Poker, since this book - combined with all his previous books - form an amazing body of work that is indispensable for the health of all poker players. If there's a leak in your game, your poker personality, your internal attitude towards poker or your approach to the game, Dr Poker is the man to help you fix it. And because his books are not about strategy but personal insight, they are rather timeless, and players at just about any level of play - from beginner to expert - will likely find a lot of information to improve their performance at the poker table.Since different problems pop up in a player's psyche at different stages in their game play, this book (like his others) is an invaluable reference tool that requires constant re-reading to maximize its value. A first reading may isolate and fix a few problems with your poker attitude. Later readings may identify other problems that didn't exist the first time, but have developed since then. Like physical health, poker health is constantly changing and evolving and this book is the perfect tool as a constant reference guide to refer back to repeatedly.This book has played a very major role in improving my poker health and I expect it to continue doing so for as long as I play poker."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"Consider that there are three categories of poker books; technical books such as those that Sklansky, Harrington, and Malmuth write, \\"tells\\" books such as Caros Book of Tells, and \\"head game\\" books.This is the best I've read in the \\"head games\\" category.The author does a very good job of categorizing different styles of play into four \\"corners\\" similar to a Gartner box; Tight Passive, Tight Agressive, Loose Passive, Loose Agressive. He then discusses and describes these and includes a short \\"preview\\" section you can use as a review before you go play.The author does a very good job of framing this psychological information strictly in the context of a poker game. It is a very readable and very interesting book. Unless you really believe you know everything there is to know (and there are a lot of those types of people out there) you will learn something new from this book.I am developing a few books that I will reread and use as references; Sklansky and Malmuths new No Limit Holdem, Caros Book of Tells, and The Psychology of Poker."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"I would be happy if they took this book off the market today!!! Now that I have my copy!!! I have read more than a dozen poker books by the best and the best of the best. I've learned a lot about how to play hands, situations and math. I became a decent player and had been doing pretty well in several home games I play in on a regular basis as well as my local casino. My game seem to reach a point where I was doing well, but couldn't cross over to that \\"next level\\". After reading this book, my whole approach to the game has changed. It taught me the missing piece in my game. \\"PEOPLE\\"... Understanding who they are and what makes them tick. As the book will teach you, when you know why they play, you'll know how they play. My game has reached that whole new \\"next level\\". This book will pay for itself a hundred times over in a matter of just a few dozen games. I won two out of three of the tournaments I played after reading this book (The book's paid for!!!). This is the one book I wish I had found years ago. the money I could have won is only being made up for by the money I'm winning now!!! Every serious poker player should read this book. If it doesn't get much attention it's because (just like me) I hope nobody I play poker with ever reads this book. I have told most people I play with about many poker books I have read, but this one I have kept to myself. let them do their own homework on finding this one.One word of caution: If you're not willing to take a \\"real\\" look at yourself while reading this book. Don't waste your money. You will quickly learn that your loses are not due to bad luck and bad beats. Winning and losing is all on you. Luck comes and goes for you and for others. You take and give bad beats. If your a good player you have already figured out that you take more than you give because you almost always go in with the best hand. That's because you're a good player. This book will show you how you really only beat yourself. More importantly it will show you how others beat themselves and how that means YOU WIN!!!"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"Well written and very informative I learned a lot about myself as a poker player. The information in this book has already improved my play."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"I was advised that I should read this book at a WPT poker camp and was that right I make more sense in the way you have to look at cash games in respect to small advantages that you may not take in other games of skill but the author really know his stuff.."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"This is a good book for a begining poker player and has useful information. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"This is one of the first books on the psychology of poker and one of the most widely read. Schoonmaker divides players into four general groups: loose passive players, loose aggressive, tight passive, and tight aggressive players. Extreme and nominal versions of each type are also discussed, as are the ways to identify each type. The theme of the book is to decide what type of player your opponents are and then to play accordingly. There is also a section on ways to identify what type of player you are and ways to minimize the weaknesses associated with your type of playing.This is one of those books that is best suited to beginning players because more experienced players have probably developed a similar system on their own. The experienced player will, however, also benefit from the book as it is so widely read that it will tell him how his opponents view the game. Thus, even if you an experienced player who does not agree with Schoonmaker, you should read this book to learn what others may know and try to apply against"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"This book has several topics that most other poker books fail to express. Hence the name The \\"Psychology\\" of Poker. It discusses in detail on \\"why\\" you play the way you do, weather you're a winning player or not. It also teaches you how to correct your inner flaws and mannerisms that you never even knew about. The book has several grid charts to plot yourself and other players you encounter in the game. I personaly view the charts to be flawed and a waste of time. There are several ways players can mix there game up, to be considered plotted on a chart of this scale.The book does not dicuss basic stradegy's (which is a blessing) and starting hand structures. It assumes most readers are already seasoned players. It more so, discusses methods on playing different types of players (4 types, tight-passive, tight-aggressive, loose-passive, and loose-aggressive) and different games. And how to spot the 4 types of players without even playing a single hand against them. The topics are refreshing and original. The only downfall of the book, is the author's tendency to berate himself! (for example... They author states, \\"because I nor you, have excellent card reading talents, we must fall on a set of standarized guidelines on weather to determine the \\"maniac\\" is bluffing or not.\\" blah blah blah.) This kind of talking makes me think about how crediable the author is on the poker table! If the author himself doubts his talents, how can I take advice from him!?Overall, If you want a book to become a better poker player on the felt. There are many other books that are worth there weight in gold (or more!) But if you want a book that brings a refreshing look into the mental game of poker. This is hands down the best one I have read so far. I have to admit, even with all its gripes and annoyances, the book has made me a much more knowledgable player, and has shown me how to defeat the biggest and most dangerous opponent in the card table... \\"Yourself!\\""},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"Most people think poker is a card game played by people. Those who advance to expert status eventually realize that poker is a people game that happens to be played with cards.I have probably read every poker book that has ever been written, in part because I want to improve my own game, in part because I want to know what the competition is saying and/or thinking, and in part because I believe it to be the height of \\"penny-wise and pound-foolishness\\" not to spend a few bucks on a poker book when ONE good idea or notion in a poker book will probably earn the buyer many times the price of the book.All that said, when I ranked poker books written in the year 2000, Alan Schoonmaker's \\"The Psychology of Poker\\" was an easy choice for me as \\"Poker Book of the Year\\" for 2000. Over time, the cards tend to even out. What does not even out over time is our ability to understand our opponents' emotions, and our own.The only think I don't like about TPOP, as I call it, is that it will probably cut down on my profits when I play, because even though it has helped me--and I was already very good--it figured to help my opponents even more, because I had already focused the majority of my poker study energy into the psychological aspects of poker.For a completely raw beginner, i.e., someone who has never played or who has rarely played and when playing has played for very low stakes, TPOP probably shouldn't be the FIRST book you buy. You need to understand more basic card and strategy elements. If you aspire to ever being more than a mediocre player who can hold his own against other mediocre players, and you're not some sort of poker savant or expert who has been winning heavily for 30 years, you should read TPOP at your earliest opportunity, and even if you are already quite good and have read it, you should probably re-read it anytime you find yourself in the midst of a losing streak."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"I bought this book along with the book from the same publisher by Feeny. After reading PoP I was left feeling very flat. Of the information that is correct I didn't find anything that would seem suprising to anybody who had spent more then 50 hours at the tables. The information is laid out in a very formalaic manner which hides the interesting differences between different classes of players. Furthermore the author seems to think that all differences seems to produce similar sized changes in action. I feel this is so incorrect as to invalidate the whole book.When I read Schoonmaker's comment on rec.gambling.poker that his book is seen an &quot;Poker Psychology 101&quot; and that you should buy Feeny's book if you were past being a beginner I was upset. It isn't clear in the marketing that the publisher considers these two books to overlap. Unless you consider yourself _very_ unobservant about human behavior I would _strongly_ suggest not buying this book. You should buy Feeny's book as it is very strong."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"I wasn't a fan of this book.The author is not a great player, and freely admits this himself on more than one occasion, yet that doesn't stop him persistently patronising the reader with \\"I'm not great and neither are you\\", \\"I can't do this and neither can you\\", \\"The pros can do this but you can't\\" etc. etc.He even has the nerve to say you MUST play tight aggressive in order to be a winning player, just because he is not a skilled enough player to win money using a less safe style of play.He doesn't offer the insight that other writers offer in other top-selling poker books with the purpose of improving your game, he ties you down to a bunch of third-rate ideas about analysing what might be motivating a player, when if you're playing against anyone even halfway good they're only ever motivated by playing winning poker.I felt insulted by the tone of this book, and the author who I would love to bust for as much money as possible.If you have any poker talent at all, any real skills, any winning results, any self-belief, and any ambitions to improve and take your game to new levels don't read this book cos it will insult you too.If you are an unskilled player, who is forced to play the tight-aggressive style as a safety net to make up for lack of game, and you play poker with other players who aren't any good either, then give this book a look and suffer the author's persistent attempts to drag you down to his level.2+2 publishing have produced some classic books from some superb player/authors, but this is not one of them."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"I have read many poker books, and now that I'm half way through with this one, I can honestly say that this is one of the worst.The psychology is about as deep as the cover. The author presumes you have no skill or ability - like him he adds - and offers a rigid mechanical rating system that is completely incompatible with today's game, (particularly the internet games).The end of this book is filled with doomsday predictions for those who want to make a living playing. He insists that the pro's make less money than average doctors or lawyers. Unfortunately, his findings are based on a study that was conducted in the 70's. This book may have been published in 2000 initially, but it seems like it was written in the 80's. Perhaps this is a nice gift for someone who already has every other poker book."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"Dr. Schoonmaker is a student of the people of the game. He reports the increase in heterogeneity at low-limit games, and goes on to examine the psyche of these individuals.

A very different and stimulating work."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"Good but not a must read, except of the appendix. Back there, for each of the four types of poker players, Schoonmaker has two solid pages on the characteristics of each type. He tells you how to beat, what styles of play work against each player.

It provided important and useful concepts about the game of Poker. I learned new concepts, which identified some leaks in my game. Leaks in your game can come from anywhere!!! Leaks can originate from lack of aggression, overcalling raises, misreading opponents and any other number of ways. So this book helps. Many people look at poker the wrong way. They think to win they need to do all of this super fancy plays and mindblowing stunts. Well folks...there are not that many options in poker...you fold, call or raise. So its really hard to do thinks that will just fool your opponents all the time. To win at poker it is mostly limiting your mistakes and getting all that you can from winning hands and minimizing losses on losing hands...that's itIve been playing for about 5 years now and love the game. Ive read many poker books and found this one to be very good. So I would suggest you buy this book and maybe a couple others and get to playing.

This does present ideas that you may not run across in most other poker books."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"The intro of this book is the strongest part. The two words \\"think visibly\\" were an excellent reminder for me to take a moment and layout marginal hands before making a decision. It happened to be a leak in my game at that moment. That leak is now fixed thanks to that advice.The author assumes, that like him, you have no ability to read players or make plays off instinct or intuition. Basiclly he assumes you are a talentless player.He creates a system that would better serve a high school math class making silly grids to help classify opponents. It's a nice concept, but one that never really goes deep into the subconcious of your opponents or you. Not deep enough for me, anyway.Maybe it's me. I'm very introspective and a semi-professional player with lots of other poker books on my shelf. I'm always thinking about concious and unconcious motives. To a novice, or a player who does not think this way, it might be a good book.Overall I'm left to ponder how a psychiatrist could allow himself to degrade his readers by telling them, point blank, they lack talent and ability. Especially when he doesn't even know my name. Yes, a man in his position is supposed to encourage you to be realistic, but he generalizes all reader's realities to mirror his -- An inferioir player.

Play Well!!"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"It was hard for me to know whether to give this one four stars or five because it is not the best of the poker books out there, yet reading it definitely enhanced my game. All I can say though is that if you're a beginning or intermediate level player, the volume has much to offer.A crucial aspect of psychology is understanding why we do what we do. Dr. Schoonmaker considers it of the greatest importance to determine what our internal motivations are for playing poker in the first place. Is it all about the money? Well, for me it is, but, for others, there may be numerous factors such as the need for socialization, and a need for competition. He introduces concepts like the eight principles of poker, a series of questions to help ascertain whether you have \\"the right stuff\\" for the game, the law of subjective rationality, and the egoistic fallacy. Yet, all of these ideas are presented in layman's term and not in sentences filled with psychoactive mumbo-jumbo.The key section of The Psychology of Poker concerns The Styles Grid, in which we answer some basic questions about ourselves in order to figure out our style at the table. Of course, the most common style is one somewhere in between the four presented. I will mention them now and give their nicknames within brackets: Loose-Passive (Calling Station), Loose-Aggressive (Maniac), Tight-Aggressive (Stone Killer), and Tight-Passive (Rock). Out of these four, the optimal mode is that of Tight-Aggressive. I believe that Dr. Schoonmaker's perceptions and descriptions are clearly on target in regards to cash ring games, but, should one be tempted to apply his advice to tournaments, you'd be in big trouble. The book was written in 2000 just before the big poker craze began, so the author could not have anticipated just how much the gigantic freeze outs would predominate the way in which we play poker online. If one sits around and waits for great cards then, even if they plan on acting with focused, intense aggression should those cards ever arrive, they'll lose because it is probable that the blinds will eat you alive before you see those big pairs or big slick. You can't play conservatively and expect to make it past the first 90 minutes of a multi-table event (at least online as some of the blinds change at five minute intervals).There was one aspect of The Psychology of Poker that immediately helped my game, which was Dr. Schoonmaker's analysis of playing with Loose Passive Players (LAPs) at the lower limits in what he labels, \\"No Fold \`Em Hold \`Em.\\" He points out that this game is actually very good for the better players as discipline prevails. However, due to so many players sticking around until the river, the overall hand strength is so high that what can win in a regular game is a big loser if five people go to the river. Until I read his view, I could not figure out why I was losing so often with straights and trips. The moral of the story is that you just have to be patient when you play, and, also, to know thyself."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"The strength of this book is in helping you understand why you play the game (it may not be what you think), and more importantly, why your opponent is playing. Understanding motivations can help you understand and predict the actions of your opponent. In poker, knowledge is power, and this book will help you to win pots you may have folded, and lay down hands when you are beaten. The chapters on various playing styles are especially important. Following Dr. Schoonmaker's tips has helped me to get out of the way when beaten, and jam the pot when I had the best of it. Thanks Dr. Schoonmaker for helping make my poker play more profitable!"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book that fills a huge gap in poker literature. While many poker books have discussed psychology, they rarely include more than a few paragraphs or a chapter. This is the first book to directly tackle one of the most fascinating elements of poker.The book divides poker players into four groups: loose aggressive, loose passive, tight passive, and tight aggressive. Each group has different psychological characteristics, and each has different motivations for playing poker. Each group also represents a very distinct playing style - with its own strengths and weaknesses. The bulk of the book is devoted to describing these differences and explaining how you can profitably exploit them. When playing against loose aggressive players, for example, Schoonmaker offers fourteen concrete adjustments that you can make to your play. Such recommendations include bluffing less frequently, check-raising more, and minimizing deception and \\"fancy\\" plays. For most home games, this section alone is worth the price of the book. Perhaps most helpful to beginning to intermediate players, however, is the guidance Schoonmaker provides in helping a player recognize his own style of play and how he can learn to toughen his game by moving into the tight-aggressive category (the most profitable style of play). He uses written exercises that force the reader to examine his own style of play and motives for playing. He concludes with a list of deadly sins for poker players and a refreshingly honest view on making money at poker - \\"don't quit your day job.\\"While the book includes some discussion of tells (poker mannerisms such as a shaking hand that may reveal insights into the quality of a player's cards), it is limited in this respect. If your idea of poker psychology is trying to read the body language of your opponent then you would probably be better off with Mike Caro's \\"The Body Language of Poker : Mike Caro's Book of Tells.\\" Schoonmaker's book also does not devote much text to specific hand situations. If you want to understand the psychological elements of third street play in high stakes heads-up seven card stud, for example, the book for you is \\"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker\\" by John Feeney (although this is a fairly advanced book - definitely not for beginners).It should also be noted that the psychological advice provided by the book is more helpful for home games or low stakes casino games. High stakes players tend to consistently play tight aggressive poker and do not exhibit as many of the weaknesses described in the book (although I have played some high stakes myself and have seen more than a few pros who will slip up every now and then!).All in all, a great book that will have you thinking more about why your opponent plays the way he does AND why you play the way you do. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"When I read the reviews on this book I was confused because of the wide range of views. At that point I decided to get this book. I think their will be few people that really love this book because it will take about 100 hours at the table to master its valid concepts.In today's fast food and ATM's people want results now and this book will not show results quickly because its will take time to categorize people you play with... Especially if you play with different people all the time. In order for this book to help, you will need about 20 to 30 hours of play with one type of player. For the player that plays the cards and/or odds this book is not for you. If you believe the theory that you play the people and not the cards, read this book. It will plant the seed and its up to you to see what grows.The book helps with to analyze what type of player you are and how people view your play. In real life there are a limited number of personalities. In the poker real world there are a very limited number. This book will give you a game plan for the top 4 personalities you will see at the table. If you are dumb enough to sit with really good players that change styles through out the game. This book will help you recognize these changes and give you a baseline strategy that correlates your base style to give you a fighting chance.This book will only be valuable after you master Doyle's or Harrington,s Books.

However, I still stand by the book, if it wasn't good I would simply refrain from saying anything."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"I want to like Dr. Schoonmaker's book. He seems like a nice guy, and he clearly understands that for many of us, poker is still a fun game. A couple of pages are a refreshing change of pace from the macho, \\"everyone wants to be a pro,\\" \\"poker is to win money and nothing else\\" approach of some pro-authored books. That said, his writing style is repetitive and dull. Despite his pleasant tone at times, his approach to instruction appears to be similar to that of an abusive high school football coach, only with milder language. Once you've read him telling you that you stink 18 times in the first 50 pages, you stop respecting his desire to clear your mind of delusions and start wondering if he's actually going to offer any help.When he does get into the helpful content, the soil is very thin and, again, the same small number of points are beaten into the ground. The endless surveys that ask you to assess motivations in percentages don't seem to be of much utility whatsoever. His four player style types are not terribly useful in that they are too overgeneralized, and the analyses of each type are shallow and repetitive rather than broad or deep.This is a good companion book for a problem gambler who needs to go to Gamblers Anonymous. It's not terribly useful for a healthy player who knows his limitations and, rather than wanting to be reminded of his limitations ad nauseum, simply wants to learn. There are some decent nuggets in there, but they're buried in repetitive, awkward language. I just got done reading it, and it's infecting my writing style as I type this."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"First off this book DID improve my game by forcing me to look at myself and taught me how to weather the good and bad streaks. As far as \\"psychology\\" i was really hoping the book would go deeper. The player analyzations seemed to run together which made the book seem redundant. The best way to get the most out of this book is to find the useful tidbits that apply to your situation and style of play."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"this is a good book that centers on why people play the style of poker they play and how to play against them. it provides short questionnaires that delve into why _you_ and other players have chosen a style and the motives for playing behind each style. it basically breaks down players into tight or loose and agggressive or passive and investigates their motives and repercussions of that style. it also contains some usable information for playing against each of the styles - mainly adjustments that you should make for playing in games with these kinds of players.overall it may not contain any earth-shattering info but it does effectively cover an area of poker that you dont see covered very often. this topic is especially applied to the low-limit player. basically, it tells you how to identify and make adjustments to the different styles of players you will find, mostly at low limits. it is an interesting read and very applicable to low limit games.the really annoying part is my copy started falling apart on the first reading. once it starts its like a thread unravelling - more and more pages just keep coming out. i'm probably going to have to pull all the pages out, punch holes in them and put them in a binder...extremely annoying and lame for $24.95."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"This book is so annoying that I couldn't read it to the end.For me it seems like Schoonmaker is an amateur poker playing psychologist, who wants to have something to say in the pokerworld and used his friendship to David Sklansky to publish his ideas.What's so annoying about this book is that Schoonmaker is talking to you as if you are a hopeless loser who needs to be cured. He doesn't stop telling you that you don't have talent and that you need to realize this if you want to improve your results. But of course you aren't as \\"gifted\\" as the pros, so don't expect to become a great player. I don't know why but he doesn't stop creating negative feelings to the reader (on his picture on the back of the book he also looks like a very negative person).I mean ok, most players are losing players, so perhaps I just don't feel adressed because I make a living from playing poker and usually have good results. But which \\"everyday losing player\\" that he seems to be talking to in this book would buy a book about poker psychology?It seems he assumes that the reason why you bought his book is that you are a bad player looking for advice to stop losing.So probably every more successful player will feel insulted by this book.A lot of things in this book look important and scientific at the first sight but in my opinion are pretty useless in reality. I bet not one individual truly improved his/her results and became a better player by doing the self-tests in this book and analyzing himself using this ridiculous style grids which measure your degree of looseness/aggressiveness etc. That reminds me of some cheap psychology tests in a women's magazine.Better read any other book to improve your results.However not everything in this book is bad, the chapters about the different player types are useful if you didn't know that before. (But nowadays you can google the same informations in 2min or read them in a lot of other books that have been published after this one.)However I expected here a bit more depth.But I mean hey, Schoonmaker is a recreational player, so don't expect him to teach you revolutionary things about poker. (Even though he might think that he has revolutionary things to teach).p.s. I've read halfway through \\"Your worst poker enemy\\" by Schoonmaker too (I wouldn't have bought it myself, it was a present from my girlfriend.) and I hated that one too. Same reason, it's too negative. Will definitely not read a Schoonmaker book again.If you're looking for truly good books on that topic then buy \\"The Poker Mindset\\" by Hilger/Taylor and \\"Inside the Poker Mind\\" by Feeney which are much more practice orientated because they are written by actually professional poker players."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","review":"Once you've read all the endlessly repetitive how-to's and studied the probability charts, starting hands, yada yada yada, this is your next step. Schoonmaker, a practicing psychologist who also plays a mean game of poker, has written a book that describes the motivations behind WHY people play poker. The various \\"types\\" he describes are those we've seen in varying degrees at every table, and his insights guide you toward infusing your own game with the basic glimmerings of playing the people, not just the cards. He also insists on a ruthless self-assessment, convincingly arguing that the penalty for ignoring one's own short-comings leads to leaks that will cost a player considerable money in the short and long run.This is a book that indirectly explains why Sammy Farha can get away with playing 9 2 suited against a raise, because it works at taking the mysticism out of intuition and makes awareness a replicable skill.Like Harrington's volume III workbook, this text offers interactive quizzes and charts that provide opportunities for self-examination that will inevitably lead to self-discipline and discovery. Highly recommended for the intermediate to advanced player of both cash and tournament games."},{"Title":"In a Manner of Speaking: Accents of the English-Speaking World","review":"This cassette is highly recommended for those interested in acents of English. Wells offers a more even collection of samples than Trudgill's cassette - although speakers from Europe and Asia (Malysia!) are not included.Some of Wells' subjects read a sample texts, other speech samples are jokes, conversations or even oral autobiography. This mixture makes the casette more interesting to listen to than Trudgill's. Probably it is also easier to use in class, as it will not bore students."},{"Title":"Mannlicher rifles and pistols;","review":"I award one-star because this book, its title notwithstanding, is NOT about Mannlicher \\"SPORTING and Military Weapons\\", it only concerns Mannlicher MILITARY weapons.Of the 240 pages in this book originally published 50 years ago, exactly THREE pages concern Mannlicher sporting arms; EVERYTHING else in the book concerns Mannlicher MILITARY arms.I cannot comment otherwise about the book; I purchased the book to learn more about the Mannlicher Schoenauer sporting rifles and returned it immediately upon learning of the book's demonstrably deceptive title.P.S.

This is a touching story of finding one's self and coming to terms with one's past. It's a story about recapturing a friendship that, despite the years, is still strong. It's a story about love, loving one's self and finding true love. And it's a story about fear, and having the courage to look into one's past...even the secrets that hurt...and come out a stronger person. This story will make you laugh and make you cry, but most of all, it will give you a sense of redemption. A truly excellent read!!"},{"Title":"Places by the Sea","review":"Jean Stone is my favorite romance author and I have read every book she has written. However, with this book, I wondered &quot;What happened?&quot; This is not like Ms. Stone's usual books. Twice I tried to read this book and couldn't get even a third of the way through it. I kept thinking that it'll get better, there will be some excitement, but nothing. The writing style and story seemed too reminiscent of Barbara Delinsky, whom I used to like as a writer, but also grew tired of her books. This book seemed centralized on one character and Ms. Stone normally writes with 3 female lead characters. I kept thinking that someone else wrote this book, not Ms. Stone. Fortunately, I know that Ms. Stone will come out with more of the terrific books that keep my heart racing whenever I see it in the book store!"},{"Title":"Places by the Sea","review":"This was a very good read.

Most excellent material, taking you from the first urges of fulltiming to the 'End of the Road'. As a Canadian, I didn't get the Canadian perspective of many of the topics, but of course for that I would have to read a book written by Canadian authors. The universal areas covered were done so in the most professonal manner and down to Earth. Many good and timely suggestions from choosing your Home on Wheels, managing money, mini-hobbies, housecleaning, security and of course repairs and maintence. A terrificly good read !

While they touch on many topics, none are explored in depth - I learned nothing new from this book. In fact, I felt they kept telling me things that are simply commom sense.

The unfortunate part of this is that a significant part of the book covered this kind of information.In general, the deeper I got into the book, the more elementary it got.

This was one of the few books that mentioned it, but unfortunately, it's coverage is so broad from A-Z with F/T motorhoming in general that it only dedicates 6 pages to homeschooling. In those 6 pages, it was so common sense that I really didn't gain anything from it. Anybody who has been seriously thinking of homeschooling would probably know as much as is mentioned here. The book was also written in 2002, and so even though it mentions the Internet, things were different back then as per how to get it, how to use it, etc. I'm hoping to get broadband internet using a smart-phone router setup, which is obviously a new thing.If you're REALLY interested on homeschooling on-the-road, I'd suggest googling for 'roadschooling' or 'Families on The Road' (there is a facebook page and a yahoo group, too) and learn from that information. The Internet and the skoolie (converted school bus) movement has definitely changed in the last 5-10 years, so you're probably better off getting real info from real people who are doing this. What I am looking for really is just encouragement and ideas. Something a few pages in a book won't adequately provide.My impression from this book was that the author covered a lot of subjects not based from personal experience but from knowing people who have walked the walk.

We took a break from our regular history read aloud and I read a two-page spread from this to him every \\"school\\" day.Ds loved the book! What is there *not* to love about an Eyewitness Book?! The pictures and photography are excellent; these just make for wonderful coffee table books for any ages. Ds likes swords (he has a life-size toy collection) and weaponry (before guns) and I think this inspires his interest in Knights. He sits riveted beside me while I read the text and makes sure I read every caption to every picture. He learned a lot from this book and he brought to the table his own knowledge which was expanded upon. A definite 5* rating from him. I also thought the book was well done. Since the information was all mostly pre-1550, the inescapable Christian content that accompanies this topic was for the majority unbiased and presented simply as it was in the day. For example the Crusades are given straightforwardly from the knights point of view without any modern relativism. The bias came in when discussing specifically Catholic issues, which of course, every Christian was, pre-Reformation. Some statements on the Knights Templar were simply untrue. For example the king of France's vendetta against them wasn't mentioned at all and there were other remarks, that as a Catholic, I had to stop and say this is not exactly true and explain the whole story. I take a mark off and give a rating of 4 because of this. However I do expect this, as I don't expect a mainstream publisher to present Catholic history without a bias. I also am irritated with the use of CE instead of AD, and usually just chuck books by publishers who use it as it is the first sign that historical revisionism will be in place, but as noted above I respect DK Publishing and find they publish Christian information and material quite well for the most part.Ds is currently perusing the titles trying to pick which Eyewitness Book he'd like next."},{"Title":"Knight (Eyewitness Books)","review":"This was purchased for my 7 year old who loves anything to do with knights.

All these lords were knights. At the age of 7 a boy becomes a page. At 14 he becomes a squire. They become knights when they were 21 years old. In the 13th century being a knight was so expensive some remained squires. By 1400 some knights wore full suits of plate armor. The sword was the most important weapon. The mace was also popular. Horses were expensive but important. A castle was a private home used for defense against attacks. Bows were effective against knights. The castle was home for a knight and his household. Women had fewer rights than today and often married at 14. Churches made knighthood a religous order. The Knights Templar were a religous order of warrior monks who fought in the Crusades. Japanese knights were called samurais."},{"Title":"Knight (Eyewitness Books)","review":"Boring, boring, boring. This book wasn't good. It had anlmost no imfo. I didn't like this book."},{"Title":"NORTH BY NORTHEAST","review":"This came to mind today on learning of the death of a newscaster that I often listened to in moments seared into my being. He wrote the forward to this book and offered an introduction of the artist. It brought me memories of Cronkite oddly as I just took it out to say goodbye. I suppose as news has been plundered in recent times he slips off the stage in a time news is doing the same. At a very young four, when my mom washed the windows, he told me of the death of our President, and then I told her. So much he \\"introduced\\" into my life just as he does this work. Space travel, riots, civil rights, artists, revolutions, crimes, crisis and the century moved on. At another time he spoke against a war, on yet another occasion- the last I saw him on network stuff- he was asking Dan Rather if bankrupting the future of our children with a Gulf War was so wise. He had guts. But I never saw him again in the position to ask the tough questions. That voice is the one speaking of his friend here and talking of his love of sailing and the watercolors of this artist as vehicles to capture those feelings.I often take this book out, or put it back on the coffee table and look at the images.On the surface quite academic....I find it very appealing. It has lovely text describing the artist's process, life, technique, and thoughts.There are pictures here that I find quite an escape into the kinds of places I haven't really traveled or ever known, east coast. His actual technique is dramatically good and the descriptions so interesting.I'm not necessarily sure why my brother selected this for me, I was in my twenties or early thirties when he sent it, one of a rare few gifts from him and very unexpected, but it has meant a great deal to me. I would think that it might stand also as the kind of thing Cronkite would do-to share out the work of his friend in this tribute to his life of creating. If you enjoy pictures of the sea,watercolor, of island, of coast, sailing you would appreciate the work."},{"Title":"NORTH BY NORTHEAST","review":"Beautiful art; book cover not in such great shape as promised.

My wife and I are fortunate to have grown up around Cape Cod, and to appreciate the harbors and other coastal scenes that Ellis has depicted in the book. Cronkite had sailed these waters and describes the scenes very well. I do not know if this is still published, and I do not think that it is, but if you can find a used copy of the mid-1980s edition, and I do not know if there had been any other editions, then hold on to it and pass it along. Other family members have received copies of this book over the years as gifts, and my daughter, nieces, nephew, and friends visiting often gravitate toward these copies, which are usually sitting on coffee tables in many Cape Cod living rooms.

Ford is amazing at bringing clarity to what gay people would love to say to their staright friends, family and..... on gay life...you know, the sister who has a son who LOVES show tunes at 10 and she just doesn't get it!The &quot;Marthaholic&quot; (Martha Stewart addict) had me crying-I was laughing so hard and so did &quot;I hate Shopping&quot; where that author and a female friend almost kill each other trying to get a Fireman to notice one of them.Good &quot;Commute/Lunch time&quot; reading."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"This collection of essays made me smile, laugh, and think. Diverse topics range from the light (butching it up at Home Depot, competing with a straight girlfriend for the attention of a fireman) to the serious (putting kids with the &quot;gay gene&quot; on the short school bus, saving the heathen kids from hell). Ford's observations don't always lead to out-and-out belly laughs (although there are a handful of those), but they will inspire knowing grins and comfortable chuckles over and over again. Ford is a talented and polished writer whose prose seems easy, almost too easy, for the wise and thoughtful observations it contains. I especially liked his treatment of the difference between gay men and lesbians (&quot;the girls are still waiting for the boys to catch up&quot;), his look back at his odd Aunt Betty and her longtime &quot;friend&quot; Doreen, and his bust-a-gut funny romp through an online chatroom. Most appealing to gay men because so many of their experiences are similar, these essays will appeal to many others who can appreciate everyday experience written about with a gay sensibility."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"Loved from cover-to-cover. Once again I was made to feel that I'm not the only one who thinks like that, does that, and has a thing for Olivia Newton-John!

If I were to sit down now and start my own book of essays, it would be mirrored by the thoughts and experiences of this very talented humorous man.

Thank you, can't wait to read more..."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"I picked up the book because Alec Baldwin doesn't love me, either. Now I've found a soul-mate in Michael Thomas Ford. The book touched me in so many ways. I found myself agreeing with most of his take on the world. Finally, I thought, a gay man who doesn't like showtunes and likes Shawn Colvin. The stories are very funny, but each is bittersweet which, to me, is the best kind of humor - more than slapstick, it makes you think."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"Ford's description of his dinner with the nearly mummified Von Trapp family in Vermont is worth the price of the book alone. (No bounding Julie Andrews with guitar here.) I brought the book to work and read that chapter to everyone I knew. It always had them in stitches. One caveat though, for the die-hard gay literature fan, this is not the book for you if all you want is affirmation of being gay. In this respect the title is a bit misleading. But the humor is on the mark though, and as everyone else has said, hilarious to the max."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"Believe it or not, I just discovered these wonderful books. It's eerie how many of MTF's feelings echo my own. I HATE Streisand, and getting my picture taken. Ford shows us that EVERYTHING in out life doesn't necessarily revolve around our lifestyle. It's superb the way he balances all aspects of his life into a coehsive blend."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"This is a light read that made me laugh myself silly. Ford takes some of the elements of gay and lesbain living to absurd extremes without being bitchy or self-effacing. Some of his ideas are challenging and thought provoking, which is why it's one of the best &quot;gay humour&quot; books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"I came across this book while visiting Washington, D.C. at Dupont Circle's &quot;Books &amp; Books&quot;. I wanted something to read for the boring flight back to Miami Beach. My boyfriend and I had a very nice experience sharing stories, reading to each other and laughing like idiots. I think his work helps us to look at our many problems objectively in a digestable way, he is rediscovering the plain gay life.

His life gives me the giggles."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"As a 33 year old budding queer, I saw this book, and started to read. I could hardly put it down! Ford's insights in to life and the queer life are so true to form. I already bought the next book(That's MR. Faggot to you!) and I can't wait to start reading it. Did anyone mention that Mr. Ford is VERY handsome?? Hmmmm?"},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"Perhaps I should preface this by stating that I've always considered myself to be someone who, if nothing else, is a man whose politics tend to lean definitely to the 'left'. On more than one occassion I've been accused of being ( gasp! ) Liberal so I now, throwing caution to the wind, wear the badge proudly....so to speak. It must be my Irish/Democrat upbringing! Nevertheless, although my sexual orientation may be considered 'straight' ( Gwynneth Paltrow please call me! ) I one day found myself in Lambda Rising, a gay bookstore here in Wash.D.C., browsing the racks ( and only the racks, thank-you! ). Being the odd man out has never truly bothered me.... plus where there are books, so there am I!Without going into detail of the experiences of a 'straight' man finding himself in a gay bookstore ( a book in itself! ) I spied Michael Ford's novel and finding the title so engaging, and with my curiosity piqued, I started to read....and I read and read, all the while laughing, so hard that I thought they were going to physically throw me out of the store for vagrancy! Well, I succumbed and purchased a copy ( with little self-respect intact after embarrasing myself to no end! ) of \\"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me....\\" and still after owning my copy for a little over a year I find myself still chuckling.I won't pretend to truly understand anyone's else's lifestyle ( alternative? ) other than my own ( and who really understand's the opposite sex? ) but I must say that Mr. Ford's book of essay's not only left a smile on my face but perhaps gave me a little more of an understanding into the life of the average ( average? ) Gay individual. Can straight people say Queer...I'm really not sure what is PC here. Just curious! Anyway, upon hearing that even in humour some truth's abound I find Michael's book a compelling read, and not just for other's of the same sexual proclivity, but for other so called 'straight' guys as well, if nothing else than to help us all better understand each other. Granted some of the book does seem rather like a cliche at times but that's a small point indeed. Michael makes some valid points about these little crisis that each of us face in our everday lives. Plus, I guess I was pleasantly surprised ( why I don't know ) to learn that after all is said and done that we all , to one degree or another, want basically the same thing.... love , security, a little happiness and secure in the knowledge that each of us, in some small way, is helping make the world perhaps just a little better than we found it. Fortunately, Michael finds humour in these everyday complexities and thank-goodness for that! Yes, I did laugh at Michael's book but I also found someone who was perhaps searching....and, like many of us, still is.So whether you're gay, straight or 'somewhere in between' (I'm not sure what THAT means! ) pick up a copy, call up a friend, hopefully one of a diffrent sexual orientation, and laugh and learn at the same time. It's a start. I'm certainly glad I did! Now if I could only get Gwynneth's phone number!"},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"I know many who enjoy this book; I found it not only shallow but downright offensive, particularly in the way its humor, about the protagonist's mother or about others, turns so often on shots at appearance."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"I have all of Michael Thomas Ford's books (just ordered the newest collection today!), and I'd have to say that him and I are pretty much alike.

Despite our different sexual orientations (I'm straight, the author is gay), I related to his crazy Baptist upbringing (my mother spoke in tongues, it wasn't pretty) and his not fitting into the one-size-fits-all category of what a you-fill-in-the-blank person *should* be. If you enjoy David Sedaris (whom I adore) you will love this collection of essays. Hmmm. I wonder what my alter ego has in mind for her next shopping spree?"},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"This title was one heck of a fun read! Especially enjoyed the chapter \\"Dyke The Halls\\" and \\"Singing A Different Tune\\". This book was enjoyable as it served as a reminder of some of the same situations that happened to me in my younger queer life. The two chapters I have cited were very funny and caused me to often laugh aloud. The other chapters were fun as well. Ford is an excellent writer and I don't think you can miss with any of his work. I have read several of MTF's novels \\"Last Summer\\", and \\"Looking For It\\" among them. This title was very different than the above mentioned novels but every bit as enjoyable. I highly recommend anything written by this talented author. You can't miss with him. Don't miss this one! It's a fast read (I read the entire novel on a flight from California to Florida). Thanks Mr. Ford, I look forward to your future endeavors."},{"Title":"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me and Other Trials from My Queer Life","review":"Mr. Ford has managed to pack laugh after laugh into this book! His sense of writing encapsules the gay lifestyle, or at least mine! Chapter after chapter he explains the &quot;joys&quot; of the lifestyle and how to deal with people, or at least his way.
