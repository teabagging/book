This is what Donald Rumsfeld might call \\"a long, hard slog.\\"It's not BAD. It's just not... compelling. Fitfully absorbing, perhaps; that is, the story heats up temporarily and then subsides into tedium. I'm still holding out hope that the pace will pick up in those last 300 pages I can't bring myself to face yet... but Steverino seems to be going in so many different directions here it's hard to get excited about it.I absolutely loved the first four books in the Dark Tower series, particularly \\"Wizard and Glass\\", which I feel is one of King's finest works, a full-bodied fantasy novel remarkably free of some of Steverino's more irritating idiosyncracies. So I looked forward eagerly to \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\"I realize I'm being premature as I still haven't finished it. But frankly, folks, I wish someone would just tell me what happens so I don't have to bother. Anyone by chance have the Cliff's Notes for this book? A novel of this kind should demand your attention, and \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" never quite does that. There are a couple of scenes where Roland makes a gesture with his finger signifying \\"Get on with it\\", and that's how I feel about much of this book.Hard-core King fans will probably go easier on the Master than I do. I love some of his books and stories; others, less so. But so far this is a story that just smolders and never catches fire. A major disappointment."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I'll start by saying that, like many readers, I started this series many years ago and was charmed by the early tales of Roland. Unfortunately, the series has been uneven at best since the second book.While I was never a big fan of Susannah or Eddie, both characters seem to have become even more shallow and one-dimensional. Roland remains interesting, though some of the focus has been removed from him. Jake is probably the only redeeming character, though he comes as a package with Oy, the Ewok equivalent in this series.When it comes to style, King has never been my favorite writer, but this book reads as if it had never seen the desk of an editor. As mentioned by many reviewers, it is painfully dragged out and repetitive. The book is filled with gimmicky foreshadowing meant to keep you turning the pages, which ends up getting annoying.Speaking of annoying, the dialect of the townspeople in the book is one of the most painful and pointless things I have ever had to deal with in reading a book. Besides this, by the end of the story, I felt as if I had been beaten about the head for 700 pages by 19, 99, ka, todash, and the rest..I can only hope the final two books return to the formula that worked early in the series-- inspired, original, fast-paced story telling-- and this can be left behind as an experiment that failed."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"For me, this was a much anticipated release. Having waited since 1997, when the fourth book in the series was released. The time it took for publication was my biggest complaint. In this fifth part of the epic tale of Roland and his ka-tet, the group is met by, what appears initially to be, a distraction to their journey to find the dark tower. It soon becomes apparent, that this is no segway, but a part of the path they must take, no matter what the danger entails.The fifth book keeps me wondering what the sixth and seventh books are going to be about. The story, which in some respects can stand alone, but in many respects, if you have the first through the fourth books of the series, fits in nicely. If you want to read this book as a standalone story, there are parts that might not make a lot of sense to you, but the story overall will still work. The end will make you want to buy the next in the series when it comes out later this year.At times, the book did seem to drag out. However, if you can continue through those parts where the story slows (probably a direct result of being a part of the MTV generation, where everything changes rapidly) you will be rewarded by seeing the pieces of the puzzle fit together nicely to complete the whole picture of the other world where the story takes place.All in all, The Wolves of Calla, tells a great tale of how intelligence and understanding of the world around you, and a little luck will enable even the most unlikely of people to become heros in some form or another. King has created an elaborate world that is separate and connected to this world in a manner that, in time, will be a major contribution to the world of literature."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"If you have read the other four Dark Tower books, you won't even read this review because certainly you have already read the book or already plan to. If not then stop reading this and go get the Gunslinger. You absolutely cannot jump into the middle of this seris. As for this book, another excellent chaper in the dark tower saga. For that is really what all these books are a chapter of one (really huge) novel. I have no complaints except that the next one isn't available yet!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I read a ton of books by quite a few authors and let me tell you something.... They cannot hold a candle to King. If you have read all of the Stephen King's stories that this book touches on you be be extremly happy with this novel , If you have read none of them you be be extremly happy with this novel. Everytime I read a Stephen King book and start to get a glimpse of the complexity that he holds in his head and interweaves into his stories , I am uterly Amazed. The Dark Tower series is one for the ages and should be held in such regard as Tolkein's Epic stories. The thing is Tolkein had Middle Earth, King is speaking of worlds overlapping worlds, intersecting highways that connect the bridges between uiniverse's, that are all contained in a Rose and a Tower! Incredible book ..... Incredible author!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Over the past few years I've been reading through Stephen King's Dark Tower series. I've been doing this as part of an ongoing goal I have to read through many of the classic science fiction and fantasy books ever written. It all began with Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, but since then I've chewed through the likes of Ursula LeGuin, Arthur C. Clarke, Frank Herbert, and contemporary authors such as George R. R. Martin and Robert Jordan. The Dark Tower series has already become a legend in its own right as a strange amalgam of sci-fi, fantasy, and King's trademark, horror.What to say of Wolves of the Calla? Some complain that this volume doesn't live up to the previous four, but I couldn't disagree more. Wolves is as robust and wildly interesting an addition to the series as the previous four, and despite some off-the-wall criticisms, it most certainly does contribute to the overall Dark Tower story arc. What is that story arc? I will try to summarize this vast tale in a few sentences: In the world of the Tower there exist many, if not infinite, worlds. Indeed there are multiple versions of our own world, some where the difference is as minute as a difference in the name of a professional baseball team. These worlds are held together by a metaphysical lynchpin: the Dark Tower. Our hero is Roland the gunslinger of Gilead, a mythic warrior from one of these worlds who has discovered that there is something terribly wrong with the Tower. Its supports - \\"Beams\\" - are under attack and failing. Thus the very fabric of reality is weakening. Some worlds, like Roland's, have \\"moved on.\\" They are running down: time itself doesn't behave correctly, and one day north becomes east and then corrects itself. As a part of this weakening of reality, doorways between these worlds are opened up through various means, allowing our heroes to pass back and forth.The quest of Roland is for the Dark Tower itself. The ancient caste of gunslingers, of which he is the last, has always had some veiled knowledge of the Tower, but as a young man Roland had a mystical experience of it. The quest to find and repair the tower has become an obsession for him. Due to the strange behavior of time, he has been seeking a way to get t the Tower, and the dark beings that now assail it, for over a thousand years. In Wolves we find Roland and his little band of up-and-coming gunslingers, exiles from our own world that he has \\"drawn\\" into his own, continuing on their quest. They are caught up in events in the rural town of Calla Bryn Sturgis, where creatures wearing wolf-masks ride into town on grey horses every generation or so and steal some of the town's children, only to return them as mental invalids who need constant care and die painfully and young. After hundreds of years the \\"folken\\" of Calla Bryn Sturgis have decided to stand up to the wolves and fight, even though their enemies carry weaponry far more advanced than their crossbows. As gunslingers Roland's band are morally required to help this town in need.Thus the tale of Wolves of the Calla unfolds. The whole plot follows the classic pattern of such films as Seven Samurai and The Thirteenth Warrior, where a small band of heroes is recruited to defend a helpless town from ruthless invaders. But of course with King, nothing is cliched, even when he's working with an established narrative formula. I've never read stories quite like the ones in the Dark Tower series, where everything is determined by what Roland calls ka, the rough equivalent of what we would call destiny. Thus while the protection of the Calla may seem like a side quest, all things serve ka, and in reality it is a crucial component of Roland's long journey to the Tower.The actual preparation and defense of the Calla is the most interesting part of the book. The revelation of what the wolves are, who they serve and why they take the children every twenty or thirty years is a mystery that King holds until the very end. In a long tale of over 3,000 pages an author has plenty of time for characterization, and King takes the opportunity to grow his characters in interesting and strange ways. Volume 4, Wizard and Glass, consists almost entirely of a flashback into Roland's youth that shows the reader how and why he has become the remarkable man that he has. We see his baptism of fire into the hard life of being a gunslinger, and we also see how personal tragedy has shaped his psyche. The same is true in Wolves to an extent, but this time the baptism of fire is not Roland's but Jake's, the twelve year old boy from the New York City of 1977. Like Roland, here Jake must make some difficult and tragic choices, and through those tragedies we see his dramatic metamorphosis from a confused boy into a hardened warrior.It is the idea of ka, more than anything else, that drives Roland and his companions on their quest. The gunslinger has a monumental sense of personal destiny. He was meant to find the Tower, and he is willing to sacrifice everything dear to him to find it. One reason I continue to read these books - despite the sheer darkness and obscenity that occasionally show up - is because Roland's quest is, in some sense, a quest for God. In the first book, The Gunslinger, the question comes up of who or what has the right or the ability to sit in the top level of the tower. The obvious answer is: only God. He is the one who is ultimately in control, and I assume that it is He who is behind ka. The idea of God's controlling sovereignty faded through some of the earlier volumes, but here it returns in force. Roland, although not a Christian, increasingly refers to the will of God in Wolves, and indeed it becomes almost interchangeable with the idea of ka. There is also some existential questioning in Wolves, as some of the characters begin to question if the top room of the Tower is actually empty. But I suspect that it is not.It is in this sense that I see the Dark Tower series as an inherently philosophical, even religious, tale. Roland's quest is not simply a journey to save the world. There is also the desire to find what really lies at the heart of existence. What is there, really? This is a metaphysical question. No, it is the metaphysical question. I also see in Roland's quest a desire to find his identity. Roland knows why he is here. Ka has determined that he should find the Tower, the lightning rod of all extant worlds. But yet there is also a sense in which he doesn't know why he is here. He doesn't know why he was chosen for this task, and in coming to that great field of roses in which the Tower stands, he hopes that he can find out. The answer that he ultimately seeks is to the question: who is God? I'm not sure if this is what King is thinking, or even if he would have the ability to articulate it in these terms, but I think that in finding the answer to that all important question, Roland is essentially in a search for the meaning of life. Wolves of the Calla is only one episode in his long search for the answer to that question, but it sure is a fun ride."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"It's been a while since I read The Wolves of the Calla, so I can't remember specifics. My overall impression, though, is that it was just way too long. I have no problem with a long book as long as the amount of story justifies the length, but Wolves felt like it was 800 pages merely for the sake of being 800 pages. King has often been accused of producing bloated work, but the fifth installment of the Dark Tower series is the first time I've really felt it as a reader: a plot that should lead to a taut, tense thriller is nearly rendered into a tedious essay on a society that doesn't really exist. This isn't even mentioning the fact that the detour to the Calla isn't really more than a subplot, anyway, as far as the overall Dark Tower story is concerned. The entire book takes place in one setting, and very little progress toward the ultimate goal is made. If The Dark Tower was a TV series, Wolves would be little more than a \\"filler\\" episode.Another complaint is that so much information is introduced that either never pays off or is clearly just a sloppy mechanism to solve some future conflict. There is a fixation with a certain number (eighteen, if I remember correctly) that is only vaguely explained and, predictably, turns out to be rather important in the end. So much vital information, rather than being discovered, just appears in the protagonists' minds without explanation, like some Jungian archetype. If this concept had been further explored, it might be intriguing, but as it is it feels like little more than a deus ex machina. There's also a lot of conflict afflicting the characters that is meant to increase tension as the time for the final showdown draws near, but then as they finally face the wolves, said conflicts just seem to disappear and have no bearing on the fight.So what's good?Well, there is a great novel lurking in there somewhere, insulated in the protective blubber. I love the idea of a fantasy version of The Magnificent Seven, and the final showdown, in spite of being only ten or twenty pages long, is a knockout. I like the return of Father Callahan from Salem's Lot, and it's interesting to see King tackle some of the exact same scenes, decades apart (to give you an idea of what a geek I am, I actually pulled Salem's Lot off the shelf and compared the scenes in question side by side). Apart from Wizard and Glass, Wolves probably has the most traditionally Western atmosphere of the first five books. The roont twins are carefully and sympathetically drawn--King has always had a way with mentally simplistic characters, although I daresay he tends to simplify their angelic qualities. I also love the mythology within the book, specifically the tale of the plate-throwing woman (don't remember her name, unfortunately) and the unique weapon she inspires among the women of the Calla. The ending is a cliffhanger that makes you want to race to the next book of the series to find out what happens.Overall, Wolves of the Calla is a worthwhile read, if for no other reason than that it's a vital entry in a longer series. I just wish King had gone over the manuscript a few more times, and had an editor who was capable of telling him \\"No\\" every once in a while."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"With the Dark Tower series Stephen King has managed to combine an epic fantasy quest with classic Old Westerns, a bit of gothic horror, and urban fantasy thrown in for good measure. What you get from this mix is a series destined to be a classic.Roland the gunslinger from Gilead and his ka-tet, having survived a giant mechanical bear and other evils in Wizard and Glass, stumble upon the small town of Calla Bryn Surgis. Once in a generation this town with an unusually large number of twins, must give up half of its children to \\"the Wolves\\" who take them to the dark land of Thunderclap for a few days and send them back as raving idiots who eventually grow into giants and die in their thirties. Just like the little Mexican town in the classic Western the farmers of this small community ask the traveling gunslingers to help them fight off the bad guys, but this is no ordinary Western.King has his heroes traveling back and forth to 1970s New York on their quest to save the rose that is the Dark Tower, too, fighting bad guys along the way and discovering the bizarre connections between his world and ours. Also, thrown into the mix is the disgraced Father Callahan of 'Salem's Lot, Maine who just happens to be the local priest in the Calla. Add to that Susannah, a recovering schizophrenic member of the ka-tet, who is carrying something unspeakable in her womb, a robot named Andy who serves the farmers of the Calla by carrying messages and telling horoscopes, and you've got the most unusual adventure story to come out in years.Amid all this King spins out a story that is both compelling and homey somehow. I felt like I was listening to him tell it by a campfire on a crisp autumn night. Even if you are not normally a Stephen King fan b/c you don't read horror fiction give this book, and this series a try. Fantasy and Sci-fi fans will especially love it.Beware if you are offended by violence and language. It is not the worst out there, but this is adult stuff."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"It almost goes without saying that no one should jump into an epic series mid-stream and Wolves of the Calla by Stephen King proves this.Roland and his Ka-tet of three (or is it of the 19 or 99 in this book?) have braved many trials together including a giant cybernetic bear, the calculating Detta Walker, time travel, death, riddle-craving sentient monorails, the twisted wasteland city of Lud, and their first encounter with the Crimson King. All these events are alluded to throughout Wolves of the Calla and as a result someone unfamiliar with the back-story would find themselves questioning their own sanity.But for those of you have have followed Roland in his trials through the Dark Tower 1-4, then this is a must read. At times, the story may seem to be bogged down in palaver but all this talk is necessary to develop a feel for new characters and empathy for the town of Calla Bryn Sturgis.For part of it, Wolves of the Calla feels like a western, as any Dark Tower Book should. But King follows the western archetype even more by placing Roland and his Gunslingers as protectors of a town impacted every generation by taxing raids. With planning, luck, and assistance from the towns-folk Roland's Ka-tet stand up and fight for the town like so many silver screen heroes of the west in classic American Cinema.Ultimately, the story ends with a mighty (however brief) display of violence and once again the Gunslingers remember the faces of their fathers. And although their time in the Calla has concluded, King beautifully adds enough unforeseen conflict within the Ka-tet to drive the rest of the series. So if you enjoyed the previous tomes in this epic adventure, please, for the sake of Ka, continue reading and come another step closer to the Dark Tower itself."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"There is a distinct difference between the books written early in Kings career and those written late. It is a real loss to his career and literature in general that he did not finish this series early in his career.In any event, this is the best of the late ones."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Like so many of you, I love Stephen King. I really do. He has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker. But hey, we already had to read Gerald's Game! At least Gerald's story wasn't very long. However, Wolves of the Calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring. Also like so many of you, I do in fact plan to read all of King's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons. But, knowing this, knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell King puts on the menu--shouldn't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence? If you cut all of the fat from Wolves you'd be left with one tasty little steak, perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine. Instead we have a book that simply doesn't do anything. You know from the get-go what's going to happen in the end and in King's own words (out of Roland's mouth)--that's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes--after a several hour investment--simply do not pay off. I was bored out of my f---ing mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and I didn't even have Frank Muller as the reader to help me get through the journey. On that note, I truly hope Mr. Muller is on the mend. King ... well ... he's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it. But if Cell, a very mediocre book, is the indication of where King's going--is the best of him behind us now?"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen King set the pacing and style of this series with the first four novels in the series. I have read each book and thought that the next was better than the last because he continued to provide interesting new insights and tension, and his tendency to write stories within stories is an interesting way to give a reader more bang for the buck. However, \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" is quite different from the previous four books in significant ways, and the differences make this book the least book of the series thus far.The ka-tet has survived \\"Wizard and Glass,\\" an amazing book where we learn of one of the most important events in Roland Deschain's past. We join the ka-tet soon after meeting a bizarre character more than a little familiar to fans of the \\"Wizard of Oz.\\" The ka-tet is entering the lands of the Calla, an arc of communities that are adjacent to Thunderclap.Calla Bryn Sturgis is one of the towns of the Calla, and Andy the robot has warned Calla Bryn Sturgis that the Wolves are coming. Each time the Wolves come they kidnap one-half of each twin pair of children. The children eventually return, but they do so \\"roont,\\" or brain damaged. The ka-tet of Roland of Gilead, Eddie Dean, Susannah Dean, Jake Chambers and Oy the bumbler are entreated to provide aid and succor to the town, thus being required by the code of the gunslingers to stand against the Wolves if it is possible to do so.The next several hundred pages of the book are devoted to meeting Donald Callahan from \\"Salem's Lot\\" and learning how he arrived in the Calla, and the various intrigues surrounding the characters in and around Calla Bryn Sturgis. There is also an unusual introduction of Stephen King into his own story. Much of the story provides development of the characters of the ka-tet, in addition to the characters of the town. In considering other Stephen King books, this one is written somewhat like \\"The Girl Who Love Tom Gordon,\\" only longer.The story is well written. The character development is well done. However, it seemed to me that perhaps some of this development could have continued as the ka-tet continued on their quest for the Dark Tower. The result of delving into the characters of so many people in the Calla and of the ka-tet is that the pacing of the story slows down very much as compared to previous books in the story. The problem for readers is going to be that you really need to read the previous four books to get here, and if you prefer character oriented novels over action novels, you are unlikely to reach this point in the series. Conversely, fans of action-oriented novels or novels where there is a strong element of the bizarre will reach this novel and be less satisfied than with the previous books.Another problem with the story is that King spent so much time on character development and giving so many hints that I had guessed the nature of the Wolves and several other important details well before the characters in the story made those discoveries. The best surprises come when you discover things at the same time as characters in the stories, not well in advance.I also found the introduction of contemporary elements into the story, which you will have to read to see what I mean, to be amusing, though occasionally a little bizarre as I wonder at the motivations people might have to do certain things.The five books in the series thus far are nicely tied together, and well written. I enjoyed \\"Wolves of the Calla,\\" but I found this novel to contain less of what I typically enjoy in a Stephen King novel, and found the pace to be tedious at times. I provide a cautious recommendation for this book given the extensive amount of time King spends on character development, with only brief moments of action until the last fifty or so pages, where he finally moves beyond second gear into action. I am looking forward to \\"Song of Susannah,\\" because the very end of this book sets up that novel, and I am hoping the pace picks up that book, which is much shorter than \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\"The fifth book adds another 700+ pages to the epic Dark Tower series, pushing the total page count toward three thousand pages. The cross time and space dimension epic is intriguing and usually exciting, and I yet wonder how Stephen King will tie it all together in the seventh book, \\"The Dark Tower.\\" I recommend this series to fans of fantasy and science fiction, as this series combines elements of both."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I began reading King's now epic Gunslinger saga when it was first serialized in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction back in the late 70's. Didn't get reconnected with it until the third book in the series was published. While the series is uneven, the best of King's saga work on an epic scale that he hasn't really attempted with any other novels/sagas.Roland the last gunslinger has one final mission; to prevent the destruction of our world and the alternate Earths that exist. If he fails the world will fall into chaos under the spell of evil. Along the way he recruits Eddie a former drug addict, Jake a boy who Roland let die in his pursuit of the Man in Black but who he later saves and Susannah a wheelchair bound African-American with a multiple personality disorder. He recruits all three to become fellow gunslingers and help him achieve his goal to get to the Dark Tower and save all versions of humanity.The fourth book finds the quartet hired by the town of Calla to prevent the Wolves from taking their children. The Women of Calla give birth to an unusual high number of twins. Evidently these Wolves who ride on horseback wearing armor abduct one of the pair. The abducted children are either never seen again or are returned mentally destroyed but grown into physical giants constantly in pain. Roland suspects there's more than meets the eye here and agrees despite the importance of reaching the Dark Tower to help the townsfolk. Father Callahan (a character from King's novel Salem's Lot)leads the townsfolk in approaching Roland to help them. With a battle before them Roland must prepare his gunslingers for dealing with these otherworldly creatures with the knowledge that somehow they figure into his mission.Although it's a bit long at 700 pages (it could easily have been trimmed down by about 200), WOC continues to develop the characters of The Gunslinger series. King's abilities as a novelist has continued to grow and he tackles this novel with skill that the author of Carrie or even Salem's Lot might not have been able to do. The book features a generous assortment of color illustrations throughout.Although the series continues on with Song of Susannah and the final volume The Dark Tower, this is where the series truly becomes more interesting and complex. If the last two books in the series don't quite live up to the expectations of the previous ones, it's because of the length and duration of the saga. The other flaw in King's book is the huge build up to the battle with the Wolves themselves. The payoff, unfortuantely, isn't quite there as the battle itself rages on for only about 15 or so pages.Nevertheless, Wolves of Calla is an entertaining saga that will continue to keep you guessing. Entertaining as the previous book in the saga was (Wizard and Glass), I was looking forward to the resolution of the plot of this series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I started out really enjoying this story, eagerly anticipating all the mysteries that had been set up to be unraveled. Father Callahan's story, the nature of the Wolves, Susannah's little &quot;problem,&quot; why, like ex-junkie Eddie, I just didn't trust Andy the robot, and many other things. But once these mysteries were unfolding, I became bored with them. It came to the point that I was having to force myself through parts of this book. It is overly long and very wordy, and though I understand that the ka-tet's wilingness to help save Calla Bryn Sturgis' children was just another duty to &quot;ka,&quot; or destiny, this story line drifted from what this series is supposed to be about. Namely, the Dark Tower. I'm beginning to fear that I will never have a clear understanding of the Crimson King, the low men, or the Tower itself.The high points of this book are Jake's coming of age and Eddie's part in the New York storyline. All of the characters are so developed at this point that I actually care deeply about what happens to them. That Roland, the cold gunslinger, is growing a heart is also fascinating.As a side note, if any readers want to learn more about the Crimson King, &quot;Black House&quot; is a good reference. (But read &quot;the Talisman,&quot; is predesessor first; it is far superior.)"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"As several of my fellow &quot;constant readers&quot; have already mentioned here, King's genius is apparent in this lastest Dark Tower adventure.I can't accurately describe how wonderful I thought this book was. After all, I'm not a writer. But I will say that King is able to make you feel the whole spectrum of human emotions within the covers of this book. Not only that, but he triggers your imagination to think of things that other novelists don't seem to be able to do nowadays. Fantasy/sci-fi has always been a take-it or leave-it area, but he makes his series accessible to all audiences, using that flavorful narrative voice of his we have all come to love.The self-reflexivity he shows here is brilliant. It also proves that he still knows how to have fun as a novelist even after all these years in the game. &quot;Leave 'em wanting more&quot; is how the saying goes, and I can't wait until &quot;The Song of Susannah&quot; so that I can go through the whole, thrilling ride once again."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I've read damn near every Stephen King story around, and the Dark Tower is easily my favorite. The weaving in and out of his other books that this series has done should eventually be look upon as one of the great literary achievents. Yes, King isnt Ulysses but he isn't Encyclopedia Brown either, the guy has writing chops.Anyway, as for Wolves of the Calla, I just finished it today after toilet-reading it for about 2 months. I must say i was pleasantly suprised and very satisfied. I'd gotten a little worried because King had really started this &quot;maturity&quot; vibe in a lot of books around the mid-90's. I noticed with Insomnia he started kinda tackling getting old and more serious looks at love and that went right up through his accident. Wizard and Glass was the peak manifestation of that. It wasn't terrible, but it was like a giant, &quot;oh i remember young love&quot; mind-dump for a thousand pages. I was bored, which was double disappointing considering it followed the Waste Lands the most exciting book in the series and I waited 10 years nearly for it.Anyways, this time i really talk about WotC.It was a really great book. I never found the plot tedious or the Calla boring. The only really slow parts were the beginnings of Callahan's story because I knew it was going to lead to something huge (and it does) and I had 500 pages to wade through to get there. I think some people dont realize that the slow build in the book is almost certainly a design. Everything that had to come about in order for them to face down the wolves was important to the broader implications of Ka and the Dark Tower story as a whole. Plus I think it further fleshes out just how iconic and complete a hero Roland is. (as a cynical person, I hope this builds to him ultimately failing as a hero to achieve whatever he means to achieve at the Tower)But anyways, i was really shocked how many reviews actually said Wizard and Glass was their favorite book so maybe I'm way outside the mainstream and this is just me spitting into the wind. If you liked the first 3 books, then this is exactly in that same vein. Connections with other books, extensive deepenings of the plot, and some great questions are raised for the final two books.oh and the best part? when your reading it, you know you wont have to wait a damn decade to get to the next book. GOD BLESS YOU STEPHEN KING!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"haha, i read King when i was a highschooler,(im 30 now). I enjoyed it then. i feel King writings are geared toward entertainment. and that is what i liked about it then. I sure its an Ok book but for me with all the other forms of visual media there is no way a book is going to do it for me. Also it think the two best books maybe of all SK novels were VOl 2-3 of the dark tower. they work very well. The first one was OK and the fourth novel was lame as lame is. Another thing is that I would appreciate having this novel released directly to a PDF version that I could read on my PDA while at work. I might even pay $20."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Ihave not yet completely read this book, however, it is as good as the rest of the Dark Tower series, which is excellent."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I just finished reading Wolves of the Calla, the fifth book in the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. It might be the long wait between books four and five, but I think that this may be the best book in the entire series up to date."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"When I finished Calla, I picked up The Dark Half by King. 50 pages into it realizing A. This is good but B. This is how far Stephen King has come as a writer. Shocking. Calla in comparison to his older ones like Dark Half is vastly different as for once King does something that he rarely does. He abandons the unecessary descriptions that lose you when you are into one of his stories. This book is so low on useless description of every landscape and such that the story really flies. This is high on dialogue and story and as strange as it may seem unbelievably more vivid without such those descriptions. The characters have become much more. Each one of the gunslingers is far more developed with their previous journeys and new troubles. Yes Roland too. I don't want to spoil your possible surpise at this but in short, while Roland is still Roland, his heart has become more a part of his strength then at any time previous in the books. Each character was tested and each character rose to the occasion. But in the end this is not only in my opinion the easiest reading and best written of the books but by God the most pleasantly surprising of the books character concerning. My favorite of the books and because of the investment in the story over the years, I guess I have to say my favorite Stephen King book period. Even reading Dark Half as good a story as it is, it shows such striking improvement over the years in his ability to tell a story. Not insulting the reader's intelligence and giving enough pure entertainment to keep them into some very heavy subjects and catch on to some highly subtle forces at work emotionally speaking, while telling a very large story. Moving on from the dark part four we are in for a real breath of fresh air, especially those who read Salem's Lot, which I did not but I suppose I will make myself read a flipping vampire book now [ as much as I don't look forward to it ]! Bottom line is, this is the most surprising book concerning the characters including Jake and his similarity to someone else that I won't mention, even now. I hope you enjoy this one as much as I did, I lost sleep reading it for a few nights, and I sadistically hope you are just as worried as I am about the ending...appearances. How can some writer put SOME people [many] in such a panic about some story!? He can't,... unless he is really, really good."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Having read every word Stephen King ever published, and having waited with no small measure of impatience for this new installment to publish, I was extremely satisfied with Book V. I like the addition of Callahan and look forward to what happens to our Ka-TET in \\"Susannah\\". My only gripe (and it's a small one) is that the fight with the Wolves seemed to be too easy and over too quickly for something that has terrorized the Calla for so long. But that doesn't take away from a truly great story that leaves you wishing it was next year already and Book VI was out."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"It had been a long while since I'd read the prior Dark Tower books, or any other Stephen King for that matter, so I was really surprised at how bad this book was. I'll treat its story, writing, meaning in turn.We don't move a single wheel closer to the tower. Instead, 700 pages are given over to an all-to-extended homage to Kurusawa's Seven Samurai. The gunslingers stumble across a town which is beset, every generation or so, with a group of \\"Wolves\\" who come into town, kidnap their young, and return them developmentally disabled. After repeatedly emphasizing how once the gunslingers are asked to helped, they can't be asked away (shades of American foreign policy?), and after extended palavers in which Father Callahan tells of his vampire-killing adventures since leaving \`Salem's Lot (as a homeless advocate, a migrant worker, and and a vampire killer), the Wolves finally show up, and the gunslingers, using fancy weapons they discover there, help the townspeople to defeat them. (Perhaps noticing that there had been literally hundreds of pages building up to an anticlimax, King has Roland predict that when the action comes, it will be fast.) A complication develops, and another volume is necessitated, when Callahan, after personally killing legions of vampires, draws the line at aborting an inconvenient demon fetus. He's still a Catholic, after all.Line-by-line, reading this book was hugely taxing. No one ever mistook Stephen King for a stylist, and this book shows why. All the townspeople speak in an awful English-like dialect, in which people thank each other \\"big big\\". (This conceit is ubiquitous and much worse than it sounds.) Of course, it's too much to ask that this community, developing not just far away, but in a parallel world, would speak contemporary American English, but we don't have to ask this. If we can read the conversations of Tolstoy's Russians in translation, the same should be true of King's Mid-Worlders.Morally, I'm not sure what to make of the book. One little speech of Eddie's was morally and beyond the pale, and brazenly so. Channeling Keyser Soze, Eddie threatens to kill the friends, extended families, and so on, of a mobster. This sounds like something like genocide, which we'd expect the traditionally liberal King to come down against, but Eddie keeps confirming to Callahan that no, he really meant it. Is this the part that makes the gunslingers anti-heros?More broadly, the impulse of the gunslingers to help the townspeople, by force, even though most of them would rather not stand up and fight, is admirable. The scenes between the gunslingers and the couple of the stouter-hearted townspeople versus the wobbly masses bring to mind Paul Berman's or Robert Kaplan's telling of American militarists and European pacifists. A couple of the villagers are willing to protect their children by force, but most of them are simple bourgeois who care more about what's for dinner. (A good short story, consisting of these scenes, might be salvageable from the monolith.) Is this what King had in mind? Probably not."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"If you read the prologue and the LAST chapter in this book, you have essentially read the whole plot. What's in between is just materials to fatten up the book, and does NOT contribute AT ALL to the story of the Dark Tower or about the main characters. Having reading this book, you won't have any greater insights into any of the characters.This is a sharp contrast to the previous 4th book, which I very much enjoy except the ending where the characters turns into plastic and the dialogue turns to mush. This 5th book is a continuation of that cheesy, unrealistic set of dialogues that just makes you wonder what really happenned to Stephen King."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I love it!! it came much faster than I expected and in better condition than what was described.I would definitely be a repeat customer, with confidence!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Packaging was a bit shabby for this book.

I'm a huge 'salems Lot fan, and I loved the tie-in w/ Father Callahan. This book takes a major sidestep in telling the story of Father Cal and the demons he battled (literally and figuratively) after leaving Maine. I enjoyed his story even more than the story of the wolves.If you've gotten this far w/ the DT series, you should enjoy this installment. Although it's not nessasary, I'd reccomend reading 'salems Lot before 'the Wolves's to have a deeper understanding of the back story. The quest continues...."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen King's Dark Tower series carries some of the best fantasy type fiction in print, but that only goes for books one through four. Wolves of the Calla was a decent book, but no where near as good as the former books. Also, the main concept of this book was taken from Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, and thus not really original. Still, this is probably the last good book in the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"After finishing the book \\"Wizard & Glass\\" I ran to the library and picked up a copy of \\"Wolves of the Calla\\". After I got past the first part in which the robot Andy tells a Tian a farmer in the town of the Calla that wolves are coming from Thunderclap I really got into it.I didn't get into \\"The Drawing of the Three\\"and \\"The Wastelands\\" this quick. But anyway Roland,Eddie,Susannah,Jake,and Oy continue their quest for the mysterious Dark Tower.While traveling they meet a group of people who ask for their help.Why do they need help? Every few decades,a group of wolves come and collect one of every twin.They eventually let them come back but they're \\"roont\\". Meaning that they are big bumbling idiots who eventually grow to the size of a giant. But it is not really this that is interesting it is the appearance of Pere Callahan from Stephen Kings second novel \\"Salems Lot\\". Callahan tells them a very entertaining story about vampires and such.Another thing that is happening is Susannah (who once had a split personality disorder) is having another problem.From being pregnant with a demon child comes another personality.Mia. Mia is a ruthless\\"woman\\" who will stop at nothing to save her \\"chap\\".Chap is a word that is used annoyingly too much but whatever.I've noticed that Stephen King seems to be ruining the story. Writing himself into.Etcetera. But I still can't wait to read \\"Song of Susannah\\" and \\"The Dark Tower\\". B+."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I don't know if it was just me, but I had a hard time about the middle third of the book. I did enjoy it, it was just a hard read."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Trapped in a world that is often stressful and frightening most of us choose to escape periodically. I often choose books that transport me far away from this world into magical and mysterious realms. One such realm is that of Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower Series\\". Here time moves differently, now fast, now slow, or stopping all together. Our four heroes, Roland his companions, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake travel not only between different worlds but different whens trying their best to save all the worlds and reach The Dark Tower.Like all fans of Stephen Kings \\"Dark Tower Series\\", I always look forward to reading his next installment in the series. \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" did not disappoint.In this novel the four gunslingers and their talking pet Oy, a billy-bumbler, are following the Path of The Beam, which leads to the Dark Tower. Led by Father Callahan the residents of Calla Bryn Sturgis, a farm town, seek the help of our heroes in preventing a tragedy from occurring.Father Callahan tells Roland and his group that every 20 years the \\"Wolves\\" kidnap one child from each set of the Calla's twins and take them to Thunderclap. Weeks later the children are returned mentally and physically impaired.While contemplating Callahan's request, the four gunslingers discover that back in 1977 New York City, (the when from which Jake came) Calvin Tower, owner of the bookstore Manhattan Deli of the Mind is being threatened by two gangsters to sell them a vacant lot in midtown Manhattan. This is the lot in which the Rose grows. This Rose is our world's manifestation of the Dark Tower.With the help of Father Callahan the gunslingers begin to come up with a plan to save the Rose and stop the Wolves forever. However, both plans might fail because one of Susannah's split personalities is surfacing, and the woman that emerges could hold the means to destroy the Dark Tower forever.\\"Wolves of the Calla\\" is an interesting, well written, and exciting book. I think it is the best of the series so far. Although it is seven hundred and nine pages long, it is an easy read. You also don't have to have read the others in the series to enjoy the story. King gives back-story at the beginning.I did find it a bit disconcerting that King not only brought himself into the story as an unknown writer but also one of his creations Father Callahan from his story Salem's Lot. This, however, did not injure the story but simply raised the question of why King chose to merge the real world and this fictitious world."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book made the relatively long period from the last one seem worth it. I was doubting that they could keep getting better in the series, but I don't think he has failed. Cannot wait to finish them off"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"In this fifth instalment of the dark tower series Roland and his ka-tet continue to travel through the ruins of Mid-World and along the path of the beam that leads to the dark tower. This path leads them to Calla Bryn Sturgis, a quaint peaceful village of a couple of hundred inhabitants. Tragedy befalls the Calla every 20 years as \\"The Wolves\\" come to take the children of the Calla away from the village for experimental purposes. The Wolves are coming in 30 days, and the town folk enlist the help of Roland and his friends to try to protect their children from them. This assignment is of course a detour from the quest to the dark tower, but Roland comes to conclude that it is also their \\"Ka\\" and what is their \\"Ka\\" must not be ignored.Clearly \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" has its ups and downs but I feel like this is a very solid instalment in the series. I enjoyed this one much more than book 4 the main reason being that at least we spend the entire novel with the ka-tet that we all know and love instead of characters from Roland's past who have little bearing on the Dark Tower. The characterization is absolutely top-notch in this one starting with Roland who ceases to be this enigmatic boogeyman anti-hero and becomes someone we as readers truly gain respect for. His actions are selfless, his philosophies enlightening and never has he come across as being more human than here, instead of just someone who robotically pursues the dark tower. Susannah's schizophrenia is developed more fully with a fourth personality emerging. And also not to mention the numerous tales told, the best of which being father Callahan's tale, who was the priest from Salem's Lot. King usually frustrates me when he backtracks extensively into the past, but Callahan's tale was absolutely fascinating.Again, I'm sure many readers were probably frustrated with the lack of advancement towards the tower. Well, although the ka-tet never get physically closer to the tower since they always stay in the village this is the book in the series that opens up all the doors to their final discoveries. If it wasn't for their stop in the village, they never would have met Father Callahan and gotten \\"Black 13\\" from him, which is able to open a doorway into the New York of 1977.This novel is setting things up for a truly grandiose ending. It never ceases to amaze me how well King is able to tie in so many elements of his literary universe together, successfully using concepts from books like The Stand and Salem's Lot which he both wrote more than 25 years ago. He even manages to use his own name as a tie-in to the series and apparently he becomes a major character in the 6th novel. On the surface this seems rather gimmicky but I don't doubt for a second whether he'll be able to pull it off."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is, of course, the fifth book of a seven book story. A story which to my mind is the greatest thing Stephen King has ever written. I will not repeat the plot here, but merely observe that Roland's ka-tet makes it way slowly (and yes, it does feel really slowly sometimes) to the Dark Tower. Once again, we are treated to character development (watching Susannah, Eddie, and Jake settle in as gunslingers while Roland ages)and introduced to several more cultures on Roland's world (or rather just beyond it, I suppose) as well as links to other King-works (particularly Salem's Lot).After all this time, the reader feels a tie of family to the story and characters (I first started reading when the NAL paperback came out, and I vividly remember failing sophomore algebra reading Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came in class because of it... now I am in grad school and a teacher myself).This book is a welcome addition to its predecessors.(As a side-note, the book is absolutely beautifully bound. The Donald M. Grant edition is art in and of itself [not even counting the wonderful Berni Wrightson illustrations], so DO NOT WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK! Pay the few extra ducats and treasure this forever.)"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen King is aging. He almost died in a horrific accident several years ago. For him (and his grateful readers) this placed into sharp relief his literary ambitions in 'The Dark Tower'series.He began this series when America was suffering hostages in Iran and Jimmy Carter was president. His ambition was huge - to challenge Tolkien in writing a mythical odessy that would transport mere mortals to a special place, while challenging our precepts of faith, religion, hedonism and love.Well, King achieved this all in Tower I-IV. He also cleverly links many of the themes of his hugely expansive writings of the years. So much so, that Tower series seems to provide a literal backbone to his many works. I imagine he lazily flicked back and forth to the Tower when the whim (or imagination)took him. As readers, we equally flicked in and out of Roland and the ka-tet's trials and tribulations.However, his passage through life has reinforced that even he will shuttle off this mortal coil in time. And time, as Roland would reflect, is a capricous ally to all.For the benefit of all, King has worked hard to bring his omnibus to a conclusion (I have pre-ordered the last two books). Having re-read Tower IV before starting on 'The Wolves', I am convinced he has the makings of a masterpice. He just needs to sign up Peter Jackson now for a 2006-2008 filming in New Zealand and all will be done!In the 'Wolves Of Call' King continues to bring together themes that bedevil imagination. He also continues to draw out the developing characters of the ka-tet. Another fast (and thought-provoking) read consistent in quality and thought with the rest.Once again, I finished, sat back and thought, and thought again. Any author that can provoke as King has with this series deserves every accolade. Buy it, read it, look forward to the rest!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"King does it again. Beutiful prose; wonderful characters; suspenseful plot and; in the end ...a not-quite-good-but-above average taste in your mouth (well in the mind in this case).What i've noticed again and again is...well let's face it even Kings age..and although he's aging gracefully like a literary equivalent of Sean Connery; it is taking him above 700 pages( in the Turkish version) to create the atmosphere he easily created in 200 odd pages when he was young and &quot;there wasn't enough money for the kids' penicillin&quot; (a favourite metaphor of his check the Runnig man and some others besides). I am content with this; we all age for god's sake and i would gladly kill to see the end of the series i first read when i was 12 ( an overstatement here but let's say i would gladly pay hard earned dough). I just miss the harsh edges of Bachman's prose that's all. As Hamsun discovered hunger has its fangs but that's what makes life- and writing- more interesting. As an afterthought check references to Harry Potter and the serial numbers JKR...:) and well ; doctor doom strikes again (stan lee would be proud of'em)p.s f King finds a B-type director-as he so often does-and not a Kubrick equivalent to direct the movie adaptation of this (and i'm sure there will be an adaptation; this is too good to miss)i'm determined to haunt him from my grave...Roland and posse are too good to be wasted....Read this; but start from the beginning to see the rare sight of a bearded English major from Maine determined to create something anew and has lots to prove....after all dreams are like pearls growing in clams....aren't they?"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I have read all of Stephen's books.

You will not regret it. It is a long series, but you will be rewarded with one of the best stories you have ever read.If you are a fan of The Lord Of The Rings, but have never read The Dark Tower, you owe it to yourself to start reading them now. The Dark Tower is the next best thing to our beloved Middle-earth epic."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Wolves of the Calla is a powerful (and long) fifth installment in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. I came with very high expectations. Especially after Wizard and Glass, which is, in my opinion, (along with Desperation) one of King's two best books so far. While Wolves is not as great as Wizard and Glass, I feel in no way let down.Wolves of the Calla is a great book.The Story itself owes a big deal to The Magnificent Seven. This is the Dark Tower version of a border town, inspired by the arrival of Gunslingers, rising up against its oppressors. Will the town have the courage to stand? Will they win the day or somehow become worse off? It all draws down to one apocalyptic battle.Thrown into this backdrop we have the continuing story of Roland and his Ka-Tet's quest for the Tower. Susanah's about to have a little one (or perhaps not so little) and doesn't even know it. Jake is growning up fast. Roland too is growing older--at the most inopportune time. Eddie is becoming a more formidable gunslinger by the day.Add to this the appearance of Father Callahan from Salem's Lot, an unexpected trip to New York, the reappearance of a certain flower, and you get a very engrossing story.I have said this before but it bears saying again: I am impressed with the continued development of King's storytelling and writing abilities.Literary gasbags like Harold Bloom sound shriller and more foolish the more they criticize a master like King. He may be a genre writer who writes in the dialect of the people, but so what? So was Dickens. So was Faulkner. I would stack his work of the last ten years up against any writer living. If weighed fairly, it would not be found lacking.In other words: read this book. If you haven't started the Dark Tower series yet, do so. The first book is a little bit of a hurdle, but you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen king returns to the Dark Tower series after a gap of 6 years, and does not disappoint. This is the fifth novel in the series and it will make no sense to someone who picks up the book without having read the other four. The novel does not contribute very much to the progression of the series itself if we were to measure progress towards the Dark Tower, but it does bring together characters from King's other work (particularly 'Salem's lot) and introduces a major twist with Susannah (spelling?). This novel, more than any of the others, has more a feel of a serial - presumably because he wrote the last three books at the same time. As some of the other reviewers have noted, the illustrations are not in tune with the spirit of the story - they are quite bizzare. I had read the previous four books in paperback form and so had formed my own personal impression of what the characters would have looked like. Susanah is certainly not naked when throwing the plates as shown on the cover. Overall, a very good addition to the Dark Tower series, and a must-read for fans."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Well, another book in the Tower series. I think the Dark Tower series is some of King's best writing. Wolves of Calla will not disappoint Tower fans.It's been so long since the last installment that I've forgotten much of the lingo and happenings from previous books. Fortunately, readers should catch up quickly. Initially, I thought I might have to reread some of the earlier books but I decided against it due to the amount of reading that would be required. Not that I wouldn't enjoy rereading those books. I wanted to get into the new one.This book is not like Wizards. There aren't many, if any, new revelations about the characters. It's pretty much a day in their travels to the Dark Tower.This is a good book for Tower fans. I look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Let me begin by saying, don't let someone else decide whether you should read a book or not. They say you can never judge a book by its cover; well the same goes for judging a book by someone else's opinion. What they may think is mediocre or even down right terrible; you may think it's great. On the other hand, what they think is great; you may think it deserves a place among such crap as the movie Ishtar or the \\"music\\" group Hanson.Here's a little about me so you know where I'm coming from. I am what you would call a life long Stephen King fan. The first novel I ever read was Carrie at the ripe old age of eight. I do own every Stephen King novel in hardcover. I have read every one several times. But, I won't say that everything the man writes is legend, in my opinion. Some of his work, I have found myself unable to \\"get into\\". Not to say that these are bad novels, it's just that they didn't spark something in my imagination that other works of his have.Now, on to my opinion of this book: I will have to agree with others who say that the Dark Tower series is by far some of Stephen King's best work. However, I don't agree with those who are saying that this series is taking a turn for the worse. In a series such as this, I think you should set aside judgment until you have read the entire series. Most of the negative reviews I have read are primarily aimed at the fact that the author's name, as well as one of his novels, is mentioned a few times in the book. Everyone seems to be jumping to conclusions. In my opinion, stating that his doing this is a bad thing is quiet hilarious. What better way to keep the audience on their toes than to throw them a curve ball. None of us know for sure what significance this will have on the outcome of the series. So, why not trust in the author's judgment on this one. Others say he seems to be rushing through this series, just so it is completed. I seriously doubt this is true. Who in their right mind would rush the ending of something they have worked most of their lives on? As for Callahan's story in this novel, I found it to be a good read. It didn't lead them much closer to the tower, but it did fit quiet nicely into the story. I didn't feel it slowed the story down in the least.As I love every book of this series, I will hold my final opinion until I have read the final book. I trust that all of the questions will be answered. But, I will say that the only flaw I have found with this book is poor materials in the book itself. Shortly after starting this novel, I wondered why my fingers were always stained black. Come to find out, the cover was wearing off on them. The sacrifice of having to wash my hands more often was well worth it.Just one final question though. Some reviewers say that they have never been a fan of Stephen King's work and this is just more of the same. My question is, if you didn't like his work before, why are you still reading his books?No offense intended to those of you who like the movie Ishtar and the &quot;music&quot; group Hanson. But seriously, what's wrong with you?"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"From the outset, King states that this book shouldn't be read as a stand alone volume and that you should read volumes 1 through 4 before tackling \\"The Wolves of Calla.\\" The only thing I can say is; \\"Amen to that!\\" I read the first 4 volumes over the course of about a year, finishing the 4th installment about 2 or maybe 3 years ago. I've read the first hundred pages of this book and I've decided to go back and read 1 through 4 again before proceeding. Maybe I'm slipping into early senility, but there is simply too much backstory to sort through without having it fresh in your mind.

The characters have been pretty well developed by now, so there's not much new there ... we know their qualities, and yes, the parts we are bored of.The things I really liked, though, and the things I am looking forward to in SOS and in the final book, are the return to the fantastic world Mr. King has developed. I have always held him in very high esteem for his ability to create complex societies and to make me feel as though I am actually involved. From Castle Rock to Calla Bryn Sturgis and everywhere in between, I look forward to visiting the worlds he creates.More than enjoying this book, I enjoy the series ... and this is not meant to demean the quality of the individual pieces, but the whole is definitely greater than some of its parts. :)I think it is safe to say that I enjoy the world of the Dark Tower for the fantasy of it. I enjoy it for the &quot;insider&quot; feeling when I recognize characters or points from one of the other novels I have worn down. And finally, I enjoy it as a guilty pleasure - my Western shoot-em-up serial opus from my favorite writer."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I picked this up on Tuesday afternoon, and have read it twice already. Even when I put it down, I keep wandering back, picking it up; it pulls at me like the Tower pulls Roland.I love the immersiveness of the Tower books, and this one provides that in spades. I was too busy reveling in the details of the world, the clues that are scattered throughout, the tantalizing glimpses of how it all fits together, to worry about it feeing slow, or bloated. The return of Father Callahan, the examination of the vampiric nature, Tower and the bookstore, all fed my growing sense of where this is going. I'm already speculating on who will be showing up next. I'm sure Jack and Speedy will be a part of it, and Tyler. The mystery of the changing authors has some really intriguing possibilites, too. Maybe George will be showing up soon...or Richard?The sensation of time expanding and slipping that permeates the whole of the novel is only emphasized by the sudden, almost truncated nature of the confrontation at the end, especially given the repeated musings of Roland throughout on the nature of the waiting game. I felt the same way waiting for the book to come out all summer long, then I had it, read it, and now it's over!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"(WARNING-SPOILERS) As much as I like the Gunslinger series, Wolves of the Calla didn't do that much for me. I'm kind of wondering why it was created. It seems pointless. Not saying I won't read the next book (cuz I will - probably in hardback). And I'm definitely NOT saying King's an awful writer (cuz he's amazing -this SERIES is awesome). But this book is poorly structured. For a guy who's taken as many years to write these as King, why not structure the every book tightly as he did the first 4?Here's how I see this series:The Gunslinger showcased Roland's personal journey. We had to see how absolutely dead he was after his world has died away behind him and he retains nothing else but the drive to march onward through the shattered remains. I get that. I enjoyed reading it.The Drawing of the Three brought the first set of final companions into Roland's world &amp; began the process of waking Roland up. Readers had new perspective through Eddie's eyes. The explanations that must be made by the author are really made by the characters to each other. I loved it.The Wastelands brought the other members of the gang together. Eddie &amp; Susanna become gunslingers. They heal what was broken in Roland and allow the reader to begin to love him. They bring us back into youth - Jake and his puppy Oy. They begin to discuss the mystery of the tower.Wizards and Glass gave us crucial back story. We learn why Roland loved and see where some of the coldness in the first book came from. It couldn't have been better placed in the series.All this makes sense. But WHAT THE HELL WAS THE WOLVES OF THE CALLA DOING AFTER THESE? It doesn't bring in any new crucial characters (unless we're getting stuck with the Reverend -maybe that's it. I'll come back to that.) Maybe, just maybe, King was trying to do this:1. Jake's passage into manhood.2. Roland's body begins to fail.3. The sundering of Suzanna's psyche.4. Eddie understands what it means to be a Gunslinger (not just the shooting part).5. Father Callahan joins the ka-tetI've got to say, none of these are a compelling reason to read a novel. They're all BEGINNINGS that don't get concluded, and leave you hanging in a way that none of the other novels have. Taken one by one:1. If this book was REALLY going to be about that, it should have actually had more Jake time. And more time where he was actually participating in pre-adult activities and then making the passage to manhood. Also, he'd already passed into manhood in the Wastelands, when he trusted his psychotic brain over the rest of the world and went in search of Roland. And if WOTC was his goodbye to innocence, it doesn't work on two levels. One, Jake is never innocent. Roland's perceptions of him are. The towns perceptions are. If we were supposed to be nostalgic, King should have spent some time putting that into Jake's portion of the story, instead of having other characters report it. But the only time we're reading from Jake's perspective, he's either agonizing over adult decisions he's going to make, or making them and acting like an adult. He's never innocently jumping out of the hayloft - he may be jumping but he's also thinking about family relationships and the consequences of his actions. If this story were about the loss of his innocence, he would have had some innocent thoughts. And, as a second proof: part of the reason Jake's great character is that he's a mix of innocence and intuition. Take that away and he's just an undergrown man. Maybe King's going to focus more on intuition and less on innocence in the coming books, but it's the combo that keeps me interested. Like in Wasteland, when he gives up because he's not sure that Roland can track him, I loved knowing Roland would come for him. And I loved the fact that he STILL saved himself.2. Roland's been loosing appendages since book one. If WOTC was written to show us this, it's a colossal waste of time. Fit it in with the next REAL story line and let us go on. I mean, seriously. Of course his body's going to fail. He's been around for 1000 years. And he's remembering how to live again. That's right when bodies cut out on you.3. Yes, I'm ok with the sundering of Suzannah's psyche. BUT. Her pregnancy only begins in this book. It doesn't end here. And a whole book with her/mia crawling around touching her stomach does not work. Even though the banquet scenes were creepy and I totally love Mia, it's not enough.4. Eddie's already a gunslinger. We read this passage in Wastelands. I'm happy with the man - he's more sensitive than Roland &amp; can see past Roland's crap. His shining moment is when he talks in front of the town. Sure, it's hard work talking to townspeople when you know they're gonna die. And Eddie's not the world's most ready made diplomat. That's fine. But his character arc in this story is so short it's the size of a banana. This is not major enough to have a book on it. It's just not.5. The fly in my ointment. When I started writing I'd forgotten Father Callahan. Because, although we get his story over two long palavers, I just don't care about him the way I do anyone else. Maybe I'm jealous. Maybe I don't get the references King makes to Salem's Lot (I haven't read it). In any case, FatherC doesn't work. HOWEVER, I'm willing to admit when I'm wrong: I think he's the reason King wrote this book. If Callahan goes to the tower, I'll understand what the purpose of WOTC.But I don't have to like it."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I officially hit the point in the dark tower series where I said \\"OK, I'll just read the rest of them just to say I did it\\" when I read this book. The whole time I was reading it I couldn't figure out what the effing point of the whole story was. I suppose you can look at it in two ways,1-If you're just interested in reading about \\"a\\" story of the Ka Tet as just because of the characters this could be fun.2-If you're looking to read \\"the\\" story of the Ka-Tet you're going to be asking yourself what the hell does this book have to do with anything. The actual quest for the tower seemed to end in book three. Book 4 was a \\"flashback\\" (though acceptable in my opinion), and then this book finds out heroes with some villagers helping them with their personal problems like they are heroes for hire. Nothing really to do with the dark tower. Not to spoil too much but book 6 pretty much is the conclusion of this book where the dark tower is barely even mentioned.Basically after the third book there is a HUGE detour you take and it's not until book 7 (which I'm on right now) that things seem to come back on track. I'm sure he'll incorporate all the elements from books 4, 5 and 6 into the final one (what good writer wouldn't?) but it's all seemed like it was just being made up as he went along."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"After breezing through the first four novels at a frenetic pace, this novel took over a year to finish. After the first 400 pages i couldnt read it anymore and needed to take a long break from the Dark Tower novels (marvel comics graphic novels renewed my intrest). After page 500 or so/ Callahans second tale, the book gets better.Two main problems i had, was that this book took 880 pages to build up to a fight that lasted all of 9 pages. 9 pages! out of 925!Secondly, what made this series so compelling was the setting and atmosphere. Old Western, mixed with Kings horror, Tolkiens fantasy and with this North Central Positronics decayed technology mystery spred through out. Now not only does King change this dynamic by inserting everything he posibably could and it just comes across as a muddle of ideas with no linear progresion. Why a Star Wars lightsaber and not a unique device? Why a Harry Potter sneetch? Why put in other characters from your other novels? And why insert yourself as a Deus Ex Machina?If this epic is ever to be adapted to big screen or tv, then whoever does the adaption needs to over look books 5 and on, and come up with a better ending for the ka-tet, otherwise it will be laughable."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Truthfully, this book feels like filler. The other books in this series were well done in terms of pacing and character development. Each book had a theme that King stuck close to- The Gunslinger was obviously about developing Roland and his quest, The Drawing of the Three gave color and life to 2/3s of Rolands ka-tet, The Wasteland was in very large part Jake's tale, etc. This book is not as well executed.Wolves has a very rushed feel. Too much information is thrust upon the reader at once. Too many subplots or minor details become all-important to Roland's quest, another major character with a very detailed background makes the scene, and the first half of the book generally becomes such a mish-mash of ideas that it seems more like an information dump than an actual tale of the quest for the Dark Tower.Pacing gets better halfway through, and the tale of Calla Bryn Sturgis and Roland's ka-tet takes on a very Spaghetti Western quality a la The Magnificent Seven, that is to say low-brow gunslinging action- but in a good way.Enjoyable, and absolutely vital reading if you're following Roland's adventures to the end. But definitely not the best of the currently available books."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"While my favorite Dark Tower book is currently &quot;The Wastelands,&quot; I found &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; to be a highly enjoyable and page-turning continuation of the saga. It definitely has the same mystique and follows in pretty much the same style as the other previous installments. Put another way, if you enjoyed the other Dark Tower novels until now, you will no doubt enjoy &quot;Wolves of the Calla.&quot; I won't rehash the plot but rather, simply give my two cents as to what I liked and didn't like:-King really develops Jake's character and makes him into a believable hero despite his young age. We can really see the change he goes through, from the naive and innocent little boy to the mature, wiser-than-his-years gunslinger he becomes, although not necessarily by choice.-Susannah's character also gets more developed in the sense that her role in finding the Dark Tower becomes clearer. And it seems that her role will have an even greater impact than we know, as is suggested by the title of the upcoming sixth novel, &quot;Song of Susannah.&quot;-I found Father Pere Callahan to be quite an engaging new character, a great way to &quot;spice up&quot; the saga.-The battle with the Wolves, which I found somewhat disappointing and rather cliched. We have the obligatory plot twist before it even begins when Frank Tavery breaks his ankle, just for some added suspense. Nothing wrong with that, but it's nothing new. Then the battle begins. It's certainly exciting but little more than that. None of the ka-tet even gets a scratch, but of course we have the obligatory sacrificial death of 2 members of the Folken. King sets us up throughout the novel to think that the Wolves are some sort of almost-unstopable creatures, and yet they pretty much get their ass*s kicked in very little time. What was all the fuss about really? King could have done a LOT more with this showdown against the Wolves. It starts off great but quickily turns into a by-the-numbers battle. Sort of like the battle in &quot;Wizard of Glass&quot; where young Roland &amp; Co. clean house and make the bad guys look like fools when that totally contradicts what King set them up to be.But my disappointment with the battle with the Wolves is my only gripe with &quot;Wolves of the Calla,&quot; hence why I didn't deduct more than 1 star. I would highly recommend this fifth installment to any fan of the Dark Tower series or Stephen King in general (although you would be doing yourself a huge disservice by skipping the previous 4 novels and beginning with this one, something that I've seen some people do). As another reviewer has mentioned, a mediocre King tale is still loads better than other novels, and I would agree. I along with all the other Dark Tower fans eagerly await the final 2 installments."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"As Dark Tower books go, Wolves of the Calla is pretty darn good -- certainly a step up from the turgid, soap opera nature of Wizard and Glass. However, it's just not as good as previous novels, with Drawing of the Three and The Waste Lands being the best so far. As a fan of King's 'Salem's Lot -- one of his best early books -- I was intrigued by the addition of Father Callahan, but I found myself wishing the man would shut up as he relayed his own story following the events of the Lot. I especially grew tired and annoyed with the speach patterns of the Calla-folk, \\"say thank ya.\\" The ending is most interesting and I look forward to seeing what King pulls out of that magic hat of his in the last two books. The negative point to this book is an old one as concerns King's ability to write on and on and really give you nothing new in way of plot, but I've got too much invested in these characters so I'm certainly not going to stop now."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Roland and his ka-tet move on after an encounter with Flagg, aka Farson, Marten, Richard Fannin and others. Along their journey they meet some residents of a nearby town, Calla Bryn Sturgis. One of these men is Father Callahan from &quot;'Salem's Lot.&quot;They are asked by some of the residents to help save their children from the Wolves. The wolves come every generation or so and take one child from every set of twins. Nearly every child is born as a twin. The kidnapped children are returned but to a sad life of being &quot;roont,&quot; feeble-minded and with odd physical characteristics causing an early and very painful death.This time the townsfolk intend to fight. Though some members of the town think it's better to leave things the way they are, it's better to give half of their children than to have all of them killed and their town destroyed.Meanwhile, Susannah is unaware that she is pregnant, not with Eddie's human child but with a demon child, spawn of the night she spent holding down an evil entity while Roland drew Jake into his world. The moment of birth is soon coming, but will this demon child allow Susannah or any of the others to survive?In addition to that crisis, Father Callahan shows Roland and Eddie something that he's had hidden under the boards of his church for years. Something with a powerful force and it's waking up. It is another piece of the &quot;wizard's glass,&quot; this one is the black orb that allows one to travel through different worlds, otherwise known as todash.The ka-tet (mostly Jake and Eddie) travel back to New York where they check on the vacant lot and the rose growing there (this may be the Dark Tower). They learn that this lot is in danger, Flagg may be just about to get his hands on it. If Flagg wins this one, the Dark Tower is lost for sure. The ka-tet must buy this lot and protect it.The whole book brings together so many integral pieces of the mystery surrounding the Dark Tower and how Roland and ka-tet will come to save it (or will they?) as well as answers many of our questions about the series while it ties in &quot;'Salem's Lot.&quot; We even have a fun little treat at the end, tying in Stephen King just like in some of his movies.The people of the calla are mostly lovable and it's tempting to speak in their dialect after spending hours reading the book.This book was definitely worth the wait."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I picked up the Gunslinger Nov 19 and finished Wolves of the Calla just now (Jan 11). I've never read over 2600 pages of text in such a short time span and don't believe I ever COULD do so with my current schedule. This was an uterly fantastic read."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book is so well written I left it feeling very satisfied, like I had just finished making love. The purpose of the book?, well, it is just setting the series up for a classic Steven King ending. He makes you love and connect with characters so much (bag of bones comes to mind), that when they are soon after disposed of, maimed, or lost forever, it really evokes a lot of emotion in the reader. This book is simply the set up. It is very necessary, very entertaining, and very much the &quot;fix&quot; all Dark Tower junkies needed after the dry spell, and before the Big Bang conclusion that I am confident The King will deliver."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The book itself is amazing just like King's previous installments to this series. One thing, however, depreciates the value of this book and that's the illustrations. The man who drew the pictures for this book is untalented to say the least. Almost none of the illustrations even come close to verifying the text on the page. Those with any sort of imagination would find it insulting to find such pictures used as a representation of the plot. Dear Stephen, pay more attention when choosing who will depict your stories next time. The woman on the cover of the book jacket is a black woman with &quot;tight curls&quot; in the story, yet in the pictures she looks more like a Native American. Go back to comic books Wrightson."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Considering the fact that most Stephen King fans who have read the other 4 Dark Tower books won't be bothering to read the reviews about it (because they - like me - will be buying and reading it none-the-less), this review is actually written to YOU, the relatively new Stephen King reader or YOU, the person thinking of buying this book as a gift for someone else. If you are one of those two types, here is my short advice:Don't buy this book.If you're new to Stephen King, then you will be happier in the long run if you start with many of King's earlier works (like 'Salem's Lot or The Stand). In this novel, Wolves of Calla, he references many of his other books and characters and settings. These references will either be lost on you or confuse you and will take away from the level of enjoyment this book offers.If you're getting it as a gift, be aware this novel is book 5 of a long and complicated series. Reading this book as a stand alone novel would not be pleasant or appreciated. Make sure whoever you are buying for has read the other Dark Tower novels and enjoyed them. Not all Stephen King fans have liked this series because it does differ from his normal &quot;scare me silly&quot; style.Hope that helps."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Now, I have to admit that when I read the first of the Dark Tower novels, I was not much impressed. The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger had been difficult to find at first, so when I finally found it, I was really looking forward to jumping right into it. I was disappointed--there didn't seem to be much going on, and Roland was not a very captivating character. I have since learned to be fairer on this subject, as the DT novels have been the backbone of King's career since his graduation from the University of Maine in 1970. Thus, the non-DT novels that connect to this series are made that much more interesting, and the rest just seem peripheral and duller by comparison to me now.I didn't really give the DT series a second chance until I read Wizard and Glass in 1998. I really connected with the romance and the sadness (my feminine side asserting itself?) in that book and, contrite for my hasty judgement, went back and re-read the first book along with The Drawing of the Three and The Waste Lands, then re-read Wizard and Glass with the context firmly set in my mind. I became a DT fan, and waited anxiously for Wolves of the Calla. Now it's here, and I am most of the way through it, and I must say it was worth the wait. I agree that the characters have really matured--Eddie Dean is more thoughtful and less annoying, Jake and Susannah both are proven to be much deeper than they might have initially appeared, and I wish I had a pet like Oy. Roland, too, is not just a taciturn, morose cowboy--Wizard and Glass proved that conclusively enough--and a much more sympathetic character now. I actually find the quirks of Calla speech to be rather endearing (find myself wanting to use them, do ya, in regular conversation, say thankya big-big), although I'm still trying to figure out the Mid-World accent (seems to be a strange mixture of Highland Scots, Mexican, and Down East Yankee).What I find most encouraging, however, is to note (in the Final Argument) that the sixth and seventh (i.e. the last two) installments in the series are due out within this year. Perhaps King's finally run out of story material, and plans to retire with these last two books as his legacy to modern literature?"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla is incredible. It has been a long time since I have read the last book in the series and I wasnt sure if I would remember what happened but as soon as I started turning the pages I was quickly engulfed in his world.Even though this book does not really get Roland and his companions any closer to the dark tower it does move the story along nicely and only Stephen King has the magic to completely wrap you up in this world and make it seem so believable.For those of you complaining about the illustrations who cares they have no effect on the story wahte=soever. ANd by the way if you actually look at them you will notice that Susannah is not naked on the cover and the two rizas that did not land where it said they would in the book have no shadows so they havent even landed yet.Anyway the book is amazing read it you will not be too dissapointed unless you think you can catch the drift of the story by the pictures. Oh and I liked his little shout-out to Tolkien by naming the general store Took's very cute"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Once again the master of storytelling strikes gold with Wolves of the Calla. I am an audio listener and was most apprehensive by the new reader who had big shoes to fill replacing Frank Muller. It did not take long for George Guidall to grow on me and it was a thoroughly enjoyable read. Those that criticize the cultural language (thankya big big, ya kin, may it do ya, etc) as annoyances would benefit from the audio version. The language and inflection brought richness and depth to the story/sub-stories and is perhaps my favorite part of the book.All in all a terrific story, and I thank ya."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I was anxiously awaiting the 5th installment of the Dark Tower series! I started reading the series in the late 1980's and have followed it faithfully.Wolves of Calla is simply a good read. It brings the gunslingers in a new direction and we see the characters growing older and wiser. Stephen King has this ability to pull you into his stories and make your heartbeat speed up with suspense.We see a part of Roland that we haven't seen in earlier installments and Eddie is becoming a fierce gunslinger. Jake is old for his age and Susannah has many hidden surprises......I loved the book! When I finished the book I was saddened because reading other books afterwards just wasn't the same as reading a book of King's magnitude.Stephen King has outdone himself with the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"You can almost feel King rounding the corner in WOLVES OF THE CALLA, gathering speed as he heads towards the long awaited conclusion of this massive epic. After three decades, the end is finally in sight.In this fifth installment of King's DARK TOWER series, Roland and his ka-tet are still on the path of the beam. Their quest has led them to Calla Bryn Sturgis, an agricultural town beyond the forests of Mid-World and in the shadow of the ominous dark city of Thunderclap. As they approach the city, they are met by a group of desperate townspeople who beg them for help against a foe so implacable that many in the town have long since given up hope. Among this delegation is a familiar face from King's canon, the unfortunate Father Donald Callahan, former resident of Jerusalem's Lot,Maine.The townsfolk of Calla fear an army of beings they refer to as wolves, which descends from Thunderclap once each generation to abduct their children. Not just any children, mind you, but one half of each pair of the twins who live there in surprising numbers. Months after their abduction, the victims are returned to the village, robbed of some vital spark, doomed to grow into slow witted, short lived giants. Having seen signs that the wolves' next invasion is imminent, the people of Calla beseech the gunslingers to help them.Bound by their code, the gunslingers have no choice but to cast their lot with the villagers. What follows is a period of preparation and soul searching, as hidden depths and hideous duplicity are discovered within the group. The day the wolves reappear, they find a newly defiant population, willing to do battle to protect their progeny, even if that entails the ultimate destruction of the entire village.Always a powerful storyteller, King really hits his stride in WOLVES, which, as he acknowledges in an Author's Note, is essentially a western draped in the clothing of the fantastic. King works the tropes like a master, delivering a gripping and satisfying tale, simultaneously positioning his characters for the final battle to come. Along the way, he pays homage to several diverse works of fiction, among them THE LORD OF THE RINGS and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, further strengthening the links between this and past works, at one point dipping a toe into the murky waters of metafiction. A powerful new novel of blood, passion, and, in King's own parlance, resistance, WOLVES OF THE CALLA is winning entertainment from one of modern fiction's brightest lights."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla, although a little slow at first, proved to answer a lot of questions for fans of the Dark Tower series. I was very curious about the outcomes of several plot twists in Wizard and I got some answers. However, I was left having more questions! I can hardly wait till the next segment comes out to find out what happens next. I really enjoyed the comeback of Father Callahan, who was one of my favorite characters in Salem's Lot! And of course there's always Randall Flagg, a.k.a. The Crimson King to start all kinds of trouble for the gunslingers. I would recommend this book, but I would read the other books in the series before tackling this one!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I very much enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any fantasy/horror fan, it is a fine addition to the series. It was a little slow to begin with, took about 50-75 pages to really get into it, but once I was past that, it was hard to put down. Others have complained about all the time spend on Father Callahan, and I admit that his story was pretty indepth, but as with the other major characters in the ka-tet, his history was needed. For the most part, the other members we have had a chance to explore and learn their history/stories as we go along, with an extensive section of writing done about them when they are first introduced. I see the same with Callahan, the only difference being he is being added near the end of the series so King doesn't have the luxury of spreading out Callahan's history/story over several books like the others. Overall, very pleased with the book and am anticipating the next installment of the series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"It seems to me that almost every time I get \\"hooked\\" on a series, especially one that lasts as long as this one has, I am almost always disappointed finally. This book has not disappointed me, although I admit I would keep reading the series even if it did (for a sense of completion, at least). This is probably King's \\"magnum opus\\"-- the writing which I believe he must feel defines his career and guarantees him a place in literary history. I can say that I haven't loved every one of his books--but I have loved every one of them in this series-- including this one.Like the \\"third from the end\\" book it is, it does NOT answer any final questions. It's a stepping stone to an end, one that I still cannot predict (that makes me happy). I am anxious to move along on the beam to the next story, the next waystation with the ka-tet. But for now, I rest satisfied that this book was worth reading.The book ties contemporary literature and more of King's work into Roland's world, delightfully so in many spots. The places where King most artfully mixes a popular culture reference of some sort are the ones that make me look most forward to the next books-- I want to know where he's going with this trend, because for now, I don't see it. There is enough \\"backstory\\" so that if it's been a while since you read the last books in the series, you don't have to go back (although it's a pleasure to do so). But you won't be lost wondering \\"when did that happen?\\" and yet you won't be frustrated reading TOO MUCH recap (which happens in a lot of series books, too.)The illustrations were an interesting touch I didn't remember from the past books till I looked at them again-- I'm not exactly sure what their purpose is, but I am not against them. I would and will read this book again-- and I am glad that King has finally come to the beginning of the end in the series upon which I have followed him over 20 years (since I was barely Jake's age, myself!)."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"It's still hard to believe so much time has passed since the first Dark Tower book, The Gunslinger, came out, and I read it thanks to the weirdness of our local library actually ordering some 10 copies (regionally) of the original Donald M. Grant printing. Still, it has been a very long journey with Roland, Jake, Eddie, Susannah and Oy, along with all of the ghosts from Roland's and his ka-tet's pasts, but it has all been worthwhile.Wolves of the Calla, however, is the best entry in the series yet. After the, I feel, unfairly maligned Wizard and Glass, a lot of movement was needed, and movement is what we get in Wolves, and how! From the opening chapter, meeting with the Jaffords on their farm, to the closing pages, this brilliant bit of writing will have you completely glued to it until the last bitter word. I can't wait until the final two chapters in the series come out in 2004, although it will be sad to bid farewell to Roland's world, which we've all come to know and love so well.Also, please please please give these books a chance even if you're not a Stephen King fan. They really are some of the most brilliant modern fantasy novels ever written, and I am always saddened to see them pigeon-holed in the horror or popular fiction sections when there is a fantasy section in a shop, just because of who wrote them. So, please, give them a shot. They're different, but really superb."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"'Wolves of Calla' is not the best book in the Dark Tower series, but it is still a great read. Stephen King once again takes Roland and his ka-tet farther into the waste lands towards the ultimate goal, being the dark tower. While there were admittedly slow parts(which knock off one star) in this 700 page read, the book is still hard to put down. As an admitted fan of the Dark Tower Series, I found this book to be a fitting addition and well worth the wait. Dispite the short foreword, this book really would be more enjoyable to someone who has read the first four parts of the series prior to reading 'Wolves of Calla'. The foreword is more of a refresher then it is a discription of the past books. While someone could possibly pick up this book and read it without reading the first four, I do believe it would lessen the reading experience. If you are a follower of the Dark Tower series, you owe it to yourself to get your hands of 'Wolves of Calla'. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This one is worth the wait. The best book of the series yet. It has everything you could want, action, adventure, love, and mystery. Be sure to read the others first to get the full flavor of the story. Without that you won't appreciate the characters nor the overwhelming amount of story that exists to make this series the best any writer has every come up with.Very addictive read. I had it finished in about 4 days."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Although it is neither as gripping nor as emotionally engaging as its predecessors, 'Wolves of the Calla' still offers an exciting and engaging read, with more than enough plot twists to keep even the most jaded readers interested. A few of the twists are so surreal as to be jarring-one involves an explicit J.K. Rowling reference; another, an oblique nod to Vonnegut*-but previous experience with King justifies faith that he will eventually resolve the can of literary worms he's opened here.As in the series' previous installments, King tosses in a few goodies for readers of his earlier books: the Low Men and their lost-pet posters from 'Hearts in Atlantis', for instance. The most overwhelming, of course, is the re-introduction of fallen vampire hunter, the ex-Father Callahan. 'Wolves' is as much a sequel to ''Salem's Lot' as it is to 'Wizard and Glass', and much of the book is indeed devoted to catching up with the Pere, in flashback sequences that certainly would not have suffered from some judicious edits.'Wolves' is self-indulgent, yes, but little more so than King's previous works. The man writes long, and that is to be expected-any nay-sayer should read an uncut edition of 'The Stand', if he or she can spare a couple of weeks. The prose is workmanlike and, in places, dull, but like Tolkien, King is much more a storyteller than a wordsmith. There is little physical advancement to the overall story arc: Roland and his ka-tet travel perhaps a hundred miles closer to the Tower, no more. The story itself, however, progresses mightily, offering tantalizing glimpses of Breakers, the rose, the Crimson King, and just how many worlds -are- joined by the Tower: even our own.One of the most interesting new elements concerns the increasing preponderance of the number nineteen, a number which has also come to appear on the page preceding each book of the series' subtitle in the 2003 editions. The resolution of this and many other of the saga's twists and turns-perhaps most notably the Vonnegutian revelation at book's end-is enough to maintain interest in the Ka-Tet of Nineteen's adventures. This segment of the whole may be lacklustre, but it moves: it's a quick read (even at 709 pages), it's a compelling read, and it whets the appetite for the ever-approaching end.* - It is appalling to me that of thirty-odd reviews, many of which complain at length about the book's epilogue, not a single one mentions 'Breakfast of Champions', in which a similar event not only takes place, but also leads to the rather enjoyable resolution so many here have actually taken to &quot;warn&quot; King against. For shame."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"\\"The saga of \\"Roland Deschain, Gunslinger of the line of Eld, and his ''ka-tet,'' (those whom destiny hath joined), continues in \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\" Susannah Dean, formerly the duo-personality Odetta Susannah Holmes and Detta Walker, Eddie Dean, previously a drug addict and mule in New York City, Jake Chambers, a boy from Manhattan who died twice in Book #1, and was subsequently and symbolically reborn in Mid-World, and Oy, their talking billy-bumbler, together walk the path of the Beam. They search for the Tower, that magical edifice which holds together time and all universes. Their quest is to prevent the destruction of the Tower, and the unthinkable consequences, by the fearsome Crimson King and his evil forces.On the borderlands of Mid-World lies the remote village of Calla Bryn Sturgis. Almost all of the children born here are twins. Once every generation a large group of raiders, seemingly indestructible wolf-like creatures called The Wolves of Thunderclap, descend upon Calla and take one from each set of twins who fall within a certain age group. When the abducted children are returned, they are terribly changed, all severely retarded with reduced life-spans. The wolves are due to raid in just 30 days. A few of the town's people, who want to fight and defend their offspring, learn of the presence of the Gunslinger ka-tet in a nearby forest. They ride to meet the group of four, plus Oy, to ask for assistance. The Gunslingers' acquiescence represents a temporary divergence from their path and their trust in Ka (destiny).Meanwhile Susannah has a \\"chap\\" growing in her womb and Eddie is not the father. Her malady of old also returns, which seriously threatens to destroy the ka-tet when it is at its most vulnerable. Back in 1977, NYC, a single rose grows in a vacant lot on Second Avenue and Forty-Sixth Street. This is not just any flower, but the manifestation of the Tower on Earth. The same forces which seek to destroy the Tower are relentlessly trying to kill the Rose, and must be deterred at all cost. There is a magic portal, a Door in a cave near Calla, which enables Gunslingers to travel back and forth between New York, New England and Mid-World. Increasingly chaos and darkness are spreading to Earth, and elements from Earth's culture are showing up on the Tower side of the Door, ominously foretelling of future events.My only problem with \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" is the introduction of defrocked priest Donald Callahan, and his overly long, repetitious story, directly out of author King's novel, \\"Salem's Lot.\\" Now I read that book years ago, when it was first published, and loved it. However, I can barely remember the plot. A large part of this novel involves Father Callahan and his past. I have invested lots of time and energy enthusiastically following the adventures of Roland and his merry group of Gunslingers through thousands of pages of prose. If I had been forewarned that a reread of \\"Salem's Lot\\" would assist me in appreciating \\"Wolves of the Calla, I would have done so, without hesitation. I am, if nothing else, a committed Dark Tower follower. But no one advised me, alas. And I do feel I missed-out on a portion of the story. I was, frankly, bored at times. I believe that Mr. King owes more to his loyal readers than to go off on a long self-indulgent walk down memory lane with a character, and plot, created many years ago. Other than this, I loved the book and believe it is a worthy continuation of one of my all time favorite epic sagas.Once again, the narrative is as rich as ever in its description of characters, cityscapes, landscapes and creatures. The changing relationships between the foursome, their growth as individuals and as a group, is really worth noting. Although not as adventure-packed, nor as suspenseful, as the first four novels, the book moves along at a good clip, except for most of the Father Callahan episodes. The full-color illustrations by comic book artist Bernie Wrightson are outstanding.At this point, I don't care how King ends his epic. I just know that he has taken me, so far, on a glorious 2000 page ride, (approximately), and I have loved almost every minute of it. Nothing that occurs in future books can spoil what I have already read. Highest recommendations!!JANA"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"After finishing the whole series via a three month audio-book journey I can say that DT5 stands as one of the best of the series. I was somewhat disappointed with the book the first time through (before I decided to re-listen to everything) and now put it all on expectations I guess. Nothing ever lives up to those do they?Another read made me see it as the climax of Jake and Eddie's character growth. The ka-tet is strong and they are all according-to-hoyle gunslingers. No fear of the mid-world boogy-men, just of their own choices and judgment. So there is nowhere to go but down, right?But if you did not like this book, I say reconsider the following: DT5 is probably King's best job at putting you into another world/time/culture. DT4 did this very well, and is still I think my favorite, but that work is surpassed here. The Calla feels real to me. The language, the town, the people all run deep.This doesn't even include the extra story of Father Callahan, which I also found fascinating.I've read some reviews where people got sick of the made up language and accents but I can say they work wonderfully well as an audiobook.King says near the end of the series that the story of the journey is the point of the DT series, not the ending. If that be true then DT5 is, to me, one of the richest parts of that journey."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Having joined the ka-tet of 19 only briefly, and read the first 5 books in the space of a few months, i feel that maybe my opinion on \\"Wolves\\" will be slightly more optimistic than some of the views I have read on here so far, possibly because I haven't had to wait 6 long frustrating years for it, having started it on the same day I finished the also fantastic \\"Wizard and Glass\\".Lets just make one thing clear from the outset: \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" is a masterpiece. Not only is it a work of utter brilliance when judged on it's own merits, but when assessed in relation to the previous 4 volumes, well, \\"breathtaking\\" fails to fully articulate the feeling I think.King has given us something magical, something truly valuable, and of real worth. He has given us a journey with twists and turns, with highs and lows, with action, suspense and romance, a story of survival, he has taught us lessons most of us who have lived this experience (because King has truly managed to make the reader feel part of his little ka tet) will never forget, lessons of Ka, khef, ka-tet, of friendship, of focus, or never forgetting the faces of our fathers, and of aiming, shooting, and killing with our eyes, minds and hearts. King's genius is not merely in what he says, or how he says it, but his brilliance is in what he evokes within his reader, in his gift to truly make you feel like part of this world, this journey, this destiny...And what does all this amount to? One of the most under appreciated literary works of genius to have ever been created, and most certainly one of the most outstanding stories of contemporary literature.With \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" King shows his superiority by once again taking a risk and changing the entire rhythm of the narrative and approach to his storytelling. But yet, he manages to sustain the essence of the 4 previous books, and in doing so continues his path toward completing his magnum opus, his own Dark Tower. For a writer who could quite easily be summed up as the most consistently brilliant of his era, with a body of work so far reaching that it spans decades, mediums and genres, and succeeds in coming out on top in each of these, to say that the \\"Dark Tower\\" is his own \`piece de resistance' is to offer it (and him) a compliment of such magnitude that there are truly no words sufficiently superlative to accurately reflect or quantify it's (and his) magnificence.Thank you Mr King, for the journey so far, and for the journey that awaits me in Susannah's Song and the Dark tower itself...SP."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"When I picked up this book, I was nearly dying of curiosity. When I finished it, I was not disappointed.It picks up where the last left off. Roland's ka tet are traveling along the Path of the Beam to reach their ultimate goal.. The Dark Tower....But, they get sidetracked when they come to the town of Calla Bryn Sturgis. There, they meet a man called Father Callahan (King fans will recognize him as the character from his older book, Salem's Lot), a man who was once from the real world and somehow got to the one that Roland is in.And, they also vow to stop the Wolves of Thunderclap from raiding Calla. The Wolves are mysterious creatures who steal babies from the Calla every 25 years.

With each new situation we learn more of Roland's true self. The affection of his ka-tet is making him become more and more human. Are we too impatient for them to reach the Dark Tower? I will sorely be disappointed when the series ends. I can readily admit that I do not have the imagination or talent to write such a fantastic epic tale. All you Dark Tower fans, do not listen to the nay sayers. The story ROCKS!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Huge fan of king, the gunslinger ,like Lotr fellowship, in my opinion, are a class above the rest bar none! The next three books in the dark tower series are also quality literature, wizard glass in particular I personally found touching and relevant,this tragic tale is king truly in his prime. But how did it go so wrong, sell out?I don't know , there's plenty of reviews upset about it , and rightly so. How can a story start so great and then go so bad? I wonder whether it was him that actually wrote it it is that off key...the sad thing about it all is he actually admits how bad it is .. It was completed and that was all that really mattered. Stephen king ,by any chance u come across this :p the dark tower means more to people than this rubbish. Roland sadly , had to play along with a terrible script , cheating him out of the epic conclusion he was destined for! I wonder how it would had turned out if he had followed the series on after w n g and completed it. It would had been that great these mediocre novels since then wouldn't had been missed .. I feel he's lost sight of what it all means , and will regret it. The dark tower series could had stayed with us for generations; standing the test of time, which not many story's do and also shapeing the way story's are told for many year to come. Heck wat do I know , he's the one laughing now with more money than cent, and I'm writing a daft review that no one will read, but it means more than this.\\" all we can to do is decide wat to do with the time that is given to us\\" only a few king books will be truly remembered from his time and I honestly hope Roland is not forgotten."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The dude can write like nobody's business and I can hardly wait to read this one.

Kick up dust with your boots along American roads that may look like they're in the past, but may be, in fact, from the future. Open doors in-between worlds, travel far and near as Rolands all famous ka-tet of Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and, of course, the talking billy bumbler, Oy. Meet priests, three types of vampires, even get a glimpse of a zombie. Perhaps. Perhaps better. Meet Andy, the talking robot tin man with a sense of humor and a love for horoscopes. All of this surrounds a strange story of Wolves of the Calla. Who are they, really, what do they want when they ride to the city of Calla, what do they steal that's so true to Roland's heart?I'm wasn't born in America. This is one book that gave me the taste of a true American story, at least from what I felt must be American, having lived here close to 15 years. Wolves of the Calla is part western, part sic-fi, is a bit apocalyptic, has a little fantasy, some horror, some epic, and some plain tall tale. The one that the old folken would tell you on the road as you pass by to some forgotten town in the middle of a desert, one they would speak of in between draws of their pipe, blowing smoke in your face. The whole Dark Tower series is an epic quest, but for me this book is perhaps the epicenter of its essence, not in the terms of the end goal, but in terms of the story itself. Add to that fierce women warriors, unheard of weapons, nods to Harry Potter, Star Wars, and even Microsoft, and you got yourself a rare gem. \\"You say true, I say thankya.\\" Now come on, ya good fella, get yourself a copy, mayhap it will do ya right."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"As assumed, awesome, could've been more fighting though. I wish there was more of Roland\`s past, the tie in with Salems Lot was awesome."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"4 STARS FOR THIS BOOK 5 IN THE SERIES.Three stories are divided into sections and interrupt each other. I would have preferred each be told completely before moving to the next. However, some of the author's ideas and creativity are wonderful. I'm enjoying the language and phrases he uses in this world. \\"We are well met.\\" \\"You forgot the face of your father.\\" Si (pronounced sigh) instead of Mr. or Miss.I loved the story about the wolves. It's inspired by the Magnificent Seven movie. The gunslingers (Roland's group) help a farming community fight bandits who periodically rob them. Here the bandits wear wolf masks and ride horses. They steal children. It was well done. Neat characters.A second story was pretty good. It starts where the book Salem's Lot ends. Father Callahan survived the vampire and left the town Salem's Lot. He became a drunk and periodically worked as a day laborer. He ends up in the future in the farming community of Calla where he meets Roland's group. (You do not need to read Salem's Lot for this.)The third story is Calvin Tower in 1977 New York City. He owns a vacant lot where a magic rose grows. Some bad guys want to buy that land. Roland wants to buy it to protect the rose. There are a few trips through time to interact with Calvin. Parts of this were repetitive. Eddie and Jake are seeing the same things we saw in earlier books. I'd prefer a shortened version of this story.NARRATOR: George Guidall was ok. His voice for Eddie was weird.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook reading time: 25 hrs and 13 mins. Swearing language: strong but rarely used. Sexual content: two scenes, vaguely referred to, no details. Setting: apocalyptic future and 20th century New York. Book copyright: 2003. Genre: apocalyptic time travel fantasy.--------------------------------------------------------------3 STARS FOR THE ENTIRE 8 BOOK SERIES:One of the books is number 4 . The last book is number 7. The main character is Roland, a gunslinger, inspired by the Clint Eastwood character in his spaghetti western movies (ex: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Set in an apocalyptic future, Roland is on a journey to the Dark Tower to stop evil forces from destroying the world. The books should be read in order. There are many wonderful ideas and stories. There is also too much clutter, rambling, and things I think should have been edited out. The Harry Potter series was better because everything developed the characters and moved the plots forward. Here at times I felt the author was writing short stories and getting off track. Overall I'm glad I read it. And there were a some wonderful parts that I will remember.I was disappointed with the last two books. Instead of enjoying the journey, I wanted them to be over. I did not like Roland's ending. It left a bad taste in my mouth. There was such potential and it felt piddled out. I liked one reviewer's comment \\"in his rush to end this series the author has given up its soul.\\" (Amazon reviewer Roger FitzAlan \\"Aranarth\\")Although not necessary, you might be glad to read The Stand before reading this series. The evil guy in The Stand (Flagg) continues being evil here. I really liked what happened to him in the first half of Dark Tower book 7. Throughout the series there are snippets of characters from various King books, but nothing to recommend reading those books first."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"A must read book.

I grew tired of Roland and his Ka-Tet always shooting dead-center bullseye every single time and everything always working out. However, the book was still decent and you have to read it to finish the series so I recommend doing so if you want to reach the end of this 4,000 some odd page series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This isn't my favorite entry into the series; but then, all the rest of the books refer back to this one *a lot*, so it's essential to know what the characters have experienced between books 4 and 6. The only other one I'm not particularly fond of is book 6, with yet more trips into NYC and Maine and tangles with the mobsters. At least Father Callahan is given a mighty fine send-off! I guess King figured he owed Callahan a better ending than skulking out of Salem's Lot and disappearing.Anyhow, this book riffs off of a Kurasawa movie (Seven Samuri), which was riffed off of one of Sergio Leone's Man with No Name westerns, and then by Hollywood in The Magnificent Seven. It's a nice nod to that particular Western story. It's obviously a good one, and it's good to see King's take on it.I think didn't quite know what he was getting into with his characters or with the world he set them in. It's a difficult tightrope to walk, and I'd say overall, he did a remarkable job of roping all the disparate threads and tropes (from SF, F, H and Westerns) into one big long story."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book picks right up where the previous installment (\\"Wizard and Glass\\") left off, with Roland and his ka-tet still following the Path of the Beam towards the Dark Tower. However, the group is quickly given a proposition by the townspeople of Calla Bryn Sturgis (a town on the brink of entering the mysterious Thunderclap world where the Dark Tower itself lays), who have seen their babies taken by \\"Wolves\\" each generation and finally want to put a stop to it. Being a man of honor, Roland of Gilead accepts the offer and he and his crew are sidetracked for a bit longer in their quest for the Tower.Now, despite the notion that the goings-on in Calla Bryn Sturgis could be considered \\"filler\\", it is very interesting, exciting \\"filler\\" that makes for an entertaining read. The main plotline consists of Roland, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake scoping out the city in order to plan the best defense (much akin to Roland, Cuthbert, and Alain in Roland's tale from \\"Wizard and Glass\\"), and finally taking on the \\"Wolves\\" in the end (though not before uncovering a sinister plot they never expected).Besides that main story, however, is the character development that takes place. Roland begins showing the first signs (arthritis) of his long trek for the Tower, Susannah's multiply-personalities return in a way you will not expect, Eddie's love for Susannah is only strengthened, and Jake fights an internal battle between having a normal childhood and being with Roland. So, while the characters are not actually continuing their quest for the Tower in this book, it still is entertaining to see the characters being further developed.Also, the book takes a bizarre twist when Father Callahan (of \\"Salem's Lot\\" fame!) shows up, throwing the reader into a bit of confusion once again regarding how \\"our\\" world aligns with \\"Roland's world\\" and prompting a return trip to New York(s) via another magical door.Overall, this is another thrilling installment in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It contains an inspired main plot, crucial character development, and throws at the reader a few more mysteries that will likely be solved in the remaining two editions of the series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Tha latest chapter in the tale of Roland, has the ka-tet riding into the town of Calla and preparing to fight a battle against a group of mysterious child snatching wolves. The wolves come every twenty years or so, and take one of the many sets of twins that populate the town. When the children return sometime later they are husks of their former selves, or roont as they call them. Much of the lengthy book is buildup to the eventual confrontation, but there are also character events large enough to propel the story into an entirely new direction that will obvious be what the next installment is about.If you've read and enjoyed the four books previous to this you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"i think that this whole series of books is well estabished and written. if the people who think that he is just wasting time and walking around the subject would stop and think a minute maybe they would realize that he could be painting a very detailed picture to set you up for the books to come. roland is well thought out character that keeps becoming more &quot;mature&quot; along the way. when he finally reaches the tower i think we will find that it is not him who is the star but the ka-tet takes the main role."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Dark Tower Series is easily some of the best fiction I have read. Stephen King has created a parralell world with admirable people. Roland Deshain is an incredible character. He knows much about his world, yet realizes he can't know everything. He has achieved an almost superhero status in my mind, but yet he may be destroyed by the aging of his body. Eddie is another character that I like. He has overcome an addiction and is in complete control of himself. He can think for himself and does not fear what he can not affect. King has created a world full a vivid characters, and the Wolves of the Calla has added even more.What Happens? We learn a little more about Roland's past and the end of his orginal ka-tet with Alain and Cuthbert. We also learn a little bit more about Roland's world and it's decay. There is major character development with the four major characters, and a priest is introduced. This novel ends with a twist I could never have expected, and I can only wonder what King plans to do with it. But the majority of the novel deals with the town of Calla Byrn Sturgis. This town is plauged by wolves that still children. The seek aid and succor from Roland and his Gunslingers.I highly recommend this novel and Salem's lot. I haven't read Salem's Lot yet, but I am going to buy Salem's Lot soon."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Be prepared that this book contains a lot of character development and for those of you action junkies, you might not like this book as much as say, The Wastelands. For all else, this is an excellent addition to the series. The story started out with a moving town meeting, the introduction to the Wolves of the Calla, the supreme menace of the story. There are many characters and each of them driven by love, power, good and evil. Roland is still as rugged, strong, and incredibily charismatic. Eddie is also tougher, but still charm us with his humer and grace. Jake is becoming a man, and his courage and friendship with both Oy and Benny (his new friend) touched us poignantly. But the heart of the book lies in Susannah, who is fighting her new incarnation - and losing. In the end, she might or might not touch you, but she will definitely scare you (or at least, send you a few shivers) all the way to the very end.For those of you that like the majestic feeling of desolation in The Wastelands might be disappointed. This book is heavy in diolouge and back story, a lot from Father Callahan, the priest from Salom's Lot (as many of you probably read). But no matter what kind of reader you are, the climatic chapters of the last 300 pages will worth more than the price of this book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen King's fans who don't read the Dark Tower series are really missing out. The \\"Wolves of Calla\\" is an impressive, well-written, story that raises questions King has been giving us in other works and ties in one of his very first stories in a unique way.The suspense and drama of the books are fantastic, but I think it's the characters that really set this series apart. In \\"Wolves of the Calla\\", each member of the ka-tet has agonizing personal choices to make and their decisions, sometimes flawed, sometimes heroic, make this series something beyond classification. This isn't a drawn-out epic fantasy or a gimmicky tie in of other novels. Like \\"Wizard and the Glass\\" this novel is memorable both in itself and in what is does for the series storyline.Jake is growing up. The Gunslinger is growing a heart (has been for some time). He's also losing some of his physical abilities, but he's a much more interesting character than when he started out. Susannah's latest personality would defy belief if written by any other writer, but Stephen King handles her masterfully. And Eddie the former junkie is now the one that's desperate to hold the group together. The battle to project a town's children against seemingly unstoppable &quot;wolves&quot; is just one part of the story.The stakes are raised at the conclusion of this installment by a new character with his own stunning background added to mix and Stephen King tantalizes us with the first real glimpse of how this serious might conclude. I hate the spoilers, so that's all I'll say.Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I'm an adamant fan of the Dark Tower series to the point of buying almost all of the audio versions of the books to keep the story fresh in my mind. Roland Deschain is one of the most intense characters created in American literature and I believe he embodies the better qualities that we'd like to see within ourselves. The Dark Tower series has always held a sleight of hand feeling with it's mixture of Roland's world and our own, and that's a huge part of it's charm. The other appeal for me has been the recent addition (and when I say recent, I mean with 'Wizard and Glass' which was published in 1997) of the Randall Flag character from 'The Stand,' my favorite King book of all time.****Read no further if you don't like spoilers!!!!****I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I was a little taken aback by King's inclusion of his own fiction, 'Salem's Lot,' in the storyline towards the end of the novel. It's a a bit too self-gratifying for an author of his stature. I am hoping that the next two installments will make it all worth while."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"this one was not as good as Wizard and Glass, which is my favorite in this amazing series but it was still a great book. i cant wait for the next one. i want to know what happens to Tower and Susannah. the only problem i have with this book is that it raises more questions than it answers. some people say that his trip into Calahan's(Salem' Lot) life is stupid and a pointless waist of time. but i think that everything stephen king says in this series is important and should be read like it is. something will surlly happen with calahan in the next book or in the dark tower."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I didn't want to like this book after the first 200 pages or so. Unlike the folks of Mejis (in wizard and glass), the particular nuances of calla bryn sturgis english got to be annoying and kept popping me back out of the world of the book and back into my reading chair. But fear not, you soon will overlook all the thank-ya big bigs and find a pretty good doomsday type novel. In this one, the doom comes in the form of the titular wolves. Calla bryn Sturgis is haunted every 20 years or so by the 'wolves. The town children are almost all twins and the wolves take one twin from each set. The kidnapped are then returned mentally and physically impaired. Roland and his new gunslinger friends are obliged to help the town in fighting the wolves and saving the kids. But all is not as it seems and there are many, many subplots going on.Its a good read and a worthy addition to the series, especially if you liked 'Wizard and Glass'. It doesn't quite return to the forward pacing set in 'The waste land' but tends to delve deeper into the characters, much like WG.In particular, Eddie Dean really grows in this one and is no longer the weak sister but becomes a gunslinger in his own right. Jakes character matures as well but the susanah character and her multiple personalities get to be annoying and its pretty obvious that she is holding the tet back.Overall, a good tale. Definatly leaves you wanting the next book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"After reading the novel in about three days, I decided to read the reviews. The most nagging complaint I have noticed is that King interjected some Elton John lyrics, references to earlier King novels and developed the link of everything and everywhen. Isn't this his pattern from Hearts in Atlantis, It, etc? The main theme of individual having to make a choice fits into the pattern: the gunslingers can ignore the town's need to follow the beam, or they can help. If I can add that each of the DT books has surpassed the plot stretching and lack of movement in the novels of Jordan, Goodkind et.al. The authors I mention because their novels seem to be teflon-coated when reviewed in most publications."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Book 5 in the Dark Tower series is finally here. This book had the potential to be the best in the series. Unfortunately, the thing that everyone else hates about this book I too don't like very much. The thing being the pop culture reference to Star Wars, Harry Potter and King himself as well as the Salem's Lot tie in. Another thing upsetting to me is the constant coincidences and how Stephen tries to explain it all as being &quot;nineteen&quot; (the level of the tower with the most coincidences and cross promotionalism apparently). All of these problems lessen the effectiveness of the book in my opinion. Of course, that is what I didn't like.What I did like is the rest of the storyline and characterization that continues in this book. The problem with the wolves as encountered by Calla Bryn Sturgis is really just a side story and is never really addressed until the end of the book (thankfully as that would've made this book more filler before getting down into the real story). Instead book five takes the ideas set forth in book 3: Wastelands and expands upon them. Here we learn more about Mr. Tower, the Rose, various companies working against the tower and even a little more about the man in black (aka the walkin' dude). Jake has a kind of coming of age (in a way) and the ka-tet is threatened with break up. As you can see, there is enough advancement to keep the book interesting. Despite the problems I had with the ending, I still can't wait for book 6 therefore this book deserves at least four stars, losing one to all of the stupid references and tie-ins."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"After reading the first in the series, I eagerly awaited each of the next three books and couldn't put them down when I finally got them.

Its like making meatloaf for 20 people with 4 pounds of beef. Your going to have to use a LOT of filler to get enough meatloaf. Book number 5 is filler. I'm sure the last book in the series will be wonderful, King just thought he had more story than he actually does. And whatswith the awful artwork? Somebody had to approve this stuff for the book, I can't believe they looked at it and said &quot;Hey!

Lots of connection, believable characters, suspense, humor to relieve, all the things i could want in a King book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Why do I get the feeling that you people will give a positive review to anything that King writes, no matter how painful it is to read.One reviewer hit it right on the head and, what a surprise(!), his review wasn't helpful to any of you. The sassy, street-wise Susannah is a joke of a character. I can say the same for the whiney, exceedingly tedious Eddie. Even Roland is starting to act like these two, with the corny one-liners over and over again.The language used here by the group and the people of Calla Bryn Sturgis is borderline verbicide. Couldn't King think of a dialect a little less annoying?What happened to the morbid, lonesome GUNSLINGER in the first part of the series? These people are supposed to be killers, not a party posse, for crying out loud.People, stop being clones and give this book an honest review. It stinks, almost as bad as &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;, and you know it."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Let's get this out of the way first: If you've not read the previous four books in Stephen King's &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series, you can stop right here. This book isn't for you. While the story itself is strong, the characters and references to the backstory likely will elicit a good deal of frustration and head-scratching. You'd be well-served by going back and reading the first four books of the series.That being said, &quot;Tower&quot; fans undoubtedly will be pleased with this, the fifth book in King's genre-bending magnum opus.On the heels of a sometimes disappointing Book IV (&quot;Wizard and Glass,&quot; which was essentially 672 pages of flashback and so, by its very nature, did little to advance the overall plot), &quot;The Wolves of the Calla&quot; refreshingly finds Roland Deschain and his ka-tet moving forward in their quest for the tower.King is a lot of things, but above all he is a fantastic story-teller, and &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; stands testament to that. From the very first sentence, he reels the reader in with his magnificent feel for the language and his always-present humor. (Check out his Web site for a look at the prologue. You'll be sold immediately.) He goes on to spin what ends up being a gripping tale that offers a few answers about our adventurers but, in true &quot;Tower&quot; form, brings up even more questions.It's worth noting that &quot;Calla&quot; also finds King reintroducing characters from some of his other stories, most notably Father Callahan from &quot;'Salem's Lot.&quot; It's not the first time he's done so in the series (and in other books), but it certainly represents one of the more prominent roles played by a former character. One has to wonder if it is a result of literary inspiration or shameless self-marketing. (Whatever the case, it got me to pick up &quot;'Salem's Lot,&quot; which was a great read in itself. So even in the worst-case scenario, everybody wins.)At 700-plus pages, &quot;The Wolves of the Calla&quot; isn't a quick read, and at times it gets bogged down in detail (in particular where Father Callahan's tale is concerned). And King's tower-related symbolism often seems a bit abstruse. But the strength of the story, and of that of the overall series, easily overcomes such shortcomings, adding yet another sucess to Sai Stephen's impressive body of work."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"King is my favorite author, and I have been devouring the &quot;Tower&quot; books several times.However, I have never read, nor had any interest to read &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;. As such, I couldn't care less about Father Callahan and found his presence in Roland's world totally uncalled for. &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; felt like King couldn't quite continue the &quot;Tower&quot; series by itself. Like he really wanted to tell another story altogether but was guilttripped into continuing the series. By itself, without any of the Dark Tower characters, &quot;Wolves&quot; would have been a great read, but as a &quot;Tower&quot; installment, it left me feeling &quot;This is what I have been waiting for all these years?&quot;I am such a tower junkie, that I actually feel a little cheated.As an example, Eddie never struck me as a baseball fan, or one who would even follow the World Series. As a Red Sox fan, I'm way familiar with the name Buckner, but for Eddie, it seemed out of character. Maybe the &quot;Girl who loved Tom Gordon&quot; would have made a better time/dimension traveler..."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I anxiously awaited the 5th installment. I should have waited for the paperback - this way I would not have felt as if I threw away $30. I loved the first 4 installments and hope that 'Wolves is nothing more than a momentary transgression. Simply put, it is the most boring book I have ever read. This is the first review I have ever placed on Amazon. I am doing this because I feel compelled to warn people. Let's hope Mr. King didn't &quot;go through the motions&quot; for the final installments."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I've been a fan of the dark tower series since the early 90s, and I've liked them quite a bit. I cry ye pardon King, but Wolves of the Calla blew serious chunks. The beginning prologue is great (and has been available from Stephen King's website for over a year), and the ending is &quot;interesting&quot; (with interesting revelations made about the true nature of the &quot;wolves&quot;) but the 600 pages in between are, simply put, really BORING!!! This is probably King's worst and most boring novel since the Regulators or the Dark Half. Unfortunately, in order to finish the series (with Song of Susannah and the Dark Tower, due in 2004), you must persevere and methodically blow through this most painful of DT volumes."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I don't read books, but my wife does.

There are parts which become somewhat tedious such as the Telling Tales part. Also, it became a little annoying to keep bringing up the number 19. Every number or date given adds up to 19.

If you have read other King books besides the dark tower then you will like this book. King has written numerous books relating to the Dark Tower series such as Hearts in Atlantis and Salems Lot. Both would be good to read before you read this new book. For readers that have read a lot of his books its fun to see the way they refernce each other and tie in together. The storie line of this book is good. Not as good as the first books but still not bad at all. This book is not too exciting until the end and there are a lot of long stories told that sort of make it drag on. If you have read Salems Lot then there is a very long story retold for you but also more of what happend to father callahan. All in all this was a good book and I would refer it to anyone that has read the other Dark Tower Books."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Started out interesting and fast paced but by page 100 it came to virtual halt. Mr. King forgets to \\"Show, don't tell\\" Mr. King should reread and follow his own book \\"On Writing\\" After I got to page 100 I started skipping paragraphs then eventually whole pages. Tons of painfully repetitious padding. When a paragraph would suffice SK drags it to 2-4 pages!As an example take a look at Tolkien's The Hobbit (289 pages) and his The Lord of the Ring trilogy (432 pages, 352 pages and 464 pages). Another,. more relevant example The Gunslinger (256 pages), The Drawing of the Three (406 pages), The Waste Lands (448 pages). The first three books of the Dark Tower series are great, to the point and have pace. Wizard and Glass (672 pages) and Wolves of the Calla ( 736 pages) are stagnant and bloated.(...)The character of Susannah still talks like a black street [prostitute], degrading and diminishing her as a serious player. Eddie too is shallow and cheap. Even Roland the Gunslinger himself is made ridiculous by his insistence on ritual and pomp regarding the simplest of things. But oh! do they keep fretting about making this and that in time and even saying \\"time is short let's getgoing!\\" BUT they don't. They take FOREVER to do anything. The speech patterns and manners of the people of Calla Byrn Srurgis were mind numbing (they take forever to spit out a simple sentence) and redundant. The Gunslingers adopting the Calla's speech patterns and mannerisms was unnatural and even more benumbing. But hey, it sure racks up the page count, right Mr. King?Mr. King is now at full count (to use his baseball lingo). One more strike and the series is OUT and over. We, the once prized, Constant Reader lose. Mr. King wins $$ either way so it doesn't matter to him.....which is glaringly obviouse by his lack of quality these past 10+ years.I hope he takes the time with the last book in the DT series. Even if it takes many years. Think compact, distilled, consise."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I already wrote a reveiw but yes it was horrible the black marks that i got on my fingers, that i couldn't remove, from reading this book without it's dust jacket. Great Book, horrible construction."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I just finished the fifth book of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, and of the first five, it was my favorite. That is a big statement because I loved four out of those five. I don't want to give a summary of this one like I usually would because it would ruin parts of the first four, and that is no fun. I will talk about some of the great aspects of this book.The first is the characters. Each character in this gigantic novel, from Roland, our dinh, to little singleton Aaron has a purpose. There are not flat characters or spare characters that are just there to add more people to the crowd. They have distinct personalities and motivations for everything they do. Our band of four main characters have some of the toughest decisions they have had in the series. Should Jake tell Roland what he has seen? Do they all tell Susannah about the demon inside of her? Can Susannah fight Mia and be able to help her ka-tet? The reader gets to see how each character makes their decision and why, which might be part of the reason readers get attached to these characters.The setting makes one think of an old-fashioned Western movie. There are farmers and ranchers, there is a decision to be made and the town is split in two, and there are four strangers and a bumbler who come waltzing in to save the day. But there are also robots that warn of the wolves coming, yet always seems to be laughing at the humans. There is an old man who knows what The Wolves truly are and has told no one. There is a priest whose story seems awfully familiar and comes from the same place as Jake and Eddie...but more on that later. It seems like it could become cliche, but it never comes close.I don't want to really give much away because some of the discoveries that characters make are what make the book. I will touch on the priest, Father Callahan, who escaped to this world after being bit by a vampire and running for years from Jerusalem's Lot...known to Stephen King readers as Salem's Lot. Near the end of The Wolves of the Calla the character finds this book and starts to read it. At one point he says \\"but I am a real person!\\", he is reading his story and is flabbergasted. How is his story in this novel, this piece of fiction? I won't get too detailed in my analysis of what this may mean because I know it is an important theme of the next two books (where Stephen King becomes a character), but I will pose this question. What is a character in a book really? We have all read books where the characters seem like friends of ours and what happens to them impacts us emotionally. Can you imagine how this would be for an author, the one who breathed life into these characters? I look forward to reading the next two books and going deeper into this issue with all of you!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"as everyone else who has read King's magnum opus Dark Tower series, I was excited for the newest volume. However, in the end I was extremely dissapointed. Besides Father Callahan's recounting of life after Salem's Lot, this book didnt move anywhere, the characters it introduces are boring and easily forgettable, and almost nothing happens. WHich would be fine if it was a 200 page book, but to have to sludge through 700 pages of it is very trialing. King is one of my favorite writers of all time, but this one really let me down. I hope Book 6 picks up where Book 4 lets off."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I loved the come back of Dark Tower! Wolves of Calla was one of my favorite in the series (together with #4 and #1). Just read it and ya\`ll see!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I won't dissect the installment since many others have done excellent jobs of that here, but I will say that while I enjoyed this installment, it did feel a bit long.Some have complained about the loose ends that were not tied up here but given the nature of this series, it should be clear that loose ends created in one book will probably be addressed in latter installments.That said, I could have done without the addition of Fr. Callahan as I felt his back story and connection to Salem's Lot just didn't feel important. I've never been a fan of vampire stories and so that just accentuated my dislike for the long time spent on Callahan.Taken as a part of the greater story arc, it was satisfying and it compelled me to carry on to the last book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Out of all the events (and non-events) in this book, the moment that most stood out in my mind is the private palaver between Roland and Jake. The main purpose of Wolves of the Calla in the Dark Tower series is, I think, to tell the tale of Jake's initiation into the Gunslinger order. Up until this point, Jake has been a \`prentice, though prepared in the physical requirement, not yet ready to bear responsibilities for strategic decisions. But here in Calla Bryn Sturgis, he finally makes his challenge to his teacher. Jake's questioning of Roland's decision not to tell Susannah of Mia's presence marks what is certainly a less violent coming of age than Roland's own challenge to Cort with his hawk, but a challenge nonetheless. When Roland admits to Jake, \\"I don't know what to do. Would you like to tell me?\\" he concedes that Jake has earned a say in the decisions of the ka-tet. Jake is so taken aback with this concession that he thinks Roland is being sarcastic, but after discussion, the two come to a compromise concerning Mia. Jake at first has trouble accepting that the ka-tet will follow his decision for good or ill, and accuses Roland of passing the buck, but Roland (Ah, gods love him - could King have written this part at eighteen? I think not.) bids him put aside childish indecision once and for all to claim his rightful place. Out of all the moments in all 900 pages, this is the moment that got me most.Other highlights:The weapons and appearance of the enemy have surprising origins.Roland gets laid by a worthy woman.Susannah learns a new weapon and rocks it. (Yeah, girl!)Eddie meets up with his old drug-dealing pals and owns them once again.Jake becomes the man.Lowlights, however:Vampires? Really?Susannah's demon spawn?An entire town full of new characters?Andy = Jar-Jar?Wolves was a great book, albeit too long, and probably largely unnecessary. Not a waste of time, though. I was thoroughly entertained, as always."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"As an avid reader of kings' books,I have to say that this one is one of his best(somewhere in the top 10,which in taking in acount the amount of books he's written says alot).In my opinion, the way he interwines plenty of his stories into the dark tower context(I'm talking about the ones that aren't part of the dark tower saga officially,like:The talisman,The stand etc..)is incredible,and if you read enough of his books you get A cozy recognition feeling,the only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is,that to much is left unsaid and I can't wait to know it all."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Of the 7 book series, this, book 5 ,is the second best behind #2, DRAWING OF THE THREE. Not because Roland, Jake, Eddie, and Susannah return, but more in spite of it. The stand-out character in this edition is Father Callahan, the priest from SALEM'S LOT. His story following the demise of the Lot is memorizing and the most interesting part of WOLVES. Dealing with the remnants of type 3 vampires and the Low Men from HEART OF ATLANTIS kind of ran off with the story.Here, Roland and company make like the Magnificent 7, rolling into Calla Bryn Sturgis, a farm town plagued every 19 years or so by the Wolves. Doctor Doom look-a-likes who take one of every pair of twin children, for some fiendish purpose. The stories of Roland, Jake, Eddie and Susannah have grown stale in Roland's quest for the Dark Tower. Perhaps killing off the ka-tet would have been most merciful for the reader. Each book should start with Roland meeting and employing new characters to get killed off in his quest.SK has pushed the made-up language of Roland's earth to the limit. If I read \\"Thankee, sai\\" or \\"commala\\" or \\"ken\\" one more time I'm going to scream. I don't understand what those annoying tag-lines add to the story. Also annoying is the turn of SK injecting himself into the story. You've got to be kidding me.This book could stand a good editing out of about 200 pages. That done it would be flawless. Now that Susannah has come up pregnant with the demon seed and fled to give birth I have to read what happens next. I hope the next two books are tighter than this one, but WOLVES is well worth a read."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This installment of the Dark Tower series takes us away from the Glass Palace and towards the Calla. The story of how our protagonists try to rid these folk of the Wolves that have haunted them for generations is a compelling one, and there are many nice sub-plots going on with a certain vacant lot in New York and a bit of a problem that Susannah finds herself in. I had been worried that after all these years King would have finally lost his touch with these books, but after the first fifty pages I had put all of those fears to rest.One quote from another reviewer, Eileen Rieback, sums up perfectly why this book lost a star from me: &quot;Pere Callahan's tale is essentially a sequel to Salem's Lot, and has no place here.&quot; Now I remember liking Salem's Lot when I read it years ago, but when the first large flashback(there are two) of the events after that book was suddenly dropped upon me it completely destroyed all the momentum the story had been building up to that point. I had been flying through the pages, but when that first large flashback came I suddenly knew how Roland must have suffered and struggled through that immense desert. The thought that kept going through my mind was that King should have just written a Salem's Lot 2 instead to cover this stuff. It took awhile after plodding through this drawn out flashback, but I did manage to get myself wrapped back up in the Calla.The second flashback of Callahan wasn't nearly as bad since it is a lot more relevant to the story. And the story in this novel is excellent, gripes aside. Not as good as The Wastelands or Wizard and Glass, but it's right behind those two. If you've come through the first four books of the Tower there's no reason not to read this one. And if you haven't, well the series winds down in less than six months so there's no time like the present to start. And hey, if you're a big Salem's Lot fan that is eager to know what happened to Callahan then you can easily consider this a five star book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of Calla, the fifth book in King's personal Lord of the Rings, brings the overall story progression of the Dark Tower series to a relative halt, but is an entertaining read nonetheless.Without giving too much away, the gunslingers -- Roland, Jake, Eddie, Susanna and Oy -- attempt to rescue a small farm town from an approaching army of... something bad. To do this, the ka-tet's journey toward the Dark Tower stops; the group instead seeks to help the famers find a way to stay off and even conquer the coming enemy.There are some surprising and thrilling plot developments in this latest novel. The series -- which ventured unabashedly into the realm of sci-fi in the Wastelands -- returns itself to an Old West setting. King makes no effort to hide the fact that this story was wholly inspired by Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai and indeed draws other connections to real-life works and in very literal ways. The most shocking and satisfying story developments are, almost predictably, left for the end of the book -- and the reader left to wait for answers in the next.King has a way with words. He has a love for details. And it's this complementary combination that has made many of his books such intriguing reads over the years. But sometimes he gets carried away. There are points in Calla where the reader may hope for the next page to reveal a pivotal plot twist -- even some interesting dialogue between main characters, but it instead dwells on unimportant sidestory. These are the slow parts. Luckily, they are few.After reading Calla, one gets the idea that King is himself finally figuring out where he wants to take the Dark Tower series. He seems to have made up his mind and the hints are there, the themes in place; the worlds appear to be coming together, connected by comic books and Star Wars, strange as it sounds. The reader will still be left with lingering questions -- many, in fact. But when the book is done one will be more curious than ever for the answers.A worthy new installment to what is bound to be remembered King's crowning accomplishment as a writer."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of Calla is a good book. Darn good. The story never seems to drag down and I didn't skip over paragraphs that i thought would be boring. If you do skip, you might miss something. Many have talked bad about how it deals with Father Callahan's character but I thought it was rather interesting. I mean I don't kow how many times I have finished a Stephen King book and wondered ( an d maybe made up) my own little stories about what happens to the main characters. Well, in this book we DO learn what happened to the main character form Salem's Lot. Hey I thought it was very good and interesting to see what happened to his life after being &quot;marked&quot; by Barlow. Anyways, the story also tells us a lot about the main charcters , Roland, Jake Eddie, and Susannah. They are growing. They are changing. They are getting closer to the tower. This is my @nd favorite of the series, Wastelands being 1st."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I just got though reading it ,and of course love it ! However I gave it 4 out of 5 simply because there was Waaaay Waaaay and I mean waaaay too much Callahaun and not enough of Roland and his past ! I really hope that the next book has more of Rolands past with his former Ka-tet or that he would write additional books detailing Rolands past , but alas I really enjoyed this book and I hope that if any other charactors from his books make an appearance it's someone more interesting like Jack Sawyer from the Tailsman ! Looking forward to The next !"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Volume Five of the Dark Tower series is good, and King's writing is its usual best, but the story is a bit predictable and the reader gets a little tired of hearing the irritating vernacular of the Calla townsfolk (&quot;may it do ya fine&quot; and &quot;thankee-sai&quot; get old after awhile). Still, the ending is another cliffhanger, and some strange incidents make the reader wonder if King will be able to pull the whole thing off. The wait until the next volume will be a long one, I know that for sure."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This installment of the Dark Tower series captures the magic of the previous books while adding some shocking twists, unbelievably creative storytelling and MORE. Tower junkies will jump for joy as they continue along the path of the beam! If you are not a tower junkie, start with Gunslinger (Dark Tower 1) and hurry to catch up with Roland and his ka-tet in the Calla!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"(I'll attempt to make this review spoiler-free, but I can't give any promises)I'm aware that the crowd here is fairly rabid, so I'll get the obligatory positive points out of the way. I've read almost everything Mr. King has written up 'til the point, and I firmly believe that he will be lauded in retrospect (laudation always seems to occur in retrospect) as one of the preeminent writers of his generation. His prose is artful, his characters believable, and his stories spell-binding, and the Dark Tower is no exception. It is, as he has frequently said, the lynchpin around which his universe revolves.In recent years, however, I've seen this as becoming more of a crutch than anything else. Mr. King has been inserting Dark Tower-isms into everything he's written as of late, and while I don't necessarily mind this particular conceit, it frequently comes off occasionally as something he simply cannot escape doing (like that legendary gag about how every William Shatner TV appearence includes the word &quot;Klingons&quot; somewhere). &quot;Black House&quot; disappointed me by turning the vibrant and original world of the &quot;Territories&quot; that he and Peter Straub created in &quot;The Talisman&quot; into just another adjunct of the Dark Tower universe. I was hoping, then, that the actual followup to the series would solve the problem a bit, at the very least making all of these tie-ins worthwhile.&quot;Wolves of the Calla,&quot; then, is something of a mixed experience. For the first time, a Dark Tower book feels like it's being written long after previous installments. References to the previous books in the series feel forced, almost of a &quot;hey, remember when *that* happened?&quot; sort; if one follows Mr. King's advice and picks up this book after refreshing on the previous four, many of these references feel unnecesary and oddly out-of-character for our forward-looking troupe. Additionally, I lost count of the times exchanges of obligatory &quot;casual reference to another world meets with confusion which is dispelled with a knowing 'never mind'&quot; occured. King mostly avoids his tendency to &quot;overforeshadow&quot; this time around (&quot;He walked down the street for what would be his last time as a human being with two arms&quot;), which is a nice surprise.So let's see. Two paragraphs of criticism...wow. The flaws of &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; are a shame, because King's written another excellent story. While parallels to the *other* grand epic in the current mindset are usually discouraged with regard to King's tale, I can't help but note that this is the &quot;Two Towers&quot; of his series. &quot;Woves of the Calla&quot; finds the main journey arc on pause as character development and exposition come to the fore, but King's talents at characterization and humanization mean that this is a welcome variation from the previous installments. Some have written justifiably on issues of pacing (the book's final showdown is left to the last fifty pages), but this is besides the point; &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; is less about the conflict of the villagers than it is about demonstrating how our protagonists have changed over the course of these five books. And at showing this King succeeds brilliantly.The verdict? &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; is an excellent addition to the ongoing series, and its somewhat bizarre cliffhanger (which is no secret by now, finding King magnifying his joy of author-insertion to some previously-unrecognized levels) is sure to keep people looking forward to the next volume. &quot;Wolves&quot; feels a bit rusty at times--King has become so proficient at oblique references to the Dark Tower series that the book's *direct* references to the mythology feel forced--but at worst it feels like it was perhaps underedited. If you're a fan of the Dark Tower, you won't be disappointed. If you're a casual browser...well, you might want to start at the beginning."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Maybe not the best in the series...I still think the fourth book holds that place, but well worth the wait.It is in this book we see the characters finally work together as trained Gunslingers. Each of the characters has a pressing problem and hardship in their lives, and yet they must put them aside to help the children of the Calla . How these characters deal with their own monumental problems and act as true heroes at the same time is a reflection of the fact they have become true gunslingers, following Roland.King also takes the opportunity to let this book show us more of Roland's world and culture. I found the dance Roland did at the start of the book fascinating, and the society of goddess worshiping disk throwing women seemed like they might have walked out of the pages of Roman Mythology. King does a great job rounding the culture, and giving us views of the world just as if we were reading a historical fiction, instead of high fantasy.Wolves of the Calla, at 736 pages, is the longest yet of the series. But the length is justified as King takes time to create characters and places so real, you feel as if you might have been there before in some odd and half forgotten dream. He builds suspense to the final battle with the Wolves, and then makes that battle as fast, and horrible as any real war skirmish.Many complained about the references to pop culture, Kings other works, and aspects of the \\"real\\" world, but I thought they only served to make the idea of the Tower as an axis of reality more believable. Making himself a real, yet invisible character in the book gave me a little shiver, after all...if King is real in that world so am I and all his readers. Heh heh heh. It only served to make the sense of so many realities tied in one moment of fate more grand.King also makes the themes of choices and payment for those choices central. Lives are altered forever by the Calla's choice to go along with the Wolves so long. Susannah's brave choice of using her sexuality as a weapon against the portal demon in book 3 is now coming due for payment as the birth of her monstrous child approaches. The choice the Father makes in forcing Roland's hand to not offer Susannah an abortion is about to be paid. Yet, King doesn't moralize these choices. He shows each character as someone who simply made the best choice they could. There is a great tragedy in this, and also a great beauty.I recommend this to anyone who has found their hearts tied to the fate of the brave little Ka-Tet. To anyone who has not read the others, go back to book one first and take the journey to this one. Only then will you truly understand the path that these brave gunslingers have walked so far, to save the tower and all realities. And you will understand how far the along the path they really have still to go.Hold on to your horses, kids. Its going to be a hell of a ride."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen King has said that of all the books he has written, the Dark Tower is the most important and deeply meaningful work he has produced. Reading each successive volume, I can see that this is increasingly true. The series seems to be the summing up of his writing career by incorporating many of the characters, story lines, philosophies, mythologies, and literary inspirations of his previous works into this single far-reaching fantasy universe. This fifth installment more strongly than ever incorporates such references, including Salem's Lot, The Stand, Hearts in Atlantis, and many others. He also includes references to a myriad of books by other authors besides the obvious Tolkien. I found allusions to the works of L. Frank Baum, J.K. Rowling, Richard Adams, and even Marvel Comics.I will not provide a detailed recap of the story here since so many other reviewers have already done so. What I will attempt to do is explain why I give Wolves of the Calla only 3 stars, as well as to list its strengths and weaknesses. The story of the residents of the Calla and their joining forces with Roland's ka-tet to vanquish the wolves deserves 5 stars. There is intrigue, town politics, an ominous threat hanging over the twin children of the residents, and an exciting battle between Wolf and man. The personalities of the townsfolk, who are divided in their opinions of whether to fight or submit to the wolves, are well developed, as is that of the enigmatic Andy the Messenger Robot. King has done an excellent job developing the mythology and culture of the &quot;folken&quot; of Calla Bryn Sturgis. The reader is treated to a realistic and colorful portrayal of their language, culture, festivals, music, and traditions. After finishing the story, I felt that I had actually taken a trip there and met its inhabitants.Where the story line falls short, and earns the book only 3 stars, is the middle half of the novel, where there is a lot of travel to the New York of 1977 and many side narratives about the pasts of several of the protagonists. The travel, sometimes performed involuntarily through a mystical &quot;todash&quot; and sometimes voluntarily through another magical doorway, leads to efforts to protect the rose of previous episodes from harm. Not only is all this back-and-forth action distracting, but the ka-tet's dealings with the owner of the lot upon which the rose grows, and with the hoodlums who threaten him, is tedious. Also in this middle half is an excessive amount of tale telling about the pasts of several of the characters. Pere Callahan's tale is essentially a sequel to Salem's Lot, and has no place here.The illustrations have added a lot to the cost of the book, but little to enhance the story. I give one star to these illustrations. Granted, Roland's Mid-World is a gloomy place, but these paintings are too gloomy and colorless. Every character is depicted as sinister. They all look physically mangy and stringy, even the good folken of the Calla.Although I prefer King's horror fiction to his Dark Tower epic, being an ardent King fan I feel duty-bound to read the entire story - all seven volumes worth. Besides, I do want to know how Roland and his ka-tet manage to save Mid-World from the evil of the Dark Tower. Reading the entire magnum opus does require a large commitment, since the story, when completed, is projected to weigh in at more than 3,500 pages. Needless to say this volume of the series should not be tackled unless you have already read the previous volumes, and thus it is best left to the diehard Stephen King or Dark Tower fans. Of course this installment will leave the story, and you, hanging in midair. But have no fear... the last two volumes will be released before year's end.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I received a Donald M. Grant Artist Edition of this book a couple of weeks ago and threw aside my life for the next couple of days. I was a little weary because while I enjoyed &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;, I was afraid that maybe Stephen King may have lost his Dark Tower touch from the earlier novels (namely &quot;Drawing of the Three&quot; and &quot;The Waste Lands&quot;). My fears were assuaged and as it now stands, this may be the best book in the series to date. Past characters that readers of the series may have forgotten about resurface and King entwines them into the narrative magnificently. Favorite characters from the series also mature and the climax of this installment literally had me trembling with anticipation. Anyone who may have doubted King's ability in recent years to reel off an excellent &quot;yarn&quot; can rest still as this book reinstills the notion that SK is our master storyteller. Fans of the series will not be disappointed and I encourage anyone who has not yet picked up the DT books to start at the beginning as this is not a series to pick up right in the middle. The only minor gripe is one that I have with most of SK books (don't get me wrong, SK is without doubt my favorite author) in that the book can seem a bit bloated at times, but not nearly as bad as Wizard and Glass (or the dreadful Tommyknockers). I am so excited for this series and I hope that for a wonder, the next book, Song of Susannah gets pushed to next spring instead of next summer, as King pulls a bit of a Blaine the Mono on the reader and we are left with quite a cliffhanger.&quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; gets my highest recommendation!!!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"First of all I'll start by saying that this book is the best in the series so far. I loved the character development. I do have to say that some parts of this book won't make much sense unless you are a well read King fan. However, I believe, this will only make folks all the more curious to learn of the all encompassing world that is the Dark Tower series. I just wish it was summer of 2004 so I can see what happens. Oh well, I waited over five years for this volume, I'm sure I can stand to wait 7 or 8 monthsfor the next one. I'll end by saying that while I am a very quick reader, I was surprised by the fact I finished all 719 pages in under 8 hours. I guess I was ready for this one!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I am a huge King fan, and a big fan of the DARK TOWER books. Although the books tend to allow the worst of King's writing habits to come into full bloom, all the best of his habits are also allowed to thrive, and pretty much choke out the faults.WOLVES OF CALLA absolutely requires that you have read the other 4 books. You can't dive into this series without it. I suppose reading the four page summary at the beginning gives you the rudimentary plot, but what you miss is all feeling of attachment to the characters, all the EMOTION you have invested in the story.The book is long, and it is as lanquidly paced as the others. King isn't zipping through one plot twist after another. He is slowly building suspense and mystery, as he also slowly grows our committment to seeing these characters through to the end. The travelers are diverted to the village of Calla Bryn Sturgis, to help them out of their troubles with the Wolves...I'll say no more about what that trouble is. We think we're just being diverted from the main track of getting to the tower, but we slowly see that the travelers MUST go through the village to meet key people and learn key things about the two worlds (or are there more?).King devotees will love the references to past books, particularly the enormous importance of Salem's Lot. Also, the Low Men in Yellow Jackets (from Hearts in Atlantis) are featured heavily. In some ways, we are somewhat jarred from enjoying the book but counting the ways King keeps knitting it all together. That's a small problem. On the other hand, his ability to stich all his many worlds from his past many decades of writing into one quilt begins to bring a unity of vision to ALL his work that is admirable. It doesn't all add up (kinda like the conspiracy in X-Files never added up) but it's fun and adds a richness to the overall experience of reading King.The book brilliantly shows King's gift for creating character and mood. Several times throughout the novel, new characters sorta sit down and tell us their life stories. It's a way of stretching the novel...an occasional problem King has with some of his lesser works...books like CUJO which are really novellas he stretches into novels (with CUJO it still works great...with THE DARK HALF...it doesn't). But the thing about the Dark Tower books is this...we WANT the epic scale. It's almost like THE LORD OF THE RINGS books. The backstory and &quot;filler&quot; is what makes it rich and emersive. We don't feel skimped on.I can't wait for the rest of the series. If you haven't tried THE DARK TOWER before, now is the time. It's a towering achievement!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I delayed reading this novel for several months with the unshakeable notion that this could be the downfall, the weak link, of the majesty of the Dark Tower series. In many respects, this was the case indeed.I consider myself to be a faithful reader of King's works, although after finished reading each one, I am left with the feeling of disillusionment and a sense of dissatisfaction. With the exception of a few pieces, most notably \\"Misery,\\" \\"Dolores Claiborne,\\" and The Dark Tower I-IV, I feel as though the anticipatory phase before reading the novel becomes the most fulfilling aspect of the whole experience. This is essentially the same final response I felt after reading \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\"Positive features:+ One main reason I enjoyed this series in the first place was its immaculate ability to create an essence of \\"realistic fiction,\\" or the concept of keeping certain ideas, manners, and situations grounded to reality while taking place in very unorthodox and fantastical setting. Reading these books doesn't seem much like delving into a mythical world of dragons and magic as it does seem as if we are glimpsing into the far future of our own world and our eventual destination. And although the majority of \\"Wolves\\" keeps true to this trend, I do see something of a deterioration in King's ability to maintain this same atmosphere.+ I found the new character depths into which King propelled his readers to be very profound and essential to the continuation of this series. I particularly appreciated that each of the character's limits and emotional ranges were pushed to brand-new heights that allowed readers to witness completely new frontiers and features of their individuality. However, I felt that Jake's dilemma did not have an effective resolution by its end, and I surely hope it will be further developed in the next installment.+ The use of several side stories throughout the main plot was very effective in keeping the piece interesting and rich. Diverting the reader's attention to other issues concerning alternate futures and pasts urges us to become more willing and eager to discover and unfold more of the primary mystery, an excellent tactic to maintain the story's flavour.Negative features:- A particular con I found in this novel was the dreadfully anticlimactic conclusion. I found there to be chapters upon chapters of planning and deception and espionage to finally lead up to such a pitiful and arbitrarily brief display of battle that half of the book's content was meaningless. It also left me with the burning question, \\"What was the worry all about?\\"- Several unexplainable, and most importantly confusing parts of the novel also continually reappeared and made progress through the novel more difficult than necessary. First of all, the sudden and unexpected introduction of the mysterious \\"19\\" concept on page 37 made for an uneven transition from \\"Wizard and Glass\\" and the previous absence of this \\"Mysterious Number.\\" I also felt that the constant uses of secrets and undeterminable details made for a frustrating read in the sense that it forced readers to continually backtrack in the novel and reread past events in order to gain a full comprehension of the current issues. Examples of this include Tian Jafford's whispered secret, Callahan's association with the name of the Calla itself, and the general plans and strategies made by the tet to defeat the Wolves. However, I could see how this style could fit in nicely with the theme of individuals keeping their own personal secrets from others (Susannah's Mia, Roland's arthritis, etc.).- What I also found bewildering was the tet's own reaction to the existence and sudden presence of the gruesome terror, Black Thirteen. The Pere's reaction was quite accurate to the expected response, but I found there to be little more than a bat of an eye at this fact. Unless I was mistaken that this being was the epitome, the bare essence of all sinfully destructive, sadistically horrifying, and malevolently vile facets known to all creation since the beginning of time, condensed into one single orb whose only intention is to become the harbinger of only pure misery and malicious suffering to all life, they should have had a bit more of a shock to be in its possession. That they would willingly and practically recklessly manipulate this entity into performing their own tasks was enough alone to make me wonder if King knew exactly what he was dealing with.- Another minor issue I had with this volume was the poor illustrations used. With the exception of one, titled \\"You stainless steel bastard,\\" I found they completely lacked any emotion and felt almost void of any importance or relevance with the actual chain of events they attempted to recreate visually.- As a final point, I was under the impression by the end that King's only intention to create the poor excuse for a cliff-hanger and leave the story half resolved was the need to ensure readers would anticipate the next installment and feel obligated to shell out the fifty dollars (in Canada, at least) to buy the Dark Tower VI, no matter how undeniable the sense is that he may be running out of his original panache and ingenuity.These opinions only encompass my personal response to the outcome of the newest volume of the Dark Tower series, \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\" They should not completely influence your own position on this particular novel, but I hope that it did open some unfound doors and point of views of your own that have remained shut and lost. I also wish that this review should not bias you to whether or not purchasing this book should benefit or hinder your outlook on King's ability to create a profound, fulfilling tale, for there are many other better examples of him at his finest. I sincerely hope that the proceeding installments in this series do not pursue the same route as \\"Wolves,\\" but instead seek a more professional and intriguing path."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Reading a Stephen King novel is very similar to eating just one of a nationally known brand of potato chips: You can't stop at just one. King has a knack for encouraging the reader to spend significant amounts of time in his very real alternate universe. So much so, both the loyal fan and uninitiated hunger for more. It's a good thing then that his books are as enjoyable as a visit from an old friend time after time, read after read. For those who have not yet read any of the volumes in The Dark Tower series, it is more of a gift than a prerequisite to read the previous four novels prior to settling in with Wolves of the Calla. King's storytelling is so masterful that one does not absolutely, positively have to read the others before this one (as the author suggests in the brief synopsis preceding the first chapter) but like butter on hot bread, having that knowledge makes the story just that much richer.Wolves of the Calla takes place in an alternate universe within an alternate universe that could be earth's future, past or even present. The point being that it is an alternate universe with very real similarities to our own. King fans will recognize themes from other favorites such as The Stand, Hearts in Atlantis and Insomnia. Although the heroes of Wolves of the Calla don't actually appear as instrumental characters in the pages of these novels, their presence is certainly felt and their quest for The Dark Tower influences a plot or two. Rather, it is the underlying presence of evil that lurks on the pages of most King novels that is the common character throughout.The folk of Calla are good, hardworking townspeople who's spirits have been wounded by an evil force that preys on their children. Specifically, the many pair of twins who are born and reside in the town. In Calla, it seems having sets of twins is more the norm than the exception. The story builds as one by one the residents of Calla gather the courage to stand and fight the evil force preying on their spirits and the souls of their children. They must first, however, gather the resources to gain the assistance of Roland the gunslinger and his band of weary, yet fierce, warriors. In true King fashion, there is just enough truth to the horrific events that follow to allow a reader to question the thin fabric of the wool that covers the eyes of our reality. Gun battles, multiple personalities, computers gone haywire, corporations controlled by evil... Corporations controlled by evil? Sounds a lot like the 21st Century.Wolves of the Calla is an excellent blend of horror, science fiction and fantasy. It is entertaining and thought provoking. King develops the characters in a way that makes them human and allows the events to flow like a river downstream... into the gaping mouth of a blood thirsty monster. In this alternate universe nothing is what it seems, yet everything has an air of familiarity. It is in this familiarity that King frightens us the most, because there is nothing more frightening that the alternate reality of King's mind."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla is not a colossal disappointment, but it is fundamentally unsatisfying. The first three Dark Tower books were lean and delicious. The fourth and, now, the fifth are bloated and bland.I remember Mr King's afterword in Wizard and Glass, in which he said he finally had to force himself to sit down and 'just *write* the thing'. Now, as another reviewer has noted, he feels he has to finish the series out of obligation, so he has again forced himself to bang out the last three books rapid-fire in order to have done with it, rather than because the tales need to be told. He said before he wrote the Dark Tower books so slowly because he could not force himself to write them; they just 'came'; they just wrote themselves. Starting with Wizard and Glass, he abandoned that thinking, so he's on autopilot, and it shows. I have always said I must see the end of The Dark Tower, but if Mr King does not know how to end it, it would be better left unfinished with the last book in the series he wrote with real feeling and the need to tell a tale: The Waste Lands.The story is the basic plot of Wizard and Glass again, only this time with no framing story and a shockingly boring trip to New York or three. That is, Roland and his friends arrive at a sleepy farming and ranching town about to be attacked by outside forces. The ka-tet dicker and dither about as a showdown slowly (oh, how slowly) approaches, just as Roland and his compatriots did in Mejis.Father Callahan appears (this is no spoiler as King gave it away both in other Dark Tower books and on his web site), but why? Nothing that happens to him once he leaves 'Salem's Lot is interesting (another mystery Mr King should have left unsolved), and his simultaneously silly and boring backstory eats up a large part of the book. As far as his role in the story, well, I for one would not have noticed it were Callahan by his behaviour. This characters acts nothing like the broken priest who took the bus to Chicago after taking a vampire's communion. And the book doesn't even include that classic line from Barlow ('Now, false priest, take *my* communion!') Alain's fate is revealed in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it flashback. I shall not tell you exactly what it was, but suffice to say it was substantially less interesting than what I had come up with, and I expect better from Mr King.The revelation about the nature of the Wolves is delayed purely for cheap suspense and hardly awe-inspiring when it is revealed. In fact, it's downright tame.As another reviewer noted (and the same is true of Wizard and Glass), at the conclusion of this book the ka-tet have barely moved an inch on their long journey to the Tower. The journey now seems to take place between novels, and the novels are written about isolated incidents that occur along the way. Wolves of the Calla is a sideshow, an event Mr King or perhaps another author could have written about as a corollary to the main tale once The Dark Tower is complete.This book is not mediocre King. It is simply mediocre."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Just finished The Dark Tower V.I enjoyed it while I was reading, but now that I'm done I'm starting to feel like a sucker. This book teaches me a lesson; never recommend a series to my friends until it is complete. After reading the epilogue, I dropped \`Wolves of the Calla' in disgust, then had to scrub at the sink for ten minutes to get the ink stains off my hands.What a horrible ending. HATED all the winks to pop culture. And the self referential stuff was even worse. Right now at stephenking.com there is a pop up animation of the author's head. First it plugs the new Dark Tower book, then it just floats there on the screen, following the movements of your mouse with it's eyes. Trust me, it is the scariest thing from Stephen King in ten years. And I feel like it's laughing at us.I understand King will be making an appearance as a character in the series (wearing jeans and Chuck Taylors, I'm sure.) I hope Roland fills him full of lead for messing with his character.What was up with the Gunslinger in this book? He had some great moments, but what happened to him being a \`Tower Junkie?' His quest seems to be loosing steam, when it should be gaining intensity. I thought the device of the Doorway Cave was the only concrete step the Ka-Tet took towards the Dark Tower, and it felt both under-developed and contrived.The scenes set in New York City were repetitive and boring. King once joked that he could publish his shopping list and it would sell. As I followed the characters while they ran errands through Manhattan, I felt the author was following through on his threat.For me, the best part of the book was the defense of the Calla. I enjoyed the western style heroics, and thought the final battle worked pretty well. This time I was really grooving on Eddie as a character, and Jake and Oy were as good as ever. For my part, I enjoyed the inclusion of Pere Callahan, and his interesting post-Salem's Lot history. I am undecided on the Mia story line.King has used the character of Susannah Dean in some really strange ways throughout the series, and I am \`hongry' to see where he is going with all of it. I think Susannah is a fascinating character, but sometimes the subtext surrounding her baffles me. She is the second character in a Stephen King novel whose sole purpose during a battle scene is to provide sex . If you have read IT, you know the super weird scene with young Beverly Marsh I am referring to.But now I'm just nit-picking. I figure I would forgive all if it weren't for that awful ending.It's not that I am opposed to the idea of metafiction, or breaking down the \`fourth wall.' But the Dark Tower was never presented as \\"Adaptation.\\" From the start, we were asked to take this quest seriously, and as readers, we responded. It seems a bit late in the game for the author to start winking at us.To end on a positive note, I thought it was very cool of Stephen King to dedicate the book to Frank Muller, who read all of the audio versions of The Dark Tower to such incredible effect. Actually, Wolves of the Calla was the first book in the series I have read. Up until now, I had the pleasure of listening to the audio versions performed by Muller, an amazingly talented storyteller. If you read the Afterwards, you know Frank Muller was in a terrible motorcycle accident recently, and is still recovering. Despite my opinions of the novel, I think Stephen King is a stand up guy for donating all income from the audio version of Calla to a foundation set up for Frank."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"You already love the Dark Tower saga, or you wouldn't be here reading the reviews. You don't want to have the plot given away, you just want to know - does it stack up? Is it worthy of what went before?The answers are yes, and probably. When King began this project, he knew that his muse was drawing him into it, knew that he would be taking the unearthly, doomed but defiant mood of Browning's \\"Childe Roland\\" and that in the figure of Roland the Gunslinger, he would be wedding it to the American version of the knight errant. But he didn't know the shape of the plot, or even if it would all lose direction and fizzle out. He was still groping his way forward, trusting his instincts, until book four. The venture dug deeper than his usual fare, but it also felt picaresque, improvisational, sometimes quirkily imagistic.This volume makes it clear that he knows where he's going, and means to arrive there smooth and clean. There's a single clear narrative, with none of the sense of flailing around that troubled some of the earlier volumes. The wild west atmosphere has - temporarily, one hopes - gained ascendancy over Browning's edge-of-the-world eeriness. But that suits this rustic leg of the quest just fine. (I regret to report that the science fiction trappings that entered the story with Blaine the Train grow a little thicker, which also thins out the Dark Tower flavor a bit.)But even as Roland's Magnificent Five (counting Jake's billy bumbler) adopt a town in trouble, prepare to face down the terrorizing gang, and add a country priest to bring the company's number to six, large forces are moving under the surface. These are both the forces within Roland's universe, which has been designed to encompass all universes, and the forces driving King's own creativity.My feeling reading this instalment was, that King isn't just being cute bringing in characters and motifs from his other novels - that country priest from 'Salem's lot, and the low men in yellow coats, among others. Knowing for sure now how Roland's story will come out, he is feeling out the subconscious affinities these other stories always did have with the Dark Tower, which has after all grown up right alongside them. And the interconnection the Dark Tower forms among multiple worlds has something to do with the interconnection art makes (and King's art in particular has made) with multiple realities: fictions and legends and personal pasts.I strongly suspect King knows just what he's up to. He intends the next two books to round off his career; and among other things he is now writing a story about the nature of stories. That accounts for the twists near the end that some reviewers are objecting to. In other hands, such nesting could become a tiresome post-modern trick. But post-modernists don't care much for stories; King does, and my money says he's going to do something different and interesting with the theme.In the meantime this segment, with its little detour from the path of the beam, moves fluidly and grippingly, and is satisfying in its own right."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"One would figure that at some point along the DT series, Roland would be called upon to act out his societal role: to be a gunslinger and provide \\"aid and succor\\" to a group in need. When I discovered that Wolves of the Calla was just that, I became excited. Just think: A group of viscious monster wolves ride in on horseback and periodically take away the town's children, returning them later mentally ruined, or \\"Roont.\\" Roland is called upon to battle this evil and save the town. Sounds good to me.Unfortunately, way to much time is spent contemplating a strategy for this battle. Indeed, when you read how quickly and simply the final battle is resolved, you feel robbed and wasted of your prior reading time. Heck, if the ka-tet was just going to round up the \\"wolves\\" and slaughter them, why all the town meetings and politics and strategy planning?And then there were the \\"wolves.\\" Little robots with spinning \\"thinking caps\\" on their heads, dressed up as wolves??? What happened to King being the master horrormeister. Sorry, Steve, but that wouldn't scare a child; in fact, most would giggle at the concept. And then making them carry lightsabers and Harry Potter snitches??! Too many elements of the story quickly develop the silliness of the Emerald Palace scene at the end of Vol 4.The book is also way too wordy. Did we really need all of that time spent developing Father Callahan's past?? I love character evolution, but Callahan's past history with HOME (an addict shelter) and with other people who worked there did NOTHING to advance this story. In fact, it seems to be written soley to satisfy fans of 'Salem's Lot, who might wonder what ever happened to that priest light in faith?Overall, a mildly entertaining read, but way too long, a little on the boring side, and massively disappointing at the climax. Probably the worst book of the series. The good news: I've just finished Volume 6 (Song of Susannah), and King recovers nicely. A much more concise and spritely tale.Commala-com-lookJust get through this bookCommala-ca-detterThe series again gets better"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Like most of you I waited several years for the release of Wolves of the Calla, much like I waited for Wizard and Glass before it. Anyone familiar with the series is likely to be a hardcore fan of it like myself, appreciating it for it's very unique blend of Western, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Tolkein level sense of Epic. These are among the most complex set of characters that I've ever read about.Wolves of the Calla covers somewhat new ground for this series. It is also very different from it's 4 predecessors, and as the title of my review indicates, I can't tell you exactly why. There's no one thing that makes it different and yet the feel is a little *off* from the rest of the DT books. I don't seem to be alone in this as others have pointed out what they feel might be the cause/s for this. I hate putting numbered lists in my reviews, but it might be the best way to do it here...1. Callahan. If any of you have ever read Salem's Lot(a great book on it's own merit)then you'll recognize this character right away. At the end of that book Father Callahan hopped on a Greyhound headed anywhere, with the Mark of Cain on him. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I seem to remember that this mark..this *aura* if you will, about him made other people shy away from him, filling them with a sick dread with his presence. And yet from the time he leaves Maine and lives in the Calla this is essentially not there. Further his backstory takes up a great deal of the book, a surprising amount of it actually. Ordinarily this wouldn't bother me but...I don't feel the same lure to this character that I do with the main characters of the ka-tet that we know and hold dear to us. Perhaps this will change as the story moves on, and I suspect it will.2. The ka-tet is getting a little frayed. This is a little difficult to explain, but with every book before there was always this magnetic force, a tangible thing you could feel as you read, between the characters of Roland's group. It was there briefly at the beginning of the book but disappears shortly after. Characters do thier own thing, the group is splintered somehow, and it boggles me. I know that part of this is in the plot of the story, but...c'mon folks, one of the things that's made the DT series so endearing was how this group of strangers became as close as a family and worked in perfect cohesion. Without that under everything the story loses something.3. Roland is beginning to concern me. Save for a very believable and understandable period at the end of Wizard and Glass, he has seldom displayed emotion more than the occasional hint of smile. Yet in Wolves of the Calla...he laughs...he smiles (a lot), he displays great impatience (the twirling of his finger and &quot;speed up the story&quot;), and out of the blue comes arthritis. I suspect maybe all of this will be incorporated and successfully woven in somehow in the last 2 books of the series, but how I have no idea. It didn't feel *exactly* like the enigmatic Roland that I've come to know from prior books. The only flashback (another post mentioned there's almost none), is one that greatly interested me. Of Roland and Cuthbert at the battle of Jericho Hill. Please....*tell me more*, for your father's sake.4. New York. Probably one of the things that made The Drawing of the Three so great was watching Roland's interaction with a city like New York. &quot;Tooterfish&quot;, &quot;astin&quot;, and gunslinger/cops. It made you smile (and often laugh with Eddie's side commentary) and yearn for more. But in Wolves, visiting our world has become...well...mundane somehow. It feels like ground already trodden, and because of this the story suffers somewhat. I don't want to goto New York, I want to find more mysterious burnt out cities, speaking rings, and weird locales and situations that made the first 4 books so great.5. Miscellany. What I'm quickly discovering is that Roland's ka-tet interacts *wonderfully* within itself. But when others become involved (or an entire settlement) the interaction feels rather weird and sometimes strained. While you'll see parts in here that link to Hearts in Atlantis, Salem's Lot, etc, a lot of it feels....forced somehow. I just can't put my finger on it exactly though. And the ending! Steve buddy...I'm going to trust you in spite of it...you're one of the few who might be able to pull something like this off. I'm trusting you Mr. King...please don't let us all down.The story itself has slow buildup, and when the titular characters finally come the fight lasts about 8 pages (while very good in itself). The artwork while a little heavy-handed is still worlds better than the neo-cubism/scratchwork art of Wizard and Glass. To quote Jake, That is the truth. It's a good book...it just feels...different somehow. And maybe a little forced and too convenient for itself at times. It's good enough for me to give it 4 stars, but it is by no means the best of the DT series (I reserve that distinction as a tie between Drawing of the Three and The Wastelands). Bring on Song of Sussanah, ye ken? We're all waiting!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"If Wolves was \\"Just another King book\\" I would have given it 3, maybe 4 stars if I was in a generous mood. This however isn't \\"just another book\\". This is the path of the beam. This, is the Gunslinger series. When I read Kings latest disappointments \\"Dreamcatcher\\" and \\"Buick\\" I was worried about the fate of the Gunslinger series. King has just exceeded my worst fears. No, this book isn't scary, it's an terribly wrong turn for the DarkTower.Through four books I've followed Roland on his quest. I've loved that world, it's history and the characters that live there. I believed King was writing something important, but \\"Wolves\\" has shattered that. What has made this series great, up till now, has been the sense of Roland's world being a real world. You could almost touch it. Parallel to ours and maybe slightly out of our (the readers) reach, but it was still a real place. King has crushed that. Now the book has no importance. There's nothing of consequence as The Gunslinger Series has just turned into \\"The Never-ending Story\\". Stephen has now shown us that the Gunslinger's world is inhabited by characters from Marvel Comics, light-sabers from StarWars and, worst of all *shudder* Sneetches from *heavy sigh* Harry stinking Potter *rolls eyes*. What's in store for book 6, \\"Revenge of the Rock-Biter\\" and \\"Harry Potter meets the gunslinger\\"?It would have been better if King Never finished this book than to destroy this series this way. The Gunslinger had been King's finest work. It's now trash and I'm very, very sad."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I started reading The Dark Tower series years ago. I started to read Wolves of the Calla a couple of times, but I just couldn't get interested in it, but this time I picked it up, started from the beginning again and roared through in a couple of weeks or less. Not having read too many other Stephen King novels, I wasn't aware of the tie-in with Salem's Lot and Pere Callahan, a character in Wolves who was in Salem's. Roland and his ka-tet's stopping at Calla Bryn Sturgis brought their travels to a halt for a while, and Roland's decision to help the folken of the Calla fight off the wolves who attack about once every twenty years, taking one of each set of twins, was a welcome break for characters and readers. I got more of a feeling that the Dark Tower is looming in Roland's mind and his following the beams is close to an obsession now. I think that all of them, Eddie, Susannah, Jake and Roland, and now Pere Callahan, are ready to move on by the end of this book. I have to agree with several other reviewers that the back and forth to New York so many times got a bit tedious and boring for me in the middle of the book, and I wondered when the final contact with the wolves would come. I actually enjoyed the references to Blaine, the thinny and some of their past experiences, but references to Harry Potter and some other quite modern things seemed not to be in sync with the times they were in.Character development was especially good in this book. Pere Callahan is an interesting one, and Susannah never fails to entertain with her multiple personalities that she seems to carry. The habits of the newest one are rather disgusting. The people of the Calla are a folksy, western group who love to cook big meals and eat outdoors and have a dance or two. The description of Roland's dance is wonderful, and the visual in my mind was so funny and just plain fun. Why the people of the Calla never tried to make a serious plan to fight off the wolves was strange, but they just kind of resolved themselves to the fact that one of a set of their twins would be taken and would be returned by train as a roont, intelligence stripped, growing into a gigantic-sized person who met an early death. Truly ruined.What disappointed me was the back and forth to NYC in the middle of the book, Mr. Tower, his books and the crooks, and the fact that the final battle with the wolves, which is planned during a good part of the book, takes place in the last few pages of this very long novel. During all of this, Jake is growing up, makes a new friend and his character is well-developed. Eddie doesn't change much, but he's a favorite of mine, and the Billy Bumbler, Oy, is a great side-kick for Jake. I have the final two books in the series waiting for me to read, and I'm going to start within the next couple of days, because the Tower is ever nearer and I want to find out what the ending is. I just hope it doesn't happen within the last few pages, but is given a little bit more story time. I gave it four stars because I did enjoy the book very much overall and it made me very anxious to read the next one.Thankee sai, and long days and pleasant nights to ya."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"While there continue to be many elements of fantasy and science fiction, \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" is more strongly influenced by Westerns than the previous novels in the series. Roland, Eddie, Susannah, and Jack are continuing to follow the Beam in search of the Dark Tower when they come across Calla Bryn Sturgis, a town in need of help. Every twenty-some years or so, riders on wolves come to the town and take some of their children. Oddly enough, most of the children born in the area are twins; the wolves generally take one from each pair. Some of the townsfolk are tired of doing nothing and want to fight, so when Andy the messenger robot informs them the wolves are coming soon, they seek help. Part of being gunslingers is a willingness to help people in need to ask for aid. Roland and his group soon find their destiny intertwined with the town.The presence nearby of another piece of the Wizard's Rainbow causes members of Roland's ka-tet to go todash, another type of transportation between worlds, and visit New York City. There they discover that the rose in the vacant lot is in trouble. To save it, they must deal with Calvin Tower, owner of the lot and the bookstore where Jake bought the riddle book and \\"Charlie the Choo-Choo\\"; Tower is being threatened by goons from Balazar, the same mob boss who tried to kill Eddie. These are just the start of the many coincidences which the ka-tet begin to notice.Thus they find themselves with two major tasks - save the rose and defeat the wolves. Another complication quickly arises when it's discovered Susannah is pregnant, mostly likely with a demon child. Part of the puzzle falls into place when they learn the story of Pere Callahan, a priest living in the Calla who originally came from another New York City in another time. Callahan's tale is a very interesting one, from his time in Salem's Lot when he faced a vampire through his travels between alternate versions of America.The battle with the wolves doesn't last very long, but that doesn't take anything away from the book's quality. Once again the story is engaging and very detailed. King describes the town in such a way anyone who's watched a Western can easily picture it in their mind. There are only a couple surprises; however, even though some of it is predictable, it remains interesting throughout. It's another quality entry in the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"As most people know, this is King's first return to Roland since the 1997 publication of Wizard and Glass, excusing \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" of course. This book begins the second half of Roland's story. Wolves, Song of Susannah, and The Dark Tower were all published within rapid succession of each other because King felt it was time to finish the series.Wolves of the Calla follows Roland's \\"ka-tet\\" to Calla Bryn Sturgis, a remote town harassed by \\"the Wolves\\", a group of creatures who wear wolf masks and appear every generation to collect children. The Wolves only take twins and they only take one of the twins, which they then return later on, but in a \\"roont\\" state, similar to retardation. Roland and the ka-tet enter Calla Bryn Sturgis days before the coming of the Wolves and are drawn into the conflict. Along the way they gain another member of the group, Father Donald Callahan from \`Salem's Lot, another of King's novels.Wolves succeeds in making the characters more complex. Roland finds temporary love, not to mention suffers from arthritis. Eddie matures greatly and stops making so many banal jokes. Susannah, pregnant with her \\"chap\\", develops another personality named \\"Mia\\". Jake befriends a local boy and finds acceptance for the first time since leaving New York. Even Father Callahan develops. His transition from New England priest to End World wanderer is some of King's finest writing.However, much of the plot is unnecessary. I think that King felt that he'd overdeveloped Roland's character in Wizard and had to compensate for the rest of the group. There is an overabundance here of back story or \\"palaver\\" as King calls it. For the majority of the novel, the characters sit around and either talk about their past, or their plans for defeating the Wolves. The novel is rife with throwaway characters, many of whom are particular only to the Calla. While this may not be a bad method of storytelling for a standalone novel, creating atmosphere for example, it detracts from the overall story of the series.While not a bad book, Wolves is like the Nebraska of the Dark Tower series; it's a long, necessary path on the way to something greater and a lot more interesting."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is my favorite book of the Dark Tower series.I've never been a huge fan of horror (Stephen King's or anyone's else) but the fantasy aspect of this particular series has really caught my attention. And in truth this is much more fantasy than your typical Stephen King horror.In their ongoing quest to reach the Black Tower, Roland and his Ka-tet (Eddie, Jake, Susannah and Oy) come to a farm village called Calla Bryn Sturgis where some disturbing occurrences have been happening of late. Strange wolves started raiding the area about the same time children began to disappear, only to reappear, but drastically changed. Does it have something to do with the arrival of the 'wolves'? What is going on with the children? Is Andy the Robot all that he appears? And what is going on with Susannah? Reasonable questions that are all answered by books end.I found that this 5th installment had a high level of suspense. I could not wait to get to the end of this book as I knew it would be climaxing with a terrific battle; a battle that I felt (IMHO) was one of the best actions of the entire series.Other reviewers mentioned that there were some areas of this novel that dragged a bit, e.g. the return trip to New York. However, I felt that not only did this side 'trip' add information regarding the entire series, but also allowed me more time to anticipate and appreciate the final sections of this thrilling 5th installment.Conclusion:Stephen King at his best; high fantasy that is intriguing, page turning and extremely well done.Ray Nicholson"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The whole series is a must read but this book, in particular, is outstanding and an universe in its own.

I've finally the strength, nearly 10 years later, to pick it up again as an adult. Still, my feelings toward this particular book in the series has not wavered much.Book 5 of the 7 book series places our heroes, our ka-tet, just outside of a location called Calla Bryn Sturgis. It is a town that is plagued by what the folken call Wolves. Every generation or so, they come on their grey horses out of the ominous, Mordoresque, Thunderclap to take away children (one out of every pair of twins, which is the norm in the Calla). They steal them away and any opposition is laid flat by technology unknown to the simple farmers. The children are, eventually, sent back what they call \\"roont\\". In effect, they are brainless, driveling, giants that live short lives and are forever unconnected with their previous selves. Once more the Wolves threaten to come and take the children away. The only difference is that there are gunslingers on the horizon, and they will evoke the Line of Eld to stand and fight for them.That is our opening. That is the story. The gunslingers must pause in their quest for the Dark Tower, in effect it takes a back seat, while they help the folken of the Calla. Truly, the book focuses more on the connections between what the reader would call \\"my world\\", the world of Kansas, New York, and Charlie the Choo-Choo, with what the reader would call \\"their world\\", the world of the Callas, of Thunderclap, of the Beams. A main character, though for how long is anyone's guess, is introduce to us as Father Callahan, more affectionately known as Don, who is from Maine but has been transplanted to the Calla where he has set up his church and converted most of the town to the Man-Jesus. Although the book is a kind of refreshing change of pace, it also seems too detached from its fellows. As I've said, the quest for the Tower takes a back seat. Even the protection of the rose in the vacant lot in New York seems unimportant at times.Because of this hiccup in the quest, and several \\"fall back\\" coincidences (though it could be argued that's what the book is all about), like a new persona emerging in Susannah, and the ideas on how to corral the Wolves to their death is all too convenient and yet displaced all at once. The book is more like a speed bump, an irritating one at that since it's a rather drab read, rather than part of the whole. Therefore, it loses its appeal, at least for me.Regardless, the book is still a great kind of stand-alone entity that may not quite fit into the whole with the exception that Jake's manhood is tested to the extreme and he must surpass the tasks awaiting him. Although there is limited character development and the Tower takes a time-out in the corner, the story itself truly defines what gunslingers used to be to the world. They were the \\"calvary\\" the ones that would save, the White, the good men who would stand against the Black. It defines the Line of Eld more clearly, and starts to introduce the concept of nineteen and ninety nine to the reader. These numbers, their significance, and their ultimate meaning are earth shattering in the upcoming books.King, as usual, dares to be different, dares to explore, and continues to push the envelope of storytelling as much as he possibly can."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I bought this for my son for Christmas after buying the first 4 for his birthday.

In The Dark Tower V, Roland and his \\"ka-tet\\" (journeyers joined by fate) need to help the Calla-folken defeat the evil Wolves of the Thunderclap and restore peace to Calla Bryn Sturgis. Roland and his ka-tet must first convince the Calla to their side. The Calla is faced with a monumental question: To live in fear and survive or try to break free and maybe perish in the effort? I loved this book because of its captivating and original plot, along with its rich plot and humor. I recommend Wolves of the Calla to anyone who likes a good fantasy or science fiction story. I also recommend this book to someone who wants to read an imaginative and original epic. Anyone who wants to read Wolves of the Calla should first read the other books in the series: The Gunslinger (1), The Drawing of the Three (2), The Waste Lands (3), and Wizard and Glass (4). Read the books in the Dark Tower series, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Fans of The Seven Samurai (and its Westernized version The Magnificent Seven) will immediately recognize the opening situation of this book: a small farming village that is periodically raided, with its residents trying to figure out what to do about it that won't just result in their entire town being demolished. The raiders in this case are 'Wolves' who take one of each pair of twins born in the town (of which there are an inordinate number, nearly all births), but unlike most raiders, they return their booty at a later time - but by then the twin has been brain damaged (or 'roont') and have various physiological changes that turn them into short lived giants. The farmers' solution: hire a group of gunslingers (right out of the movie!). And of course the 'gunslingers' they get are none other than Roland, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake.But why should Roland interrupt his quest for the Dark Tower to help these people? In answering this, King brings into play something that has not been greatly obvious (though certainly present) in the prior books, the standard of ethics ingrained within Roland, part of his original world, of not just chivalry and nobles-oblige, but a groping for an absolute standard of right and wrong. This thematic line actually runs through just about all of King's books, but within this book I think it comes into clear focus, and must be the underlying lynch-pin of the Tower itself. Also apparent is the new focus King has brought to this work. In the earlier four books, there was a tendency to wander, to bring in items that seemed to have little relevance to over-arching story line. Here, there is a taut plot line, and an explicit explanation for the hows, whys, and makeup of this fantasy universe, a universe that can now be seen as encompassing all worlds, both \`real' and fictional. In this, he seems to be following in the footsteps of Robert Heinlein's last few works (and Heinlein is directly referenced a couple of times in this work), in which Heinlein effectively tied all of his works together in a multi-verse of alternate time lines and author-created worlds.Jake and Eddie both come in for some strong character development here, something I felt had been somewhat lacking in books III and IV, and Roland himself exhibits some characteristics that are new but quite fitting. Father Callahan (from Salem's Lot) is introduced as a major player, and his story forms an important sub-plot to this work, though I did feel as if this story was overly drawn out, and could have used a little judicious pruning. Susannah becomes the foreshadow of the next book, as once more she seems to develop multiple personalities, and may be pregnant with the Red King's child.There is pathos, humor, satire, sacrifice, and soul-searching abounding here. Perhaps a little on the wordy side, but as another step towards the Dark Tower, this book achieves its goals well. For anyone who has read the prior books and become hooked by Roland's world, I think this book will satisfy.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Okay--first things first, let's all admit to ourselves that nothing that I write here is going to have any implication whatsoever on your purchase of this book. If you've reached the point in your life where you are considering buying the fifth book in the Dark Tower series, you may as well just give up now and buy it. You don't get to find out how the story ends without reading the last three books that you've been waiting for, and this book, to be sure, is a book in that series. You and I both know you'll buy it, so just do.But, for the rare prospective buyer who may not have all of the preceding books, or for the odd critic who is looking for something to argue with (as some people do with these things), I'll give my impressions.To start, this book marks the beginning of a bit of a departure from the standard over the past four titles in the series. Like it or not, each one of those books felt and sounded different, mostly because there were years of time between each one's release. This book, and the two that come after, all sound very much the same, which is to say that they sound very different from the first four. Particularly irksome is the sudden explosion of idiom and slang that starts in this volume (hitherto unobserved in any of the previous books), penetrating the story even to the point that the out-of-character descriptive monologue gets peppered with it. I don't MIND the dialect, but it does wreck some of the verisimilitude of the story to this point.Of somewhat greater concern is the fact that this book spends a lot of time to not get much of anywhere. True--roughly one month of calendar time passes in the story world in the course of this novel. But the vast majority of that time is spent sitting around, doing and thinking about abstract things and NOT shooting stuff, which is what made the third book in the series as gripping and entertaining as it was. New characters are harder to find (particularly since King has gotten into the habit of recycling his old characters--those who haven't read 'Salem's Lot might want to give it a go first) and action of any appreciable sort is played down. This continues a trend started in Wizard and Glass, and unfortunately one that I would rather not have seen go on.All the same, the story is tolerable. Things are still happening, though not at a pace that you would expect them to given the fact that only twelve hundred pages remain in the entire series at the end of the novel. The character development is decently done, and although I didn't find the ending nearly as shocking as some other reviewers have (come now, folks--this isn't going to become The Usual Suspects of the literary world), there was a tolerable twist near the end to keep things interesting.Not the high point of the series by any means, but good enough for readers who are already invested, and a marginal recommendation to new ones (it's a good step up from The Wheel of Time, if you have to pick a series to start--and this one is finished)."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I thought this book was very good. A good suspenseful tale Along the Path of the Beam and well worth the wait. If I would've had reason to believe I would have to wait another 10-15 years before the next one, then I guess I would've wanted a story that came across as a little more important, as opposed to feeling like this was just a sidebar (despite all the things we discovered.) But since all the other books are done, it gave me the luxury of being able to enjoy this book on it's own merits without feeling frustrated about the series as a whole. Good Read! The only thing I didn't like was the incredibly, disappointingly BAD illustrations from the legendary Bernie Wrightson. What in the world happened, Bernie?! I agreed with another reviewer who said it was like he never even SAW a black woman before. Yikes!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is excellent, vintage King. Not quite as good as Volume IV in the series (although very similar in feel), but still a great read. The main story is that of the ka-tet's intervention to save a town from a bunch of marauding who-knows-whats that come every 23 years to steal one of each pair of twins and then return them later horribly afflicted. This was OK, but I found it not as interesting as the back story. Pere Callahan is clearly identified early on as the Father Callahan from King's Salem's Lot. What's up with that? How can there be a fictional character in the \\"real\\" world of Roland et al? This leads to more questions about the nature of Roland's world and its relation to that of the rose, and to our own and to the worlds of many of King's previous novels to which allusions are sprinkled throught the text. All this leads up to a rather suprising cliff-hanger ending which has upset some readers and reviewers, but which I thought was great. I can't wait for the next volume to come out."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"You'd better put this one in the bathroom or you'll never get any work done..... however you will find that you're actually paying more daily visits to the john than normal. Seriously, it sucks you in with typical King expertise and then holds you there through the bloody climax. My only regret is that the \\"Wolves\\" weren't human. I felt that for all the suffering they had brought about, the vengence would've been sweeter if they had been. There's always something special about a gunslinger in a showdown against really wicked, \\"deserve to die\\" bad guys, and here you have Roland and his Ka-Tet in just that sort of situation but in this case the \\"deaths\\" aren't the normal kind...... In all fairness to Roland and the others....the \\"Wolves\\"....all 61 of them....were pretty intimidating."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla is a book that has a lot of the usual Stephen King intensity, but it also has a little too much side tracking. It's a fun book; i read it in two days; still, it's a step behind the first three Dark Tower stories--not as slow and deliberate as Wizard and Glass, which fortunately did have its moments of brilliance--yet it does find invention, passion, and voice in a tale that is worthy of Roland and his gang.The scenes involving the uninteresting and childish Calla folk seemed lengthy and dry, often reading like a bland screen play, but King has not lost it--I did give this book 4 stars, after all--but King has set a bench mark for himself that, yes, even he has difficulty reaching. The book hits its peak with Father Callahan and his telling our ka-tet the story of 'salem's lot. It also rides high during the ka-tet's journeys in, yes, that's right, New York. King writes here with the type of passion and flare we rarely see in popular fiction--when we do see it, it is usually from the pen of the King himself--proving that his word prosessor still has some gas in it, as long as he puts the appropriate effort into it."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is definitely one of the best books in the Dark Tower series and one of Stephen King's best. Those reviewers who gave this book less than four stars must not have read this book and hate Stephen King. As for those who are upset with King for referring to himself in the story, calm yourselves. This is not the first time he has done this and I don't think you should condemn the man until you see how it turns out in the last two novels in the series. Until then, just calm down and don't be so quick to call for a lynch mob."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Unlike the original which is tense, short and filled with mystery and the promise of great things to come, &quot;Wolves&quot; is long, wandering, and offers little dramatic tension. Though it doesn't really advance the story much I found myself enjoying it anyway beause Roland and MidWorld are cool. The priest is a good characters aswell and there are a few nice bits that are reminisant of Steve's short stories. Definitly don't blow $5o on this, get it from the library."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I've been a big fan of King's &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series from the beginning. I've anxiously awaited each installment, and I always look forward to satiating my curiousity about the details of Roland's world.The first book is actually my favorite, since it presented the reader with a new and unknown world in which he/she felt that anything could literally happen. I wanted to find out everything I could. The second book seemed a bit of a delay tactic, although it did do some important foreshadowing, while the third was an exciting adventure filled with enough answers to keep the reader satisfied without giving too much away. The fourth book also seemed a bit like a filler, but it was a nice look back into the past and a chance to see yet another exciting world, and to gain some insights into the primary character.Unfortunately, this newest installment also seems like a delay, and it comes on the heels of another (better-told) one. There have been many times in the series when I felt that the events we were witnessing were the ones better skipped over, and the events skipped over would have been the more interesting to witness. That is how this entire book feels. Calla Bryn Sturgis was one of the less interesting locales in Roland and Co.'s adventures (with a few notable exceptions like Andy the Messenger Robot), and I kept hoping that the book would only begin there and then move on past it. I wanted to know about the strange things in Thunderclap (and beyond), or to be passed a few answers to keep me on the hook. The whole encounter with the people of the Calla could have easily been a brief flashback moment in a better book, covered in less than a chapter, without losing much at all. While I realize that there will doubtless be some of this in the next installment, King himself has decided on only two more books (of which the second I expect to be fully taken up with the Dark Tower itself), which doesn't seem nearly enough time to spend in the wilder areas at this rate.I also found it a little disappointing that so much time is consumed with New York and the rose. Of course, I can't be sure about what King is building up to, but I first read and continue to read the Dark Tower books out of curiosity about Roland's world, not 1970s New York. Unfortunately, the way this book ends, you can expect at least as much, if not more, of the sixth book to be set in Susannah, Eddie, and Jake's world.I realize that most of these critiques boil down to &quot;not enough happened&quot;- a sentiment with which others are welcome to disagree. But this has been and continues to be a series I read for adventure, excitement, and plot twists; not to expand my mind or contemplate. I can't consider the writing and presentation to be &quot;art&quot;- it's just entertainment, and I expect more from my entertainment."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla is a great book and an excellent addition to the Dark Tower series. Any fan of these books already knows about them, has read them, and formed their own opinions.People new to the series : read the first four books and even some of King's other works (the ones in bold listed in the front of DT5)As far as some of the problems other readers had with this installment, I think they missed the point in many ways. There are two stories in DT5 - the side quest, and the advancement to the Tower. The plight of Calla Bryn Sturgis is somewhat peripheral. The protection of the Rose in New York/introducing Father Callahan/Susannah's conflicts are the advancement portion in the quest for the Tower. If you look at it as two interwoven parts, the story is very satisfying.WARNING - SPOILERSAnd now for the big complaint of the other reviewers : pop culture and self-references. Light Sabers, Dr. Doom, Salem's Lot, Harry Potter, and even Stephen King himself are a part of this story. I see why people have a problem with these things being a part of the Dark Tower series. But in the context of the Tower as the axis of the universe, the hub of all existence and an infinite number of other worlds, the inclusion of such things are not out of place. Since The Gunslinger, King has said Roland's world shares many similarities with our own. People didn't seem to mind that Hey Jude by the Beatles was mentioned in DK1. Even Jesus has made the jump to Mid-world. Why is it so hard to accept that many things from our world exist in Roland's? And by King alluding to himself as the author of Salem's Lot, he implies that our earth is in fact a part of the Dark Tower universe. As long as he doesn't pull a Stan Lee and inject himself as an actual character into the Ka-Tet of 19, the reference was fine. One of the main underlying themes of these books has been, &quot;...there are other worlds than these.&quot; People who take issue with the above might want to be a little more open minded toward what King is doing.As someone who has been reading The Dark Tower saga since 1993, I have to say I really am pleased with the fifth installment and the direction its taking. I look forward to Song of Susannah, and The Dark Tower along with the Concordance Vol. II"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The pacing of the fifth Dark Tower is by no means slow-- it's AGONIZINGLY slow. And yet The Wolves of Callah still manages to compell and entertain.Looky here now, I'm all for three-dimensional characters, rich backstory and leisurely tale-telling (ala Wizard &amp; Glass), but Wolves of the Calla (again) finds King wallowing in too much of this excess. Yep, it's another one of those rousing stories put on hold for hundreds of pages in the name of &quot;poetic license&quot;; think every book after--and including--&quot;Bag of Bones&quot; and you'll know what I mean. But hey, that's Stephen King's prerogative and that's what most long-time Constant Readers have come to accept/expect.&quot;What the hell? Poetic license?&quot; you say? Ah. I'm alluding primarily to the Father Callahan backstory, which, while interesting and enlightening at times, eats up a good seventh of the story and really does little to advance the plot that we purchased the book for-- the continued journey to the Tower. So although Callahan is poised to become an integral part of Roland's quest, and though the Calla is a pivotal stop along the way of the quest, both facets of the story come off as frustrating impediments to the questing itself. But then again, this one's more of a metaphysical journey through dissappearing-reappearing doorways than actual walking.In other words the book kinda drags. At first it's a pleasant drag: we get a chance to slowly reacquaint ourselves with the craggy Gunslinger and his likeable posse of misfits; then we get to tour the troubled town of Callah and meet all its quirky residents; then we get the cool Salem's Lot tie-in. And then? Well, then you start to realize, around the 150 page mark, that King has little intention of delivering action or adventure this time around. Here, it's all about character-development and craft, and while King has always been a master of writing brilliantly demonic/sardonic characters (Flagg, Leland Gaunt, Pennywise the Clown, etc.), let's be frank: character development is better delivered through action rather than talk--and boy does King subject us to chatter over the course of this 700 pager.Fortunately enticing plot developments are sprinkled throughout--some so intruiging that they'll undoubtedly keep me (and thousands of others) reading until page 1,919 of the seventh and final entry. What's Mia's agenda? Who or what is the mysterous force enabling it? How does Flagg/Walter fit in? When will Traveling &quot;Talisman&quot; Jack show up? How will King make me give a s*** about boring old fart-breaker Ted Brautigan and his role? Like I said before, it's extremely compelling, nerdy stuff. But for all the dangling carrots, I sometimes wish King would hire a new editor and hurry things up. I want to enjoy the quest for the Dark Tower; not keep wondering: &quot;Are we almost there yet?&quot;"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"If you're a freak like me, you'd probably read the prologue to Wolves of Calla a two years ago when it popped up on the old Stephen King website. And, if you're like me, it drove you completely insane.I'm a pretty hardcore King fan, having read all his books, most more than once. My first impression of this recent addition to the Dark Tower series is that falls a wee bit short in comparison to the rest of the books... This is just me, but I really liked the original stories and concepts. The addition of the new \\"nineteen\\" theme, as well as obvious references to himself and Bachman worry me slightly. Who am I to say where he's going with this; I'm just worried because he gives himself a lot of room to play the \\"and then they woke up\\" card. I should have more faith, eh?In all, this book didn't pull me the way the others did, perhaps I need to let it settle. In comparison to the other books, it is not as sharp as the second, or poetic as the first, or as crazily detailed as the fourth (but the language and town descriptions fall along the same lines). It has a lot of similarities to the third book, and we do see the rose once more, but I feel that in going back to that corner the rose has lost a little of its mystery.One last note, althought Wrightson did excellent work in The Stand and Night of the Werewolf, I thought his paintings were a little blah. Definitely not Whelan. Think glaringly obvious central image ala Wastelands, but sloppier and less riveting (who doesn't like Soared on Leathery Wings?). Sadly, Roland looked like a dorkface and I won't go in detail about Oy the wiener dog.So yah, this is an ok book. But for one hardcore Tower fan, its not the best."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"In my opinion, I think this book was probably the worst one since the first book. There was a bit too much buildup to the Wolves coming. And when they came, it was a bit anti-climatic, being too short and seemingly a bit too easy for me. I also figured out what the Wolves were way before the ending. Callahan coming in was brilliant, since I myself have always wondered where the heck he went at the end of \\"Salem's Lot.\\" But there was way too much palavering, too much of Callahan's back story.The good parts? The rest of the ka-tet becoming true gunslingers, especially Jake. Stories of the Calla residents and the traveling were also good.I will definitely will be continuing on the series, but hopefully the rest wouldn't be so unnecessarily long."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Roland Deschain and his ka-tet are traveling through the dense forests of Mid-World. Their quest for the Dark Tower is nearing completion, when they arrive at Calla, a village traumatized by the kidnapping of their children by the Wolves of Thunderclap. When the villagers learn that Roland and his friends are visiting, some of them hope that these gunslingers will finally bring salvation. But not everyone is convinced that getting help from foreigners is such a good idea, so Roland has to prepare his best \`dance' to try and convince everyone of his good intentions. Indeed, it is important that the people of Calla get help, because that seems to be the only way the secret of Father Callahan will get released. A secret that might help the ka-tet reach their ultimate goal: The Dark Tower.This long-awaited fifth novel of the Dark Tower saga has turned out to be a massive 714-pages counting episode. Based upon the latest produce of Stephen King, that would normally mean a rather flimsy storyline packed with some page filling nonsense. But I am happy to say that Wolves of Calla is an nice exception to the rule. Wolves is so packed with storylines, that you never get bored. Although many ongoing plotlines get developed further, almost none of them get concluded. This can only mean one thing: Stephen King is preparing for the grand finale! If King can keep up this pace in the next two episodes, I trust that the finale will be unforgettable.One of the many enjoyable things about this series is the intention of King to make links to his earlier novels. For a King-fan this can only mean more enjoyment. Wolves of Calla has until now been the best example of this. Introducing Father Callahan, the priest that first appeared in Stephen King's Salem's Lot, has been an excellent addition to the series. Callahan does not just perform a cameo, but, without revealing too much, gets a very important role to fulfill. It also sheds another light on the original Salem's Lot story. So be warned: After finishing Wolves you will feel the urge to (re)read Salem's Lot, so make sure you have a copy in your library."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen King's decision to close out the Dark Tower series after his near-death experience is one that will be forever debated by fans of the series. Taking his time before publishing each of the other 4 books in the planned 7 book series, King rushed out these last 3 books in an effort to complete an opus he felt COMPELLED to finish. While this sounds good on paper, the resulting products leave a lot to be desired. After starting off the first 3 books with absolutely riveting writing and great storytelling, the 4th book (Wizard & Glass) did not grab the reader like the previous 3, but it still had THAT Dark Tower feeling to it.The same does NOT hold true for the final works of the series.Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla is an entertaining story, but it's one that doesn't feel like it's part of the DK run of books. Hard to explain, it just feels like it should be a book of its own, and the same can be said for the next 2 links in the chain as well. Except for 1 MAJOR decision that Stephen King makes in these last 3 books (readers will know exactly what I am talking about when they read this) I cannot blame him for the less than stellar work. I understand how scary and life-altering his car accident must have been, but the beauty of these books is that King only wrote the next chapter in his opus when he felt that the next part of the story had come to him. By forcing the matter, King writes subpar extensions, looking to finish what he started just for the sake of finishing what he started. Some would say that King was just trying to do this for financial gain, but I don't believe this is true. The author has more money than he knows what to do with, and he stated long ago that he intended this to be 7 parts nearly 20 years ago.If you are a Dark Tower fan (you probably wouldn't be reading this unless you had read the previous 4 books), you should read Dark Tower V to continue on with the adventures of Roland and his Ka-Tet, but I warn you not to get your hopes up. While the book isn't necessarily BAD, it's nowhere near as good as the first 3 parts in the DK series, and it just doesn't fit in the puzzle upon further reflection of the final work. All in all, good, but disappointing.**** MILDLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I am compelled to rebut the inaccurate description of George Guidall's performance in the audio version of the epic novel! Despite the Amazon editor's opinion, I believe that Guidall brings not just our protagonists, not just our beloved Calla, but all of End World out of 2-dimensional fantasy and into fantastic reality. I was entranced by his dynamic narrative and character portrayals. Until now, I had only READ the books of the Dark Tower Series. Then, somewhere between 'Wizard' and 'Wolves', I grew up, became very busy, and depend almost entirely on audio books to keep me company while driving ... and I was fixed to my tape player the whole story through! Guidall's voice, accents, and credible acting brought this story to life in ways that flat pages could not have done, even with a bright imagination! The story itself, SUPERB telling by King, was better off because of Guidall, \\"do ya\\", and tell me you don't agree, I beg! :) I have Dark Tower VI geared up and ready to go, and seeing that Guidall is again the reader, I can't wait to get started. Susanna's song will be sweeter for it, \\"yer bugger!\\" Say thankee!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"On the one hand, the tale is a good one, as King is usually a good weaver of tales.On the other hand, somewhere between playing with the downfall of American pop-culture, characters from other novels, and a plot spanning multiple dimensions, he ended up creating a megalith which was just a wee bit too long.Also, a big huge thumbs down to Amazon for posting an editorial review by AudioFile which included a monster spoiler for one of the bigger mysteries in the plot."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"As Stephen King has told his constant readers, he sees the Dark Tower series as his life's work. Fans are so happy that he went back to writing this series.Wolves of the Calla takes place at the borderlands between Midworld, where we first met Roland the Gunslinger, and Endworld, where the Dark Tower lies, and where Roland's quest will take him. We spend most of the book in these borderlands with sidetrips to New York and elsewhere in America.We learn at the beginning of the book that the \\"wolves\\" are coming to a small town on that border and will take approximately half of the children away where they will be \\"roont,\\" losing their minds and wrecking their bodies. The farmers and townsmen have endured this for generations because the wolves have exotic weapons and may be supernatural. However, this time some of the townspeople are ready to stand up to the wolves.Into this fight comes Roland and his ka-tet, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake of New York. It becomes clear that they will have to take on this side-quest of saving the children of the town from the wolves, but they are outnumbered, and it is unclear how much help the townspeople will be.Complicating matters is that something seems seriously wrong with Susannah, that a rose in New York that appears to have a connection to the Dark Tower is imperiled and other matters.We also meet Father Callahan from 'Salem's Lot again. And if you haven't read Salem's Lot but are reading the Dark Tower series, I would suggest reading it before turning to this book. In some of King's best writing, we learn the tragic story of what happened to Father Callahan after he left that cursed town.I highly recommend this book. King draws us back in to Roland's world with a vengeance."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I never would have believed it, but King has finally done it -- he has written a book that is almost impossible to get through. King is usually the most readable of writers; he's a magnificent storyteller and he has a way with prose that makes his sentences zip along. But this far into The Dark Tower series, he's bogged down into a morass that makes reading this book seem like slogging through quicksand with jackboots on.King intends The Dark Tower to be a story of the quest for the nexus of all space and time, but in &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; he's gotten so hopelessly entangled in parallel worlds, we wonder where the heck he is going and if he ever intends to get there. We're in Calla Bryn Sturgis in some world beyond this one, who knows where; each birth in this community seems to bring forth twins, and every decade or so a posse of evil wolves sweep down on the hapless hamlet and carry off one of every set of twins between toddlerdom and teendom; the abductees come back &quot;roont&quot;, semi-zombies doomed to a short, sad life. Into this community come Roland and his ka-tet, to help the villagers learn to stand up for themselves and defeat this plague. Okay, it's a pretty good plot. But King has to get sidetracked here, there and everywhere -- Susannah is pregnant with something too horrible to contemplate, Father Callahan emerges from his flight from 'Salem's Lot with an interminable tale of woe which takes up a good third of the book, and on and on it goes until we're left wondering where King is going with all this, or if he's just spinning his wheels going nowhere.If King had only kept it simple, it would have been a much better book, but he's given in to his fatal penchant for over-writing, which causes him to inject a lot of hot air while adding nothing of substance. It's not that he can't do it right when he sets his mind to it -- the first volume in the series, &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;, was an excellent, tightly written novel that carried us along non-stop from beginning to end, with no unnecessary detours along the way. &quot;Wolves&quot; meanders in and out and roundabout, until we just want to get the whole thing over with. I always wondered what happened to Father Callahan after his flight from 'Salem's Lot (one of King's best books), but this was not the place to find out. And in what is surely the tackiest gambit this reviewer has ever come across, King has to inject his own self into the book near the end. For what purpose, since it adds absolutely nothing to the story?King says the sixth book in the series will be released in June, and the seventh and final volume near the end of this year. One can only hope that he will get back on track, before he gets so lost in one of his umpteen parallel worlds that he never manages to find his way back home, let alone find the Dark Tower."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"What began as a series I would have expected to be studied in literature classes some fifty years from now and would have ranked as finer than the Lord of the Rings series has become the pop fodder that Stephen King naysayers have falsely accused him of for years. Is it better to burn out or fade away? In Stephen King's case, I suspect die-hard fans would have preferred the series left uncompleted, leaving their imaginations to follow the logical path this series had begun with book IV.No longer. Not only has Stephen King revised his premise for the book from this point on, he has reissued the first four to better fit with his new ending. When you have to rewrite the first 4 books to fit with the final three, you've failed as a writer to produce a viable series.Further evidence that SK is &quot;phoning-it-in&quot; are the ridiculous references to fad pop culture, including the Harry Potter reference that runs through the whole book and serves only to draw the reader out of Mid-World and back into disappointing reality. When the book states plainly at the end that, yes, they are talking about Quidditch, the realization turns your stomach. I'm already reading the Harry Potter books to my son, thank you very much, and they're much better than this.It's obvious from page 3 that Stephen King wanted to be done with the series, had lost his love for it, and lumped out three quick books all at once to stop the nagging fan letters and make a good chunk of change. His greatest villan for decades, Flagg, is now a ruined puppet of what must have been everyone's favoite King character to have survived this long. Having come 5 books and 10 years with the series, I can't imagine not reading the final two.Then again, I was so much more satisfied with the series before."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"In Wolves of the Calla, Roland and co. put their Tower quest on hold to assist a small farming town in their final stand against an army of humanoid \\"wolves\\". It seemed like a good part of the book was flashbacks, and not much really seemed to happen at all until the last two chapters. It retains the classic King suspense, and those thirsty for more details about Roland Deschain's world will be satisfied, but \\"Wolves\\" lacks the rhythm and constant tension that made \\"Wizard and Glass\\" so great."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I'm reading these books mostly on momentum at this point. My coworker says that this one is one of his favorites in the series, but honestly after book three I've been mostly \\"meh\\" on every single one. This book needed to be about 1/2 the overall length to make the point and tell the story. There just isn't much gained in the rest. It's sort of indulgent. And the constant \\"convenient coincidences\\" is getting really old and out of hand.It's hard to say \\"don't read it\\", because you sort of want to know where all this goes... but meh... it's really kinda not worth it."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I'm 40 percent into it and so far its pretty good.

My word, we are on the fifth LONG novel and we don't even know the who/what/why about the evil forces Roland and his ka tet are up against, just subtle suggestion and inference. Unfortunately for Wolves of the Calla, exactly zero of the pressing questions are answered, but a fistful of other mysteries (some just downright corny) are presented.As far as the main plot, it is good, I can't deny that, albeit too long. To be honest it initally sounded mediocre, but I found myself pleasantly surprised to enjoy it and feel involved. What does bother me is the ridiculously huge backstory of Father Callahan, taking up chapter after chapter, which is the sad combination of boring and absurd. Harmless \\"type 3\\" vampires with blue smoke around them? Seemingly endless (and BORING) travels across country and to homeless shelters? If someone told me how much time I would have been spending \\"in\\" homeless shelters with this book I wouldn't have believed them. With so many fundamental questions about the series, why did King feel the need to ignore them and go into painstaking detail into Father Callahan's ultimately sleep inducing past? As if suddenly thrusting a character from another King novel out of the blue onto the reader wasn't enough.From the reviews I have read, not much seems to be answered in the next installment, just more hum drum character studies. Well, I will see for myself when I read it, but at this point I am beginning to accept that fact much of Mid World and the baronies will remain a question mark. I would be disappointed if I took the time to read this magnum opus of a series and the dominate feeling it left me with is \\"unsatisfied\\". Leave the character studies to Henry James and divulge a bit of this world you created Mr. King, it is what sucked us into these books in the first place."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I have to say, my biggest complaint about this book is that the cover art I had for the first 4 books doesn't exist for the last 3 : Stupid changing of publishers!!)But really? Let's get down to my thoughts!How can I even begin to put my thoughts in print? This books (in my opinion) showed what a genius King really is. No plot left unanswered, no matter how small! (And his use of pop culture? I about died of laughter when Harry Potter showed up!! And no, I'm not kidding.)This has been my FAVORITE of the series so far - I finally felt like I really got to know Susannah in this one, and until now I didn't really care for her. I know a lot of people complained that he brought back her Schizophrenia for this book, but to me it only makes sense and I think it adds to her personality. I loved that Eddie and Jake also played bigger roles. (I guess I was just a bit tired of nothing but Roland after Wizard and Glass!)I loved the story surrounding the Wolves, I loved the people of Calla Bryn Sturgis and I loved all the different ways that pop culture ties in with Roland's world.I suppose all I can really say is that you should go read this series. I didn't LOVE the first four books, in fact? As I read them, it was slow and difficult at times. But as I finished each one, I looked back at it and liked it. But this one, I loved every page.

It was the characters taking a breather from the walking they had been doing constantly since the first book and actually staying in one place for more than a single night. They style shifts slightly, while retaining some of the western feel it also starts edging toward the modern. There are references to places that we are familiar with and songs we all have heard. It connects the world of the gunslinger to our own and makes you wonder if they are as separated as it would seem at a glance.Wolves of the Calla shows what the heritage of the Gunslingers was about, helping the common folk. It's where we learn more about what traditions and customs went into making Roland who and what he is, while setting up the story to come in the following books.Overall it's a wonderful book, Second only to \\"The Gunslinger.\\" While I wouldn't recommend starting the series here, it is the one I have reread the most."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The writing is good but it just drags out a lot and most of the story is just the characters telling stories, there is probably about 200+ pages where Father Callahan tells his story about what happened after 'Salem's Lot. The majority of this book is comprised of back-story and which can be interesting and all but it just goes on and on. What I liked so much about the first three was learning more and more about the world the group is in but in this story I felt there wasn't that much added to that aspect of the story."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book was\\"really...really...really.........really...really......good\\"-H. SimpsonFantastic read, If you enjoy LOTR you should check into these books. You needn't be a SK fan to enjoy."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I'm a little surprised at some of the negative reviews here... Not the fact solely that they're negative, but the reasons behind them are silly...First of all, I had a few problems with the book. I agree that the Callahan flashback was way too long and that the final clash with the wolves was way too short. I kept expecting that surprise attack from the river, or something - they just shot them and then it was over... Alot of us could have written that. I was looking for more of a Wizard's Glass type ending where, when you stop reading to get a glass of water you can't drink it because you hand is shaking so much and your heart is beating so fast..Now - why is everyone so ticked off about the self-insertion bit at the end? Isn't that kind of cool? I personally was wondering if Calvin Tower had a couple 1st edition King's stashed in that warehouse. It's not self-serving, What King does is entertainment, allow yourselves to be entertained for once, relax and enjoy the book - why literally look for things to bag on?I've also read reviews that indicate the reader's malice toward the unresolved storylines such as Susannah's pregnancy, etc.... Um, isn't this a series? There are TWO more books left. I'm sure they won't be thin pamphlets either. Again, relax, enjoy the books and let a little of the suspense grow - only eight more months guys, and your thirsts will be satisfied.I would reccommend this book wholeheartedly for the DT fan who loves the story for what it is. If you're a nitpicking, type A, stick-in-the-rear, read something else.conversej799@hotmail"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book was excellent. I have read all of Stephen King's book and not disappointed with the latest Dark Tower book. I can't wait for the next tale to come out....I will order it as soon as it becomes available. Anyone who has been a fan of Roland will agree that this book was just as superb (if not more so) than the previous 4. 10 stars (if the scale went that high)"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Right up front I have to say that I would read a shopping list written by Stephen King. I have yet to read something by him that I didn't like, although there have been some that I liked more than others. That being said, I found Wolves of the Calla extreming satisfying. One reason is that it tied the storyline in with many other King stories. Secondly, we find out that he'll be finishing the series shortly. Who would have thought it possible.Anyway, buy the book, read the book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I have read all of Stephen King's other books, including the earlier volumes of the Dark Tower series. As much as I like King, the Dark Tower series -- particularly the last two -- could use some serious editing. The Wolves of Calla has three plot lines going. Of these one -- the confrontation with the wolves of the title -- is resolved in this long book. The other two are left hanging in midair at the conclusion. This is frustrating, even though King has stated he has written the remaining two books in the series in rough draft, and they are to be released in 2004.It's interesting to contrast this book with King's excellent &quot;On Writing.&quot; One would have to conclude that Wolves of Calla should be much shorter. Far too much of the story is dragged out at extreme length; in &quot;On Writing,&quot; King advised that a second draft should always be 10% shorter than the first draft. If he followed this rule, then I would hate to see the first draft of Wolves of Calla. Indeed, the entire series has been written at great length.It would be one thing if the book ended with a well-written confrontation with the Wolves. However, that confrontation is disposed of in a few pages, despite the hundreds of pages leading up to it. King really doesn't seem interested in it. At one point, Roland says that the shooting will be over in 5 minutes, and that seems accurate. King's real interest here seems to be setting up plots for the upcoming two books.However, I am not saying that this book is a waste of time. Anyone interested in the series will have to read it. And there are sections that are well-written and engage the reader. I never had much of a desire to put the book down. When I did finish it, however, I did not take much from the book. And economy has never been one of King's virtues. He seems to enjoy cramming his novels with as many incidents as possible, even if they stray from the main plot line. I have often found these tangents, while stucturally awkward, one of the pleasures of reading King. Sometimes they work here, sometimes they don't.Certainly King is stretching himself in the Dark Tower series. If this were the only thing he had ever written, I would expect he would have had difficulty in getting it published. This is not a criticism of the series; much of the problem would have been his original mixture of Western and Fantasy elements in the same book. Most publishers want fiction to fit neatly into genres, and King refuses to do that.Anyhow, while this book is an improvement over its predecessor in the series, it hardly ranks with King's best. It's worth a read, if only to keep up with the series -- which will be an amazing length when completed. Let's hope he returns to form for volumes VI and VII."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is the best book of King's yet. This book is an engaging page-turner because King knows how to create a pace. He dices things up with references to &quot;real life&quot; people from the past and present, allusions to other books, popular music, and characters from other King stories. Additionally, he is able to focus on many genres (the Western, Fantasy, Horror, Mystery) because his characters jump from time period to time period and world to world. Thus, the Dark Tower series is almost beyond categorizing. King simply tells a great story with much suspense and, surprisingly, lots of humor too. His allusion to J.K Rowling and to himself at the end struck me and family (who argued over who could read the book first) as hilarious. Just a great read. I can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"After reading several spoiler laden reviews here commenting on the inclusion of a new character near the end, I thought it may be worthwhile to pass the following along.Early in the DT series, I noticed quite a few parallels between the Dark Tower and The NeverEnding Story by Michael Ende. these parrelles include the search for a Tower (an Ivory Tower in Neverending story). Without giving anything away from either story, I heartily recommend NeverEnding Story (the book, not the movie!) to any Dark Tower fan. It's a great story and as the Dark Tower has continued to unfold, the parallels have only grown stronger.As for the Dark Tower, It's great to see this series continue and I for one will continue to follow the path of the beam..."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves gets 3 stars from me because of how much I enjoyed it while reading. As someone who read the first three books eleven years ago at the age of ten, to be immersed in Roland's world again was a joy.However, not only is the book anticlimatic, but the last 10 pages turn everything before it on its head. Including the 4 previous books. WotC is seriously out of synch with the rest of the series. At times tonight after finishing the book I have wondered if it should have been ended after Wizard and Glass. Or in other words been left open to the imagination.I really wish that King would have written a fuller, more richer book 5 rather than finishing the last three in one swoop. Of course I haven't read the last two, but it's rather apparent that the last three are really the same book. Just as there are alternate yet similar world's in the Dark Tower, I feel that the end of the series resides in an alternate realm then the first 4 books. And I'm honestly disapointed.I don't know if Amazon allows this, but if you have thoughts on what I just wrote please e-mail me at shelbyrose7@yahoo"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"*Possible Spoilers*I was dissapointed with this book.

I hope the 6th chapter quickly resolves this issue and moves onto Thunderclap!Can't King imagine something else to write about besides Susannah's stupid schizophrenia?The whole thing with Callahan was also very boring. I found I wasn't very interested in his alcohol addiction.People, I think King is going soft."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book was not worth the wait, although it is a must read for Dark Tower buffs. I love the Dark Tower Series, however #5 is my least favorite. The book was about 250 pages too long. I found myself getting bored towards the middle of the book. Everything having to do with Callahan's past was interesting, but all of the exciting parts of the storyline were rushed! Potential SPOILER...don't read ahead if you yet to read the book~The battle with the Wolves was also disappointing. It was hyped for a good 300 pages, then the actuall battle consited of about 6 pages. The whole dish throwing thing was a little ridiculous too. Personally I am glad to see Susannah has transformed to MIA and disappeared. I can't stand her. This book would have been better had King expanded on the Calvin Tower storyline (I assume this will be a good portion of 6).After reading Wizard and Glass, I was hoping to hear more about Roland's youth. Hopefully, that will happen in volume 6!!!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I read the first three dark tower books and wanted more. Years later (giving King the time to finish the series so that I don't have to wait YEARS for the next book), I found the audio books. They were CAPTIVATING!. The narrator, Frank Muller, captured the essence and the characters perfectly. I greedily absorbed each audio book and looked forward to the next. That is, until I listened to the first disk of \\"Wolves of the Calla\\". OMG. The guy (George Guidall) sounded like he couldn't keep drool off his lips and you can hear it while you listen. UGH!! His failing flesh comes through in his reading and I don't think I can stomach another disk. I believe I'm going to have to wait until I have more time so that I can read the series as I cannot endure anymore disks of this driveling, slobbering narrator. Don't get me wrong: age has nothing to do with my dislike of this person but when you are narrating a book, clarity and voice quality have a huge impact. What a disappointment. :("},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I find Wolves of the Calla to be the best book of the seven novels that make up the Dark Tower series.

Much more fast paced than Wizard and Glass.I highly recommend this book, as well as the entire series, to anyone."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Honestly, I feel like Wolves of the Calla was by far the weakest in the series so far. I know a lot of people who really loved this book, but I just can't understand why. It felt like a 700 page sidetrack of plot. Only once or twice in this entire book is the Dark Tower itself even mentioned. Flagg is left completely out of it, and they get absolutely no closer to the tower itself.I'm a huge King fan, but sometimes there are little ticks about his writing that bug me here and there. This book was chalk full of them. I felt like if King would have removed all the character's dialogue of \\"aye, do ya well\\" \\"do ya ken\\" \\" \\"see this very well\\" \\"hear him very well\\" over and over again the book would have been several hundred pages shorter. Also the writing is packed with rhetorical questions. How did Jake feel about this? What about that? What did Roland think of this? Again and again. It just felt forced for the sake of King finishing the book.The idea of the wolves was cool, but after 700 pages of build up I just didn't care anymore. I wanted them to get back on the track of the tower, not mingle on some farm in the middle of nowhere.There were elements of the book I really liked. Callahan's story, black thirteen, sussanah's situation...they all kept the story flowing at least...but I feel like if this book was cut in half it would be a lot better. This book really frustrated me."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen King outdid himself with Book 5 of the Dark Tower Series.

In prior books, the towns/cities that were traveled through were secondary to the journey to the Dark Tower (Tull, Lud, Topeka, etc.). Calla Bryn Sturgis, however, is the entire focus of this book, and while that may make some answer-hungry readers upset, I still found that I enjoyed it immensely.The ka-tet of Roland, Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Oy are on their journey under the beam, headed toward the Dark Tower, when they are interrupted by a group of people from a town up ahead. These people are in a dire situation, and need the help of the gunslingers. Every twenty years or so, a group of \\"wolves\\" comes out of the east, and takes one of every twin in the town (twins are the norm in this world). The twins aren't killed, but they come back \\"roont,\\" which is to say their brains have been basically sucked dry. The ka-tet meets a man who will be familiary to many King fans, Father Donald Callahan ('Salem's Lot). Callahan lives in the town now, and is one of the main proponents for using the gunslingers to take out the wolves. Callahan also has a secret: in his church he holds one of the colors of the Wizard's rainbow, and he offers it to Roland if they will help rid the town of the curse of the wolves.If all this weren't enough, Susannah has reverted back into her previous schizophrenic state. She has created a whole new personality, Mia, who is the mother and protector of the \\"baby\\" that Susannah is carrying inside of her.Wolves of the Calla was completely different from what I was expecting when I picked it up. Frankly, the book has very little to do with the Dark Tower when compared to the previous books in the series. Of course, the tower is constantly in the back of everyone's head, but the main focus of the novel is defeating the wolves that take the children from Calla Bryn Sturgis. In this novel, I feel that King has created the best villains yet in the series. He does a great job making the reader truly hate the wolves, and you cannot wait for the climactic battle.It is also very interesting what King is doing with the whole idea of things from our world being true in their world. The wolves have a few weapons at their disposal that might (should) seem very familiar to you. The whole idea of Callahan now being in the world of the Dark Tower opens up a whole bag of tricks. And it is apparent that King is going back into this bag with a revelation that comes near the end that involves a certain author we all know and love.But, of course, it wouldn't be Stephen King, and it wouldn't be a Dark Tower novel if there weren't a few crazy twists thrown in just for good measure."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla introduces you to an Old friend from King's Salem's Lot and answers a long asked question why he ran.

The story is as much about the wolves as Moby Dick is about a whale. Stephen King draws upon imagery from his own substantial body of work as well as such disparate sources as the Knights of King Arthur's Round Table to westerns like The Magnificent Seven. Readers of previous books in the Dark Tower series will recall how this imagery is powerful but often incongruously juxtaposed.

The Quest for the Black Tower continues."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book is yet another genius entry into the Dark Tower series. The book takes place where The Wizard and the Glass leaves off with Roland and the Ka-tet having just met the evil wizard Walter and escaping Otherworld Kansas. The book starts with a town meeting in the Calla where the town is discussing what to do about the immenent attack of \\"Wolves\\" which comes ever 20 years to abduct 1 of every twin child. SOme of the town say to fight the Wolves while others say to just give up the children.The story skips to Roland and his group walking through the waste land, when they notice the people from Calla watching them. The people from Calla asks the group for their help in combating the Wolves, and they agree. Additionally, it is revealed that Roland must help the town becuase they have in their possesion one of the wizard's rainbow, the evil back one which has the power of teleportation and inter-universe travel.Roland meets the town's leader the enigmatic Fr. Callahan who many will remember from Salem's Lot. He tells Roland his story of his experiances with Vampires and his travels through other worlds via \\"lost highways\\" and how he ultimately wound up in Calla. This section of the book is phenominal and is a great pick up from the end of Salem's Lot and is an even better tie in to the Dark Tower Series. Additionally, it entails his encounters with the fabeled \\"Low Men\\" who many will rememebr from Desperation or Insomnia. Lastly, this is the first in depth mention of the Crimson King who it is speculated that Marten works for. That is as far as i'm going on that section, i dont want to spoil anyhing.The team travels back to New York several more times, has additional dealing with the thug Balzaar (before the time he was murdered by Eddie). These dealings connect to Calvin Tower (the bookstore owner from Wasteland) and his dealings with the vacant Lot where Jake found the rose.While the town is preparing for the coming of the Wolves, there is much trechary in play which the team must deal with all of which play out to the end in the ifnal battle with the Wolves. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the team notices some horrifying changes with Susannah and her condition is also revealed. I am not going to talk about that because he condition leads to the cliff hanger ending.The plot of this book was awesome and it was phenominally written. Like Wizard and the Glass Wolves of Calla is around 700 pages, but does not have 200 pages of filler. Instead everything is necessary in this boko and everything that happens keeps you begging for more and more. I thought this book was a great addition to the series. The ending was very powerful, and the cliff hanger got me dying to read the next book.This book is a must read. However if you did not read the other book sin the series you will be completely lost. You have to start from book 1 or you'll have no clue what is going on.BUY IT NOW"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"***SPOILERS AHEAD***Okay, so first, the good. Wolves of the Calla is a good story. Mid World is back in full force, and let's not kid ourselves, Roland's decaying world-that-moved-on is as much a character in this story as he is. The characters are good, the dialog is good, all of the things that make a story a story are good.Now, the bad. I don't like what King has done with the series. I don't like what he's done with Roland as a character. To me, it seems like the whole thing has gotten a lot more G-Rated. I mean, look at Roland in the first book. Dude sleeps with a prostitute and then shoots up a whole town. In Wolves, at one point he actually says to Eddie, \\"I've learned to respect your feelings.\\" Respect your feelings?! What kind of hippie-dippie support group talk is this? Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against characters developing and changing over time, but that is just not something Roland would say. His whole affair with Rosalita Munoz is all cutesy-cutesy, \\"look at the couple in love\\" sort of thing. This is not very Roland! Roland is a love-em-and-leave-em creature of lust and apathy. I mean, he's basically kind of a sociopath. Is this how a sociopath acts? \\"Rub me down with your arthritis lotion?\\" I think not.There are also problems with the storytelling. Making Jake a psychic is a lazy device. To me, it's just a shortcut so that King doesn't have to think of a better reason for the characters to make their decisions. I'm not saying that psychic characters are ALWAYS a cheap device, but in this story, it is. How does Jake being psychic change his character at all? (except for maybe making him more of a Wesley Crusher \\"boy who can do anything\\", which is pretty damn obnoxious in itself)I wasn't sold on the \\"big plot twist\\" that the Wolves were really robots. First off, it's kind of obnoxious to introduce a big plot twist and then not reveal it for hundreds of pages. For one thing, it didn't take me that long to figure it out -- so by the time we got our \\"big reveal,\\" I was all \\"like, duh.\\" And then the final battle ... was kinda lame. I never really thought anything important was at stake. Okay, so we lost a couple minor characters who we didn't care that much about. So what? Where's the suspense? Where's the sense of \\"will they make it, will they make it?\\" There was no moment in the battle where I doubted that our protagonists would be victorious. Sadly, this becomes somewhat of a theme in the last 3 books : big conflict is set up, some easy plot device makes big conflict easy to surmount, protagonists escape big conflict.Finally, I'm going to comment on King's writing style. Now, take this with a grain of salt -- my big Stephen King phase ended with my teens, so it's hard to know if this was always his style, or if it's something that's come along in recent years. But it bothers me how little subtlety there is in his writing. King never alludes to anything. If there's something important, he draws a big circle around it and basically says, \\"Oh by the way, that wasn't just a coincidence, that was something important.\\" He'll even dip into the character's thoughts, JUST TO ERASE ANY DOUBT as to what they're thinking. I mean, I know that King writes for a mass audience, but at this point in his career, couldn't he afford to go off-script and maybe write something a little more challenging? When a book makes me connect some of the dots, I find it more engrossing; it's like I'm part of the book or something.Anyway, Wolves of the Calla is a decent-enough book, and enjoyable in an \\"empty calories\\" sort of way, but it is not up to the same level of quality as books 1-4."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I'm well acquainted with series which have a book in them that doesn't progress the plot, having come off the Wheel of Time to the Dark Tower. \\"Wizard and Glass\\" was my favorite because I loved the excited backstory of Roland. Wolves....kind of came to a screeching halt. It is a complete side quest like in a video game, if you will. You can trudge on to the final goal, or you can stop off and do this extra bit, if ya ken. Halfway into this book, as Pere Callahan's and other's stories were being recounted, I was like \\"can we just get on with it?\\" Looking back at the book in its entirety, I do have a hindsight appreciation for the character development that came about from this quest in the Calla and don't begrudge the lack of progression to the Tower as I did during my reading.But one thing I really don't like in books *SPOILER* is when authors mention themselves. That is the biggest reason, for example, I stopped reading Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt series. I just think it breaks the fourth wall. I understand that many of Mr. King's books are linked somehow to the Dark Tower series and that's fine...I feel I can still follow the Dark Tower without having read 'Salem's Lot...but going so far as to mentioning one's self, it breaks my suspension of disbelief. So that's why this book gets one star less than Wizard and Glass."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Okay, before we get into this book, let me take a little survey: Have you ever seen The Seven Samurai? How about The Magnificent Seven?The Three Amigos? GalaxyQuest?If you've seen these movies, and any number of stories like them, then you know the basic outline of this book. Say it along with me now....Calla Bryn Sturgis, a small farming village on the far end of the world, is notable for a few things. Its rice, its peaceful people, and its abundance of twins. The farmers of Calla Bryn Sturgis want nothing more than to live their lives in peace, but their idyllic existence is threatened by invaders from the east.They come from the evil town of Thunderclap, once a generation - the Wolves. Armored and cloaked in green, riding identical deathless gray steeds and armed with terrible weapons, the Wolves come to Calla Bryn Strugis to steal one child from every set of twins. They take them to their dark city, and when the children come back, they come back as damaged goods. \\"Roont,\\" the Calla-folk call them, and it's an apt word for they are ruined indeed. Over the years, these children, whose minds have lost all of their intelligence and humanity, grow into pain-wracked giants, and then die horrible deaths years before their time.No one knows why the Wolves come, and no one has ever even considered trying to stop them. Until now.Word has come that Roland and his ka-tet - Eddie, Susannah, Jake and Oy - are in the area, and if anyone can stop the Wolves, it would be Gunslingers. If the people of Calla Bryn Sturgis can convince them to help, and are willing to fight alongside them, then they have a chance to repel the Wolves once and for all.If only it were that simple.Interlaced with this this pretty straightforward tale is, of course, the larger story of the quest for the Dark Tower and the fight against those for whom the Wolves are merely agents. A new warrior in this fight is Father Donald Callahan, whom we last met way back in 'Salem's Lot as a broken and ruined priest, damned by a vampire king and sent out into the world to live or die as he pleased. Through his damnation, Callahan has found himself able to see things he shouldn't be able to see, including the various classes of vampires and the Low Men - agents of the Crimson King who serve His interests in the various levels of the Tower. Callahan discovers a knack for traveling through the Americas along secret highways. In his ramblings from coast to coast, looking for peace - or death - he slips from one version of America to another, never knowing how or why.In the end, he brings himself to the attention of forces far greater than himself. It leads to his death and reappearance in Roland's world, but more importantly it puts him in possession of an object of great power and even greater peril - Black Thirteen, an inky sphere that could be the black eye of the Crimson King himself, and which has the power to send its bearer through a door to any point in space or time.Roland and the others are going to need that door, too. While they're busy planning their battle against the Wolves in Calla Bryn Sturgis, they have another fight to win, in another world. In New York of 1977, there is a vacant lot, and in this lot is a rose. The rose must be protected at all costs, for it is the other end of the Tower - one axis upon which all the worlds turn. This lot is in great peril, and it is imperative that our heroes keep it safe. By whatever means necessary.It's a really good tale, and one that is actually better than I remember it being. The first volume after King's near-fatal accident, it's all put together very neatly, while getting us set up for events to come, even if some of them aren't entirely clear, or seem a little random at first glimpse. For example, Roland discovers that he's beset by the Dread Foe Arthritis. As it is now, it's making him kind of achy, but should it spread to his precious shooting hand, then it's all over for him. Why King decided to afflict Roland with something as mundane as arthritis isn't entirely clear (although to be fair, Roland is technically over a thousand years old and could be considered due for a few of the ravages of old age).Perhaps it is a sign of Roland's encroaching humanity. In The Gunslinger, mention is made of his ability to detach himself from his body somewhat so as not to feel thirst. In that book, he is largely mechanical, only showing any kind of real emotion when he finally faces the Man in Black. Over the course of the series, Roland has become more tuned into what it means to be a person and to feel, y'know, feelings and things. This gives him the bond with his ka-tet that he needs, but it also comes with a price. Perhaps the arthritis is the first price he must pay for allowing himself to feel.Mention must also be made here of poor, beleaguered Susannah. I mean Detta. Odetta. No, wait - Mia.Out of the seething cauldron that is this poor woman's mind, a new personality has emerged. Mia, Daughter of None is still something of a mystery to us. As far as we know, she has only one ambition - to protect the child growing in her belly. This child was not fathered by Eddie Dean, Susannah's beloved husband, but by the cold and unnatural demon that Susannah held at bay while the two men pulled Jake from his world to theirs. Growing within her now is something horrible, something that Mia was born to protect, even at the expense of the body she inhabits. Right now, that's all that she is, and her greater purpose is yet to be revealed.King does a pretty good job of juggling the various plot lines in this book, making sure that we aren't left hanging for too long on any of them. Of course, they feed into each other as well - Father Callahan's tale interweaves itself with the story of New York in '77, and its ultimate conclusion allows the plot to progress through this book and into the next. I actually enjoyed Callahan's story a great deal, and thought it would have made for a wonderful stand-alone short story. Not a novel, as there's a whole lot of \\"I walked around for a few years and did manual labor\\" in there, but the story that he told to Roland and the others would have stood on its own quite nicely. He's an interesting, complex character, and I look forward to seeing what awful thing happens to him next.What's more, there's a wonderful meta-fictional element to this book as well, and it introduces that idea of a story that is aware of itself being a story. For example, in the beginning of the book, Eddie notices that time has started up again. While it is true that time, like everything else in this world, is unreliable, I found it interesting that he should make mention of it at that point, right when their story starts up again after a break (from our point of view) of six years. From the characters' points of view, on the other hand, the time between books is indeterminate, but Eddie notices that they don't seem to really do anything in that intervening time. It made me wonder about what happens to fictional characters when they're not being written about, a train of thought for which I am not adequately medicated.More importantly, the impact of real-world fiction becomes painfully obvious in this book. For one, Stephen King is established as an as-yet-unseen character, which comes right on the heels of a very serious existential crisis for Father Callahan. The Wolves themselves are explicitly noted to be rip-offs - er, homages to fictions ranging from Marvel Comics to Harry Potter. Whatever else Roland's world is, it has a very close connection with the fiction of our world, and that connection may offer important clues as to the true nature of their quest.So, what purpose does this book serve in the greater series? Well, there are many out there who see Roland's quest as being not so much for the Dark Tower as for redemption. After the loss of his love, his friends, his family and his homeland, Roland made himself into something that was only technically human. Over these books, he has had to learn how to re-connect, first with individuals, then as a small group, and now with a community. In this book, Roland has to come to grips with Calla Bryn Sturgis not just as a hired gun but as their leader, if only temporarily. He has to see himself as part of a greater whole, thus becoming - as I mentioned above - more human. Each book forces him to be more and more connected with those around him. The only question is if he can hold on to this new humanity before his quest for the Tower destroys him.All in all, a good read, which moves ever-so-smoothly into the next book....------------------------------------------------------------\\"First come smiles, then comes lies. Last is gunfire.\\"- Roland, Wolves of the Calla------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Although the Dark Tower series was started in the late 70s, this is my first time reading the series and they just keep getting better and better. This series is by far, in my opinion, one of King's best set of novels because each novel gets better then the last. Wolves of the Calla is no different. This novel is full of vivid imagery, spine-tingling suspense, and strong storylines all wrapped up in such an awesome plot that this work of fiction is believable. King is such a good writer that it seems like Roland and the other characters are real people; like there could actually be another world out there where these adventures take place. Wolves of the Calla will leave the reader excitedly anticipating the next book in the series. My strong recommendation is to order the next two books before you finish this one to avoid waiting between novels."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I just finished reading the 5th Dark Tower book (in spanish, I'm from M&eacute;xico) and it was awesome!! But I just couldn't belive what Stephen King did... He inseretd himself in the story!! That's awesome!! I would like to know what part he is going to play since I have just been told that he is in the next book for a short time. I can't wait to read the 6th book... 2 more books to reach the Tower!!!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Like in Book 4, have VI ready, this ends in a cliffhanger AGAIN!It could be the change in readers, but it took me a while to get \\"into\\" this audio book. I actually think it just dragged a lot in the story of a new character, the yeast of the story is really good and I was intrigued about the Wolves, but it was not as engaging in the middle. Now, the LAST 4 CDs (there are 22 on this Audio book) are really great, the development is exciting and the ending just had me reaching for the next book. It has some references to other popular current fiction Characters and some from Mr. Stephen King's previous works that kind of baffle me, but hey, this is Stephen King after all.This book and the ones to follow are read by George Guidall, previous were read by Frank Muller, which I liked much better, and because I started and continued right away with each book, the change really bugged me. But the story is so compelling that I just got hooked again. Join the journey! I really like Eddy and his New York accent, which he does not have on this book due to the new reader."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This follows immediately after the events of the fourth book. As Roland's ka-tet continue their quest to the Dark Tower they make a stop in the village of Calla Bryn Sturgis where they are asked to remain and defend their town against the \\"Wolves\\" of Thundercap. The wolves come once a generation and steal several of their young children only to return them later in an altered state. Like the movie \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" and others like it (\\"Seven Samurai\\", \\"Samurai Seven\\", and more), Roland sticks around to train the villagers how to defend themselves and help them to make a stand against the onslaught.There are other goals as well, such as protecting a single, red rose in the middle of an abandoned Manhattan real-estate lot. Added to the large list of characters is Father Callahan from Stephen King's book \\"Salem's Lot\\" with several hints of more characters to join from the world of Stephen King.The story has a lot of plot development to the point that you may be confused on what is going on at times but it sets up the sixth (and shortest) book and brings the story one step closer to the seventh book. This is not the strongest of the books in the series... It is slow at times, weird at other times, but a roller coaster ride the rest of the time. In the end I still enjoyed it as it left me hungry to continue on to the sixth book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"One of the better books of this series. King gives us a great discription of a small town in Mid-World and how the people have succumbed to an evil force. That force takes the children and makes them roont. Yet the villagers do nothing to keep the kids safe since past efforts were usesless. This story has some great character development and battles, yet some of the themes from previous books in the series continue to pop up as a thorn. Doors to other worlds is reintroduced and is getting old. I am all for connections between all of these books but some of these themes seem to be ways out for an author who is stuck."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"It does rely heavily on the Seven Samurai for inspiration, but it is entertaining nonetheless. The backstory of Father Callahan is interesting, seeing as I've missed him since his Salem's Lot days. The people of the Calla lack intrigue, but this book gets you excited for the impending (in two books) finale."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This books stands apart from the rest of the Dark Tower series in that it pretty much all takes place in the same place. It reminded me of a quintessential Western story where the gunslingers roll into a troubled town and agree to help the poor townsfolk from the imminent arrival of the outlaw band of miscreants who plunder and pillage. Only these outlaws, the wolves, don't steal your money or your horses, they steal your children. Even though the book was less epic than others, I still found it engaging. And there are some mystical twists that keep it from being completely mundane. By now, though, there's a sense that Roland and his ka-tet of gunslingers are unbeatable, so there's not too much suspence. Jake is awesome though; I love it when kids get more credit than they usually do in the real world. Ultimately, though, the book does feel like an in-between pit-stop interrupting Roland's quest for the Tower."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"It was a fun read, but mostly it was just a container for other stories to unfold. The last 150 or so pages only dealt with the wolves."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book is what I see as a love-it or hate-it kinda book. I personally enjoyed it, but it did seem to drag. The first 4 books I flew through, and this one definitely took some personal initiative to sit down and read. Although it isn't a bad read, it's more of the Gunslinger and his Ka-tet and more hitches along the dark tower. And it sets up book 6 with some really great tie-ins to their quest for the tower. You will start to see things really become serious about that quest, and will be wholesomely ready for book 6. And whether you loved the book or not, if you have enjoyed the series so far you will enjoy most of this one, and be eager for the next."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"i thought that this book had a very interesting storyline but overly long on getting to the climax, for which there was only one. (unlike the previous four books, which had many) so far, book three - the wastelands - was and is my favorite. fast paced cover to cover so i guess compairing that book to the last two, this one especially, i've been left a little disappointed. i have the hard covers but dont really read them until the paperbacks arrive so for me, reading 700+ pages of flashbacks, characters', outside of the ka-tet, past storylines (father callahan especially) and many mythological gibberish which had nothing to do with our heroes quest (other than everything having to do with ka) seemed a bit long. but that is king. i cant tell you how many times i got lost reading IT when i was only 15. i realized quickly that his style of writing isnt for everyone (it is for me now, however) and this is just another example of it. very anxious to read the final two, i won't wait for the paperbacks this time, and can only hope that he does take the ka-tet back to thunderclap to uncover the mysteries there. even though, for me, that that part of the story i found irrelevant, i still want to know what is there and how the kids become roont. i just hope he doesnt do away with it like he did the tick-tock man - with a one page demise of Flagg's pawn - who i thought would be great to see returning and playing an important role in spoiling the ka-tets goal of reaching the dark tower. he could have been a great nemisis other than Flagg himself. i still gave the book 4 stars because the last 250 pages made up for it all. plus, the story does continue...."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"King is brilliant at setting up the scene for you, and he's at his best in this book.The plotting between the gunslingers ka-tet, and the Wolves, keeps the pages turning. Much like it did in Book 4, when the young gunslingers were going against the Big Coffin Hunters.The old mysteries of Thunder Clap mountain are replaced with new mysteries like the numbers 19 and 99. That's were King really gets you sometimes, the synchronicities of everything, and how everything is interrelated. But at times you wonder if the author really knows what he is doing, or if he is just hoping it will all come together somehow."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Another DT book we cannot tear our eyes from. There are some pretty gruesome scenes here and there, but the underlying plot retains its cunning and keeps us reading. The love and disgust, cheer and horror, dreams and reality are all me3rged into this exciting story."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Honestly I just can't understand how this book even made it to print. There are some great gems in here, like all King books, but it seems the older he gets the deeper the gems are buried. At least this time the good portions of the book are waiting near the end so the reader has something to look forward to as they slop through the excruciatingly plodding development of the story.For fans of the DT series (and if you're even bothering to read this you probably are one) I would recommend reading this book only in the hopes that some part of the story as it is told is crucial to the next two books. It certainly doesn't feel like it.This entry into the epic is so bad it's difficult to find specifics. The bottom-line is it's a bad book by itself and when compared to the amazing body of work in the rest of the series Wolves has to go down as one of the greatest failures in literary history. It's that bad. The best reviews here all qualify themselves by telling you to put the book in context of the other releases and that it's good simply because its part of a greater whole. I remember hearing similar arguments for The Phantom Menace. I can't put this thing into ANY context that makes it a worthwhile read regardless of the role it might play in the overall story.The other reviews below will spoil the plot (such as it is) for you if that's what you need. For me the only value here is it occupies a nice size slot on my bookshelf and thus makes it appear as if I've read more quality books, which I have not. One less than it appears in fact."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"How excited I was when this book came out! I was totally into the series after reading the first four books. I have been more disappointed before except I cannot remember when after reading this book.Like other reviews have already mentioned, a way too long story of 500-600 pages before finally something happens. The begin was good when Callahan and the community were introduced but the second part of the book consisted with only very long boring palavers. The reason King needed to keep the climax in the end seemed to be because the wolves were supposed to be very dangerous!SPOILER WARNINGand here it comes, 60 wolves arive, BOOM! All easiliy put down with only one casuality at the side of Roland and the towns people, eeeh right!Stephan king does this every time! EVERY TIME!!! Monsters, demons, or other forms of evil are presented as undefeatable, very dangerous etc, but are always very easily shoved aside. I have already red the entire dark tower series and can therefore conclude that part 5 is definitely the worst of them all.Don't get me wrong dear readers, the first 4 books are good, I mean, really good. That's why part 5 is so dissapointing.I hate to admit this but part 6 and 7 won\`t make up for this failure. One reader might as well stop (really do) after book 4 and consider it finished. Part 5 added nothing to the story,"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I read many of the reviews for this distributor before I decided to buy.

I originally bought this book online because I lost my copy from the book store, which was three times the price and half the quality of this book.

Western time-travel at it's best, from the master story-teller."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This story is unbelievably great. In my opinion, I think it may be Stephen King's best book, not just of this series. Never in my life has a 700+ page book seemed too short. I was sorry when it ended. The characters are so richly and vividly drawn, I could feel something for each and every character, from Roland and his ka-tet to the many townspeople of Calla Bryn Sturgis and especially Father Callahan. Also, the subtle references to other King books were a treat for me (the ones I recognized, like Salem's Lot and The Regulators).The only grudge I could possibly hold against the book is the fact that the actual showdown between the gunslingers and the Wolves lasts only about 10-15 pages. After so much build-up, I guess I was expecting Battle of Helm's Deep. Although there is plenty of shooting (and dish throwing) in the final confrontation, most of the advantage comes from planning and watching, (palaver in the High Speech). It works exceptionally well. Roland's motives and actions don't seem to make sense at the time, but it becomes clear later. The suspense is of the page-turning variety, although most of the suspense comes from King deliberately not telling the reader things other characters are told. For instance, Eddie learns the secret of the wolves from another character about halfway in, but the reader does not know what he was told until the final chapter. Frustrating, but it kept my nose in the book to find out.I recommend this book wholeheartedly, and can't wait for the next two installments to finish the series. You'll be counting letters in people's names and objects on your desk to see if they add up to 19!(If anyone was bored with Wizard and Glass as I was please pick up this and keep going, it's worth it definitely)"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I got this book because i love the Dark Tower Quest.

It's not essential to read the DT novels to enjoy his other works, but for a King junkie, Roland's quest is like china white (ask Eddie if you don't know). Wolves of the Calla, fifth in the DT series, is in many ways the most complete story of the bunch. Not only does it have a self contained adventure that forms the crux of the novel, it weaves in elements of all 4 previous tales, not to mention Salem's Lot and Hearts in Atlantis. It most clearly resembles the flash back in Wizard and Glass (my personal favorite) in style and setting, but it revisits scenes and devices from books 1-3 as well. So, everything seems to be coming together splendidly...until the end. I won't ruin it for you (as others do below - so be forewarned), but let me just say that it feels like a cop out. Now, since it is a cliffhanger ending (well, actually its got a few loose threads hanging out there) I'm willing to give SK the benefit of the doubt, for now. But I really didn't like the turn this one took."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is a great addition to the DT series, definitely hooking into wanting to read the last two. People, come on, the ending fits, just think about multiple universes, universes spawning universes, a choice you make in life spawning two universes following either choise you could have made, a universe spawned from you mind, whatever. Anything is possible. Keep your mind open. Couldn't you or your life just be a work of fiction. Think about it."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book took me over a month to read - not because I'm a slow reader, but the story didn't catch my attention and I found myself often setting the book down to do other things. As a fan of the Dark Tower books, I see the series as a long journey. Wolves is like driving in the Arizona desert, not much to see, but you have to get through it to arrive at your destination.The settings of the story, Calla and New York, didn't spark my imagination like I had hoped in a &quot;fantasy&quot; novel. The author didn't either have the time or energy to introduce an intriguing setting in Wolves. I also felt this way with the re-introduction of Susannah's schizophrenia. Old and/or tired territory was being covered in Wolves, including the plot of gunslingers saving a small town.I read Wolves because I'm a fan, but didn't enjoy it as I had the other books. As a passenger on the Dark Tower train, this leg of the journey was of a featureless landscape. &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I have long been a fan of Stephen King's earlier works but have found his newer stuff leaves something to be desired. A friend talked me into reading this series and I was enjoying the story until \\"Wolves of the Calla\\". 1st he introduces Walter or Flagg from \\"The Stand\\" and next he drags in Callahan from \\"Salem's Lot\\" and goes into a long dull retelling of that tale! The final straw comes when he inserts himself into the story and then Roland et all realize they are only characters in a writers mind!!!! Talk about ruining the flow of the story! Foul play, Stephen!! After this I found it hard to reinsert myself into Roland's world.

You may be turned off to the fact that the actual fight with the Wolves and the Ka-Tet occurs on the last pages, but this is a book where its about the journey there not the destination. Here are the pros and cons of the book IMHO:Pros: First off, this book really connects you with all of the characters. The writing is amazing which makes the \\"boring\\" parts very exciting and interesting. I also like all the side stories as they all build up and reach a crescendo towards the end which eventually leads up to \\"The Fight\\". A lot of interesting characters such as \\"Andy the Messenger Robot\\" and Father Callahan from Salem's Lot. I really enjoyed the story about Callahan because I read Salem's Lot a while back so the brief part where King explained what is told in Salem's Lot was helpful. The prospect of millions of realities in one world which was introduced here was dazzling. All in all what made this book a success was the great writing and the side stories(Jake realizing treason of Benny's Dad, Trying to earn the agreement of some of the more skeptical Calla citizens, etc.) SPOILERS AHEAD: Also the ending where Margaret Eisenhart and Benny Slightman was touching.Cons: None at all except for the ending (I had books 6 and 7 ready so this didn't bother me)."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"An excellent addition to a great series!

I wasn't disappointed. There's no point in recapping the plot for you at this point -- there are hundreds of reviewers doing that, and a fair number of them spoiling it as well, but I will tell you what I liked about this book. I've always loved the way King has linked all of his stories together, creating universes that all tie up. The inclusion of Father Callahan in this book, while a plot point we've all known about for a long time, was a great touch and really helped to drive home the point that, in the worlds of the Tower, all of Stephen King's stories are really happening. The self-referential stuff doesn't bother me in the slightest -- if you want a REAL self-referential novel, check out Isaac Asimov's &quot;Murder at the ABA.&quot; Now THAT'S overkill. King uses himself as another tool in the story. Furthermore, he doesn't just reference himself, but branches out and includes other works of literature, showing that maybe the worlds of the Tower do not end with the worlds of Stephen King. It's an amazing book that will have you looking everywhere to find out what happens next. This has easily taken its spot as my favorite of the series... at least until &quot;The Song of Susannah.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"i was quite dissappointed in this part of roland's ongoing saga. as many reviewers have already mentioned, this book does seem long winded and i whole-heartedly agree that callahan's flashback was much too long. king seemed to be intent on outdoing himself by adding too many ingredients into the mix. this started at the ending of WAG, which i thought was downright terrible compared to the flawless and gripping tale of roland's journey into and out of hambry that preceded it. what i loved so much about the DT books leading up to the end of blaine's ride was the pacing and the meticulous attention to detail. the drawing of the three and their journey along the path of the beam is simple, direct, and down right cinematic in all the best ways that most fantasy novels can not pull off. it is ACTUALLY believable. roland CAN get sick and he does need medicine and food. the characters all had major flaws, yet they dealt with them in ways one can understand and cope with. but as the time between the dark tower and the other worlds passes, king started to leave out the human characteristics and seems to just transform roland's ka-tet into super heroes. the amount of emphasis early in the series regarding the rationing of food, water, bullets, and all the other day to day things is long gone and the reader is left to assume way too many things. everything else seems to just be and there is sense that 'anything' can happen. 14 year old jake could shoot 3 flying doves with his eyes closed, riding bareback on a horse while being chased by a marauding group of space aliens. does that sound utterly ridiculous? it does to me, but by now, the 'ka-tet' have apparently become full-fledged gunslingers with all the experience, strength, dexterity, and know-how of the justice league. while i have no doubt that they obviously learn many new things in mid-world, they seem far less likely to have ever inhabited our own world now, which wasn't the case all through and up to the end of 'the wastelands.' while i LOVE oy the bumbler, he isn't a wild animal anymore, but a comedic and cute sideshow that seems FAR MORE suited to have been in an issue of SANDMAN rather than a stephen king novel.as king noted in his forward to the newly revised 'gunslinger,' he wrote the last three books all at the same time, something which he had not done with the previous 4. i think it really shows and thats part of the reason why there are so many new characters and things apparently thrown into the mix in this 5th installment. however, we are not given time to dwell upon the events and situations because there is a hurried feel to the story, even though the finale is INCREDIBLY short and highly predictable. the past references to the other 4 volumes ARE FORCED and entirely unnecessary. unless this is the 1st dark tower book that you pick up to read (a horrible mistake in my opinion), these seemingly 'casual' throwbacks to the events of the past are not only incredibly obvious and laughable, but downright insulting to the intelligence of anyone who has infact bothered to read the other 4 installments. the obvious references to harry potter, star wars, kurosawa, and HIMSELF are okay (at best) but totally unnecessary. it gives the impression that mr. king is becoming prehaps TOO involved with his own story instead of letting the characters and events unfold on their own.while this certainly isn't a terrible book by a long shot, this was the only DT book that i DIDN'T race through. the reliance upon OTHER people's tales throughout the book constantly slowed down the story that was taking place in the calla. large chunks of the story were down right tedious and boring. seeing as how the books are finished now, i can only hope that i won't be able to say the same things about the final 2 volumes in this truly epic tale."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is the most expected book by Stephen King. And the expectation is rewarded with a marvellous experience : reading this fifth volume of the Dark Tower series. Stephen King is here at his best. He brings together some other books of his and entertwines them, dramatically and effectively, into the tale. It is Salem's Lot of course, and that is a brilliant development. Some may say that he uses again situations like the assembly of the village and this repetition may seem humdrum. This is a false perception. He renews the situation in all possible ways. And the book stands out as one great achievement. It also deals with problems of our society. There is a strong feeling of rebellion against machines and modern technology that want to take over the universe, as the tools of some individuals or groups of individuals who want to conquer and control the whole world. It is a denunciation of this technological and mechanical dictatorship we are living in, but technology and machines are always seen as the extension of the morbid desires and impulses of some dark people who pull the strings in the wings, and we long to discover those wings, and we feel in phase with our gunslingers who want to prevent this domination, to save the universe from the dictatorship of these dark minds. Stephen King is also mixing motivations : some are moved by religious feelings and convictions, some are moved by adolescent needs and dreams, some are moved by the desire to control their lives, some are moved by the impulse to destroy the dark side of humanity, etc. These motivations bring together very different people in one common task. Stephen King also explores the people who are ready, for petty profits, to sign up with the dark side of life and become traitors of their own community, and the reasons of this treachery are also very varied, and the gunslingers are not immune. Anyone can become possessed by some dark forces : personal ambition, personal interest, or just some schizophrenic split in their psyhe, a split that is produced by society itself because we do have to be schizophrenic to be able to survive in a world deeply divided between humanistic dreams of peace and quiet development and totalitarian selfish interests. This exploration of the deepest layers of modern man's or woman's psyche is fascinating, frightening and also thrilling : the thrill of the future not being entirely determined and enslaved, of the future being open to our decision to stand against dark forces, of the future being in our own hands. And yet it is not that simple, because to bring up this humanistic future, the gunslingers are at times obliged to be ruthless and brutal with other human beings or even with themselves or among themselves. The dark forces are everywhere and the future can only be brought about through a painful and sometimes fatal delivery. We are mesmerized by this sense of delivery that pervades the whole book : delivery as in the bringing about of a new life, delivery as a liberation of our potentials, even if these potentials are at times purely destructive.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book was awesome .

The wolves were not what I thought they would be, they were even better. I could not beleave the people in Calla, I wanted to shake everyone of them. The story has parts that were happy, sad, and exciting. I read this book faster than all of them, you always want to know what was going to happen next. I would tell everyone that this series, The Dark Tower, is well worth buying.Amazon Verified Purchase"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book was a wonderful follow-on in the \\"Dark Tower\\" series. Nothing was lost in this installment. Honestly, if you've stuck with the series long enough to get this far, you won't want to stop now. This was a great book. I won't go into much detail given that this is the 5th book in the series. If you've read the previous 4 then you're obviously into it enough to understand the writing style, characters, etc. You'll enjoy the 5th book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"All i can say is BIG BIG !

The characters are intriguing and King's style of writing is right on par in this story of Roland and his 'ka-tet'.

This series is fantastic. This series will blow your mind and keep your imagination running! If you like the idea of an alternate reality this series is really for you!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I will preface my review by saying SPOILERS!I took a long break after reading book 4 \\"wizard and glass\\". For some reason, I had an especially hard time with Susan Delgado dying - not that it happened, because I knew it was coming, but dang it! I liked her. I found Roland's story in that book awesome, and was disapointed when the narrative came back to the 'ka-tet'.After taking a year, I picked up book 5, which was not even close to the length of time between those two books' publications.When the katet came to the Calla, I enjoyed every minute of the story. I really feel like King explored what it would being a gunslinger actually involved. What feels like a detour to some (and even characters mentioned this) Roland describes as their duty. The answering of the three questions, the investigation and the plan to ambush the Wolves was great. I enjoyed the dialogue and vernacular of the Calla people.I didn't mind all of the back story with Father Callahan. I have gotten used to the fact that storytelling is a large part of the Dark Tower series, going back to book #1.The parts of the book where the group goes back to New York were a little out of place. I didn't mind them because it felt as if King is now moving his readers toward the end of the series, as the last three books I believed were published right after each other almost in a trilogy format. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as the story in the Calla.The biggest gripe I have with the story, is that after hundreds of pages of buildup to the Wolves attacking, the fight is anti-climactic. The Wolves are almost too easily disposed of. Yeah, I realize that's a spoiler, but I did warn you :).I don't think it will be a year before I read the sixth book. I enjoyed the fifth, may it do ya fine."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"(Semi - Spoiler Alert. No specifics on the plot.)As a stand alone book, Wolves of the Calla is great story, although references to other Dark Tower and Stephen King novels may leave readers feeling left out.As the 5th book in the Dark Tower series, it is still a great story but another story that makes little progress towards the final goal of reaching the Dark Tower. I had the same opinion about Wizard & Glass. A great great story on its own but being a flashback, very little progress was made towards reaching the Dark Tower.My other gripe with Wolves was that SK went overboard on \\"name dropping\\". Too many references to Dark Tower world items, too many references to 20-21st century pop-culture items (Harry Potter, Star Wars). I can't explain it well, but I just got less of a feeling of creative new ideas from SK. The first 4 books were mind blowing. Such a perfect blend of fantasy, sci-fi, reality. There just seemed to be too many references to SK's past and pop-culture as I previously mentioned.Overall this is a great book though and I give it 4 out of 5 stars. If only the next book could score this well..."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I am not going to go into a rendition, I see this has already been done. This is the 5th book in the Dark Tower series and continues to follow Roland and his posse on their quest for the Dark Tower. I enjoyed this book. I thought the way Stephen King innertwined characters and places from his other stories brought depth to the characters and brought more realism to the world surrounding the Dark Tower. I do recommend this book and the series. You will need to read these books in order, I do not believe this book can stand alone as a novel."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"And we're back on track! After the massive flashback segment in \\"Wizard and Glass\\" the real story of the series begins to drive forward once more, picking up soon after the conclusion of book four.This story is a little different from previous instalments. The journey towards the elusive Dark Tower slows as the team, King's own \\"fellowship\\", stop to help a town that anticipates a violent and devastating attack from the \\"wolves\\", a group of almost-men who may kill or abduct their children. There are many secrets in this book, all of which are revealed satisfactorily, and many of the mysteries surrounding Roland's world are also uncovered - although there are just as many new questions as there are answers.The writing is, as ever, great; the dialogue particularly brings such clarity to this aspect of King's complex series that you don't feel you're reading fantasy, which, as a writer of the genre myself, can often get bogged down in the narrative. King lightens the novel where it needs light, and darkens the novel when the various truths are revealed. Speaking of light and revelations, we see the protagonist Roland in an entirely new light, adding yet another layer to the full rounded character and his companions. It's wonderful and heart-breaking to see our beloved characters in this way, who by now feel like family.Do we want Roland to succeed? Always. Do we want him to succeed at the expense of his companions, who are also our friends? There are new aspects of the Dark Tower, its substance and purpose, that almost make us think \\"maybe they aren't all that important after all ...\\"Don't miss it. It's a series back on track after a minor slowdown, and it is so intriguing that you'll still be thinking about it weeks later."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"My friend told me this was the best book of the series and so far he's right. I am not starting on Song of Susannah so I can't comment on the last two books yet, but yeah, so far this is the best book of the series.My favorite parts of the Dark Tower series have taken place in \\"Roland's World\\". I don't care so much for their trips to New York. I like the land of the lobstrosities and Blaine the train and most of this book took place in that world, Calla bin Sturgis to be exact.The build up to the coming of the \\"Wolves\\" was well done and I, at least, was surprised with what they turned out to be. Like all the other Dark Tower books there is really no way to read them out of order and have any idea about what is going on. This really is a series that must be read in order.Thus far, this is my favorite book of the series and I was excited about going straight into the next one."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is the fifth book in the Dark Tower series. I found it very similar to the 4th book. I liked the 4th, so I liked this one. The characters don't really progress towards their final objective. The first three books had them moving towards the Dark Tower, but in the Wizzard and Glass and this one, they don't make much progress. The book was a fast easy read (like all of the books in this series)."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Tower Series by Stephen King, where do I start? I enjoyed reading these books a great deal, but near the end, it felt like it had just been going on for far too long. It is an epic tale, and King doesn't really pull any punches. Heros die, and for the most part stay dead. Making the books recursive and self referential was little odd, and felt a bit trite in my oppinion. Having himself as a character in his own book was odd. I'm not sure if it worked or not. I think the goal was to again bring the story into \\"our world\\" after it had strayed far away into the lands of Rolland.I feel that now that the books are completed, that the author and editors need to have a pow-wow, and re-edit the books after reading them in one fell swoop over the period of a week, and then a V2.0 version can be released.If I were to compare these books to JK Rowling's Harry Potter books, I would say these books address more adult themes, but maybe don't hold together as well. There are more gimmicks in the writing, and it is often hard to relate to the character's struggles.Sincerely,Ira Carmel."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The first four books of Stephen King's Dark Tower series are engaging, somewhat endearing works of fiction, some of which (\\"The Drawing of the Three\\") are individually stronger than others (\\"The Gunslinger\\"; \\"Wizard and Glass\\"), but \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" (Book 5) smokes them all. Not only is this rip-roaring piece of epic fiction the strongest book in the series yet, it's also one of the best things King has ever written. Period. Considering my struggle to make it through \\"Wizard and Glass,\\" I found the writing in \\"Wolves\\" so engaging that it swept me in its grip every time I sat down to read. Roland and his ka-tet come across the town of Calla Bryn Springs where, every 23 years, a cluster of \\"wolves\\" on horseback steal the children and send them back home towering mongoloids; the gunslinger concots a plan of retaliation, all while trying to protect the Rose, housed in a vacant lot in 1977 New York City. The suspense in \\"Wolves\\" builds with majestic mastery, laying out the plot in the extended prologue and getting mileage out of characters who, on the surface, are seemingly generic stereotypes of fantasy townfolk. While the climax only amounts to a scant few pages, the richness of the narrative as a whole shines through. And the illustrations--by \\"Cycle of the Werewolf\\" illustrator Bernie Wrightson--may be the best visual accompaniment to Roland's (and King's, and Our) journey yet."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"There are better reviews for this book then i can provide, so i'll keep my perspective short a to the point. Wolves of the Calla is a good addition to the Dark Tower series but it does somewhat lack importance. We see new character development of our favorite \\"Ka-tet\\" and are introduced to some new, but not very important, characters as well. The book progresses the Gunslingers further toward their goal of reaching the Dark Tower, but it does so very slowly. Their is many pages of back story to secondary characters in the book, and though these stories are entertaining they are unnecessary and for the most part entirely irrelevant to the quest. The novel was very enjoyable (its still the Dark Tower)I just felt that much of this books trivial \\"palaver\\" or planning outweighs the significant parts of the story. I was just hoping for more progression in the quest then was made. You read 900 pages of Wolves of the Calla and at the end your not much closer to the Dark Tower then you were when you began. But with that said,The Tower IS Closer..."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Well...I have been waiting 6 years for this book to come out.

I do not want to spoil it for anyone else...but those of you reading this should know what I am refering to. It was the last page...I did not like that at all. I sure hope Mr. King didn't go in that direction and totaly destroy the entire epic.

Though they have no time to leave the Beam's path if they are to prevent Chaos from ruling the worlds, Roland follows his Ka anyway.The group are in the farming community Calla Bryn Sturgis where apparently every decade the Thunderclap Wolves abduct a child from each pair of Calla twins. They take the misfortunate members to the Tower before sending the twin home a mental and physical damaged husk of what they were.In 1977 New York City thugs from the Drawing of the Three threaten bookstore owner Calvin Tower. They demand he sells to them a vacant lot in midtown Manhattan where the Rose that is this world's manifestation of the Dark Tower lies. The gunslinging quartet with the help of Old Fella must fight evil in two worlds.The fifth novel in Stephen King's Dark Tower series is fantastic as the action continues, the team takes a detour yet paradoxically steps closer to their goal, and the connections to other books continue. That link to SALEM'S LOT and THE STAND, etc. is part of the fun (Scribner offers THE CONCORDANCE to assist the audience in following the who's who from where). This particular volume contains an exciting story line starring absorbing characters who get deeper with each tale. Readers will appreciate the latest adventures of the gunslingers as Mr. King's epic fantasy is moving forward towards the climax.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"gonna keep short.

Shardik from TWL, the Oz bits in WaG. Maybe more. So referencing Harry Potter, Dr. Doom(?) and the like isn't that odd. As for the Salem's Lot one... well, let's grant that Stephen King doesn't fancy himself to be the best of writers. So why would he refrain from doing with some of his own work what he's done with the work of others a la the above mentioned? If one of the other four exactly DT (and not just DT-connected) books had been mentioned, I probably wouldn't advance this theory, because then it would be sort of like saying that King is this great psychic being who has learned of the Dark Tower, et. al. or something. But since he didn't...Now I saw a rumor about Mr. King inserting himself personally into the story in a later book, but until that happens, it is most fair to be undecided as to the matter.As to why I rated this 3/5 stars... Eddie's little &quot;kill the wives and kids&quot; thing was rather disturbing (blah blah, I'm so pathetic). Furthermore the story didn't flow very well in certain ways, in my opinion (mainly the ka-tet's supposed dissolution). Having endured Robert Jordan's refusal to explain nearly any of his world's mysteries, detours into New York, etc. don't bother me, because at least we've been given something to go on about that rose, for example, unlike the decaying seals from the Wheel of Time series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Honestly I just can't understand how this book even made it to print.

A little town is victimized by bad guys, until the gunslingers from outside come and save them, doing some damage in the process to the town itself.The prominence of this plot, the relationship of which to the series' primary plot is as yet unclear, may be one reason why I found this book disappointing. Although the Wolves plot works reasonably well as an idea, it seems to lack tension, partly perhaps due to being drawn out over a long book, and partly because the final confrontation is brief, easy, and (to me) unengaging.Wolves of the Calla also incorporates two other main plot threads, that of Callahan (Father Callahan from Salem's Lot)'s backstory, and that of the vacant lot containing the Rose. I'm not sure of the relevance of Callahan's story and find him unlikeable as a character, and since that thread is all in the &quot;past&quot;, it lacks tension. The Rose in New York is clearly relevant, of course, but the details of the thread are confused: why do the New York characters need to flee, and how will that help the gunslingers get control over the lot, which as far as I can tell they haven't established by the novel's end?Characters remain appealing in this installment, with Roland's possible illness and Susannah's possible pregnancy adding much-needed tension. I like Oy and was sorry to see him apparently forgotten at the novel's end. Though the Calla seems a bit too archetypically familiar, the plate-throwing is a nice touch.The illustrations are awful. I respect the fact that they're apparently what King prefers, but to me they look like rather cloudy pictures of strangely squinch-eyed, universally bucktoothed beanpoles usually firing guns while making faces.A startling bit of deliberate authorial intrusion occurs near the book's end with the characters' discovery of a copy of Salem's Lot. For a moment, I was afraid King was thinking of putting himself into the story. That would be scary, and not in a good way."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Rock would say this was gimmick infringement:Doctor Doom with Light Sabers and Snitches....?I used to admire King's originality. This book re-treads alot of old stuff. Not sure I liked that.What is it with authors writing 7-book series like Dark Tower and Harry Potter, having to make each book substantially longer than the last? This book could have been 200 pages shorter."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I have been a loyal Stephen King fan since I picked up my first book Cycle of the Werewolf. I am on page 445 in his current novel,Wolves of the Calla. I must say over the years, I have read the series up to #5 each time a new book comes to the shelf and have always found something I missed each time. I have enjoyed all his masterpieces, but this series surpasses them all. I do have one concern,on page 412: The sentence begins with: It were black, like all the emptiness that ever was, but there were something red in it.&quot; &quot;The Eye,&quot; Roland said, etc.If you will read down to the end of this page and think of the movie and the book Lord of the Rings you will see the familiarity. As a loyal fan, I was angered by this. There was an Academy Award won for this movie, and my question is, did Stephen and the writers for this movie have the same imaginable thoughts at the same time?"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I recently re-read The Stand for the first time since I was a teenager and was struck by the great storytelling, interesting characters and tight writing in the book -- despite its length. It was particularly striking because I had just thrown Wolves across the room in disgust after about 150 pages. Wolves is a self-indulgent and frequently revolting mess of a book that's nearly incomprehensible in its own self-referentialism. This isn't because King is &quot;ready to retire,&quot; as some have put it. If you read the recent collection Everything's Eventual, you know he still has every bit of his storytelling power. Too bad he didn't use it here."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"First the good news: yes, this book is better than the last one. Now the bad: it's still not as good as 'Drawing of the Three' or 'Wastelands'.Wolves of the Calla starts off good. You really think it's gonna get back to what you love about the Dark Tower. But, then it sort of falters a bit, and then kinda ends up in a ditch for awhile. It picks back up towards the end, but nowhere during the story did I feel that rush of excitement that I did when I was reading the first 3 books in the series.I'm really starting to pull back my expectations. By book 3 I would have told anybody this series was pure gold, but now even with a best case scenario (the next 2 books being AMAZING) it will always sag in the middle. Small blemishes on an otherwise wonderful series. Maybe I'm being too harsh. But, the first 3 books were so great. It's a shame.That's not to say that Wolves of the Calla isn't good. It is. But, it's not _great_, and that's disappointing. Overall, if you love the series you have to read this. Even if it was horrible you would have to. But, the story jumped the track with Blaine the Mono and, as of this book, hasn't managed to get back yet.Here's hoping the next two books put us back on the path of the beam. Ka willing."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I'm not only a King fan but a huge Tower Junkie. Wolves has been to long coming, but it was worth the wait. In this book he does what he says he was going to do, he wants the Tower books to be a kind of sequel to other of his books. Salem's lot is now finished, our questions about Callahan are now put to rest. The other books will be a kind of sequel to some of his others I believe.Now the only probelem I had with this story was some of the words, comalla, say thankya big big. Now after awhile these were getting annoying but Steves proise at telling a story kept me going, and all in all Wolves was a great story. He leaves us with more questions than we had going into the story, and that is great story telling. Why? Because it makes you want to read the next book to find out. He is keeping his readers hanging on, and in the end I don't think he will dissapoint.Now to say something about the ending that so many people have a problem with. Do you really think this will hurt the story? No, I don't think it will. Clive Cussler does it in all of his Dirk Pitt stories and I find it humorous. If he becomes a huge character in the next books I might be a bit dissapointed, but if there is just a small reference then it will be entertaining. Give the guy a chance before you hang him."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Part V is so far the worst of the first five Dark Tower books. Wizard and Glass did well with its romantic turn, but much of Wolves of the Calla is about nothing. It's boring. The characers relentlessly thank each other in their tiring way, \\"Thankya sai\\" here and \\"thankie sai\\" there. It gave me a \\"big-big\\" headache, as perhaps one of the characters might say. The ominous number \\"nineteen\\" comes up too often. Names, titles, and tree branches, add up or make the shape of nineteen. It becomes trite. The story has greatly changed from the shoot-em-up western it had started with the first installment. I think it's obvious King was young and full of testosterone when he wrote the first Gunslinger novel. That young blood thirsty man is no longer here, but I hope he occasionly appears in the last installments. Most of this novel is about backstory, adding things up like the recurrent numerology theme I mentioned earlier. The book becomes more interesting toward page three or four hundred when action starts cropping up. This book is only good to those few Dark Tower fans."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"For the first time I actually skipped over long sections of text in a S.King book, because it was so boring.

In book 5 however, the narrator sounds as if he has had a stroke or has down syndrome. The slurring of his words and lack of ability to emulate the voices from the previous books is so distracting that it takes away from every aspect of the book. I would equate it to watching the miniseries \\"band of brothers\\" only to find out that a few episodes in they replaced the entire cast with 100 kids from the Special Olympics."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I was a little thrown off by the 4th installment. I felt as if Blaine had taken the story to a new low. Granted, Eddie had to prove his committment and skill as a gunslinger but I was very turned off the character/immaturity of Blaine. I didn't feel as if he fit into the Path of the Beam well at all. In Calla, we are introduced to many new supporters and objectors to Roland's idea of the Rose and the Tower. With multiple problems that will be resolved by the power of ka, I am transfixed on the way all of them will fit together.

Plus there bodie's never get sent there because Roland can still see them but with a weird glow around them. On that same night Roland follows Susanah to a pond where she strips naked and eats gross things like frogs. So Roland knows she's obviously not herself and suspects that she has a new personality named Mia. He suspects that the demon got her pregnant and that a personality was created that takes care of feeding the baby. He also thinks that Susanah's life is danger when she gives birth. So he struggles how to tell Eddie.Awhile after a man named Pere Callahan visits the ka-tet. He tells them about a group named the Wolves and they steal babies and kids fom the town people. Callahan thinks the gunslingers can help, although not all the town people think so. Callahan also reveils how he's not actually from Mid-world but from Eddie, Jake and Susanah's world. Also what I didn't know is that he's a character from the book Salem's Lot. He was the priest who was forced to drink Barlow's blood. We find out what happened with him after he left Salem's Lot.A big part of the book is him telling his story. This book is the slowest. We get stories from the town people on top of Callahan's big story. The battle with the wolves gets built up through-out the book. Which makes you not wanna wait until it finally happens. Since there's 7 people fighting the wolves and the fact that the ka-tet teaches them to fight. People here gave the book fair reviews, calling it a The Magificent Seven rip-off. Well I guess those people didn't read Song of Susanah yet. In that Eddie even realizes that the battle was a lot like The Magificent Seven.So that movie was obviously King's inspiration. He meant for it to come off as familar to both the readers and characters from NY. The books start getting weird with the characters starting to realize...they're characters written by Stephen King. Yes that takes some fun out of the books \\"even if it is clever\\". However that doesn't stop the books from being interesting and engaging. They're still a very good read."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"If you have been hooked on the Dark Tower series, you should be longing to get your hands on this one.The hero Rowland and his companions are still on their quest to reach the Dark Tower, but are repeatedly thwarted by problems.This time a local farming community has been warned that the deadly Wolves of Thunderclap are coming back to wreak havoc and vengeance on their lands. The farmers desperately need Roland and his fellow gunslingers to protect them, but it is vital that Roland does not lose sight of his original goal.Can they be successful in two missions?This is classic Stephen King."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book is definately not the best book in the Dark Tower Series. It's hard to get into it, the dialect changes somewhat dramatically. Definately a must read just to keep pace, since the sixth book picks up EXACTLY where this one leaves off. It's not exactly as much of a cliff hanger as The Waste Lands ended, but still plenty left wide open at the end of this book.I guess the biggest reason I found this book uncompelling is because the title of the book gives so much away. The entire book deals mostly with the Wolves in the Calla. I never really felt the suspense that the Gunslingers were in any danger of losing a battle with the wolves. Sai King definately tries to build some uncertainty, but I never doubted that the gunslingers would defeat the wolves and then move on with their quest for the Tower.All things considered, book 5 does give some nice insight into exactly what it means to be a gunslinger. It's your duty to protect the innocent, which makes their quest for the tower even more worthy of our attention. The way Sai King has tied this book quite closely to Salem's Lot is very interesting and there are some new twists introduced in this book that make for some compelling reading."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Volume V in Stephen King's DARK TOWER epic finds our intrepid band of Gunslingers arriving in Calla Byrn Sturgis, a town about to receive their once-a-generation visitation from \\"The Wolves\\", a band of marauding masked horsemen dispatched from nearby Thunderclap to steal their children. Shades of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, The Gunslingers are conscripted to fight The Wolves, and...That's it, actually.To the tune of 700+ pages.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate WOLVES OF THE CALLA, but I didn't start enjoying it until about 500 pages in, and most of what I enjoyed had to do with the reappearance of Father Donald Callahan, the Priest who fled \\"SALEM'S LOT in disgrace way back in the '70's. His backstory is compelling, and would have made a great standalone book. The problem with having it in THIS books is that WOLVES is comprised of almost NOTHING BUT backstory. The flashbacks and digressions are seemingly without end, and when we do finally get to the meat of the story, the actual stand against The Wolves, it's over before you know it, and it seems so rushed that it's almost an afterthought. There are interesting developments, to be sure, such as the introduction of Susannah's new persona, Mia, and her \\"Chap\\", but considering that the past two volumes haven't put our heroes one step closer to The Tower, WOLVES OF THE CALLA is a digression down a long road that, ultimately, doesn't take us where we'd hoped to go. With luck, he'll get back on track with the last two volumes......"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I was suspecting that the series was going south at the end of the 4th book.Wolves just shows that King got lost in the middle earth and is just trying to pull resources from ANYWHERE, his own work or any other work, and he is doing it not from \\"literary genius\\" but just from plain desperation, which is more evident in the next two final books.I do agree with the other comment, he should have stopped after the fourth book and should've avoid giving us the \\"Wachowski feeling\\" of destroying what might have been a really good and original idea..."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla is the fifth novel in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is also the worst book in the series thus far. There are a ton of small plot holes here, and quite a few things that happen are pretty convenient. King tries to create suspense by hiding the main characters' knowledge from the reader for hundreds of pages. But this is just tiresome and amateurish.This book takes about five hundred pages to get going. It's bogged down by a large amount of back-story and general farting around, much of this having to do with the homoerotic vagabond adventures of Father Callahan, who makes his first appearance since \`Salem's Lot, the second book King ever published. And Callahan is written inconsistently. He really doesn't believe in God much, if at all, yet he staunchly holds to Catholic positions (seemingly for no other reason than the sake of the plot).King continues his highly derivative, winking-at-the-reader \\"homages\\" to various other sources: this time it's Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel Comics, and even King himself. When you combine these (Doctor Doom in the wilderness with the lightsaber and the exploding Harry Potter ball - it sounds like ridiculous Clue), the effect is exponentially worse.If this were a stand-alone novel, there would be no compelling reason to read it. Unfortunately those committed to reading the Dark Tower series through don't have a choice."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Is the much delayed Book 5 in King's Dark Tower opus worthy of the ongoing saga? As a long-time King reader who nonetheless struggled wearily with The Drawing of the Three and The Wastelands, I'm not necessarily a reliable arbiter, but while Wolves of the Calla suffers many of the flaws of its predecessors (and some of its own), it seems to me these are balanced by new and striking elements that eventually make for a worthwhile if uneven read.The Calla in question, straight out of the fictional Old West King used to build the excellent Wizard and Glass, but atmospherically expanded via oddball linguistics, is a sharp conceit. The Calla's dilemna and the Gunslingers' response to it create a classic dramatic engine in the first chapters.And then instead of driving that engine and building momentum, the book takes a sharp left into Father Callahan's past, creating a short novel within a novel, essentially a sequel to Salem's Lot. It's a fever dream of 1970's America, purposefully reminiscent of King's glory days of thirty years ago. It's lovely; easily the best part of the book. One might argue its not exactly organic to the tale being told, but the Dark Tower books have always been a jumble of elements, and at least this bit is terrific.Eventually we return to the Calla and it still seems like a long time before reaching the inevitable showdown with the Wolves. Despite taking his time getting there, King ratchets up the tension expertly...only to collapse the entire story under the revelation that the villains are personality-free robots who apparently play Quidditch. Well, at least they didn't turn out to be giant spiders...So the book is great--and also terrible. Certainly worth reading if you like King, but plagued by the nutty, anything goes anti-storytelling that has defined this series since the long ago second book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Loved this book. The character personalities really evolved. I would recommend the entire series to everyone. I had put off reading these books due to the commitment of 7 books. Very pleased I made the decision to read them. If you are a King fan, I strongly suggest reading this series. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is one of my favorite DT books. You should read Salem's Lot before reading this, but if you have not don't fret. If there are few character's you were wondering if they were good or bad this book may clear it up.

The world he lives in is quite different from our own, yet it bears striking similarities to it. Politically organized along the lines of a feudal society, it shares technological and social characteristics with the American Old West, as well as bearing magical powers and the relics of a highly advanced, but long vanished, society. Roland's quest is to find the Dark Tower, a fabled building said to either be, or be located at, the nexus of all universes. Roland's world is said to have \\"moved on,\\" and indeed it appears to be coming apart at the seams -- mighty nations are being torn apart by war, entire cities and regions vanish from the face of the earth without a trace, time does not flow in an orderly fashion; even the sun sometimes rises in the north and sets in the east. As the series opens, Roland's motives, goals, and even his age are unclear, though later installments shed light on these mysteries.This series was mostly inspired by the epic poem \\"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\\" by Robert Browning, the full text of which was included in an appendix to the final volume. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of The Gunslinger, King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, the Arthurian Legend, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's \\"Man with No Name\\" character as one of the major inspirations for Roland. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language abstract to our own, are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work.The Dark Tower is often described in the novels as a real structure, and also as a metaphor. Part of Roland's fictional quest lies in discovering the true nature of the Tower. The series incorporates themes from multiple genres, including fantasy fiction, science fantasy, horror, and western elements. King has described the series as his magnum opus; beside the seven novels that comprise the series proper, many of his other books are related to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I would like to say one thing before I start this one and that is that I DO NOT like to write bad reviews. I do not set out to bash people's work for fun or spite or whatever it is that motivates bashers and trolls. I find it's more fulfilling to try to find the good stuff in any work of art and enjoy that instead of focusing on the negative. Sometimes however, it must be done and I also can't NOT review book 5 in a series I've reviewed 1-4 in.If anyone actually bothers to read my earlier reviews they'll see that I was absolutely floored by the first three and a half books in this series. I loved it's originality and it's pace (yeah, especially the pace) which kept me turning pages while the plot built to the point where, if this had been a movie, the intermission would have been. That was the end of the big train thing with the riddle game. Funnily enough, this is where this series began to become a train wreck.After 600 pages of Roland making out with his girlfriend while trying to gain control of a crystal ball whose relevance (enough to spend chapters and chapters on) was never satisfactorily explained, we return to the here and now, have an odd encounter and get ready for the final leg of the journey to the dark tower.And so I began Wolves of the Calla with that \\"Ok, now we're getting down TO IT!\\" kind of feeling that you get when you open Return of the King. Now I was aware that there are two books after this one, but I also knew that he sat down to write these last three books straight through. So with all this in mind I was ready to really get to final push.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:Now, after creating that readiness in the reader at the end of Wizard and Glass, the first thing that Mr. King does is lead us on a MASSIVE F---ING DETOUR! Yes, we've established that the Tower is all, our protagonist will sacrifice small children (and anyone else) to get to it. He will do whatever it takes.. but he has time to stop and play Toshir Mifune in some rehash of The Seven Samurai. Say all you want about this detour being the will of Ka or whatever, but I think it was just an excuse to get Father Calihan into the story.It is worth noting parenthetically here that I have always loved Stephen King's cross connecting of his characters and this is no exception. The final scenes in this book have some great existential quandries that would have been AWESOME had they happened back in book two or three but only add to the mess in this novel.Also from the rehash department comes the Susannah plotline, she's a schizo again, and true to form, it was done much better the first time. Thre is also a generous helping of Rosemary's Baby to balance out the books somehow.But all that is ok, I can deal with all that. Here's what I don't get, The Dark Tower, somewhere along the line, when I wasn't watching.. became a rose being fought over by mobsters. I follow that, but what I don't understand is: Why, after finding out that the rose is the tower, do our gunslinger heroes not gather up Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen and go to the TOWER! NO, they decide to stay and help Ant Island defend itself against the grasshoppers.. pardon me.. robot grasshoppers.(If you understood all three of those movie references.. you're officially a movie geek :))Ok, From all of the above, you might think that I think this book sucked. Well, I don't. There is still a lot of good here. There is a lot of suspense leading up to the final confrontation in the book. There are some interesting secondary characters and there is Andy the Robot. Robots are always good. There are also, dispite my above comments, hints that this stop was unplanned but nescessary.So I'm giving it a three out of five. That's not a bad rating for one book, but the quality of the series is steadily declining and I'm fairly sure that the tower will not be the awesome thing that I envisioned when I read the first books in the series. I think it will end up being quite dull."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"First I want to start out by saying that I love Stephen King. And I think that the Dark Tower books are the best of his work. Having said that, I was a little disappointed in this volume, because it seemed like a rehash of the previous volume (Wizard and Glass). It did have unique qualities: introductions of characters from other books and new pivotal characters to the Dark Tower series. The fact that some of the book happens in our \\"when\\" is very important and a nice return to form for the series. It does move the story further towards the culmination at the dark tower, but just feels a little familiar and too close in scope to Book IV"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Seven Samurai or The magnificent seven it may be, but done Stephen King style. Moving ever closer to the Dark Tower. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I compare the Dark Tower series to Chaucer's Tales of Canterbury, and I hope that Stephen King finishes the series soon.Even those who don't particularly find science fiction entertaining will enjoy this series, because the characters have human emotions and the secrets about their pasts and their missions are slow to be revealed. King strays away from the horror novel genre, but weaves a tale of a different dying world that relies on the last gunslinger to save us all.It is absolutely fascinating and addictive to read this series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Like many of you, I have waited for several years for this book. When I got it, I could hardly put it down, and probably wouldn't have had I not had children to take care of! Although I had re-read books 1-4 a couple months prior to the release of this one, I fell right back into the lives of this ka-tet with comfortable ease.But this is the nature of King's work. It draws one in completely and when it lets go, it can leave one in withdrawl. I am seriously anticipating the 2 following books, however a part of me has to say that I am also dreading it. I loathe the idea of saying goodbye to this group of unlikely heros.As for the rather \\"controversial\\" ending, I think people need to have more faith in the writer here. The genius of his storytelling has carried us this far, and I believe that same genius will see us through to a brilliant, thought-provoking ending. This story is King's baby. His opus. And I believe he will treat it as such.I for one thought the plot twist was quirky and creative and I eagerly anticipate the outcome.I do have one question though- if Balazar and the Sombra Corporation are trying to buy the vacant lot in Jake's when (1977), then what was the state of affairs with the lot in Eddie's when (1986)? I've never been much for ignoring the paradoxes created by time-travel and the such, but I wonder if this question will be answered in the following books.And a final note- I too was \\"marked\\" by the black dye from the book cover, and the stuff is pretty stubborn to get off. I found that Dial Complete soap and hot running water with a bit of scrubbing did the trick."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I am almost to the end of this book, and I can honestly say that I have not read a Stephen King book this GRIPPING since 'IT'.

If you've been dying for the next installment of the Dark Tower/ Gunslinger series then you've probably already clicked 'Buy' before you've read this review, and you WILL NOT be disappointed. If you haven't read of Roland of Gilead yet, then buy them all...This book is incredible. I can't wait to see it out to it's end, and yet I don't want to finish it, because then it will be another year (at least?) until I get to read the next one!!!

I admit it took me about ten years to finally start with &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; -- I had been dragging my feet on them, why I don't know. Anyway, I read Pts. II-IV in order and have been waiting for Wolves of the Calla for a long time.This seemed to be much more readable and I absolutely LOVED the plot twists. I can't wait to see what &quot;Song of Susannah&quot; brings. As has been noted earlier, you pretty much have to start with the first one and read them in order. But hey! It's definitely worth the time and wear on the eye muscles."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I've been a Dark Tower (and Stephen King), fan since 89 when a friend of mine loaned me the then very hard to get \\"The Gunslinger\\" and \\"Drawing of the Three\\". Had my friend Brooke, on that cold winters night during an all night Spades and Drinks session at college told me it would take 15 years from that point to conclude the series I might have passed the books back to her without reading them.Happily I read and loved them. Thank you Brooke.The long stretches bettween books were rough. I filled my time with Tolkien, Jordan, Herbert, Rowling etc. All great writers of great long form SF and Fantasy. But Rolland's world was the one I always asked about at the bookstore. I'd take time off work to pick up Dark Tower books and read them on the day they arrived at the local bookstore, or Fed-Ex from Amazon.I don't want to do a detailed review because most of you are just getting your copies now so I'll just say that DT V was well worth the wait.I Just put it down after a cover to cover reading binge that took me from sunrise to sunrise. This is the best of the series to date. With the possible exception of The Stand this is, Mr. King's finest work to date. If it pleases ya.Now Mr. King please hurry up and release the final volumes. I don't think I can wait till July to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Wolves of the Calla starts soon after Wizard and Glass leaves off, and immediately becomes an event to be charished. Effects from events in past Dark Tower books appear to wreak havoc upon Roland's ka-tet. And Susannah's &quot;scizophrenia&quot; breeds the character Mia who is a personality fixed on only one thing: motherhood.The town of Calla Bryn Sturgis is in needs the help of Roland and his ka-tet. Their children are kidnapped every generation, taken to Thunderclap (where the Dark Tower lies), and are returned &quot;roont,&quot; or mentally defragmentated. The wolves follow a higher purpose; their goal, in serving the Crimson King, is to feed the psychic abilites of the &quot;breakers&quot; with themental juice (if you will) of these kidnapped children. The &quot;breakers&quot; are psychics enslaved to destroyed the Beams holding up the Dark Tower.The Wolves of the Calla is one component of a much greater whole, and for complete understanding should be read as such. Without at least a working knowledge of this greater whole, the novel's full meaning cannot be comprehended. The Dark Tower series includes more than these five Dark Tower books. To understand and enjoy this novel read these prerequisite volumes: The Dark Tower 1-4, The Little Sisters of Eluria (found in Everything's Eventual),'Salem's Lot, Low Men in Yellow Coats (a novella in Hearts in Atlantis), and Black House.As an aside, the time taken to write these books is incorporated into the framework of the series. I somehow doubt its a coincidence that the numbers 19 and 99 that are so important to the Dark Tower 5 put together equal 1999-the year King was hit by the van that made him realize time of was of the essence, the Dark Tower needed to be finished."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"What did the publisher make this book cover from -- crushed up newspapers? I always remove the dust jacket and read the book without it, and after two gripping hours I found my palms and fingers were totally black. Nothing removed this -- even Lava soap. Dropping off my daughter at pre-school that morning was an interesting experience, a sort of Pere Callahan moment. Marked, I'm marked!I'm a Tower fan and I found this book rich, compelling, beautifully written and very heartfelt. Like all tales told in more than one book, there are questions unanswered and new cliffhangers, there are foreshadowing events and twists. Relax. You're in the hands of a master storyteller. All things serve the Beam.Just remember to cover your book with plastic, like Calvin Tower, or you too will find yourself with the mark of the King fan."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla, is a wonderful continuation to the DT series. In Wolves, Roland and his ka-tet are pressed into service by a small town in the ranching country of End World to help defend them against raiding hoards. Wolves is a change in direction from the first four DT books in that the characters have direct access to other worlds. It also gives the reader an idea of how sai King plans to finish the story. Roland and his ka-tet find several remnants of technology left behind by \\"the old ones\\" which still works and are being used. They also meet a startling new character who King readers will recognize immediately.

I read this book all the way through in just two sittings, the flow of the story and the suspense just made it impossible for me to put it down. Dark Tower fans everywhere will love and cherish this new novel."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Once again, we have taken up the quest of Roland Dechain, the last gunslinger, for better or worse. In this case, much for the better. This book drew more heavily on the western influences than any in the series since &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; and leaned heavily on plot elements taken from Sergio Leone's &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and by inheritance, Akira Kurosawa's &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot;. However, King does just lift the plot out of these two works so much as rely heavily on his use of symbolism that has been so prevalent throughout the series to allude to the references. The rice patties come to mind, especially the scene with the townsfolk hiding in them. And as far as the last few pages go, well, despite the people who seem unhappy with it, this has been alluded to for quite some time in the series (although I really could have done without the Harry Potter reference... that was a little too far for me). When this series ends, that I've been reading for almost 15 years, it's going to be very interesting, and there's going to be a lot of happy people, and a lot of the opposite. Me, I'm a reader, and I'll be happy regardless, because I signed on for this particular trip a long time ago and intend to see it through to the end. And regardless of how the story goes, the characters found within are some of the richest laid to paper in contemporary literature. While reading this book, I resisted the urge to unconsciously be swept along as I read, instead deliberately visualizing scenes from within the book in as much detail as I could... sights, sounds, smells, trying to get inside the story."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Before buying this book, I decided to check out the reviews here and get a feel for it. It's been a while since his last one, and I was sincerely hoping that it would be better than Wizard and Glass. After finishing this, though, I find myself looking back at the previous almost with nostalgia. At least that story of Roland's past, though long and sometimes boring, at least introduced (or revisited) characters that I would have liked to read about, and of course had the gunslinger himself. Though Wolves of the Calla is well written, King takes an immense amount of time before he resolves anything in it; readers will literally have to wait until the last 30 pages or so until anything truly happens.I remember reading one of the reviews here, which said that the story of father Callahan took up about 1/3 of the book. Well, after reading it, it seemed to me to take up almost twice that much, and while reading his long, overly-expanded tale, I found myself wishing he'd just get to the point. The stories main points could be summarized in about 2 pages, minus the 50+ page \\"moral of the story\\" about drinking. At least with Eddie and his drug addiction, it flowed well with the character and with the story, and was interesting as well as important. The one flashback I DO like has to do with Roland and his past, and that 1 - 2 pages was a VERY interesting read, but sadly, these good parts were very far in between.I found myself not caring about this character, because he wasn't written (created) with the feel that King's other characters were. If he had died on next page, I wouldn't have cared too much. But I also haven't read Salem's Lot, so maybe that's something. I find myself actually wanting to read it so I can respect this character some more.50 pages could easily fit for the main ideas of this book, and sadly I find myself thinking of how Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time books have become, bloated with detail and pointless text that doesn't deserve to belong.Of course, you HAVE to read this book. Don't buy it now, because then you'll end up wishing you hadn't, since for most people, I believe, it won't be satisfying, but it still is a Dark Tower book, and it does come before \\"The Song of Susannah\\" ... Maybe go read it from a library. But it in paperback.It does have a few good points, and those all have to do with the main characters, and their development. I believe it brings up some points which should have been up before, especially with Roland and, of course, Susannah. These 4, or 5 with the bumbler, I find myself liking more and more, though I wish a better story could have surrounded their latest adventure(s).This book deserves 2 stars, because just seeing these characters that we like so much again is not enough, because almost nothing is accomplished in this book. Maybe after reading it again, I can change my mind, but I doubt it."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"My wife introduced me to Stephen King in 2002. I had always avoided reading his books, because frankly I did not think I would enjoy a &quot;Horror Novel&quot; I liked some of his &quot;Creepshow&quot; movies as a kid, but that was as close as I ever got to reading his stories. She explained that I might like one of his books called &quot;The Stand&quot;, and so I began my journey, discovering along the way that I would never classify him as a Horror Novelist, it is much too limiting, his scope is wide. I have poured through a dozen of his works since, all prearranged by my wife, to feed me bits and pieces of Kings overall masterpiece. The DT series being the heart and soul of a vast majority of his work. In any case, this is sounding like a &quot;read Stephen King&quot; review rather than a read the Calla one, but in a way, I would recommend other books first, because they make this one so rich. Afer all if you have read all of Kings stuff, why are you reading a review, you know you'll like it. If you haven't read DT I to IV read them in order, but grab the recently rewritten Gunslinger novel, it is better than ever. I know it is a big investment of time to start the series, but It has been one of my favorite experiences of all time, ranking right up there with The Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars. The Calla is a great story, it really builds the characters you have already met, and introduces some great new ones. Some questions are answered, and yet more are asked, and finally like any good DT book, it leaves you drooling for book VI. Now when can I pre order VI from Amazon?"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"What originally appealed to me about the Dark Tower series was its romantic classicism and mystery. Here was a hero myth like no other, set in an utterly unique and dangerous world that felt tantalizingly like our future, but so far removed in time as to be a font of magic and fantasy. At least that's where we began. We ended by picking up a snitch from Harry Potter, arguing about the relevance of Dr. Doom, and smack bottom when Roland of Gilead reaches into a worm hole and comes up with a copy of 'Salem's Lot by Stephen King. To make matters worse, the illustrations are awful, lacking the Edward Hopper-esque surrealism of those from Drawing of the Three or the graphic power of the pen illustrations in the Stand (or any ability to draw the human body, period... where did they find this guy, anyway?).Both this installment and the Wizard of Oz bookends from #4 belong on the shelf next to Phantom Menace. What a letdown to an incredible series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book was absolutely outstanding. The fifth book of the Dark Tower series by Stephen King, this book is also the longest. But the length is not daunting; the story flows easily and is by far the most entertaining, suspenseful, and gripping of the five books published so far in this 7-book series.One of the things I really enjoyed about this book was the occurence of characters that appear in his other novels (like Callahan from &quot;'Salem's Lot&quot;, or Flagg and the Super Flu from &quot;The Stand&quot;). This somehow works to connect all his novels and makes it seem like all these novels occur in the same world.I definitely recommend this book, but I urge you to read the other four first. This book can be read as a stand-alone, but you're missing out on a lot of history and important information that may clarify the plot if you choose to start with this book. This book was worth every cent!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The first book I ever read by Stephen King was The Dark Half. I then began working my way through other books of his, mostly his short story collections. At some point or another, probably when I was working in a bookstore in Memphis, TN, someone suggested that I would not be a TRUE King fan unless I read the Dark Tower series. At the time the fourth book (Wizard and Glass) had just been released and I decided to pick up Volume I. I was intimdated. I breezed through The Gunslinger, felt like I'd ridden a roller coaster after The Drawing of the Three, got bogged down (as I'm sure ALOT of people have ) throught The Waste Lands, and savored every minute of Wizard and Glass and it's first ever glimpse into Roland Deschain's past. And then, there was the wait. I know I have no room to complain. Unlike most people I didn't have to suffer the wait between volumes 3 and 4, stuck on that riddling train for, was it 7 years? And then, Wolves of the Calla. I received this book as a birthday present last December and I read it as fast as I dared. I didn't want to spoil the experience so it was in many sittings.Somewhere along the line I began to see what many have known all along, that Roland's world encompasses ALL of Stephen King's stories. One very helpful item for fans of the series, in the harcover edition of DT 5, there is a list of King's novels and the ones that have a direct bearing on the world of the Tower are in bold print.I could list details and situations pertaining to this story, but I have to ask myself &quot;Why?&quot; If you are interested in this book, then you have probably already read the other 4. If that is the case, then you are aware of what an incredible character Roland is, how compelling his adventures with his ka-tet are, and you are fully aware of King's ability to write suspense and create worlds which astonish. DT 5 is no exception.I will say this, and I will stay just shy of revealing the ending of the book, so to those who have not read it, be prepared, to those who HAVE read it, maybe you feel the same way:Stephen King does something in this novel that I am still trying to wrap my head around. The story takes place in the little hamlet of Calla Bryn Sturgis on the outskirts of Thunderclap and is mainly a sort of day-in-the-life of Roland and his ka-tet. So much so that as I neared the end of the book I was beginning to get disappointed. I was expecting further revelation. I started closing in on the last 8th of the book thinking &quot;Ok, Stephen, if you've got the whammy somewhere you better sock it to me soon or else I want a refund!&quot;Ladies and gentleman, I was thoroughly whammed. King, in the last 10 pages or so, takes this epic in a direction that I don't think has perhaps ever been done in the history of popular fiction. I know that's a bold statement, and if there are other examples of this, by all means let me know. If my speculations about what this ending could mean are in any way correct, then King's recent comments about possible retirement make alot of sense. I read in one interview that he commented that after the DT series is complete there really isn't all that much else to say. Whether that's true or not remains to be seen, but, yeah, it could be.As a side note to people who have read this book, the way it ends and the situations it could lead too, to me, is a HUGE gamble. It could be a revolution in storytelling that could astonish readers for generations, or it could blow up in King's face. But the fact that King, who's published umpteen books and probably hasn't seen anything smaller than a C-Note in 20 years, would ATTEMPT something of this magnitude, shows that he is still willing and able to take risks and please his Constant Readers. THAT is why I love this man.All in all, a highly satisfying read and a book worthy of being in the DT cannon."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen King is my favourite author and I have read most of his books and enjoyed almost all of them, my favourite is the dark tower series especially Wizard and Glass. I wonder if the reason I enjoyed Wizard and Glass so much was because it is not really about the ka-tet but about Roland who is by far the most interesting character. A problem I have had with the last three dark tower books is that I find Suzzanna and Eddie esentially unlikeable. It is hard to take them seriously as gunslingers. It is also hard to root for characters you don't like. So this problem continued with Wolves of the Calla - eddie and suzzannah are no more likeable in this book than they were in the others. Wolves fo the Calla take us to a small town that is besieged every 20 or so year by mysterious creatures that abduct the towns children and send them back permantly damaged. The ka-tet is asked to help save the children from this happening again. It introduces what will apparantly be a key character Pere Callahan who featured in 'Salems Lot. I have enjoyed the references to Kings other books but feel that Callahans tale is kind of dull and makes the story line messy. At times I felt quite frustrated with this book - it sometimes felt like it was written by someone else. I also found the references to the number 19 a bit ridiculous. To be honest I had to force myself to read this and it took me several weeks with whole days going by when i did not pick it up at all, unlike the first four books which I read (all of them) in less then 2 weeks and could not put them down. So on the whole very disappointing but the last 100 pages or so were more interesting and by the time I had finished I had reaserted my desire to complete the series. THe last 100 pages picked up the pace and of course there is the obligatory cliffhanger with lots of questions still to be answered and the mystery still there. So yes I do recomend reading this book but I am grateful I did not pay $50 for it(as I nearly did) but got it out of the library instead."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Dark Tower along with Harry Potter are probably the best series I have ever read (I don't count Lord of the Rings since it wasn't published as a series).Roland and his ka-tet are moving closer and closer to the Tower and in their way they reach Calla where the population has been harassed for a long time by the Wolves. The Wolves come every 25 years or so to take away half of the Calla children. Of course, the gunslinger and his group offer help.I have read some reviews claiming that you can enjoy this book by itself without any need to be a King's fan. While I agree that the book is enjoyable by itself, I also think that you need to read the previous books first if you want to fully understand the story and the complex relationships between the characters and the different worlds. It also helps if you have read other Stephen King books, since there are connections to them as well (clear ones with Salem's Lot and Hearts in Atlantis).I started reading this series about ten years ago and when the last book comes out by the end of 2005 I will probably read the whole series over again. I know that there are some fine points in the plot I am missing by not remembering the starting books all that well.My recommendation is...READ THE WHOLE SERIES! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"We travel through &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; in the hands of a bona fide master completely in control of his material and his craft. That this has not always been true of King is hardly a criticism: he is a high-wire walker who distains the net and eagerly reaches where his grasp cannot always follow. Here, in the self-proclaimed twilight of his remarkable career, King holds his story and its readers firmly in his control. The writing is surefooted and never without purpose; and the story is chockblock with action, suspense and unexpected turns (it is not often 700 pages leave us feeling cheated only because the tale has ended too soon).Those who suggest that &quot;Wolves&quot; is a side-story detour that brings the ka-tet no closer to the Tower are much mistaken. The novel is not really about the wolves or the ultimate showdown with them (as magnificently as that is presented) at all. It is about the duty (and the sadness, helpless as are we all in the ebb and flow of ka)) of the gunslinger, and the growth, courage, character and sense of self without which the Tower can never be reached. The Calla, far from a detour, is an essential step toward the quest's realization.Others have carped about the novel's inclusion of popular culture, including the light sabres from Star Wars, Dr. Doom from Marvel Comics, Harry Potter and, of course, Stephen King himself. But the inclusion -- and intertwining -- of cultural artifacts from various &quot;wheres and whens&quot; is central to the nature of the Tower itself: multiple and simultaneous worlds and times, all (precariously) connected to and balanced by the Beams. And it is worth remembering that King is nothing if not a Merry Prankster, always willing and eager to dress in black tie and tails with a boutonniere that squirts water.There are nits to be picked. We could do with less of Susannah and Eddie holding and squeezing hands; we wish Susannah would not call everyone &quot;sugar&quot; or &quot;sug&quot; (it cheapens her, somehow); and, without fail, King is regularly defeated by his acknowledged enemy (&quot;On Writing&quot;): the adverb. &quot;He said morosely.&quot; She said &quot;dolorously.&quot; As Roland would say, &quot;Gods!&quot;To find only such trivial faults in so massive a novel says a great deal about its virtues. &quot;Wolves&quot; is a stupendous act of imagination and execution of -- dare we say it? -- art. Knowing that the final two volumes are already in rought draft and will both be published this year comforts us in a way only the anticipation of an unfinished, time-defying story can do."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Once, there was a story of simple gunman, traversing the desert in hunt of his prey, a fiendish wizard. He learns that the Dark Tower and the Beams which hold it, pivotal monuments to the working reality of the universe, are slowly deteriorating, and that the worlds denaturing as a result. Now, more than twenty years later, we are nearing the end of Stephen King's fantasy/sci-fi Dark Tower series. Amidst all the hype, one has to wonder whether &quot;Wolves of the Calla,&quot; the fifth volume of the series, is really as good as it's said to be.First off, let me say this: no matter what one's beef is with King and/or his plots, everyone has to admit that his writing is simply beautiful. Stunningly descriptive without being droningly mundane, King crafts wonderous landscapes, objects, and characters with a few eloquent sentences.As far as the plot goes ... well, it seems to be more on a like-it-or-hate-it basis. Out of all the Tower novels, this one seems to be receiving the harshest criticism. The story is as thus: Roland Deschain, Eddie and Susannah Dean, Jake Chambers, and Oy the Bumbler continue their quest to the Dark Tower. They make a detour to a small village called Calla Bryn Sturgis, where they are asked to protect the folken from beings called the Wolves, who storm into town each generation and steal one child from every set of twins (which are highly prominent in this little glade).Personally, I had few problems with the story itself, and even the deliverance of it took no skin off my back. The characters continue to grow, and more unique ones are introduced (including a C3PO-like robot and a character from one of King's earlier novels). Wolves did a good job convincing me that the quest to the Dark Tower was important; worlds appear to be drifting together, and major power players are trying to halt the Ka-Tet's progress (particularly Randall Flagg and the Crimson King). The climax of the book was far too short for my liking however, and, like The Waste Lands, Wolves of the Calla leaves off on one of those irritating cliffhangers.In fact, my only complaint about the book, ironically enough, is the artwork. Bernie Wrightson does some pretty keen pencil sketches, but they're overpowered by the rough, gawdy paintings spread throughout the tome like a nasty plague. Even the cover is incredibly painful to look at; for the first time in years, I removed the cover just to have it out of my sight. It's a shame that greats like Michael Whelan or Dave McKean couldn't have been in on this project.All in all, Wolves of the Calla is a quality novel, if a bit below the standard it's predecessors have set. Chances are if you've read the first four novels, you'll have to read this one, just to get a sense of closure. My advice to those who don't like this book? Hold off on the bashing until the series wraps up. King, as usual, has got SOMETHING up his sleeve ..."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"First off, the Dark Tower series is like an expensive, good drug - you either go with it and it produces all kinds of happiness, or you fight it and it fights back. Some people get completely confused the moment you introduce time travel into any story - the concept of &quot;any-where-any-when&quot; isn't going to help you. Just give up now and stop putting up the lame one-star ratings to make the average go down.To go with the drug, you do have to shell out some bucks and buy not only the first four Dark Tower books, but also The Talisman, Black House, Hearts in Atlantis, The Stand, Eye of the Dragon, Salem's Lot, and some of the others that SK has highlighted in the front part of this current book. While it could be cynically viewed as an elaborate marketing strategy, I find it an incredible tie-in of so many stories that is just fascinating. If you come to the conclusion that I have that SK is the master story-teller of his era, then reading all these books is just one reward after another. This is certainly his opus, and one I find to be the best series of books I've ever read.I still think Dark Tower 4 - Wizard and Glass - is the top book he's ever written, but this is a nice 'point D to point E' book, much like Dark Tower 3. All the travel 'back' to modern day New York continues to weave in the story of the Rose, the Low Men, etc. and I found all the length of the book necessary and interesting.I did laugh at others that talked about the book making your hands black! I thought it was just mine!! Also, the illustrator was pathetic - clearly not bothering to even read the specifics of the book before beginning the drawings.I am looking forward to the Ka-Tet eventually finding the world of The Talisman and Black House, and Roland's first meeting with Jack Sawyer - two great heros."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Steven King has outdone himself with this book. From the synopsis of the previous 4 installments in the prologue to the final words this book keeps the reader engrossed in the story with very little downtime as was experienced in the other &quot;Dark Tower&quot; books.Can't wait for the final two."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This installment rocked, just like the rest of them. As a PhD student in English, I can't openly admit that I am a huge King fan and this series is my favorite ever. But it is. Now, in this installment, what I didn't dig were the illustrations. Especially concerning Susan. A. The illustrations do NOT make her look like the black woman she very much is (what's up with the straight hair? Where's she getting relaxer and black hair dye in Calla? I don't recall her getting some in New York, either. Her facial features also need to be more accurate. Also the cover picture makes her look like she's throwing Oriza naked!!! COME ON! Granted I think the cover was going for the pulp fiction feel but why'd they have tp exploit her as a woman? Also none of the other pictures looked like the characters, in my opinion. Lastly, the cover picture is inaccurate. In the novel when she throws the plates, they hit in a verticle line, from neck down. On the cover two plates hit the silhouette's arms.I love this book, and disliked the illustrations."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"If you have not read the first four books in the Dark Tower series, you don't even want to begin reading WOLVES OF THE CALLA: The Dark Tower V. There has been quite a history built up over the previous four volumes and WOLVES OF THE CALLA is not the place to jump aboard, believe me. There is a preface entitled &quot;The Final Argument&quot; that provides an excellent summary of what has gone before, but it is, by the nature of the beast, incomplete (how do you summarize 1,700 pages in only six?). By all means, purchase this volume, all 700 plus pages of it, with its gruesomely lovely illustrations by the incomparable Bernie Wrightson, as your investment will at this point and late date inspire you to read what has gone before and whet your appetite for what is to come.And once you have done that...WOLVES OF THE CALLA continues the saga of Roland the Gunslinger and his quest for the Tower, but the withal of this volume is a divergence. The assistance of Roland, Jake, and Eddie and Susannah Dean is sought by the residents --- at least some of the residents --- of rural Calla Bryn Sturgis on the borderlands of Mid-World. Roughly every twenty years, a raiding party known as The Wolves of Thunderclap ride through Calla, taking one from each set of twins who have come of age. The abducted twin is returned a few weeks later, horribly changed both mentally and physically. There are those who want to stand and fight and those who fear the worst if they should do so. The Wolves are due in thirty days and Roland and his party, deadly but outnumbered, must devise a plan.Susannah, in the meantime, has a darkness growing within her that she only dimly senses, an evil that is tended to by Mia, yet another personality, and this one perhaps is the most deadly and dangerous of them all. Roland is aware of the personality; indeed, its manifestation is vintage Stephen King, and I assure you that the description could gag a maggot.The most interesting manifestation in WOLVES OF THE CALLA, however, is that of Reverend Donald Callahan, last seen catching a Greyhound bus for New York City in SALEM'S LOT, now a resident of Calla Bryn Sturgis. Callahan has some tales to tell. And indeed, if there was to be a sequel to SALEM'S LOT (supposedly planned, rumored to be written but ultimately abandoned) it may well be contained within the pages of WOLVES OF THE CALLA. King continues to join the tapestries of two world continuities while joining yet a third. Does the name Richard Bachman ring a bell? Additionally, more of the destiny of The Rose is revealed, paving the way for THE SONG OF SUSANNAH and THE DARK TOWER, the final two novels in the series.The tale of The Dark Tower requires substantial investments both materially and temporally; it is understandable, in a sense, why the volumes comprising this tale tend to be less read than King's other works. Yet The Dark Tower may well be the key, the Rosetta stone if you will, to King's entire mythos. Individuals with more time and intelligence than I possess will undoubtedly ferret out each and every reference and cross-reference between the Tower works and the remainder of King's bibliography.Taken on their own, however, The Dark Tower volumes and WOLVES OF CALLA are spellbinding in their own right for the way that King has constructed this other world that may or may not be our own down to the last nuance. The colloquialisms employed by the inhabitants of Mid-World are also close enough to our own that they can find themselves being slipped into ordinary conversation (I absentmindedly told my wife &quot;Thankee!&quot; over dinner last night and she almost dropped a casserole). If you have yet to jump onto the epic that is The Dark Tower, the time to do so is now. Just don't use WOLVES OF CALLA as a point of departure.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Yes, the book is a little too long, the pace perhaps a bit leisurely, the artwork makes you wonder if Bernie Wrightson even read the book, but even with all of that it is an improvement over the last two books though not as marvelous as The Drawing of the Three.As King ages, the books seem to get bigger and bigger, this being the longest of the Dark Tower series judging by their widths on my bookshelf. The extra pages are filled with King's strength, characterization.Roland and company fight their battle on three fronts, in near modern day New York City to protect a vacant lot holding the rose which is a Dark Tower analog, in the Calla against child-stealing bandits and in the mind of Susannah who has to again fight against another personality.Father Callahan from Salem's Lot gets a large portion of the story, and though his journey doesn't really move the plot along, it is enjoyable just for what it is, the fall, struggle and attempt at redemption of a troubled man.As I mentioned above, the length of the book allows King to fully characterize not only the gunslingers, but also the secondary Callahan, as well as a number of the townsfolk in the Calla. As far as plot progression goes, the overall story arc is not moved very far forward. This is the sort of adventure you would imagine Roland having in every troubled town he comes to.However despite the slow pace of the book and the fact the plot did not progress well it kept me quite interested because the story he told, basically an aside to the overarching quest, was a good one. King is a storyteller and he does it well, whether he tells an epic, or detours to tell the story of a minor character's trip through alcoholism.This is definitely recommended for those who've kept on with the series as it is an improvement over Wastelands and Wizard and Glass in my opinion. Hopefully the next one will be as great as The Drawing of the Three. The ending of this one does bode well for a more fastpaced resolution as the problem left hanging needs immediate resolution."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I never was a Fan of King's work until I got started with the Darktower Series. Each book, so far, has been a masterpiece of Storytelling and I have anxiously awaited each new Book in the series.Far too often Authors let quality slip to the wayside in projects like this. Seeing the profits they make off of the original work, they expand the Story with more Books and before you know it, the original concept has been lost trying to continue something that should have been left alone. This is NOT the case with &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot;.Obviously, King intended this to be one long story from the very beginning. Thankfully, he has been able to pull it off so far. This Series, in my opinion anyway, will be Kings &quot;Magnum Opus&quot; and the continuity of the story, from book to book is seamless.Like others who have mentioned it, the ending worrys me. The hints that he has given us throughout &quot;Wolves&quot;, especially in the last pages has changed my perception of the Story greatly. If King does what I think he is doing, I can only hope he is able to pull it off without cheapening the end product...."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book was crisply written, well-paced, with great character development and plot resolution.The exploration and development of Calvin Tower, Deepneau, and Pere Callahan were excellent. I especially liked the development and backstory behind Callahan's transformation from drunkard fallen priest to vampire slaying nomad. Callahan's flawed anti-hero is typical of many of King's protagonists, and I loved him as a foil to the Ka Tet; he may be the most purely defined and developed of all of King's protagonists from any of his novels- and he was only a secondary character.The Manni are finally developed as a clan, and some revelations are made about their society and capabilities. Frankly, I felt exploration of the Manni was overdue, and the bits which explored their culture satisfied my curiosity.The build-up to the climax is tight, and the climactic resolution is satisfying and exciting.I felt that Wolves was the best of the series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"i don't know about the rest of you but I had much more fun reading this edition of the Dark Tower serise that the last one. The serise is nearing its end as can be seen by the way the rest of King's stories are becomming so intertwined with these books.The story starts out with the group being recuited to save a village from a mysterious force. Since as readers kniw, all paths lead to the beam and that the beam leads to the Dark Tower it turns out that the events of this book take them closer to their goal rather than away from it.The strain of the journey can be seen now and some of the actors in this great drama are taking a turn for the worst,Roland is willing to do his job but is dymatically running out of steamEddie is comming into his own ready to take over should Roland fall.There are new people as well my favorite being Father Challahan-another travler from our side who King fans will recognize.The only drawback for me was jake, I don't think he gets enough speaking time in this book, hopefully that will change as the last two books wrap up."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I enjoyed this book, as I have all the Dark Tower books. It had a Sunday matinee feel to it, despite the abbreviated battle at the end. It feels very serialized, with one situation leading into the next. The mysteries mount - 19, Callahan, Mia, sneeches, and ultimately, the novel found in Tower's collection - \\"Salem's Lot\\" by Stephen King. Whacky!!For the longest time, I couldn't figure out how to pronounce \`Calla' correctly. Spanish rolling LL? Cawla? Well, the book on tape helps out with that. Of course, the voices of Frank Muller are missed, though George Guidall does a fine job himself. (My first book on tape EVER was narrated by Guidall - the excellent Incarnations of Immortality series.) The calla is brought to life by the amazing creative detail in the simple lives of these people. The characterization complements the narration, forcing the reader to care for these secondary characters. There is a lack of differentiation between the characters, though, that is sometimes distracting.After the amazing build up - the anticipation of the battle against the wolves from almost the very start of the book - the ending is a little disappointing. First of all, only 2 folken are lost! And Benny one of them! And the battle itself is so short! Of course, that creates appreciation for the prowess of the gunslingers, but it wasn't very...thrilling. The ultimate insignificance of the folken to the quest is evident, as the ka-tet hardly interact with them after the battle. This makes sense, though, in the characterization of the established protagonists. The surprise of the wolves' true selves would've been far greater if not for the cover illustration that makes it too obvious. Of course, the presence of Andy (messenger robot, many other functions) pushes the reader to that conclusion.I had mixed reactions to Father Callahan's story. On one hand, it's really unnecessary background for a (thus far) minor character. It created interest in me in the Salem's Lot story, and I suppose that was part of King's purpose, leading to the big reveal at the end of the King novel among Tower's collection. I found myself wanting to know more about Salem's Lot, the book and the movie, and Lo! There it was at the end of this story.

I have loved every instillation in the Dark Tower series more and more. That may be because they seem to get longer and longer but this was great.Reading the reviews before and as I read I noticed a lot of people were not happy with the pace and the length of it. There might have been a few things that could have been left out to cut down on the length, but as long as this is at 925 pages, it didn't feel that long. Well the book is rather heavy so I felt the weight of it, but I seemed to breeze through this when would get the brief chance to read it. Even though the free time I had was short I found myself downing 50 to 70 pages at a time.In this book the four Gunslingers come across a town on their journey to the tower and are asked for some assistance. This town, Calla Bryn Sturgis, is having one child from there many sets of twins taken by the Wolves every 23 years or so. This is the year the wolves return to claim these children and the town doesn't want this to continue any longer. While in the town Roland and his Ka-Tet stay in the town to try and uncover the many mysteries these people hide while preparing for war.This is an amazing story and every book has kept me on the edge of my seat.

I waited six years for it to come out, so obviously I had some pretty high expectations for it. Obviously, anyone who reads this book isA. A fan of the DT seriesB. Concurrently, will be interested in knowing what happens next, so they'll read the book whether it's written well or not.Having said that, the book is enjoyable and I don't feel screwed. However, after the first four books, having the best praise I can honestly give be &quot;I don't feel screwed&quot;, I think this is a bad sign.Here are the main points that I was unimpressed with.#1. This book could easily be 200 pages shorter. King is starting to write like Dickens, as if he is getting paid by the word still. Not good. I appreciate King's unique ability to paint a picture with words, but there are far too many times (the page he spends describing the word &quot;run&quot; as being the English word with the most meanings) I read for awhile and I was like &quot;What the hell? What does this have to do with anything?&quot;#2. Callahan's character is interesting in principle, but he somehow manages to take up a third of the book and you honestly just don't care about him at any point.#3. There used to be interesting allusions to the way Roland's world was back when he was a child, and thousands of years ago when the world was more advanced that ours. In every story there has been some interesting tidbit given away about the history of Roland's world. Not here. There's some &quot;Great Old Ones&quot; stuff that makes an appearance (some of it MORE than a little odd and seemingly hackneyed) but there's no explanation for it, it's just there.#4. The ending. First of all, it seems like the last ten pages were written in about 10 minutes, as if King was using the last of a second wind to stumble across the finish line. Also, the last two pages.... Stephen, please. Don't do what it looks like you are trying to do. If a certain character makes an appearance in this series in person (Those of you who read the ending know who I'm talking about) I will kill you.All in all, once again, not a dissapointment, but I truly hope out of the 3 books he wrote back-to-back-to-back, this is the worst one. It's just not as good as the other 4, plain and simple."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I won't rehash everyone's opinions on what's wrong with this book and the way the series has turned with book 5. I'll just say books 1-4 are definitely worth reading, but 5 dragged like nobody's business and I don't like where King is dragging me. From the way the plot is going now, and King's \\"old man trapped in the '70s-'80s\\" and repeated writing style/themes, I will NOT be finishing the series. I read enough spoiler reviews to get a gist of it, and don't like what's going on. What a waste of a good beginning (books 1-4) of the series. Especially dissapointing after the awesome book 4 (my favorite in the series)."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"... the basic plot's the work of a genius. Roland and his Tet are carriors of the task to save a \\"Calla\\" village from an attack of so - called wolves. The task is fulfilled perfectly, so the newly grown Tet's about to move on which they'd love to do - BUT...As I said above, the basical happenings are chosen and mostly also narrated afantastically, if the author would only have kept it a LITTLE shorter. E.G. the new Tet member's self - told biography shows some details which don't really wanna fit into the actual Tower story at all; all they show is how the guy came into this world, still Midworld, of course.Most of the rest, however, is told fantastically, as I said above. When Eddie comes to talk to Calvin Tower about the house ground with the Rose on it (\\"Waste Lands\\" readers will know what I mean) or Susannah's mind is caught by another person, differently said: Detta and Odetta receive company, those facts are told GREAT!!!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I understand now that, for the most part, epic adventures are boring. Sure, there are moments of excitement and daring-do, but they are spaced between massive segments of walking or riding or swimming or whatever happens to be the preferred mode of travel. What makes a good epic author then? To me, the ability to conceal all that nothing and only show us that glorious 2% of something. King does not do this here. And he is all but killed my passion for adventuring and questing about the world. I had my ka-tet assembled and everything. We even had a furry mascot to travel along with us (Admittedly, it was a weasel we'd found in the woods and we were a little afraid it had rabies). After reading this, we realized that it might be better to find a career in the mass production of coasters and tend to our weasel wounds.In his campaign to show us the true face of epics, King stretches this novel out way further than it has to be. The characters are still as sharply written as ever, but they fail to remain compelling when set against the background of country hamlet Calla Bryn Sturgis. I live in a small town in Kansas. It's basically the same thing as the Calla. I do not want to read a novel set here.But when something does happen it's not bad, therefore the three stars. What sticks in my craw and the craws of so many others is that we have to endure so much nothing to get there. This is THE VILLAGE of the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Due to the current large number of reviews of this title, I won't belabor my opinion. I am an Avid Fan who really enjoyed the first four books of the Dark Tower series -- Books One (revised), Two, and Four were excellent, Book Three was very good -- but Book Five took a definite spin downward. I would call it adequate but mostly plodding.I wonder if King's decision to push himself ahead (due to his near brush with death a few years back) before the narrative had more fully developed in his mind had a negative impact on this story in some ways. The first four books, separated by years, were written only after they were properly \\"cooked\\" rather than being pushed out the door prematurely.Father Callahan's narratives (mid-way through and later) are high points of \\"Wolves,\\" as well as the final 200 pages (where things finally Get Down to Business), but the majority of the dialogue seems directionless as well as flavorless.Roland himself comes up as the most amiable and least compelling as a character that he has ever appeared in this series, and much of the townsfolk dialogue is just a sprawling pointless mess that felt written by a beginning novelist.In the end, it really comes down to this: It took me two weeks to plod through to page 500, then only half a day to blitz through the last 200 pages.Again, no insult to the prolific King, who has written superb tales; and I admire him for this commitment to finishing this series while he is still able. But I think most of this book comes across as filler rather than plot-driven (or even character-driven) and that the story was best served by the last third.Here's hoping that Song of Susannah raises the bar a bit."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Gods, it took a long time to get to this place eh, fellow wanderers? When Mr. King announced his muse became uncontrolled to the point that he FINISHED his opus in efficent fashion, I shuddered. Why?...was my first thought. Does his susceptiblity to mortality, so violently revealed to him a few years past drive his rush, I wondered. He referred to Chaucers' \\"CANTERBURY TALES\\" more than once, so I figured I had it right. What worse fate for a work of a lifetime than to be mauled by someone else comissioned to \\"finish\\" it. Then I reminded myself of Kings integrity to his work. No way any of this happy crap is right I finally decided. It simply came down to THE TIME HAS COME. So, I read...These characters have never been a happy band despite Eddie and Susannah. Things have always beset them unexpectedly like as not to go horribly wrong at some point. This novel reminded me of nothing so much as The Clint Eastwood film \\"HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER\\". Everybody and the damn dog knows the bad guys are coming, and everyone of them is guilty of something no matter how trivial it seems. If you dont't see it, read the book until you do. Remember sins of omission are sometimes as despicable as sins of comission. The departure of similarity really does exonerate Roland's Ka-Tet of destructive premeditation. Unlike the Eastwood character, He(Roland) has no ill will towards Calla Bryn Sturgis. But as usual, this place is simply in the path of the Beam. This time there is time to prepare for an invasion of Child-stealing \\"Wolves\\" from Thunderclap. A recurring bane on the poor folken of the Calla.Mr King has fleshed out a bunch of interesting people in this book. He took a lot of care to make his readers get the lay of the land in this one. Some say he could have done as much with less, but to get the feel of the where and the when, I disagree. I was amazed how much Rolands character was expanded. What a guy, what an enigma (as if we didn't already know this). There is a lot in this work. Traitors; smug, easily hated machines, and re-introductions to long gone (but not forgotten) names from the past... not from the TOWER books! In the last pages get ready to have the stage set for unexpected weirdness. I mean it, readers. I really doubt that Stephen King wrote the first words of this story so many decades ago with any of this in mind. Things are not going to be the same with our travellers. EVER. One last thing... I see why it has taken so long. Some people look at a book as pages glued inside a binding,and some, most sadly are. But take a copy of any of these books in the DARK TOWER series and listen to it like a seashell. Up aginst your ear, now... and be still... hear that? If you don't, just put the paper and glue down and be well... But I know you hear it; IF! You!

Don't listen to the reviews of people who don't like the fact that it seems King is going to include himself in the Dark Tower series. What is the difference between that and Eddie, Susannah, and Jake entering Roland's world. Obviously they don't understand the point King has been hinting at all along: the thinness of reality. He even goes into a beautiful aside about how the choices we make and how one side step can change the course of our history. This is King's oh so subtle way of letting us know that our perception of reality may not be the truth of the matter. I'm hooked again Mr. King. Bring me to the Dark Tower.

I am totally obsessed with this series, everytime I get one of the new books I can barely do anything else but read. If you want to read a great enthralling series I suggest that you start at book 1 and read this story.

While King does make refrences to the Dark Tower within the book , he should have begun to make our head towards the final confrontation with the ark Tower, not messing around in some small insignificant town.What I found maybe the most discouraging about King's newest book is that he makes the old man in the story come form one of King's old books, Salem's Lot. I thought it was ridiculuos the way he incorporated his older stories into the book and I feel that he did it just for a cheap pop. That was maybe the most ridiculous thing about this whole book.While the Wolves of Calla was a good book, I dont feel that it lived up to the expectations I had for any book in the Dark Tower Series, and I just hope he can bring back what we love in the next installment."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I love the dark tower series, but this book seems to be one of the least interesting for me. Not much really happens in the whole book. I personal favorite was The Wastelands, but that could be due to personal preference. This book is based in a more rural setting and involving a tale thats the old \\"great evil that haunts quiet town\\" story and how the gunslingers decide to help and deal with it. They're journey isnt suddenly put on hold tho. During their time there, they deal with conflicts in the ka-tet and find out more bout other people's lifestories.

Roland and his ka-tet must first convince the Calla to their side. The Calla is faced with a monumental question: To live in fear and survive or try to break free and maybe perish in the effort? I loved this book because of its captivating and original plot, along with its rich plot and humor. I recommend Wolves of the Calla to anyone who likes a good fantasy or science fiction story. I also recommend this book to someone who wants to read an imaginative and original epic. Anyone who wants to read Wolves of the Calla should first read the other books in the series: The Gunslinger (1), The Drawing of the Three (2), The Waste Lands (3), and Wizard and Glass (4).

It is a fantastical recreation of the villagers-enlist-heroes-against-raiders story most famously captured in The Magnificient Seven, The Seven Samurai and !The Three Amigos! In this volume, we get some reward for all of the harrowing adventures endured in the first four novels, seeing our beloved ka-tet in perfect fighting form, seeing them for the Gunslingers that they are. The overall feel is something like a rest and recovery between the high-tension behind us and the high-tension that is certainly ahead.This provides, perhaps, the one real complaint that a reader could have: Wolves is a little slow-going, and especially at first. Readers used to the rip-roaring pace of the first few books might be put off by the Calla-esque sleepiness of the first three quarters of this one, as we get palaver, more palaver and more palaver still. Palaver fans will rejoice.Really, I believe that Wolves allows us to see something that the other novels haven't--Gunslinging in standard operating procedure. As such, it is an important and enjoyable part of the narrative. The overarching story, however, isn't much advanced until the very end which culminates in a series of important and exciting revelations.Of five, I give four stars. A fun Stephen King story and a prelude to the endgame of the Dark Tower series, which should be a barn-burner. Not quite the intensity of The Waste Lands or Wizard and Glass, but by no means bad or disappointing.

I haven't read Homer's works since college and, quite frankly, don't have as much time to decipher the format as I used to. However, I enjoy the actual stories so much that I was anxious to find versions that were easier to read while still interesting. Clarke's books were exactly what I was looking for. I couldn't put either of them down and highly recommend them both."},{"Title":"The Return from Troy","review":"Clarke's The Return from Troy belongs on the bookshelf alongside such Trojan classics as Colleen McCullough's The Song of Troy and Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Firebrand. It is both well written and well told. At times, especially in the novel's first half, I was struck by the beauty of Clarke's words. His talent as a stylist elevates his prose to an artform. The grace and poignance remind me of Mary Renault's historical novels. His retelling of the Odyssey is as much as a psychodrama as an adventure, and some of the themes he unearths--the connection between violence and passion and the guilt of war--haunted me days after finishing the book. One of the points particularly struck me, and I'm surprised that I never thought of it before after reading so much about Troy. In Odysseus's words: \\"You mean that Agamemnon and the others fought for all those years to bring home another man's faithless wife, only to find themselves betrayed by their own wives while they were gone?\\" I'm still contemplating the irony and significance in that statement.To be honest, I think that the first half of the novel is much stronger than the second half. Once Odysseus meets Circe and Calypso, the novel delves deeper into psychodrama, and although the ideas are interesting, the prose and story progression lose steam. I also consider Clytaemnestra to be a strong character, and the novel suffers when she makes her exit. Furthermore, I think that the volume of narration and exposition is sometimes overwhelming: Perhaps a better balance of narration, dialogue, and action would have been more effective.These quibbles are minor and do not detract from my high opinion of Clarke's novel. I hope that he continues to write historical/mythic fiction."},{"Title":"The Return from Troy","review":"The story covers Odysseus' return from Troy and the aftermath in a way it could realistically have happened.

This man is Gabriel Oak, a small time shepherd trying to gain his independance as a farmer. In his quest for independance he meets Bathsheba Everdene, a very pretty young woman, and falls instantly in love. On a whim he goes and askes Miss Everdene for her hand in marriage, eventhough he has barely known her for a week. She rejects farmer Oak's proposal. The next week Batsheba moves away to a far away town. Eventhough he is rejected by Miss Everdene he vows that he will always love her, and being the honest man that he is Oak did exactly that. Not long after Miss Everdene's rejection Oak finds himself in financial ruin. A young, inexperienced sheep dog that farmer Oak owns, carelessly chases all two hundred of Oak's sheep off of a cliff killing them. After this devestating blow Oak sells everything that he owns and moves away in search of new work. On the road to finding new work Oak happenes upon a small structure that is on fire. Oak immeaditly jumps into action to help save the surrounding structures from also burning to the ground. After he has accomplished this good deed Oak Finds out that the owner of the buildings he has just saved is no other than Miss Bathsheba Everdene. He also finds out that she is now the mistress of a large estate on which these buildings are located. In his desperate situation he askes Miss Everdene if she would like to hire a shepherd and out of her thankfulness she gives Oak a job. Oak continues to work for Miss Everdene through good times and bad, he is very faithful to her. Even after Miss Everdene marries a man that is less than good Oak's good nature and love for Miss Everdene forces him to stay by her side. Through Oaks good nature and honesty he earns the respect of all his neighbors and Bathsheba's farm prospers with his help. In being honest and good does farmer Oak earn Bathshebas love? Does Honesty really pay off? To learn the answers to these questions you will have to read this wonderful novel.Thomas Hardy spares no expense in developing the characters in this delightful novel. Reading it made me feel as if I really knew the characters and I identified with most of them. His sense of depth and detail really brought the book to life. Although some things were too detailed and a bit boreing this book is definatly worth the time. A great story."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Few literary settings are more distinctive than Thomas Hardy's Wessex, a hilly, chalky, bucolic quilt of pastures and villages occupying the southwest of England, its residents sworn to the immutable cultural traditions of centuries long past. But it is not the goal of &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; to be merely a sentimental portrait of a region for which Hardy has a great affection, but a grandiose drama about the eventual union of a man and the woman he loves. In summary, Hardy does accede to a Happily Ever After ending, but how he gets to this point is why his novel deserves to be read.It's not surprising that the novel was originally attributed to George Eliot because the protagonist, Gabriel Oak, as the novel's moral anchor, is very similar in character to Eliot's Adam Bede. Oak is trying to make a living on his own as a farmer, but a stroke of bad luck compels him to take a job as a shepherd for a beautiful young woman named Bathsheba Everdene who has recently inherited her uncle's farm and commands a large number of workers and servants. Oak iconically personifies the rustic setting, not only because of his surname but because of the intimacy with which he communes with nature, and his fondness for playing the flute seems designed to evoke an image of Pan.Oak has an awkward history with Bathsheba -- he had known her before her windfall, but in her independent spirit she spurned his love. As the head of Weatherbury farm, however, she can't get by on her independence alone, and she needs Oak's expertise in ensuring her sheep are healthy and fit for wool production. Her romantic attention turns toward a profligate soldier named Francis Troy who, through an unlikely error, has just barely avoided wedding Fanny Robin, one of the Weatherbury servants. Bathsheba's eventual marriage to Troy breaks the hearts of Oak and another rival, a neighboring farmer named Boldwood whose affections she had once teased and whose obsessive nature erupts at a most climactic moment in the novel.The plot developments are a flamboyant display of contrivance, but Hardy masters his devices so well it's impossible not to go along with him for the ride. As an example, consider the jilted Fanny who is so weary from sickness that she has to use a dog as a crutch to get to her destination where she finally dies; not until Hardy reveals what's written on the lid of her coffin do we (and Oak) realize the role Troy played in her death. Likewise, Troy's impulsive reaction to this incident seems like a purposely destructive measure that intends to stir even more turbulence into the story.A large part of Hardy's appeal is his prose, which maximizes the value of a mastery of language; his sentences are like finely cut gems that demand to be held up to a light and studied for their craftsmanship. I believe that Hardy is the consummate novelist; he approaches the art of the novel as a painter looks upon a canvas, a weaver upon a tapestry, a composer upon an opera -- as the supreme representation of man in harmony with nature and in conflict with fate."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Want to leave for England without ever heading for the airport? Well, Hardy's &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; is for you. Hardy brilliantly portrays England and creates his imaginary town of Wessex, England. While reading, you'll notice the rolling hills and the bright green pastures that only England has to offer. Scenery is not the only element Hardy invents, his characters seem to live and breath just as you and I. They are so much alive, in fact, that you feel like shaking Bathsheba into making her realize that Gabriel Oak is the only one for her. However, like all of Hardy's novels, they include dispair, hatred, and love. &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; has an interesting twist though! Unlike most of Hardy's works, &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; ends happily, but only after much dispair and feelings of hopelessness."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The story takes place in rural part of England at the end of 19th century. Beautiful country and good description of many people peacefully living there are great background for love story of Bathsheba Everdene and Gabriel Oak. During the story they both changed very much. At the beginning she is very haughty and arrogant, but becomes delicate and tolerant. Gabriel is at the beginning of the story very tactless and even rude, but very soon becomes loyal and devoted. These changes make possible that those two young people fall in love. And Hardy could write in such a way that every reader can feel that this love is very deep."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This is a wonderful classic for many reasons. But, I urge you not to read this edition, because the notes are terrible! There are notes for things that are obvious, and a lack for those things which need them. The worst offense, however, is that one of the notes (which readers are likely to check, as it gives background on a forgotten song sung by one of the main characters) gives away not only the important action of that short chapter, but also gives away the main line of the story. Awful, awful editing..."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"In Far from the Madding Crowd, Thomas Hardy introduces us to the precarious &quot;love square&quot;. At the core of all the turmoil is beautiful farm girl, Bathsheba Everdene - spirited, vain, intelligent and adept at toying with the hearts of men. Inevitably beguiled by her charms a humble and kind farmer, Gabriel Oak, fervently attempts to win Bathsheba's affections. Enter the competition: (suitor#2) Farmer Boldwood - a wealthy and temperate middle-aged man respected in the community, eventually plunges into maniacal obsession at the mere possibility of making the beloved Miss Everdene his wife; and (suitor#3) Sergeant Francis Troy - a dashing young philandering soldier, with his share of inner demons, ruthlessness and vanity, vies for Bathsheba's hand in marriage. Bathsheba's ultimate decision, and the cataclysm it evokes, lies at the epicenter of Hardy's unforgettable ambivalent story.Far from the Madding Crowd, Thomas Hardy's fourth novel, saw publication in 1874 and earned him widespread popularity as a writer. A delicately woven tale of unrequited love and regret, set in the mid-19th century, Far From the Madding Crowd is a masterpiece of pure story-telling. Hardy's classic style is a pleasure to read as he masterfully brings his characters and their dealings to life. I would not hesitate to say it definitely captured my heart as another favourite."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This book was a required read for Academic Decathalon but I was handed the cliff notes and told to study them if I didn't have time to read the book. I dislike cliff notes unless I have already read a book and I need to review so I chose to listen to it on tape. I was thoroughly surprised to find myself laughing at the overly-honest Gabriel Oak proposing marriage to Bathsheba Everdene, I had been informed that this book was something of a rural comedy but I had not expected such preposterous situations and ironies. The novel centers around Bathsheba though I would not label her the heroine because the reader is often frustrated by her behavior and even annoyed by it. She is quite poor but a smart girl and a particularly beautiful one as well. Gabriel meets her and soon decides he must marry this young woman. She declines deciding that she can't love him and soon moves away. Gabriel loses his farm in an unfortunate event and through circumstance comes to be in the same part of Wessex as Bathsheba. She has inherited her uncle's farm and is now running it herself and she is in need of a sheperd and sheperding happens to be Gabriels forte so he is hired. Farmer Boldwood who runs the neighboring farm becomes smitten with Bathsheba too when he recieves a prank valentine saying \\"marry me\\" on the seal(this valentine was sent by Bathsheba and her maid/companion). He soon asks for Bathsheba's hand and Bathsheba who feels guilty for causing this man's desire says she will answer him upon his return in two months time. The union with Boldwood is not to be since Bathsheba falls deeply in love with Frank Troy and soon marries him. An ex-girlfriend of Troy's shows up but dies shortly after giving birth, Troy is heartbroken and tells Bathsheba that he loved Fanny more and still does. Troy leaves and soon is assumed dead but is truly only missing. Boldwood moves in one Bathsheba again but in a set of bizarre events Troy returns to take Bathsheba from Boldwood once more. Boldwood is infuriated and turmoil ensues. This is an escapist novel in these times and is well worth reading. Weatherbury and Casterbridge will charm you and allow you to experience the little oddities of Victorian Era rural life in the pleasantest way imaginable."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This is a review of the Kindle version of the Oxford University Press edition of this book.Far from the Madding CrowdThe book itself is fine. However, the font style and formatting used by the Oxford press is really unattractive, and there is no way to change the font style. You can change the size of the font but not the actual font style itself. It is a very old style and looks like something from the 1800s. I'm sure this was fine for printed books in the 1800s, but it looks horrible on a Kindle 2 screen in the 2000s. Come on Oxford, when you convert your books to an e-reader format, you need to put some thought into how the work will be displayed on e-readers. When given a choice, I always use the Oxford edition of classics, but for this book I switched over to the Penguin edition just because of the way the work is displayed on the Kindle 2 screen.

We are transported to rural England in the 1850s, to share the seasons with the folk of Hardy's Wessex.We follow Bathsheba Everdene as she grows into a woman, meeting and discarding her three suitors. Heartache and joy are in store for all the characters throughout this process.Hardy's descriptive methods are sometimes difficult, but always complete and rewarding. The characters are beautifully brought to life, and you are forced to share their emotions with them.I look forward to reading my next installment of this classic author."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Have you ever read a book, and thought that no-one in 100 years will understand it? Or have you ever read an old book and not fully understood it? If you have, then this book is one for you. It has at least one character that everyone can relate to, from the pure hearted Gabriel, to the JR-like Troy, and everyone in-between. The basic story is simple, 3 guys, one girl, with the one who loves her the most, &quot;beneath&quot; her, and the one who loves her the least, the one she finds herself most attracted to.Hardy describes every little detail of the scenery, so you can picture your surroundings, and then leaves you to figure out the specific occurences of a situation.All in all, an utterly captivating book."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"As classics go, Thomas Hardy's \\"Far From the Madding Crowd\\" is mediocre. That is, it is better than some. But not nearly as good as others. As is often the case with classics, the motives and emotions of the main characters aren't fully developed in a way that makes their actions understandable to the reader. As a result, they tend to be a little flat.In this book, for instance, both Boldwood and Gabriel Oak persist in loving Bathsheba over the years, despite how she has treated them and despite knowing how badly she has treated the other. Both of them wish to marry her for the duration of the book even though there are no redeeming qualities in her that would make a normal, healthy man want to marry her (except for being beautiful, of course). Their mindless devotion to her made no sense to me.The strength of this novel is in its plot and in the conflicts between the various characters. The narrator, also, was excellent and added much to the story.All in all, I enjoyed this story for the classic that it is, but it is not one I will ever listen to again."},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","review":"A good love story with a number of different subplots to keep the story exciting.

Even worse, if there's no way to clean up a line in translation, he simply leaves it untranslated. Take this example from poem 16:You read of those thousand kisses.You deduced an effeminacy there.You were wrong. Sodomites. Furius & Aurelius.Pedicabo et irrumabo vos.While I'll admit, that last line's difficult to translate into English without using slang usually confined only to gay porn, the translator doesn't even have the stomach to attempt it. In my humble opinion, anyone willing to translate everything EXCEPT for the dirty bits has no business translating at all."},{"Title":"The Poems of Catullus, Bilingual edition","review":"This is a blisteringly vitriolic, tawdry, funny and love-induced forray into modern poesy. The catch is that it was written by an ancient Roman poet. Although his historical background is a bit sketchy, it is believed that the poet was an established member of Rome's high culture and a son of wealth who had even come in contact with the great Caesar. One would never know this from the bawdy lyrics or the heart-wrenching songs one rarely equates with the unfeeling elite.51Godlike the man whosits at her side, whowatches and catchesthat laughterwhich (softly) tears meto tatters: nothing isleft of me, each timeI see her,...tongue numbed; arms, legsmelting, on fire; drumdrumming in ears; head-lights gone black.CodaHer ease is your sloth, Catullusyou itch & roll in her ease:former kings and citieslost in the valley of her arm.As is evidenced in the above selection, Catullus was one of the great love poets of his or any age. These often beautiful and forlorned sentiments were mostly written for \\"Lesbia\\", a woman believed to have been married to a diplomat or some man of high rank whom Catullus never fully ensnarled with his wit and passion but seemingly had a long-tryst and/or tumultuous affair with.But just as soon as you think that Catullus is E. E. Cummings you are shocked into the realization that this man was as multi-faceted and prone to \\"juvenilia\\" and sensationalistic raunchiness as say a Bukowski or Ginsberg.88What, Gellius, of the manwho itches with sister & mothernaked in night-vigils,who 'lies-in' for his uncle,what stain does he lay on himself?Such, that not Tethys to far limitsno Ocean, father of Nereids, can cleanse:no fouler brand (Gellius)even supposingone were to lower his head to his own loinsand swallow himself.Just as well he could be straight-laced and political and silently thoughtful in the same way as he was exuberant and confessional.93Utter indifference to your welfare, Caesar,is matched only by ignornace of who you are.102If, Cornelius, we entrust our secretsonly to those whom we know we can trust,here is Catullus,devoted to secrets & secrecya finger ever to his lips,as mute as Harpocrates!Another aspect of these translations by Peter Whigham, as witnessed above in \\"51\\", is the tendency to modernize the poems and language. \\"head-lights gone black.\\" is one such example. Some scholars(http://www.classics.und.ac.za/reviews/94-2whig.html) say this is to their detriment as are Whigham's liberties with words being fitted to his artistic credo moreso than the original Latin texts. I'm no scholar, but have read several different translations thought to be more true to the original Latin and I must say that they are tedious and rubbery bores. They hold none of the lively magic or smart humor of the Whigham translations. To read the others is like reading Nietzsche by any translator other than Walter Kaufmann, you lose a bit of the modern scholarship and interpretation and lively poetry for stale accuracy's sake.This is one of the few books I have used to excess, marking, creasing and breaking the spine open searching and re-learning these invaluable and poignant texts. Behind Jeffers, no poet other than Catullus is revered more by me."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Book of English Verse","review":"Bought this book on request for my husband's 91st birthday.....

Chemistry students are notorious for having an underdeveloped math and physics background for physical chemistry. This is in part due to the majority of chemistry programs not requiring the average chemistry student to take a course concerning classical mechanics. Therefore, Anderson's book covers the essentials in understanding orthogonal functions, linear algebra, and classical mechanics. The book's central goal is to establish a good foundation in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.However, in my honest opinion, this book is only for the advanced undergraduate in chemistry. The text uses the standard bracket notation, so it can be confusing to the novice. Also, it is not necessary to have a complete understanding of Hamiltonian mechanics to appreciate the level of quantum mechanics learned in the average junior level physical chemistry class. However, if you wish to pursue a graduate career in physical chemistry or chemical physics, then this book is recommended simply because it is both informative and affordable. It is quite thorough, but if you wish to see more applications than I recommend picking up a copy of Thornton and Marion's 'Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems'."},{"Title":"Mathematics for quantum chemistry","review":"There are many books out there, even books that are supposedly introduction to Quantum Mechanics, that jump right into the physical concepts without a thorough mathematical introduction. There are several books (such as Mcquarie's \\"Physcial Chemistry: a molecular approach\\" ) that have pre-chapter reviews of math concepts before every chapter, however most of the pre-chapter math reviews already assume that you have a thorough mathematical background before hand and in McQuarie's case, the math pre-chapters can be just as confusing.This book, is absolutely wonderful in that it fills in the gap that most quantum mechanics books leave out in their discussion of \\"why do we do this mathematically\\" or \\"how do we do this mathematically\\" discussion. Just by reading the first couple of pages, you can see that the author tries to explain Qm concepts in simple words that those who have never encountered advanced mathematical terms can easily grasp with examples that is scattered throughout the text. Just because this book is easy to understand does not mean that it is shallow and incomplete, on the contrary this book is quite thorough in its discussion of the fundamental concepts used in QM (mechanics, vector spaces, hamiltonians, etc.).It is NOT essential for a student taking QM to have this book, but it is certainly a big plus to have this by your side whenever you encounter some difficult concepts in QM. This is an elegantly written book with plenty of examples that will definitely help anyone studying QM or doing advanced studies in this field"},{"Title":"Mathematics for quantum chemistry","review":"You should use this book with \\"Quantum Chemistry\\" by Ira N.

Both humans and the higher animals have a mental life of sensation, thought, purpose, desire, and belief. Although these mental states in part cause, and are caused by, brain states, they are distinct from them. Richard Swinburne argues that we can only make sense of this interaction by supposing that mental states are states of a soul, a mental substance in interaction with the body. Although both have a rich mental life, human souls, unlike animal souls, are capable of logical thought, have moral beliefs, have free will, and have an internal structure (so that their beliefs and desires are formed largely by other beliefs and desires inhering in the soul). Professor Swinburne concludes that there is no full scientific explanation available for the evolution of the soul, and almost certainly there never will be. For this revised edition Professor Swinburne has taken the opportunity to strengthen and expand his book to take account of developments in this area of philosophy since the first edition. He adds a prolegomenon and seven new appendixes, in addition to minor revisions of the main text. Richard Swinburne has been Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion at the University of Oxford, and a Fellow of Oriel College, since 1985. He is a Fellow of the British Academy."},{"Title":"The Evolution of the Soul","review":"A very detailed (This is a book that spends 15 pages describing \\"sensations.\\")and fairly advanced description of dualism.

Dake is particularly strong in his critique of the classical Christian idea from Paul that we keep on sinning no matter what we do. Dake sides with John 1 in opposition to Paul's idea that sin continues on and on even after the rebirth in Christ and continuing sanctification through Christ. Dake does not believe that Christians should be given the green light to continue sinning even when consecrated into the Holy Spirit and sanctified. Paul was referring to man in the natural and not saved man when he wrote about the body's continuous need to sin.In addition, his gap theory of two floods, developed in his other book, is superb, masterful, and accurate. He offers the only way science can be reconciled with faith. He offers the way for Christians to believe in the bible and Christ in the light of evolutionary theory.

First of all, I can easily see how it was written; while doing the research for the Endurance the author undoubtedly kept coming across references to Mrs. Chippy in all of the diaries and ship logs she was reading and thought it would make a good story of its own. Thus, although the journal itself is fictional the account still has the raw feeling and detail of a true primary document. Second, Chippy and his relationships with his Mate, Blackborow and the other crew members are incredibly endearing--a very fine cat indeed!--and it's not hard to believe that his presence would be a source of comfort to the crew in those difficult circumstances. Mrs. Chippy deserves his own memorial. I only wish he'd completed his journey! Thumbs up to the author for giving Chippy the credit he deserves!"},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"This book is very cute and has notes and thought from the ships' crew on the polar bound expedetion. The photographs were quite good and it was interesting the dynamics of the whole ship and the crew.The ending is very sad though, they have to abandon the ship and trek across the ice so Shackleton orders several of the sled dogs pup and the cat shot and killed. (she could have rode in the sled.) Harry McNish felt the loss of the cat most profoundly and he was wrote up for discipline problems later. When he died they place a bronze cat on his grave in honor of Mrs. Chippy."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"It was a very interesting journal from Mrs. Chippy's perspective. A very easy read, but not a kids book. Great for those interested in the expedition."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"Mrs Chippy's Last Expedition is an entertaining story of Ernest Shackletons journey to Antarctica as told from the perspective of the true-life on board cat who was named Mrs. Chippy. The story is told in journal form and will delight cat lovers with a keen view of the adventure as only a cat would see things. Caroline Alexander does an excellent job of capturing the intelligence and demeanor of cats as in this passage. &quot;The dogs were barking like mad... i suspect they are bewildered much of the time by what goes on around them.&quot; Entertaining for both cat lovers and as an adjunct to any book on the true Shackleton adventure. I highly recommend Alfred Lansings account Endurance: Shackletons Incredible Voyage although Caroline Alexander herself also wrote a serious account after this Mrs Chippy cat diary version. Giving it 3 1/2 stars....4+ if you are a cat lover."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"Let me first say that this book was given to me as a marvelously thoughtful gift after I put my cat to sleep. The giver, knowing how much I like reading about Scott, Franklin and Shackleton, discovered this marvelous little book about a cat on Shackleton's famous South expedition. It was amazingly thoughtful.HOWEVER, this is a better book to give to an expedition enthusiast and cat lover whose cat is still living. Even then, the reader is bound to cry. The reader who has just put their beloved cat to sleep is going to cry her heart out."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"**SPOILER**Just so you know, Mrs. Chippy does not make it out of the adventure. The book does not cover this, but if you have inquisitive kids, they might find the actual story quite distressing.On the last page, Mrs. Chippy ponders what adventures tomorrow will bring her. Sorry to say Mrs. Chippy, tomorrow you and the sled dogs get shot (but unlike them, at least you don't become stew)."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"An excellent book for cat lovers reading it in their warm beds. Unfortunately it has to be added that when Shackleton started the journey on the ice &quot;he ordered the destruction of useless animals. That included McNeish\`s cat, Mrs Chippy, and Sirius, a favourite pup of Macklin\`s.&quot; see: Huntford: &quot;Shackleton&quot; page 458"},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"I am amazed that this book pretends that Mrs. Chippy actually witnessed any of these events. Mrs. Chippy, along with several dogs, was killed when Shackleton began his journey on the ice. I am glad I read Endurance first, so I was saved from believing such a story, no matter how heartmwarming. It was a cute story, no doubt, but misleading in that in purports to be truer than it really is.I am a cat lover, but, to all of you who think this REALLY happened (as I see from some of the reviews), it did not! Just keep this in mind."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"Although it's apparent Ms. Alexander did considerable research on Sir Ernest Shackleton's 'Endurance expedition,' little of it has made it to the pages of this slight volume. Instead, Ms. Alexander has anthropomorphic inclinations. In her diary, Mrs Chippy converses with Shackleton, Frank Wild and Captain Worsley, reflects of the sailors' lot, Percy Blackborrow's kindness, Frank Hurley's temperament and Thomas Hans Orde-Lees curious personality. The reader is continually reminded of Mrs Chippy's &quot;redoubtable powers&quot; which always put him one step ahead of the ship's scientists in powers of intuition and observation. Otherwise Mrs Chippy cleans his whiskers (the crew inadvertantly named the male cat Mrs. Chippy), stands watch on the rail, sleeps, eats, and sleeps again. And, that's about it. One would think that, being the &quot;erstwhile explorer,&quot; Chippy would tell us how he learned to write. Alas, it is not to be. But, since he did take to recording his observations, how did he miss such notable events as the &quot;Antarctic Sweepstakes,&quot; a sledge race won by Frank Wild, or the Midwinter's celebration of June 22, 1915? He must have been snoozing. Perhaps this is why the book is listed as fiction. It should further be regarded as juvenile."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"This book is NOT precious--cat fanciers will find Alexander's narrative about how an intelligent cat views things to be one of the best, most balanced, and yet non-syrupy writings on this subject to date. Everyone else might actually learn something about the affect cats have on people, in this case some hard bitten explorers in a stressful situation most of us can't imagine.Knowing the overall context of this story (Mrs Chippy was shot at 2:55pm the day after her &quot;journal&quot; ends on Shakleton's orders prior to an aborted dog sled attempt to reach land) makes this story haunting, even tragic. But, it also shows how an event now considered triumphant (the crew's return unharmed) is fraught with little tragedies along the way. That is what makes this story haunting and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the best books I've read in my 42, book-filled years. Although it was a little hard to read the last few pages through the strange veil of water that seemed to fill my eyes, I simply cannot recommend this story highly enough. We could all learn a lot from Mrs. Chippy, an Explorer like no other."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"A great book that doesn't try to fool anyone. The story of Mrs. Chippy might be described as the cat lover's version of \\"Old Yeller.\\" Although the ending is a bit of a tearjerker for those who know what ultimately befell Mrs. Chippy, I still recommend that you read this to your kids at night as a bedtime story or in the car on long road trips."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"Sheesh, this book is not a kleenex fest in terms of how it's written and the way the story in the book is portrayed. Yes, all of us know what happened to Mrs Chippy, that's what brings the tears but if you judge this book solely as a story, it's a knock out.Ever read \\"The Silent Miaow\\" by Paul Gallico? He's better known for writing the Posieden Adventure. The Silent Miaow is about his cat and Alexander's portrayal of Mrs Chippy is definitely in that school.Great book. If you like cats and are fascinated by their behavior, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"Wonderful story for cat lovers and Shackleton's story. Tells the story from a different lense, that of the animals on board. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"You have to have a sense of humor to enjoy this lovely little book. My husband and I read this book out loud to each other as we were driving long distance across the American West on vacation a few years ago. My husband did an excellent job of impersonating Mrs. Chippy with a very proper British accent. It was hilarious. Now our cats at home have adopted Mrs. Chippy's mannerisms and critique the behavior of our dog as 'savage,' also with British accents. Apparently we were easily influenced by this book. We had to pull over to the side of the road when we got to the last page, though, because we were both sobbing so hard. I already knew what happened to Mrs. Chippy but it didn't make the ending any easier. I am now looking forward to reading \\"Me,Cheeta: My life in Hollywood.\\""},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Throughout the book, you learn about the men on the Endurance, what their characters were like, and what life was like on the ship, all from the point of view of a cat.Of course, the ending is sad, but Caroline Alexander does not dwell on the details of Mrs Chippy's demise.This story will appeal to many, animal lovers like myself, history buffs, and anyone interested in seeing how man handles himself in times of great stress."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"This tale filled in more gaps in my knowledge about Antarctic travels. I'm unfailingly impressed by the endurance and optimism of those who journey in these harsh regions, particularly in the early part of the century. It is a well told tale and I enjoyed it although I still feel a sense of shock about the end, while accepting the pragmatism it does set off trains of thought about the use humans make of animals and the wider consequences of polar exploration. Mrs Chippy did play a very important part in the trek and deserves acclaim."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"All cat lovers will recognize the behavior and thinking of cats so observantly and lovingly depicted in this little gem of a book. It's a cat book, a history book, and an adventure book all in one. Written in diary form, it tells the story of Shackleton's antarctic voyage from the point of view of the expedition's cat, Mrs. Chippy. The expedition, the last of the heroic age of polar exploration, might have been wiped out, as was the Scott expedition a few years before. If only Scott had taken a cat with him, things might just have turned out differently. Somehow, Shackleton's crew survived. Mrs. Chippy, like the men of the expedition, is in many ways just an ordinary cat, not a hero. We read of her (well, actually, it's really his) devotion to ship routine, never missing a meal, always inspecting things and keeping watch, and his comic demonstrations of how a mouse works. Don't skip the footnotes! They are necessary to round out the story's \\"human angle.\\" Caroline Alexander has carefully combed the photographs made during the expedition for traces of Mrs. Chippy. Don't look for digital insertions of Mrs. Chippy where none had existed before, as in Forrest Gump. Instead Ms. Alexander makes a delightful game of inferring Mrs. Chippy's presence. Is that Mrs. Chippy on Page 108? What do you think? My only criticism of this book relates to its ending. Armchair explorers may not be ready for this surprise."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"You know from the beginning that it will end in tears. Why would her/his loving owner take his cat on such a dire journey? But the ending is so beautiful that it redeemed the sadness."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"As criticized by other reviewers, this book does not pretend any falsehoods. It is a fictionalized account, of course, but is based on the accounts and journals of ALL of the crew, not just the famous or the high ranking. The true hardships are recounted in the footnotes, most notably excerpts from the diary of Henry McNeish, Chippy,s owner, bunk mate and ships carpenter. In a way Mrs. Chippy's account, built from references of all the other journals, speaks for those also marginalized and also only known through footnotes. McNeich spent 28 hours toiling in waist deep frigid water to build a coffer dam in an attempt to hold back the water in the beginning of the end for the Endurance. Do we remember his name? Perce Blackborow, young and desperate for adventure, stowed away and worked hard as ships steward, assisted and filled in for the cook when he fell injured. Do we remember his name? Louis Rickinson and A.J. Kerr, ships engineers, worked at the boilers below decks, even as the ice is pressing the hull made all manner of horrible and terrifying noises. Do we remember their names? Through Mrs. Chippy's eyes we catch a glimpse of all the crew, in their bravery and their humanity. Lastly, any who would question the character or depth of relationship between even the hardened explorer and the ships cat, consider the following: Commander Frank Worsley, the Captain of the Endurance, chose the photo of Chippy and Blackborow that adorns the cover of this book as one of the few he published. ALL the diaries of the members of the expedition had descriptions of Chippy. Let me close with this quote from the poet Christopher Smart from his ode to his cat, Jeoffry:For he keeps the Lord's watch in the night against the adversary. For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes. For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.We are shielded from Chippys final fate, the journal ends on October 29th. Chippy perished that afternoon. Remember Chippy, and remember all those whose story is recorded in footnotes."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Adventure is the best-written book I have read in many years (and I read a LOT!) The book is written from the point of view of Mrs. Chippy, a (male) cat who was privileged enough to join Shackleford's Polar expedition in the early 1900's and who was stranded in the polar ice fields along with the remaining 28 crew members. The book is based on actual events and a great deal of research obviously went into the telling of this remarkable human and feline-interest story. The author captures Mrs. Chippy's world view remarkably well; cat lovers will KNOW that they are seeing these events unfold through the eyes of a very perspicacious cat. As an added bonus, Mrs. Chippy is a damn funny feline, albeit sometimes unintentionally - I laughed out loud throughout the book."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"You've read the tale of the Endurance and you can't get enough of this incredible epic. You must now read 'Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition'. Ms. Alexander, in a delightfully strange manner, has provided a unique perspective on both the expedition and on the relationship between a cat and its mates. If you read 'The Endurance', you already appreciate Ms. Alexander's scholarly and literary abilities. (Frankly, it easily rivals the accounts of Lansing and even Shackleton, himself.) When you read 'Mrs. Chippy', you will also appreciate her profound perception of both feline and human behavior. It's a pity that other reviewers feel they must exhibit their knowledge of Mrs. Chippy's actual fate, but don't worry, if you love cats, nothing can prepare you for the end of this book. Thank you, Caroline Alexander, for a truly remarkable story."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. However, I think it's obvious that any review of it must take into account that while the story takes place in actual historical context, the book's literary content, being the journal of a domesticated cat, is clearly fabricated. I find it humorous that several reviewers seem to have forgotten this and have criticized it for being somehow unrealistic.The book is a journal of the Endurance's carpenter's cat, Mrs. Chippy (apparently, ships' carpenters are often nicknamed &quot;Chips&quot;). We learn that Mrs. Chippy took his responsibilities as an explorer, including keeping a stern watch to monitor the ship's progress, helping his mate in carpentry projects, and mousing, quite seriously. In fact, Chippy's concern for the maintenance of ship routine through the monotony of the shipwreck period surpasses that of virtually any other crew member.If you've read any account of the Endurance Expedition already, you will quite likely enjoy this book for its thoughtful alternative perspective. It is not sappy in the least - Chippy's intelligent writing allows us to see him as he sees himself: as the 29th crew member on the expedition.If you have to ask, &quot;how did Chippy learn how to write?&quot; or &quot;when did he find the time?&quot;, you're not appreciating the books purpose - to entertain and provide a little insight into how an animal might have been more than slightly responsible for maintaining the crew's sanity."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"Let me first say that this book was given to me as a marvelously thoughtful gift after I put my cat to sleep. The giver, knowing how much I like reading about Scott, Franklin and Shackleton, discovered this marvelous little book about a cat on Shackleton's famous South expedition. It was amazingly thoughtful, except the giver had no idea what happened on the South Expedition.Now, I must confess to dunderheadedness in reading this book the minute I received it. I knew what happened. Still, thanks to Alexander's marvelous writing I so fell in love with the indomitable spirit of Mrs. Chippy that I fully expected Alexander would fudge the story a bit and take Mrs. Chippy along. Mrs. Chippy meets her fate with grace and dignity -- as peacefully as my beloved cat. It's not horrible, not maudlin, but very emotional.This is definitely a better book to give to an expedition enthusiast and cat lover whose cat is still living. Even then, the reader is bound to shed a tear or two. The reader who has just put their beloved cat to sleep is going to cry her heart out."},{"Title":"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Boun","review":"I can't wrest myself away from this book's haunting effect on me.The author has graciously given us entre to the interior terrain of a powerful little persona -- an intrepid little (in size only) soul.

If you have ever lived with a cat, you can see exactly what she is talking about.We also got \\"South\\" by Shackelton.

Incredibly, the ship was crushed after 9 months trapped in the ice, but not a single man was lost. Mrs. Chippy (the cat who accompanied the crew of the Endurance to Antarctica) leads us on an examination, not just of history and brave explorers, but of day-to-day survival and interaction between men in dire circumstances. If you love cats and have a curiosity about Antarctic exploration, this is a great book to start your journey. One must, however, have patience with the 100-plus footnotes, as they are a slightly awkward part of the story that enable one to understand the big picture behind the journal of this extraordinary feline.\\"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition\\", though it is light and high-spirited, tells a vivid tale which stands in the same compelling league as Jon Krakauer's, \\"Into the Wild\\". Both left me in awe of nature and wringing my handkerchief by books' end."},{"Title":"Mobile Robotics: A Practical Introduction (Applied Computing)","review":"This is a very good introductory book on mobile robots. It assumes no background of the readers in the subject. Chapter 3 provides a introduction to the hardwared aspects including sensors and actuators. Chapter 4 on machine learning by robots is also very very interesting. The case studies presented in chapter 5 and 6 will be very much useful to the new-entrants of this discipline. Chapter 7 on analysis of robot behaviour is important for the researchers working in the discipline.I like the book for its simplicity in presentation and direct reference to the points to be discussed, rather than providing a lengthy introduction to the topics.

I don't know if Sophia is a real witch or not. It would hard for me to imagine her as one after reading this book. It's fluff. Offensive, unethical fluff. Worse yet, Christians in my community are holding this book against real witches and Wiccans as a perfect example of how we are &quot;casting evil spells&quot; on them. This book is a huge set back for those who follow the Goddess. I would never ever cast a spell for someone else without asking permission first, and only then if it were for healing or very positive purposes. To leave a book on your desk to make your co-workers nervous would be unethical for most witches and just serves to reinforce faulty, scary ideas about witchcraft. Witchcraft is not about revenge or hokey Hollywood powers but about getting in touch with Deity through nature. If this author really is a witch, then she has sold out her sisters' cause, in my opinion, for commercial gain. I find that heinous."},{"Title":"School for Scandal By Richard Brinsley S (Master Guides S.)","review":"Nice book, but not one I would normally choose to spend my summer reading and especially not comparing it to another book!

She reminded me of Jane Austen's Emma. She spent most of the book telling others what to do and complaining to herself when they wouldn't listen. Her way was the only and she didn't understand why some people wouldn't listen to her. I kept waiting for her to get her comeuppance and when she did, it didn't seem to sink in - she wasn't as afraid as she should have been. The whole time I was pleading for someone to finally tell her to stuff it, but, sadly, no one did.It was told through her perspective only, so there's no way of knowing the hero's thoughts, which was a let down, 'cause I'm dying to know why on earth the hero loved her. I still can't stand her. They meet on board a ship and the book starts halfway through the voyage. It would have been nice to learn of their initial meeting and impressions and all that.Happily, it's a clean book with no sex, graphically described or otherwise. Thank you for that. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"This was an entertaining little romance! I enjoyed it quite a bit. A fun, PG- Victorian romance.

I liked Princess Diaries but the same problems that I had with those books are the same ones that I had with this one. Victoria is stuck up, snooty, and has a very large nose which she manages to poke into everybody's business. Jacob Carstairs isn't, in actuality, that bad, and while Victoria comes to realize it in the end, it is annoying to listen to her ranting and obsessing about all the little problems she sees.All in all, I didn't really care for this one. I would suggest some of the others in the Avon True Romance series like: Samantha and the Cowboy or Tess and the Highlander."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I really loved this book. The characters are vivid and the storyline is solid. At times I thought that Victoria, the lead female character, was a little annoying but she's a kind and decent person, which makes up for her bossiness. I'd definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I was surprised with the knowledge Meg Cabot has, knowing about India and how London was in the 1800's.In the story, Victoria the main character, was raised by her uncles in India and she is now returning home to London to find a husband. On the shop ride she becomes engaged to an Earl, but the annoying Captain Carstairs has been going out of his way to ruin her fun. Captain Jacob Carstairs goes as far as talking to Victoria's Aunt and Uncle to have the wedding called off. Stubborn Victoria refuses to listen and abide by what others tell her. Instead she arranges others lives and soon learns the life she needs to organise the most is her own."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"If you like plucky heroines, who can't seem to stay out of trouble, you're in for a treat with this book. The conflict and eventual romance are simply wonderful. This is a great read with unforgettable characters."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"Okay, so this book is not exactly complex or thought-provoking. But, this one is the best of the series. Some of the other ones are dumb or downright corny. At any rate, I found the character development to be best in this book. Also, the chemistry between the two main characters was more emphasized than in other novels. And Victoria, although somewhat snotty and/or naive/stupid at times, actually does some good.Victoria is independent and not interested in poetry like other characters (fortunately). The only thing that really annoyed me was her complaining about Jacob's collar points. That was just dumb. So, if you want to try one of these novels, I would recommend this one. It is definitely the best in the series."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I really did like \\"Victoria and the Rouge\\", Meg Cabot is one of my favorite authors.This book is all about Victoria, a kind of spoiled, bratty girl who gets into people's business but really thinks she is trying to help them. All in all she is a pretty nice girl. And she gets engaged to one of the most prestigious men of London, but he's not all he seems. And then of course there is Captian Carstairs...Overall, this book was great, I would recomend it. The plot was a little slow, not very much was happening for some of the book, but overall, it really is a good read for anyone who wants some humor and a little romance!"},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I think this book was great.

It's the story of a snooty busybody, Victoria, who comes from India to England to live with cousins. She meets and promptly begins arguing with Jacob Carstairs, who is really a great guy in actuality. There were a few good parts, but overall I found Meg Cabot's writing to be predictable and totally unrealistic. I thought Victoria, the heroine, was selfish and meddling. Maybe it's just me, but I thought this book was definitely not a great one."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"This book is perhaps one of the best in the Avon True Romance series. As this was the second book I have read in the series, it is quite promising and prompted me to buy some more! Meg Cabot is an excellent writer with true talent, spunk, and imagination, as seen in her books The Princess Diaries series. I do believe that this is her first attempt to write this kind of a novel, and she has successfully written one. Buy this book (if you haven't already) and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"In this novel, Meg Cabot delivers the plot of a lovely girl during the 1800's who comes from India and moves to England to be with her relations there. Before she even gets to England, she becomes engaged to the dashing Lord Malfrey, who is very charming and attractive.Throughtout the novel we experience the frustration she feels towards Captain Jacob Carstairs and his medling and sarcastic attitude towards \\"Miss Bee\\", aka Victoria, and we see how Victoria's heart changes as an ungly truth reveals itself, while revealing a much more beautiful one. I dont want to spoil the book for anyone reading this, but it is a great book about a girl falling in lvoe with a guy, but the guy turns out to have a bad past, and the annoying twit who the girl hates.....well, she realizes maybe hes worth more than shes given him. Its a great piece and as an avid reader myself i really recommend it and any other books by Meg Cabot/ Jenny Carroll (one of her Pen Names) Hope you enjoy the book as much i did!"},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"This is a GREAT book for the romance deprived teen. Some think that Victoria is snobbish but keep in mind that she fits a time period where a dance was more important that a war! She has the personality of wanting to help make people better and that sorta gets her in to trouble.... This is a Great Book to read.Victoria lets her feelings for one man force her to another.

He is handsome, like Jacob, he is popular and very charming, and he wants to marry Victoria.The big kiss in this book made me blush so hard and feel so good it won me over.

And, being as resourceful as she is, she lands herself an engagement to the perfect Englishman, Hugo Rothschild, the ninth earl of Malfrey, before the ship has even docked in Britain. The only problem, is that there is something that Victoria doesn't completely understand, going on between her and Jacob Carstairs, the ship's captain. Jacob continually meddles in Victoria and Hugo's relationship, and soon Victoria realizes that perhaps she is wrong about her new fiance.Cabot has created yet another spunky, fun character, in her new romance VICTORIA AND THE ROGUE. Teens of today will even be able to relate to some of Victoria's quirky traits, and confusing situations. A must have book for all fans of historical romance novels, and Cabot fans.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I have read about seven of the True Romance Series and I have enjoyed each of them. The characters are well developed, the stories are exciting and the romance is sweet. I like this particular one because Victoria is someone who knows EVERYTHING and then finds out that she does know everything and she needs to be wanted and loved by someone who knows everything about her. It was a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"Victoria Arbuthnot is sixteen years old.

But can she be absolutely positive on that?This, Meg Cabot's second novel for the Avon True Romance series, is just as excellent as Nicola and the Viscount. At first, I could not quite like Victoria's character, but the story gets better as it goes on. Overall, it is a very well written story, and keeps the reader interested. It also has a similar plot like Nicola and the Viscount; people who enjoyed that novel will like this."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I would like to let the readers know that this book which is written by Meg Cabot.

This was definitely a fluff read and I loved every minute of it. The characters were entertaining, there was lots of scandals that kept things interesting. There were romantic moments that me just go \\"awwwwww\\" and then there were moments that made me want to slap the hell out of the main character Vicky for being so prideful.

So i didnt really feel like reading this one. However, i saw it at my local library and i picked it out to read. I loved it! It was much better than the pther book and was funny, interesting and had memorable characters. It's more like Meg Cabot's other books than like the Nicola book. It's enjoyable and funny, so i'd reccomend it to all Meg Cabot lovers. Dont overlook this book just because you didnt like the other historical book. This one's actually good. :)"},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I didn't like this book that much. Victoria was rude and cold, despite the fact that she tries to \\"help\\" people. I wanted to smack her so many times during this book. Plus, her relationship with Jacob was sooo strange, I had no idea what was going through her mind. If you're looking for a good romance, this probably isn't a good pick."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I have read and hated most of the books in this series. I don't know why I even bothered reading most of them, but they looked good. They weren't. This one is the only exception. It was...well, awesome! It does have that everyday romance cliche, but, it was still a little different. It was very well written, unlike the other avon books. I wasn't expecting much from Meg Cabot after my dissapointment with Nicola and the Viscount, but this book was just really good. I can't explain it. A little funny, a little cliche, a little confusion. Perfect!"},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I'm fourteen years old, so I'm not allowed to read a lot of romances.

At first the story gets my attention, but after a while, I started to dislike Vicky, her personality was very snobbish, spoiled and selfish. She took advantage of mens hearts for her own benefit, to match her desires. Because this is the first romance novel I have ever read, I forced myself not to give up. I would defidently not recommend this book, it is not very interesting, and the plot is boring."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"The book Victoria and the Rouge, was an very good book but it was not what I expected it to be. I thought it was to be a great love story. But it was wonderfly written. I felt as if I was back in the 1800 with Victoria. She has a crazy mind and I don't know where she comes up with the things she thinks of. Some parts are perdiciable though.

Since then, she has been raised in India by her uncles, but now that she is sixteen, she has been sent back to England to find a husband. On the long sea journey from India to London, Victoria meets Hugo Rothschild, the ninth early of Malfrey, who proposes to her shortly before the journey's end. Victoria is thrilled with the proposal. But why is Jacob Carstairs, who was also a passenger on the ship, trying to get her to end her engagement? Now that they are in London, why won't he just leave Victoria alone? And why is she even attracted to such an infuriating man as Jacob? And is Hugo hiding a terrible secret? I enjoyed this book even more than Meg Cabot's first Avon True Romance. It had a really good romance and also a good mystery subplot."},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"I really can't believe how good this book was! I was afraid that this would be a cheesy cheap romance with no substance, but I was definitely wrong!This story is about Lady Victoria Arbuthnot, who grew up in India with her uncles after her parents died, and at age 16 travels back to London to live with her aunt's family. On the ship that takes her to London, Victoria meets Lord Malfrey, and he proposes to her on the ship deck after just three months. Victoria accepts, but in part just to make the infuriating and handsome Captain Jacob Carstairs mad. Captain Carstairs is always teasing Victoria with a twinkle in his eye, and always smirks at her, which makes her hate him. Luckily, Victoria thinks she will never have to see him again when she gets off the ship. Unfortunately, Victoria's aunt and her family are great friends with Captain Carstairs, so she'll be seeing plenty of him.Captain Carstairs continually tries to convince Victoria to break her engagement with Lord Malfrey, and not go through with the marriage, because he knows that he is only in it for wealthy Victoria's money. However, Victoria doesn't realize that Carstairs is right; nor does she realize that he is in love with her.Finally Victoria realizes that Jacob Carstairs is telling the truth, and she also realizes how delicious his kisses are, when one night Jacob can't hold in his feelings any longer.This is not the end of the story, however. Fortunately, it is just the beginning, and the Victoria and Jacob don't just end up living happily ever after--yet. There is another big...conflict that occurs that I don't want to give away because it's really interesting.Gosh, there's so many more things I could say about this wonderful book, but I'll just sum everything up by saying that the setting is great (I love historical fiction romances) and really fleshed out; and Victoria and Jacob Carstairs' sort of love/hate relationship, with Jacob's passion for Victoria, is so romantic. *sigh*"},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"Victoria Arbuthnot is shipped off to England to find a husband but she finds herself engaged to the charming and handsome Hugo Rothschild before she even gets off the boat.

Jacob also seems to distrust Victoria's new fianc&eacute;. So, which of these men is Victoria's true love and which is just a rogue?I don't usually read romance books but since I enjoy teen novels I thought I'd give this one a try. Victoria and the Rogue isn't the most thought provoking book I've ever read but it was a more than adequate fun weekend read. Victoria is a bit judgmental but she means well so she not entirely unlikeable. Jacob was also pretty amusing. The ending vas very predictable but that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the book.

Victoria is extremely puzzeled by the young captain's persistantness at getting the engagement cancled and when the truth finally comes to light, earl Malfrey might just not be the perfect person after all.

But now that she is sixteen, her uncles have decided to send her to London to find a husband. And finds a suitor she does, and even before she has arrived in London, she is engaged to Hugo Rothschild, ninth earl of Malfrey, and the perfect English gentleman. Victoria couldn't ask for anything more. Yet there is one thing she would like, to have the young and persistent Captain Jacob Carstairs leave her alone! Jacob is convined that Hugo is not all that he is thought to be, but Victoria has made up her mind, she believes with all her heart that Jacob is the rogue, not her betrothed. But could she be making a mistake?The twelfth and last book of the series, \\"Victoria and the Rogue\\" is an Avon True Romance for teens. And even though this book is first and foremost a romance novel, there is plenty of intrigue, humor, and excitement to entertain a variety of teens.Victoria has got to be in my opinion one of the most interesting characters I've read. She's haughty, a bit unlady-like, a bit innocent, and controlling of other. Doesn't sound much of a character you'd like, huh? But in actuality, her character was for me totally fascinating. As I was reading the book, I kept looking forward to having someone put her in her place and teach her what it means to love.And of course this character is Jacob Carstairs. Absolutely the kind of guy you'd dream about! I thought him very charming (though his collar points is a good two inches belowed the required height, clearly a crime against 1810 London fashion). He's certainly the perfect match for Victoria. I must congratulate Meg Cabot in her style of writing. She's staying with the usual 'formula' for romance novels, yet gives a feeling of experiencing something new.If all the other Avon True Romance novels for teens are anything like \\"Victoria and the Rogue\\", I'm definitely picking up another in the series!"},{"Title":"Victoria and the Rogue","review":"Meet 16 year old wealthy young heiress Lady Victoria Arbuthnot.

I'm sad that this is the last Avon Romance!! tear, tear.In Victoria and the Rogue, Victoria is engaged to Lord Malfrey. He seems just perfect for her, until the sly, handsome Captain Carstairs begins to hint that he isn't right for Victoria.

This is such a book. Markides explains things that I had not understood, and showed me possibilties I had not entertained. Additionally, because the narrator of the tales told to us is, as was Casteneda in the Don Juan books, outside the discipline he is reporting, we see though his initially skeptical eyes, and and hear thouigh his &quot;can this be true?&quot; ears. Thus are we led to feel secure that events have unfolded as they are reported, they can be believed, and may well be part of a new reality we can, ourselves, adopt.

The adventures that she discovers with her pal Honey, as well as her bossy brothers truly bring the story to life, and make the reader feel as if they are accompanying Trixie on her hot and sticky sleuthing missions. These books may have been written over 30 years ago, but even in the year 2006, this series stays strong, and gives readers - whether male or female - a wonderful, independent outlook on Trixie's life, and truly show how the world has changed over the years. The ideal mystery series for your very own amateur detective!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Gatehouse Mystery: Trixie Belden #3","review":"Trixie Belden and Honey Wheeler find a diamond in the abandoned gatehouse at the edge of the Wheelers' property, but someone is trying to get it back. Meanwhile, Trixie's brothers Brian and Mart have returned from camp, meeting Honey and her brother Jim for the first time, so the secret Bob-Whites of the Glen club is ripe for formation.As much trouble as the girls get into, the adults still come off as helpful and intelligent, unlike many other YA mystery series (or even the Harry Potter books).Usually I prefer the Deluxe edition from the 1960s with covers illustrated by Paul Frame, but for this one, check out the edition illustrated by Mary Stevens. One picture shows Trixie and Honey doing some pruning -- with Trixie looking remarkably like Beavis of MTV fame -- and a charming Ashley Judd look-alike picture of Trixie greeting Mart. This book also features the memorable line by Regan, the Wheeler's beloved young groom, \\"Reach for the ceiling, Laughing-Boy.\\""},{"Title":"The Gatehouse Mystery: Trixie Belden #3","review":"When Trixie and Honey go to explore the abandoned gatehouse on Honey's property, they find a diamond pressed into the dirt floor. How did it get there? Is there a gang of thieves in the area? Or did someone bury treasure there long ago? The girls are determined to find out. And with the help of Jim and Trixie's brothers Mart and Brian, they just might.This is easily my favorite book in the series, and I love the entire series. While the mystery plot itself is a little easy to figure out, finding out how Trixie is going to prove it keeps you turning pages. But for me, the best part of this book was character and setting. Trixie, her family and friends, and their surroundings seem so real when reading this book. And the fun and friendship they share has always made me want to be part of the group.Julie Campbell must be given credit for the wonderful way she handles the introduction. A lot happened in the first two books, and new readers will need some of that information to understand character relationships. She does it in an entertaining way that makes it seem part of the story. She also finally introduces Brian and Mart (they've only been mentioned previously) and the new friends form the \\"Bob Whites of the Glen\\" in this book. Frankly, I consider this the last foundational book, even though we still have two more main characters to meet.I've gone back to this book and reread it so many times, I practically have parts memorized. I'm so thrilled to see Random House reprinting the series so that a whole new generation can share the adventures of Trixie and her friends."},{"Title":"The Gatehouse Mystery: Trixie Belden #3","review":"This book must be one of my favorites in the serice.

His writing makes for lively and entertaining theater, but I am afraid I must put myself in the category of not really knowing what the fuss is about. This play was entertaining, and I could see its roots in classic theatrical themes and approaches, but it did not strike me as being a great piece of writing. Certainly in today's politico-artistic environment it would be hard to see an inauthentic work like this being hailed and loved. Brecht's Chinese heroine Shen Te is a hooker with a heart of gold, a kind but foolish young woman who manages to get along by charming everyone. She eventually falls for a loutish young aviator, and their tribulations become the basis for the second half of the plot. The plot has some nice twists and moves along at a very brisk clip. Numerous characters appear and get their due - a couple of unidentifiable gods, a poor water seller, an older shop owner, some freeloaders, etc. There are all sorts of manipulations going on, everyone keeps trying to get an edge on each other. Money changes hands quickly and this becomes the engine of the narrative - Shen Te gets some, opens a shop, does well, then gives it away to the unworthy flyer. Her sweet, happy-go-lucky character is balanced by the presence of her supposed cousin, Shui Ta, a shrewd and tough negotiator who appears at key moments to bail out his relative. How one would effectively pull this off on stage is a bit of a mystery to me, and for that reason alone I would like to see a production of it. Overall, an entertaining play with a humanistic heart, but not a work of genius."},{"Title":"The Good Woman of Setzuan","review":"Well written, talented authors!

Chapter 3 of The Sane Society is a masterpiece in describing what it means to be human and why we are foolish to expect never to be anxious and always to be happy and smiling. This book is an excellent analysis of the situation of modern man and frightening in that the characteristics Fromm cites have become even more ingrained in us. His thesis is that we are inherently anxious due to our consciousness. Unlike animals who have instincts to script their lives from start to finish, we are free to determine ourselves and this freedom without anyone/anything to tell us what choice to make is frightening. We are capable of joy and our culture is capable of being called a good one to the extent that our lives are a reflection of our individual abilities being given expression in our work, our play, our social life and our government. We are happy to the extent that we realize ourselves, or as Fromm puts it, that we give birth to ourselves over our lifetimes. In order for this to occur our society must value the human over the inanimate (property) and that is the downfall of Capitalism. We are in service to the system of production and have become alientated from ourselves and others. We fashion ourselves to be appealing products on the personality market, becoming no more than objects for sale to others. &quot;I am as you want me to be&quot; is our personal creed and our work, our social life, our family life all are disconnected and increasingly unrelated to us in other than materialistic ways. Fromm's prescription is &quot;communitarian socialism&quot; which is a society in which all aspects of life are interelated and dedicated to the advancement of human life rather than material production. He sees the problem and a solution but since this book was written (1955) we have accelerated in the direction he feared. If you doubt that what he says is true, try being out of a job and looking for work. You will find how little what you are is valued and how much the art of selling (no matter what is being sold) or narrow technical knowledge is valued. Things are more securely in the saddle than ever before and we are slaves to a system which promotes more of every&quot;thing&quot; and little of what is human. One example from real life of what Fromm is saying in his book... there was a manager where I once worked whom we called &quot;roboman&quot; because he had no ability to relate to people but was obsessed with work, always busy on 5 projects at once and very competent technically in everything he did, though universally reviled for his disregard of people. He got promoted and now heads the company office in another city. God help his employees. People who manipulate things advance and are highly rewarded as Bill Gates can tell you. People who care for people are passed over. Efficiency is King and humanity has been left in the dust. Remember the ancient Greeks saying that the purpose of society is to further the happiness of it's members? The purpose of our society is to make more things. You and I are out there at the stores frantically buying and that assures that this will continue. Fromm makes the excellent point that those who are successful in society are considered sane, no matter how pathological they might be when viewed from the perspective of what it means to be an integrated, productive human being. As we ever more frantically race to make life ever more frantic, we are forgetting what sanity is in our materialistic frenzy. You can drive from coast to coast across this country of 300 million people and not have contact with another human being except when they pass you a burger at the drive-through. Very efficient but is this isolation that technology promotes good for people? We could all do with a careful reading of Fromm's book."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"I had heard of Erich Fromm for some time but had not read any of his work and then decided I should have a look and see what all the fuss was about. To say the least Fromm does an excellent job of attempting a critique of modern society whether it be western capitalism or eastern communism. He considers the question: is current society sane ? He concludes no and pushes aside the claims of most psychologists that a sane member of society is one who can adjust himself/herself to it. Naturally such a claim means that society itself must be sane. Fromm instead supposes that there are other more objective measures of sanity than the society one is a part of. Such measures were considered by Freud early in the 20th century and led to his idea of the libido which unless satisfied produces insanity and neuroses. Fromm himself studied under Freud in psychoanalysis but came to the conclusion that Freud's ideas, although basically correct in their aims, incorrectly based all of man's behaviour on the libido.Instead Fromm analyses current society, circa 1950's, on the basis of human nature which arises from the human condition, his whole existence. Fromm finds that man has, over the centuries, removed himself from nature (the metaphor of the expulsion from the Garden of Eden) which formed for him the womb and the spiritual connection needed by him. Instead man developed his own world which was formed through the creation of villages and towns and agriculture and some independence from nature as the provider and sustainer. The eventual extreme aspects of this alienation are found in both communism and capitalism as seen today where the individual no longer feels a relatedness to others in the society, an alienation which itself can lead to insanity. The fact that people are capital and not &quot;people&quot; anymore and that their work becomes capital as well which can be interchanged with other forms of capital which have no human base produces ill health and a mentally ill society. This also applies to communism except with the addition of enforced governmental structures. Fromm notes how sanity can only be achieved through changes in all aspects of the human condition at once rather than piecemeal attempts. That is his economical, political, spiritual and social needs must be satisfied at the same time. He contrasts earlier centuries to the modern one and how a capitalistic view imposes uniformity even under the illusion of individuality.From attempts some way out of this crisis through what he calls &quot;communitarian socialism&quot; which applies directly and concretely to an individual's present circumstances. Fromm is widely read and never forgets to note the important authors who led the way before him. Similarly he is knowledgable in surveys and studies over the years concerning attempts at an improvement of the human condition applied in industry by others. It is the satisfaction of human needs in the present circumstances which lie on the road to a better society not who controls the means of production.Unfortunately after a detailed and brilliant analysis of society Fromm does not spend anywhere near the same amount of time in the resolution of its problems. In the second last chapter, about 70 pages of a total of 360, he attempts it. One feels that he never quite finished this chapter and that he had much more to say, or rather there was much he mentioned briefly but did not analyse deeply enough. He did not discuss the problems which could arise in these solutions as they are implemented. This is disappointing.Nonetheless, simply for a deep and insightful analysis of society and human nature Fromm cannot be faulted. The book is a must read for these reasons alone. It is unfortunate his ideas were never put into practice. Society continues in its march towards insanity as the capitalist ideal is approached and people are more and more dehumanised. No wonder such massive problems exist."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"Erich Frommfs gThe Sane Societyh is one the most illuminating and insightful books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. In gThe Sane Societyh Fromm questions the sanity of a society which covets property over humanity and adheres to idolatrous theologies of submission and domination rather than self-actualization. Fromm provides readers with a scathing indictment of modern capitalism which, Fromm states, is the main source of the isolation and alienation prevalent in todayfs society. Fromm advocates communitarian socialism, which, he explains, expounds the humanitarian ideals and spiritual self-actualization needed to cure society of its religious and capitalistic ills."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"The kernel of Dr. Fromm's analysis and the starting point for his further discussions is the definition of \\"human nature\\" - from the psychological standpoint. For him the human's psyche is not a computer (to use contemporary metaphor) on which society can install any programs of behavior it requires. If the social programs - norms of conduct and value judgments, i.e. what is good and bad, what one shall strive for etc. - do not match the natural, evolutionary pre-defined needs of the human being, psychological defects and neurosis shall occur. The mentally healthy, i.e. sane person is thus the one who does not have defects and does not experience neurosis, who lives in a society that through economic, political and social channels promotes and furthers his harmony with requirements of his, human nature.For many of us it may be very surprising and even suspicious that somebody can question the sanity of western society and thus sanity of the majority of its individual members. How, after all, can people who have achieved such dramatic heights in the scientific thought, who have so rapidly progressed in mutual creation of such elaborated technologies, and who then make them work with an even-increasing efficiency, be not sane?The answer lies in the definition and the meaning of \\"sanity\\". For Fromm the term \\"in-sane\\" does not equal \\"idiot\\". An in-sane person is not necessarily the one who has abnormally low IQ (intelligence level), but the one who is not truly aware of himself and of his nature, whose reason (i.e. the ability to \\"grasp the world by thought\\", to penetrate beneath the surface of things and ideas as opposed to mere ability to manipulate given objects and facts) ceased to develop properly or deteriorated; an in-sane person fails to see the difference between the means for his life - money and material possessions as most straightforward examples - and the aims of life. The one who lives for something that he consciously or unconsciously puts higher than him - be it material things or other persons whom he worships.The aim of productive, that is truly human, life for Dr. Fromm is threefold: 1) the realization of man's productive powers, 2) development of his reason, and 3) experience of true love - not only of erotic love, but the true love for ones neighbor that so many religions had manifested. His diagnosis is that our average contemporary fails miserably in all three spheres. Again we may at first rebel at such humiliating statement but only until we go along with the author through all the arguments he successively presents in the book.For the remote future generations our time may appear to be a very interesting theoretical case. The direct authority that suppressed human beings from time immemorial has been largely gone. No more serf owners, no more cruel industrialists who could exploit workers in the absence of protective legislation. The family authority also diminished and Church as organization as well as an institution does not tower above individual any more. The individual has finally gained (or received) his freedom!... But is he really free? That is a cornerstone question for Fromm's analysis.The author meticulously studies the peculiar aspects of our modern life, from what the rise of methods of mass production started to require from human beings in the 19th century, to how these requirements had, along with technology, developed in the 20th century. He especially focuses on how requirements of the modern economic machine progressively formed into moral standards for our society and how they forced out the need (and largely the possibility) for direct, overt authority; how these economic requirements now perpetuate and reinforce themselves through political and social institutions in such a way that from the first years of our lives we want to do precisely what the economic machine, and not the human nature, wants us to do: to indulge in obsessive work for most of our life's hours, with only two purposes: 1) to increase the abstract capital, material possessions and to secure the growth of the machine itself, and 2) to be able to spend the results of our work - money - and the small bits of the remaining time on the goods and entertainments produced by this machine.How could it be so? And is it so? When we look at our lives we may at first fail to find any proof of evidence for it. After all we do what we want to do, we decide what our profession should be, what company we shall work for; nobody tells us what model of the car to buy, or which girl to marry... Nobody forces us to anything! And that is very accurate. Nobody. But it does not mean there is not something that persistently suggests, urges us to do what it wants us to do. The special term was later coined for this something - economists now call it informal \\"institutions\\". And the set of institutions currently accepted by most members of society form an overwhelming force called the \\"public opinion\\". In contrast to the overt authority, which usually tend to demand very precise things from its subordinates, public opinion leaves us enough room for some unimportant choices, which give us the illusion that the choices are truly ours. In reality though most of our really important choices are pre-determined by the way the mass production machine works and what type of servants it needs for its successful operation. The modern technology needs very intelligent man to operate it. It cannot use brutal force any longer since that would hinder man's intelligence, which it now needs so much. It cannot let most humans to develop their power of reasoning - since they would then rebel against the dictatorship of economic forces. Thus the contemporary economic machine needs man who becomes more and more intelligent (\\"smart\\") but never truly develops his reason, who wants to have all the goods this economic machine can produce in order to provide for its continuous growth - and the machine skillfully helps him to want an ever-increasing number of new and different goods and experiences it can produce. It propagates itself and stimulates consumption through techniques of advertisements, propaganda and \\"success stories\\". What it does not reveal to us is that most of these stories are successes of the machine, not of human beings in the humanistic sense of achievement.This book largely repeats what Erich Fromm had already said in his earlier works (\\"Escape from Freedom\\" and especially \\"Man for himself\\") in the analysis of the human nature, current human situation and problems that occur at their junction. Twenty years after the first publication of \\"The Sane Society\\", in his final book \\"To have or to be?\\" Dr. Fromm sums up these concepts more succinctly (on some 150 pages), though never loosing important aspects of his previous works. So for anyone who's mostly interested with a psychological and not sociological aspects of this book I would rather recommend to read \\"To have or to be?\\" and then \\"Man for himself\\".One aspect of \\"The Sane Society\\" that is more elaborated in this book than in his other works is the \\"Road to Sanity\\": changes that are necessary in social, political and economic spheres to let the human beings become masters, not slaves, of the technology and capital they created; what changes are required to let each individual realize his creative and loving potential and to stop being converted into programmed robots which follow the dictatorship of the soulless capital, despite having deep inside the ever-present anxiety and neuroses that now so frequently occur.Fromm seeks solution that would help not only the upper and middle classes, but the working class too, every human being. He briefs the reader on the ideas offered by the most and also lesser renowned socialists, quoting them extensively, and suggests that the \\"Road to sanity\\" for us should be that what he calls \\"Democratic Socialism\\". Unlike many socialists who placed most emphasis in the spheres of political (revolution, the rule of the working class) and economic (nationalization of the means of production and less drastic distribution of income) changes, Fromm explains that unless significant changes also happen in the social sphere (changes in values and increase of faith in abilities and reason of all human beings) any attempts limited to economic and/or political spheres will inevitably fail. He also shows that while economic goal of socialists of the 19th century - to provide better means for living for the working class - has already been accomplished better that many could dream of, the social situation of that class and it's genuine self esteem had not largely changed. The only difference is that brutal oppression of the 19th century was substituted with programming the blue and white collar workers with \\"the law of the free market\\" mentality which can be summed up in the following: \\"If you do not work you will starve, and we offer you choices of work and monetary reward on which you and your family can exist. If you do not like the work we offer for your knowledge and skill level and you do not have enough money and brains to prepare yourself for what you would like to do, or you want to do what we as a society do not value in materialistic sense (teachers, nurses etc) - well that's just too bad for you. But we, the society, have nothing to do with that. This is you who are a failure. Realize it and stick to your destiny and work that you can do. After all somebody have to do the dirty jobs in the factories and on the streets, so why not you?\\" Although for some this may sound like a normal, fair way of treating individuals, it certainly does not sound so for Dr. Fromm and for many other humanists he quotes.Erich Fromm was far from being nave and overoptimistic. He accepts that among current economic, political and social institutions the current way of mass production (around which our whole economy is organized), which requires huge organizations and a great deal of specialization of labor, can be changed least. He offers some very practical (and mostly realistic) political, social and also minor economic changes that should help workers as well as managers to become more reasonable and also become less alienated from their work and their whole life. But after reading his truly brilliant analysis of the human nature and current human situation and the way it developed to what it is, his last, relatively short chapter on the \\"Roads to Sanity\\", leaves an impression that he himself was aware that what he proposed was not enough, and what would be enough could not be realistically achieved. Dr. Fromm is an analyst par excellence, but he does not have the vigor and ego of Karl Marx to force his ideas and ideals with the revolutionary strength upon \\"the ones who must be saved\\". Thus he does not dwell into many details on how the new, sane society shall function, limiting his suggestions only to indicating \\"possible ways\\" and some seemingly discrete changes. And that may be a sign that he himself did not believe that something can be fundamentally changed on the gross level. But even if that is true, even if economic machine and profit obsession cannot be restrained in the foreseeable future, this book is still very important as it can at least help some individuals to unveil their reason and thus to [partially] escape the general madness created by the current capitalistic soulless machine. And the larger the number of such individuals is, the more are the chances that society as a whole will gradually adopt a healthier approach to life."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"Although this book has been written almost 50 years ago it still provides basic insight into our behavior in the modern world. 'Money, prestige and power are the main incentives today for the largest section of our population - that which is employed'. This probably holds still today whereas some of the major concerns of the fifties are not concerning people any more. A book to read and think about!"},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"This book was written about 50 years ago and still up-to date, I just copied this small paragraph that give an idea about the core of Fromm message:\\" The western world have created a great material wealth more than any other society in the history of the human race. Yet we have managed to kill of millions of our population in an arrangement, which we call war. During these wars, every participant firmly believes that he was fighting in his self-defense, for his honor, or that he was backed up by God. The groups with whom one is at war are, often from one day to the next, looked upon as cruel irrational fiends whom one must defeat to save the world from evil. But a few years after the mutual slaughter is over the enemies of yesterday are our friends, the friend s of yesterday our enemies, and again in full seriousness we begin to paint them with appropriate colors of black and white. \\"Fromm message is a one that should be heard by all human beings: love between neighbors , love in societies , countries and nations, is the only solution.Love."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"A few chapters in, I was concerned the book was too \\"dated\\". Fromm does talk a lot about individualism as a fundamental human characteristic, and this can come off as ethnocentric at times (individualism is a Western value, not shared by all cultures to the extent we value it). He also criticizes cultural relativism, seeing it as one of the reasons Western humanity is \\"insane\\". Having been an anthropology major in college, this was hard to swallow, but I kept reading. And I was surprised. I found a remarkable similarity in Fromm's book to the some of the tenets of Ecological Economics, or EcolEcon (see Daly & Farley, \\"Ecological Economics\\"). For example, Fromm says in the last chapter, \\"economy must become the servant for the development of man\\" (p. 314, 4th Fawcett Premier Printing, January 1967); compare this to the EcolEcon tenet that the economy is a subset of the ecosystem and, as such, expansion of the economy should be limited, environmental impacts curbed, so that it does not detract from our quality of life (which depends, ultimately, on a healthy ecosystem).Towards the end of the book, I was feeling pretty optimistic: about society, the \\"Western World\\", and even about some personal decisions I was facing in my life at that time. Even if it is not very good sociology (as some other reviewers contend), The Sane Society is a good book and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"I appreciate Fromm's attempt to take on the univerdsal challenges that humans face in context of the capitalistic economic system that we must operate and balance our practicical needs.The introduction to the book is tremendous to put in context Fromm's place in thought and the reaction by his comtempoaries."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"I read this book in college a long long time ago. It never seemed to gain any popularity or following. The ideas about society are still quite pertinent and really show how little we have evolved in the last 60 years. It helps explain the nonsense that frustrates most of us....but never seems to change. It explains.... but obviously we haven't solved any of the problems."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"In The Sane Society Erich Fromm discusses the problems hindering the well-being of Mankind and while he wrote about the early to mid-twentieth century, it's ideas are pertinent now. We need a meaningful life wherein work is not merely a means of making money but a valued part of social life, where we experience love as a unifying factor recognizing our fragile natures and the needs we share, where we can experience our creative and productive powers without the threat of anxiety and fear to impede the progress of psychological, intellectual, or spiritual well-being.Some concern has been raised by other readers here and on other websites about the lack of scientific study to prove Fromm's theories about Human psychology. Fromm does, however, include discussion on a few scientific experiments (the more prominent being one on the psychology of workers discussed in one of the last chapters) and surveys of people and their feelings towards work and work policies.While other readers have approached this book as a work of pure psychology I approached as one about ideas. Fromm was a psychoanalyst but also a philosopher and this must be taken into account when reading this and some of his other later works. An intelligent reader should consider these ideas, applying them to him- or herself and to the world, and look for the proof individually instead of hoping that the author will provide a fully convincing argument. I tend to agree with Fromm on what he thought were the necessities for mental well-being and found his arguments quite good (although I cannot say I consider all to be sufficient).As for my five-star writing--I give it this for its powerful ideas."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"like the video 802, up here in Vermont we are reading what needs to be read."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"Just a comment about Mr. Carlson (or Dr. Carlson, if he is a PhD and commodity in the market).

His main premise is that society can produce 'socially patterned defects' that are so widespread they are seen as normal. For individuals who have more humanistic goals in life, society will inevitably judge them as irrational or insane. So life practices that that detrimental to human development are seen as normal because everyone does it. Fromm moves on to talk about how people have culturally evolved from primitive societies rooted in nature to the current stage where the achievement of a truly humanistic society is within our reach. Blocking progress is the increasing abstractification of life, depriving us of a human perspective on things. We have become slaves to our creations and placed them above humanity, which means we have become things, not people. The means have become more important than the ends. This analysis is interesting as it covers sociology, economics and psychology to give a compelling sketch of recent history. Fromm then moves on to suggest remedies for the increasing insanity in society. We must move towards regarding individuals as unique people who are are not to be exploited. Humanistic socialism can point the way to a more community centred society that wants to realise the potential of humanity and not subjugate them to the need to have, but rather to be."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"This is one of the three Fromm's fundamental book (Escape from Freedom, Man for Himself).

This book has destroyed with total thoroughness any pretention that being &quot;normal&quot; and adjusted has anything to do with health or fulfillment. A devastating social critique."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"The social criticism is awesome. Unfortunately, Fromm missed the simple truth that the unalienated condition depends on connectedness with nature and not on its domination."},{"Title":"The sane society","review":"It is always difficult (and some say impossible) to analyze a society or culture from an objective and apodictic point of view, for the obvious reason that the individuals doing the analysis have to sit outside the phenomena in which they are analyzing. If they characterize a particular society as being dysfunctional or its citizens maladjusted in some way, and they themselves are embedded in this society, then an obvious question arises as to why they have the ability to make this characterization, and are not themselves the products of the problems of this culture. In addition, if such individuals put their analysis in print, and if one or more readers understand and are sympathetic with their opinions, then these readers too, must have not been influenced by the problems of the society. Thus the issue comes down to counting the number of individuals who have escaped the decadent influences of their own culture, which entails the use of statistical and scientific analysis.The author of this book does not subject the societies that he analyzes to rigorous scientific scrutiny. Thus the contents of the book are merely opinions, but that is not to say that one could not get anything out of its perusal. Its contents are thought provoking, and could serve to motivate readers to perhaps attempt to justify them more quantitatively. There is only one place in the book where the author performs any degree of statistical analysis: he gives tables detailing the number of suicides and homicides and alcoholics per 100,000 of adult populations in sixteen countries. This table is used to give a rough guide to the mental health of these countries. He concludes also, from the data in the table, that affluent societies have the highest incidence of suicides, and therefore are the most mentally or emotionally unstable. He does not however take into account that the data may indicate a transient type of phenomena, possibly from extraneous or extreme historical events, that caused problems in some of the individuals populating these countries. Two world wars may indeed have been a temporary but large perturbation to these individual's mental health, traumatizing them to the degree that suicide or alcoholism was their seemingly only option. And one could perhaps imagine a society where alcoholism and suicide were prevented by some artificial and coercive acts of the government, such as requiring individuals to take mind-altering drugs that will alleviate tendencies to suicide or alcoholism. Thus the mere absence or rare occurence of suicides or alcoholics does not by itself point to a \\"sane\\" society.But it is free societies that the author is most concerned with, and, thus he argues, in spite of the rise of free time and less burdens placed on modern humans, they still commit suicide and abuse alcohol more than perhaps societies that do not possess the luxury of leisure time. But no case studies are given for the kinds of behavior that the author asserts is present predominantly in free, afluent socieites. Indead, the author engages in a diatribe that is general and philosophical, with no attempt to gather statistics to support what he believes about free, capitalist societies. In addition, he makes no effort to study the individuals who feel very happy to live and work in such societies. The reason for this is perhaps the author's belief that these kinds of individuals were the consequence of a attempt to \\"mold them for the purpose of the continuing functioning of the society\\". Thus their happiness is not really genuine, but merely a state resulting from being manipulated to follow some requirement of \\"social character\\". \\"Capitalism\\", he says, \\"needs men who cooperate smoothly in large groups; who want to consume more and more, and whose tastes are standardized and can be easily influenced and anticipated.\\" This may be true to a degree, but capitalist societies also need individuals who swim against the current, this need being driven by innovation. Technological change demands independence of thought as well as self-confidence, and a free society cannot survive without having a large collection of its citizens possessing these qualities. The author though seems to be unable to imagine how anyone could be truly happy in a free, capitalist society. And again, the author does not give one example of an individual or case study that would substantiate his claims. Of all the people who live in the societies he criticizes, can't he find one individual who he can cite, perhaps from medical journals or physicians case-histories, that is an example of a maladjusted, dysfunctional, perhaps mentally ill person who exemplifies his assertions? If one is to believe the author's theories, much more than mere dialog will have to be presented. Such studies are difficult but that is the nature of scientific research into mental illness and psychology.Every human born in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries is born into a situation that is not of their own making. And everyone is subject to influences and events that they do not have control over. The fact that we all sometimes do not object to such influences and events is not a sign that we enjoy being dominated and want to escape from our freedom, as the author claims. It may indeed be a sign and proof that we have optimized our emotional and psychological health, that we are genuinely happy, and that we find life in the 21st century exhilirating."},{"Title":"Aeschylus: Eumenides (Classical Texts)","review":"The Orestia trilogy is the tragic story of the responsibility of a blood debt and the need for a system of laws and justice that replaces an ending cycle of revenge. In the first play, \\"Agamemnon,\\" the title character returns victoriously from Troy to be murdered by his wife, Clytemnestra, who having sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia so that a fair wind would blow the Achean army to Troy. In the middle play, \\"The Choephori\\" (\\"The Libation Bearers\\"), Orestes comes to Argos to avenge his father by killing his mother. After doing the bloody deed, Orestes is afflicted by madness and flees in terror from the Furies, the hideous spirits who hunt down and punish murderers. Thus the stage is set for \\"The Eumenides,\\" the final play in the trilogy.\\"The Eumenides\\" begins a few days after the end of the previous play, with Orestes seeking refuge at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. In a most unusual move for a Greek tragedy, the action then jumps ahead several years when Orestes, after years of wandering as a tormented outcast, arrives at Athens and throws himself on the mercy of the godess Athena. The Furies arrive, hot upon his heels, and demand he be punished for his act of matricide. However, Orestes insists that since he acted according to the dictates of Apollo, he is guiltless of the crime. This is a shocking declaration, especially for someone from the accursed house of Atreus. Athena convenes a special court to hear the case against Orestes, but they are unable to reach a verdict, leaving it to the goddess to decide his fate. She casts the tie-breaking vote to acqit Orestes and the Furies turn against the city itself, but Athena persuades them to bless the city instead, finding there a home and a cult that will worship them as the Eumenides (the Kindly Ones).Ultimately, the Orestia is a celebration of the Athenian civilization that had created a democratic government and a system of trial by jury. That such a system could be perverted might be true, as the case of Socrates strongly suggests, but Aeschylus is comparing the system to the past to draw a strong distinction between vengeance and justice. The Orestia has great importance because of this theme, and not simply because it is the only surviving example of a Greek tragic trilogy. The climax of \\"The Eumenides\\" is rather strange for a Greek tragedy, since it ends on an exalted note of reconciliation and optimism, but that is why the Orestia is the first great drama in the history of theater."},{"Title":"Octagon magic","review":"Andre Norton has as usuall given us a book of to make the imagination work over time.

The story opened in action with teasing by Stan Wormiski (name indicative of his behavior), and continued so throughout its ten chapters.Lorrie's Canadian background is a bit vague, especially as regards the brief mention of her parents, but otherwise handled well. The book, after all, concerns her future, not her past.

Lorrie is unhappy in America as she struggles to adjust while nasty boys like Rob Lockner, Jimmy Purvis and Stan Wormiski taunt her as a Canuck who walks like a duck. Needing to escape the teasing of the terrible threesome, Lorrie climbs the front gate to Octagon House where Hallie, the servant to the alleged witch elderly Miss Charlotta Ashemeade residing there, greets her.After a terrible week highlighted by Rob's disgusting sister Kathy \\"killing\\" her doll Miranda, Lorrie runs to Octagon House where Hallie introduces her to Miss Charlotta. When the child comes home she tells Aunt Margaret about her visit to Octagon House and receives permission to return. At the house, Lorrie searches for Sabina the cat and finds a strange room with a dollhouse and old dolls inside. That leads the exploring child back in time to the nineteenth century where she meets Lotta Ashemeade, Phin and Phoebe. Lorrie's adventures into understanding behavior have just begun.The reissue of the second \\"Magic\\" tale (see STEAL MAGIC) will bring joy to preadolescent readers. The story line focuses on unhappy Lorrie as she fails to adjust to her environs, blaming others for her misery. She and the key cast are fully developed so that her woes seem genuine and monumental (remember she is a sixth grader). Her escapade into the Victorian Age provides her with lessons in group dynamics and inter-human relationships that she takes back to her present as memories. Though too slow for adults, the ten to twelve year old crowd will appreciate a visit to Octagon House.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Octagon magic","review":"Octagon MagicWhen Lorrie's grandmother got sick, eleven year old Lorrie is sent to live with her aunt in the USA.

Everything is strange in Lorrie's new life in Maryland: her advertising copywriter aunt, away all day at her job and unused to children; public school rather than the girls' school she's used to, with American rather than Canadian history and customs, with the accompanying change from being a bright student to falling behind due to her different educational background.This story has several levels: in the present day, Lorrie rescues a lost kitten from being tormented by some of the boys who have taken to bullying her, to find that the kitten belongs to \\"the witch's house\\". Octagon House is the home of two very old ladies, Miss Ashemeade and her companion Hallie, who live in the past in more ways than one, preserving old skills, old beauty, and old stories in a house that has played refuge to many troubled souls in its time. They act as mentors to Lorrie, providing a quiet oasis (and some practical advice about dealing with teasing and bullies). On another level, Octagon House itself is threatened by development plans, and local historical society figures (including Lorrie's aunt) become involved in trying to protect it from demolition. On yet another level, the antique dollhouse set aside in a room of its own in Octagon House acts as a gateway to other times, giving Lorrie the experience of some of Octagon House's other refugees, and giving her still more perspective on her own problems as compared with those of runaway slaves and abused, starving orphans of centuries past.The total effect works well: present-day Octagon House is a world in itself, with its nineteenth-century decor and emphasis on crafts and skills that while not magical are no longer common. Lorrie herself is not a simple character, nor are those she clashes with simple villains: her aunt mostly hasn't had time to grow into her new role; a neighbour girl with some racial prejudices is able to grow and develop rather than being a total loss; other characters aren't bad people although they grate on the homesick Lorrie. As for the magical elements and past history, as in most Norton stories any happy resolutions to any given situation are not necessarily simple or predictable. Anyone who has read Norton's short story \\"Through the Needle's Eye\\" from HIGH SORCERY will see echoes of it in this full-length book, such as Lorrie's relationship with Miss Ashemeade and Hallie, including embroidery lessons and stories of enchanted tapestries, without the characters themselves being simple repetitions of one another."},{"Title":"Octagon magic","review":"Great tale of a lonely little girl, who wants to go home to Canada, and finds a friend in an older person who lives in a mysterious house."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Having tried so hard to finish this I have become convinced that its reputation comes from people who have, somehow, managed to read it and didn't want to feel all the effort was for nought.

Laurence Sterne seems more concerned with his erudition than with telling his story. The novel is a sort of intellectual tease, as Sterne intorduces storylines, and then announces that he will complete the storyline later so that he can digress onto some topic that may have been of interest in 1760 (such as the description of fortifications) but which is of little interest today. By doing this, Sterne builds up and then frustrates our expectations, revealing Sterne as both vain in his self-indulgence and disrespectful to his gentle readers.

Sterne wrote a masterpiece and the surprising thing about this is that the book is as different from a novel as any can be.

The book is a series of of character sketches, but the story about Tristram's Uncle Toby holds it all together. I think the genius of this book is Sterne's mastery of making one detail relevant to another. Sterne touches on all the elements of human life - Love, war, business, theology, religion, science, trade and medicine. Sterne juggles all these as well as his main story almost effortlessly.

For some reason, Amazon has attached editorial reviews from the hardcover edition of the graphic novel version to this page.Now, the book itself offers a range of experiences from delightfully hilarious to annoyingly tedious. Lots of the \\"funny\\" parts depend on an understanding of 18th-century social mores. I'm sure some of it went over my head but I'm enough of a nerd to have enjoyed most of the drollery. I think...The story is whimsical, told all out of order by a scatterbrained, easily-distracted narrator. Tristram Shandy himself is hardly in the novel at all; aside from narrating it, he only appears momentarily as a newborn infant and then as a boy about 6 years old - and his role in both incidents seems peripheral to the carryings-on of the other characters. Each turn in the story reminds the author of something else, and he turns aside to tell stories inside of stories, each of which are necessary to give the reader some vital \\"background information\\" .. with the result that the main story hardly moves forward at all. It takes nearly 200 pages just for Tristram to be born! and even then the reader isn't quite sure it has happened since the conversations and minute actions of the other characters are magnified to such an importance that the narrator's own birth is hardly observed. For the most part this rambling comes across as \\"quirky and delightful\\" and the novel flows along quite pleasingly in spite (or perhaps because) of it. The digressions add layers to the story.Except when they don't. The \\"chapter upon noses\\" which is a translation of a fictitious(?) Latin work by the great Slwakenbergius, has little bearing on the story. Like most of the book, it builds up to a climax and then stops short of resolution, leaving you to wonder what was the point. It leads nowhere, but at least it was interesting. The same cannot be said of Book VII, which is a sort of travel diary of Tristram (in the novel's \\"present\\" time) touring France by post-chaise. Although this is the only significant appearance of Tristram himself as a character in the book, it has absolutely nothing to do with the story/stories he was telling, and it is neither very interesting nor very funny. It serves as nothing but a pointless interruption, delaying the reader for 50 pages before getting to the part we were waiting for: Toby's courtship of the widow Wadman.This last section goes along nicely for a while, and then the book stops. It doesn't end; it just stops right in the middle of a conversation, with the courtship unresolved and most of the reader's questions unanswered. This is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the entire novel, but I have to admit it's frustrating. I had trouble deciding whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars but I think it entertained me more than it exasperated me, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt ... and round up from 3.5. It's worth reading once, just for the experience - there's no other book quite like it - and the price of the Dover Thrift Edition can't be beat."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Peter Barker is a marvelous reader, and Sterne is a wild man writer.Something to be savored and smiled at over time.

The result is \\"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,\\" a gloriously rambling, richly entertaining sort-of-novel.\\"I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me.\\" So begins Tristram, who starts his life story with his \\"begetting,\\" and attempts to tell the story of his birth and life, as well as the descriptions of relatives -- his lovable uncle Toby, his eccentric dad, his patient mother (who's in labor for most of the book).But as he tries to tell us about his life, Tristram keeps getting sidetracked by all the stories that surround him -- his uncle's romance with the Widow Wadman and the war in which he received a nasty wound in a sensitive spot, the French, the doctor who delivered him, letters in multiple languages, the parson, the personal history of the midwife, and what curses are appropriate for what occasions.Most novels are pretty straightforward -- they have a beginning, a middle and an end. But \\"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\\" totally ignores that, by having a beginning that lasts for the whole book, dozens of \\"middles,\\" and no real end (it just stops at a suitable spot). All of this is without a real structure.And he took this postmodern, break-all-the-rules mentality all the way, by including odd little illustrations -- when speaking of the death of Parson Yorick, Sterne includes a black page. Random empty pages. Asterisks instead of important paragraphs. And a bunch of squiggly lines to demonstrate precisely how the narratives in previous chapters looked.At first glance, Sterne's writing style was pretty typical of his period -- detailed, somewhat formal in tone, and very talky. It takes a little while for Tristram to start dipping out of of his narrative -- at one point, he starts interrupting himself in midsentence. By the middle of the book, he's completely lost control of his own story.And he twisted it around with lots of bawdy humor (such as poor Uncle Toby's groin injury, which causes quite a few problems), and the continuous comic stumbles of all the characters. On the subject of his own name, Tristram describes his dad's reaction: \\"Melancholy dissyllable of sound! which to his ears was unison to Nincompoop, and every name vituperative under heaven.\\")Life is too rich to be encapsulated in a single story -- that's the problem with \\"Tristram Shandy,\\" whose story is a classic comic delight of premodernist-postmodern skill."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Dr. Johnson was wrong when he said that a work like TRISTRAM SHANDY was too odd to last. It's influence can be found in the works of Joyce, Woolf, and much of postmodern fiction. It's lack of a conventional narrative structure must have caused quite a stir in the mid 18th century. Even today, reading it can be quite disconcerting for one not comfortable with the colloquial English of the period.The book is narrated by Tristram Shandy, whose intention is to relate the story of his life beginning with his conception and birth. The running joke is that Tristram can't relate anything in a straightforward manner, and is continually digressing on subjects as diverse as philosophy, theology, obstetrics, travel, fortifications, sexuality, onomatology, and the human nose. There is a good deal of playful experimentation in the writing..shifting time frames, interspersing of English with Latin, creative use of punctuation and graphics, even deliberate omission of pages and chapters. Tristram is well aware of these quirks as he apologetically addresses the reader. At one point he draws a straight line to demonstrate his intended train of thought, and a squiggly line to show the actuality of it. By the time we are through, we have had some interesting portraits drawn of his overbearingly opinionated father Walter, his good natured but obsessive uncle Toby, and others.Lawrence Sterne, a clergyman by vocation, created something unique and entertaining for people who appreciate satirical wit and intelligence in their literature. For myself, I can't honestly say that TRISTRAM SHANDY was a great experience. At times it was hilarious. At times it's ideas were insightful. Too often though, it was dull and frustrating. Maybe a second reading would help, but I doubt it would change my opinion much."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Composed long before there were rules about what a novel is supposed to look like, &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy&quot; is a visionary piece of literature, a book so original in construction it almost defies genre. Conceived by an Anglican vicar who, under the comic influence of Rabelais and Swift and equally informed by Cervantes and Shakespeare, turned to writing fiction later in his life, it is an inadvertent masterpiece, the product of a writer who just wanted to have fun and entertain his readers and ultimately entertained generations.The book is not a fictitious autobiography, although its narrator Tristram Shandy might have intended it to be; most of the story is concerned not with his life but with his idiosyncratic family and the circumstances surrounding his conception and birth, with many digressions on various related and unrelated subjects. His father Walter, whose conjugal duties coincide with his having to wind the clock the first Sunday of every month, compiles a compendium of information he calls the Tristrapoedia for the education of his newborn son. His uncle Toby, an expert in military architecture, rides a hobby-horse and occupies his time with the science of besieging fortresses. Other characters include Corporal Trim, a former soldier and now Toby's valet and factotum; Dr. Slop, a dwarfish physician who delivers the baby Tristram; and Yorick the parson, who naturally is descended from the infamous jester of the Danish royal court.There are two aspects to this book that distinguish Sterne's style. The first is that he provides several different channels of narration and never really settles on a main plot thread; he interrupts the flow of one narrative with another, delivering narrative flights of fancy like a marriage contract, a sermon, a notice of excommunication from the Catholic Church, a travelogue for France and Italy, and amusing anecdotes about extracurricular characters. In this way he presages the modernism of many twentieth century authors.The second is that he does not restrict his text to English words; he intersperses Greek, Latin, and French passages where he likes, and on occasion he does not even use words at all, but symbols and glyphs to express certain concepts. A cross appears in the print when a character crosses himself; a character's death is memorialized by a black page; a blank page is provided for the reader to draw (mentally or physically) his own vision of the voluptuous Widow Wadman, who has a romantic eye for Toby; long rows of asterisks and dashes are used for things that are better left unsaid. At one point Sterne even draws squiggly lines to illustrate the sinuosity of his narrative, celebrating his own whimsy.&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; was published in nine volumes over the last nine years of Sterne's life, and whether these were all he had intended is debatable because the narrative is implied to have neither a beginning nor an end; it seems very much like a work in progress. As such, by modern literary standards it may not be considered a novel, but in the sense of its unconventionality, its supply of so many bemusing surprises for the reader to discover, it is as literal an example of the term &quot;novel&quot; as there is."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"This work is OLD but reads like the most innovative avant-garde novel of today. The book is about Tristram Shandy and his birth, his uncle and his war wound and his father with his love of names and noses. Seriously! This is the original story-with-no-story and the beauty of the book is in the way that it's written. In reality, Sterne talks about anything and everything. He makes digressions lasting 20 odd pages, rambles to the reader, apologises for rambling, then discusses how he plans to get the story finally under way.The book is out of order chronologically. One of the funniest things about the book is that it's meant to be an autobiography of the fictional Tristram. Half the book is spent telling the story of the day of his birth. Then, the author moves to another scene, mainly revolving around Tristram's uncle Toby and the novel finishes several years before Tristram's birth.Sterne's writing is chaotic resembling a stream of consciousness. Sentences run onto the other, there's heaps of dashes and asterisks being used for various purposes. Sterne adds scribbles to signify the mood of the character. When one character dies, to symbolise his end, Sterne has a black page to describe it. When introducing a beautiful female character, Sterne says he can't be bothered describing her so he leaves a blank page for the reader to draw his/her own rendition.The book - though technically not a satire - in the process of going nowhere and saying nothing makes fun of many religious, political and societal topics. Sterne was a minister but from the book it can be gleaned that he was a particularly irreverent one.The work is divided into 9 books, published serially. This is a work where you can just pick up a chapter and read it. Some are several pages. Others are two lines. It takes a while to get used to Sterne's writing &quot;style&quot; so read slowly. This goes for the whole novel as there's so much hidden underneath the surface.This edition is great in having footnotes on the same page and reviews of Tristram as well as critical essays and Sterne's own letters about the work - many of which are very good.Tristram is funny, ridiculous, clever and very very eccentric. An absolute MUST!"},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"If you read and enjoyed Don Quixote, with its endless digressions and ridiculous situations, you are likely to enjoy reading Tristram Shandy. Even if you hated reading Pamela, you may still enjoy Tristram Shandy. \\"Learned nonsense\\" describes it very well. The demands it makes on the reader, however, are comparable to those made by works such as Ulysses, Gravitys Rainbow and J.R.. The Penguin edition contains over 120 pages of notes as well as a useful \\"Glossary of Terms of Fortification\\" to help the reader along. (You just never know when you might need to know what a \\"circumvallation\\" is.) All the same, I first read T.S. in the old Signet Classic edition, ($.95) which contained virtually no annotations, and I still enjoyed it. And then there are the strange neologisms (such as \\"hobby-horsical\\"), and the even sillier names. It gets better with repeated readings and it will make you laugh. After T.S., you may want to tackle Anatomy of Melancholy. My only disappointment with T.S.: there was no mechanical duck!"},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"I'm so glad I didn't do English Lit at college. I've just read the customer reviews of this wonderful book and seen how being forced to read something you wouldn't normally read makes you bitter, twisted and intent on ensuring no-one else gets pleasure out of it. It also makes you cemented in your opinion that if you don't like it, it must have no redeeming feature (after, all &quot;I did a degree in Eng Lit, so I must know what I'm talking about&quot;). All great difficult books suffer from this -- Ulysses, At Swim-Two-Birds, Lanark, The Trial, and that's just the 20th century. Oh well. People should read what they want, when they want: they should also accept that there is little out there with no value, it's taste that causes us to like different things.That said, what do I think of it? I think it's one of the most fun reads there is, once you get yourself back into an 18thC mode of reading (MTV has so much to answer for with our attention spans). Also, forget all this bunk about it being postmodern or deliberately experimenting with the novel. When this was written, there WAS no novel, that came in the 19thC. Before this there was Don Quixote, Robinson Crusoe and little else that could be called a novel. All Sterne was doing was writing to entertain, and that he does marvelously. He had no boundaries to push - they weren't there - so he made his own (and they just happened to be a long way away from where he originally sat).Anyway -- if you like the idea of a book that coined the phrase &quot;cock and bull story&quot;, includes blank pages to show discretion when two characters make love, that draws wiggling lines indicating the authors impression of the amount of digression in the previous pages, you'll love it. But just stop if you don't like it, instead of perseveering and then taking it out on everyone."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"In a classic episode of The Simpsons, Grandpa Simpson gives the following advice of how to deal with some workers on strike: \\"We can't bust heads like we used to. But we have our ways. One trick is to tell stories that don't go anywhere. Like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for m'shoe. So I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt. Which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Gimme five bees for a quarter, you'd say. Now where was I... oh yeah. The important thing was that I had an onion tied to my belt, which was the style at the time. You couldn't get white onions, because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...\\"Such a cock and bull story has formed the basis for a mighty novel, and one of the mid-18th century no less. That was not usually an era of radical experimentation, but Laurence Stern's TRISTRAM SHANDY is the oddest duck of English literature from that era. As the young gentleman Shandy sets out to write his memoirs and offer his views on life, he cannot help but go off on tangent after tangent. Only at the end of the second volume is he actually born. Soon the narrator basically gives up on his own autobiography, preferring to tell of the odd people around him. There is his eccentric Uncle Toby who, after being wounded in a siege at the turn of the 18th century, spends all his days constructing miniature citadels on his bowling green in which to play war games. There's his father, struggling to maintain the greatness of the Shandy family against his poor bad luck. And there is Parson Yorick, an Anglican cleric who doesn't always keep to the orthodox line, and so is a self-portrait of Sterne himself.The novel is revolutionary as literature, foretelling the narrative games and unreliable narration of 20th century Modernism. But is it actually fun to read? Sadly, I found TRISTRAM SHADY a wearying experience. This story based on digressions is woefully uneven, and for every laugh out loud moment there were two or three lame episodes. And this is from a reader who, equipped with his not ordinarily useful liberal arts education, understands all of Sterne's references to history and theology."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"\\"The Life and Opinions...\\" is perhaps impossible to really classify. It purports to be a biography of the fictional Tristram Shandy, but I don't think you can call something a biography when it only covers a year or so of the subject's life! I would say that more than half of the novel actually falls into the \\"Opinions\\" referred to in the title. The rest consists of short stories on Tristram's father, uncle, and a couple other minor characters.I have never in my life read so many digressions from the topic at hand, most of which were utterly irrelevant but the charm of it is that Sterne *knows* they're irrelevant, but mockingly expresses his license of authorship in forcing the reader to go off on these sidetracks. His attitude is: \\"If you can't wait a chapter or two to get back to the story, well, go take a flying leap, I'm the author.\\" Sometimes the digressions are exasperating. Very unlike Victor Hugo's signature habit of digressing, say when a certain main character in Notre Dame decides to enter the Paris sewers, Hugo takes thirty or more pages to give a history of the design and construction of the Paris sewer system. At least Hugo's digressions have *something* to do with the story.Well, maybe that's the problem. There isn't a main story in this novel. It's not a storybook. There are many short stories nested within the main framework, but there is no real protagonist or overarching theme of any sort. Indeed, the end comes abruptly and there is absolutely no resolution of any conflict.It's not trying to teach anything, really.So what is it? I'm not sure. More a comedy than anything else. Right up there with Dickens' \\"Pickwick Papers\\" in terms of humor, but lacking the story. Maybe funnier than Dickens and just as clever. I was rolling in the aisles so many times I lost count.I read the Penguin edition, edited by Melvyn & Joan New. The back cover does a better job than I could ever do in providing a sense of what you're getting into when you pick this one up:\\"No one description will fit this strange, eccentric, endlessly complex masterpiece. It is a fiction about fiction-writing in which the invented world is as much infused with wit and genius as the theme of inventing it. It is a joyful celebration of the infinite possibilities of the art of fiction, and a wry demonstration of its limitations.\\"It's a large work, it will take a while to work through. It's worth it. There are passages I want to go back to and make copies of to tape to the walls, they're that brilliant."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"This is one of my favorites. It's not a book to rush through so that you can check it off on your lifetime reading plan. It's a profoundly human and wonderfully funny tale that needs to be savored. It was originally published in nine small volumes over a period of six years or so and no one at that time thought they had to sit down and read all nine volumes at once. This is a book you need to spend time with, pick up when it suits you or when you need to be refreshed and let one of the great writers in the language chat you up for awhile about the lovable Shandy family. Ignore the nonsense on the back of the Penguin edition about it being a novel about novel writing. This is a book about life. Two of its characters, Walter and Toby Shandy, rank with the best of Shakespeare, Fielding and Dickens. There are some truly great belly laughs, some really thoughtful philosophy and even a tear or two. Sterne's hobby horse theory is an extremely acute behavioral insight.

TS was published in four installments (nine volumes) and just throwing together various texts out of copyright, like the oxford edition, is not optimum (lots of printers' errors). On the downside, if you are thumbing through TS for a thesis like I am, this books' binding will fall apart.

A model was reading it and she had a really curious look on her face. I'm so glad I found out about this book. I really advise you to ignore the negative reviews about it being \\"self-consciously frustrating\\", pointless, etc. because it really isn't. If they simply didn't like it because they thought it was poorly written, that would be understandable, but it really sounds like they didn't get it and that they weren't open to the great pleasures of this book, which is pretty pathetic for English professors and students. It really isn't that hard to understand. I've only read a few of the classics before this, and the version I was reading had no editor's notes or explanations, but I had no problem understanding this book after reading the first ten chapters and getting used to it. I found it to be much more accessible then anything I've read by Shakespeare, anyway. I read somewhere a comparison to a Seinfeld in that it's \\"about nothing\\", but in a really humorous way. The book does have some jarringly post-modern elements, surprising for a novel from the 1700's (literally one of the first few novels ever written). In this it is unique because it is probably one of the only works of literature that can be thought of in modern times as both quaint and post-modern at the same time. But understanding this is not necessary to get involved in this book. It really is like an eighteenth century sitcom. There are mad digressions, stories within stories are started, delayed, started, delayed then forgotten about. There are quite a few genuinely funny moments where I laughed out loud as well as keen insights into human behaviour and the human condition, sometimes light and amusing and others melancholy.

It's not their fault that their story is frequently and impishly interrupted by outlandish \\"digressions\\" on the part of an author so creative that his modern descendants are considered to be Joyce and Beckett, as well as many others. Would you enjoy a chapter on Chapters? About buttonholes? About whether parents and their children are kin to each other? A chapter on curses? Poor Laurence Sterne has so much trouble getting two of his characters down the stairs that he finally calls in a \\"critic\\" to help! Advice on reading such an unusual, even unique, book: read the first several chapters, then stop and reread them. Continue that process and soon the book will feel quite familiar, and that's when the fun really starts. The Oxford World's Classics edition follows the first edition of the book, and is preferred. Amazon also offers the fully-annotated edition, the \\"Florida\\" edition, in three volumes. A caution about the Everyman hardcover edition: they reprinted a later edition which groups Tristram Shandy into three volumes, not nine. And then they renumbered all the chapters!

Tristram Shandy and the other characters here -- especially Tristram's uncle -- are also portrayed particularly well, since one gets to know them in the same way that one gets to know one's friends, that is, through haphazard, sometimes irrelevant, sometimes incomplete, stories about them that are not told in chronological order.In spite of these refreshing features, however, this book can be frustrating by the time one has reached the point of Tristram's birth, because, by this point, the magic has worn off. Sterne continues to play with the same narrative techniques he has displayed from the beginning of the book, But by now, one has grown weary of them and needs some tension to convince one to continue reading. If you've already got all of the meta-punchlines, so to speak, the rest of the book just seems like more of the same. Although I would strongly recommend this book, I have to confess that I left it halfway and would probably expect most readers who are amused by the book at the beginning to do the same once they have finished a few hundred pages."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"I'm a college student and chose this book to read for a British Lit project.

The phrasing and nuance that Lessor gives to Shandy actually provides more humour than you might find on your own.

Thoroughly professional preparation is demonstrated by Lessor. When Sterne writes --- or *** just what is a voice actor supposed to do? Somehow Lessor makes a great decision almost every time.

I was a big Kathy Acker fan at the time (still am, 14 years later) and liked the way she littered her books with strange pictures and diagrams. Imagine my shock on finding that Sterne had been doing the same stuff in the 1760s.Tristram Shandy is one of the earliest so-called novels in the English language, but it's probably the most astoundingly innovative work of fiction ever written. When a character dies, there's a black page. When Sterne wants to demonstrate the randomness of life, there's a marbled page (marbling being a random process in the original edition - the point is now lost in mass-market paperbacks). When a character makes a gesture with his stick, there's an extravagant scribble. I had assumed, in my Teen Ignorance, that your typical Penguin Classic was a sturdy but boring narrative about supposedly real people doing this and that at interminable length. The brilliance of Tristram Shandy is that Sterne displays totally credible (if utterly daft) characters in a proto-Dickensian manner, while at the same time asserting the material character of the book in your hand.I couldn't get academic about this book even if I wanted to. It's the most completely mad novel I've ever read. It's infuriating, yes, because Sterne is so good at the two things he's doing: telling a good story with living characters, and reminding you in his smirking whisper that it's only a story and that you're reading it in a book.This edition is as up-to-date as they get, and besides having comprehensive and very useful notes (Sterne is big into the tradition of Learned Wit, and many of his allusions can be a tad obscure without a modern scholar explaining them) it includes the excellent introductory essay by Christopher Ricks, carried over from the earlier (1967) Penguin edition. The UK price is three quid; it seems almost indecent that such a stunning performance can be had for so little.Dr Johnson famously remarked (in 1776) &quot;Nothing odd will do long. 'Tristram Shandy' did not last.&quot; Almost a quarter of a millennium later, it's still there, tongue thrust firmly into cheek. It's worth the whole of Fielding, Smollett and Richardson put together, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"This book is not for everyone. (Before you buy it, I recommend you read some of the other reviews for this book.) It is not an easy read, but it is funny in an odd **** ** ***. Please be advised that this book is more likely to make one chuckle rather than laugh.The story line is somewhat hard to describe. I take it to be a fictional autobiography-historical record-commentary on the people & places involved. The author, in my opinion, is poking fun at all of humanity in that each of us think our own life (regardless of our station) is so very, very important. Consequently we believe that everyone else should concur with our self-assessment and treat us accordingly.In a sense this book reminds me of a Woody Allen movie - it's superbly clever and wonderful at displaying the foibles of humanity, but it is completely vacuous in offering any solutions or good news. Allen and Sterne, unless I misunderstand them, are both cut from the same cloth of sugary post-Aristotelean skepticism. (This may make for spiffy-looking clothing, but it's not suitable for wearing out in the storm of life.)"},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Lawrence Sterne's sprawling \\"Shandy\\" is a fun, difficult read I enjoyed most when I took the time to digest it in 50-60 page chunks. Sterne's meandering style, with no sense of plot, and digression upon digression, can be frustrating to those looking for a story or any sense of a straight narrative.But for those who love word play, or, like me, grew up reading Mad Magazine and other satire; or anyone with a degree in Latin or philosophy, or even if you're a frustrated writer stifled over care to the craft, \\"Shandy\\" is the book for you.It's crazy fun -- missing pages, the infamous marbled page, black pages, drawings of pointing fingers, digression after digression on such diverse topics as armaments, noses, and fasting, and one of the most self-conscious, self-referential narrative voices in all of fiction. Literary critics point to Shandy as one of the first examples of postmodernist writing.Sterne presages the modern tendency towards meta-fiction, that blurry limbo between fact and fiction. The controversy over \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" reality television, the movies \\"Adaption\\" and \\"American Splendor,\\" along with the stream-of-consciousness style of Kerouac and the Beat Movement -- any work where the creator's ego/persona interjects into the narrative -- owes a creative debt to Tristram Shandy.I saw the movie and decided to read the book to make sense of it all. Of course, the book was no help. Sense has no place in the \\"Shandean\\" universe. The intrepid reader should just roll with it, laugh at the absurdities and highlight in pencil the little nuggets of wisdom contained herein."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Tristram Shandy begins to tell his story literally ad ovo... his unfortunate life begins its down turn at the very moment of conception when his mother turns away his father's attention by remembering the clock. Lawrence Sterne accomplishes one of the most humorous and yet innovative and unbelievably complex novels in history. While the reader waits for Tristram to come to the world, the characters are introduced through the most delicious and sophisticated game with ideas, opinions and ambiguous expresions, which connect, for example, uncle Toby's hobby horses with sexual behavours and problems of miscomunication. Misunderstandings reveal the unaccurate nature of language in a time when the illustration worked hard on capitalizing all human knowledge through the enciclopedia. A clever parody of the ideas of its time is what Sterne delivers with humour and resourcefullness. I find this book to be even stranger than James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\", mainly because of its use of the page, in which he inserts lines representing the evolution of his tale, black spots, or he leaves a blank page so the reader can draw there. It is a truely memorable work of art, which everyone should read in order to put in perspective the literary works of the XXth century which are proclamed to be the most original pieces in history."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"This Dover Thrift Edition of The Life and Times of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen, is a handsome package in terms of size, cover, and ease of reading. It's one drawback is a paucity of the sorts of introductions, timelines, explanatory notes and addenda you find in Oxford Classic or Penguin Classic versions. In fact, there's only one brief introductory note, then you're on your own. But it's a fine way to read the novel itself, and a great value even at full cover price."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"I wanted to like this, I really did. Sterne is a hugely inventive, hugely capable writer. Maybe he doesn't go in for the crazed linguistic free-for-all that people like James Joyce do, but he is every bit as bizarre and technically innovative. You could recognize one of his wildly digressive, over-mannered sentences in a heartbeat. But I still couldn't stand Tristam Shandy. Not because it's 'bad' per se, (parts of it are extremely engaging and genuinely funny in a way that very little writing from the 18th century is) but because it seemed like the work of a huge talent essentially screwing around for hundreds and hundreds of pages on what felt like, to me, a gimmick. Don't get me wrong, if modern literature has proven anything it's that huge, digressive chunks of text have a totally valid and at times, even stunning place in fiction and non-fiction alike. But a digression, however audacious or clever, is still a movement away from something, and Tristram Shandy doesn't really have anything to move away from, or back to. It's got no center. Maybe I'm not a conceptually ambitious enough reader to appreciate something this free-floating, but this book makes even the most fanatically post-modern fiction seem 'tame' by comparison. Tons of newer novels try to make it painfully clear just how decentralized they are, how utterly discursive and free from the confines of our often admittedly stodgy literary traditions they can be. Sterne wrote something that actually is those things, and while that might be clever on his part, it's just not enough. Not from someone who obviously has the chops to do so much more."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"It is curious to observe that the \\"novel\\" of the XVIII Century has much more in common with the novels of the XX than with those of the XIX. Structure, tone, introspection, playfulness, jumps in Time, typographic and other experiments, have more to do with the modern novels of the XX Century \\"isms\\", as well, of course, with the work of Rabelais and Cervantes, predecessors and acknowledged influences of this hilarious, humanistic and great book. The story presents tales within tales, and it \\"progresses\\" in spirals, with different threads interweaving like DNA chains which bring about a living being: Tristram Shandy. Through these games with Time, rhythm and direction, we learn not so much about the life and times of Tristram, but of his family. Well into the book Tristram apologizes for not having been born just yet, but we don't care because we are immersed in the prosaic yet magical world of the father, Walter, as well as of Uncle Toby and his servant, Corporal Trim, the male-midwife, the parson, Widow Wadman, and other characters as outrageous as the next. The book is a funny digression on subject after subject, some of them with no apparent connection to the main thread. We learn about Uncle Toby's and Trim's monomania for recreating, in the garden, the fortress sieges of William III's wars in Flanders and the Netherlands. Or the obsession of Shandy Sr. with big noses, whose size is related to other parts of the anatomy. The closing part is the story of Widow Wadman's efforts to conquer the naive Toby, similar to his sieges.The book develops in a continuous joy of digression, of pure literary pleasure, full of the most obscure erudite references worth reading in an annotated edition. The characters are perfect caricatures, full of humanity and good humour. Everything is subject of derision and mockery. One thing that makes it particularly memorable is the odd couple of Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim. Their absolute innocence, their boundless good faith, their devouted and manly friendship, make them a perfect British mirror of Don Quixote and Sancho, in their also perpetual assault on fortresses, as well military as temporal and verbal. A great ludic exercise of an obscure, and suddenly famous, parson from York, who has scandalized and amused generations of grateful readers."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"I had to read Tristram Shandy for a class on eighteenth and nineteenth century novels, and I found Sterne's novel to be the most interesting and entertaining of the bunch. I was overwhelmed by it at first, but, once I got into it and realized that plot was not the point, I really enjoyed the many characters and the unconventional structure. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates the postmodernists...I had to read Flann O'Brien's At Swim-Two-Birds at the same time and noticed how similar these books (though centuries apart) were in wit and style."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"This is a wonderful book and any humanist who doesn't mind 18th-century English should read it.

It contains some hilarious premises (i.e. his father being obsessed with his family's noses and Tristram's nose getting smashed by clumsy forceps work during his delivery), but the digressions, which are the central conceit of the book and can be humorous on their own, dilute the fun to the point of making it a tedious exercise to finish it. The author is clearly impressed with his own cleverness but also has a sense of humor about himself, but this cannot get the book to a level of enjoyment that reading Dickens or Thomas Hardy always achieves. The recent movie Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story hits all the highlights and is pretty amusing - I would recommend it instead. This was the first book I read on my new Kindle."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Sterne does indeed convey the limitations of fiction splendidly in this book. Tristram Shandy and the other characters here -- especially Tristram's uncle -- are also portrayed particularly well, since one gets to know them in the same way that one gets to know one's friends, that is, through haphazard, sometimes irrelevant, sometimes incomplete, stories about them that are not told in chronological order.In spite of these refreshing features, however, this book can be frustrating by the time one has reached the point of Tristram's birth, because, by this point, the magic has worn off. Sterne continues to play with the same narrative techniques he has displayed from the beginning of the book, But by now, one has grown weary of them and needs some tension to convince one to continue reading. If you've already got all of the meta-punchlines, so to speak, the rest of the book just seems like more of the same. Although I would strongly recommend this book, I have to confess that I left it halfway and would probably expect most readers who are amused by the book at the beginning to do the same once they have finished a few hundred pages."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Sterne does indeed convey the limitations of fiction splendidly in this book.

Yes, there are moments of great wit. However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book. It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing. It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree. Certainly a unique achievement, I guess. But so is Lou Reed's &quot;Metal Machine Music.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Although my motivation alone to read Life and Opinions speaks to its literary value (it is required reading for esteemed and illustrious Professor Priscilla \\"Sawcebox\\" Gilman's Eighteenth Century British Novels course at the prestigious and highly selective Vassar College in the scenic Hudson Valley of New York), I have discovered that it actually lives up to its assigned space in the canon. For those who are connoisseur-enough to understand that it takes patience, devotion, and a well-rounded understanding of vulgarity to get through an obra-maestra such as this, it is truly a fun read. At times I find myself daring to laugh out loud (lol) to Sterne's outlandish and fearless narrative. After such morally righteous (dull) tales as Pamela and Joseph Andrews, this novel is a welcome release. FINALLY here is an author who knows how to take charge of his readership and completely disregards their wishes while acknowledging and thriving off of their existence. Unlike the other little girly writers of his age who chew day and night on their anxiety of criticism, Sterne addresses his critics directly, super-manly, and does the most masculine thing of all: he makes fun of them. I mean, what better credit can one do for oneself other than to make a spectacle of those who think differently? In conclusion, don't attempt this one if you aren't a careful reader: it will just be words on a page, page after page, with a few anomalies stuck in. For the adventurous reader, carpe librum! However, I will offer one word of advice; watch for the pointed finger hand- therein little nuggets of truth, perfect for the mantle."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Having read a fair amount of 17th and 18th century European literature I looked forward to another good experience. Unfortunately Trisham Shandy did not live up to its reputation. Reading others review I saw words like Comical, Capricious and Deceptively Frivolous. I could find only a few pages out of the 500 that would justify these high praises. I found the book to start out slowly and then fizzle out altogether.My advice to those thinking of reading this book is to make sure that you have read all of the Voltaire and Swift that you can lay your hands on and then think of this one again."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Many things could be said about The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, funny, unique, and off-topic being a few of them. Personally, I would call The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy to be a rant of the longest degree. To prove my point, the main character isn't even born before the end of the second volume. It takes the character one year to write about one day in his life, so even if you enjoyed the book you would never get to read an end.To be fair, this is one of the first true novels ever written and is the very first stream of consciousness novel to ever be written. So with that in mind, it can go off once in a while on a rant because everyone does that in their own head once in awhile.The characters are rather creative, ranging from a king to a slightly strange mother, but the side trips get very annoying when you are trying to reach the end of the book. Do you honestly want to know what each person did months before the main character was even born? Do we really need to know what color this was and what Mr. Toby Shandy did to cause misfortune to his unborn son the moment he was conceived?Personally, this book was far too droning. I would much rather read something with more plot, and less stream of consciousness. I admit that maybe people would probably enjoy reading this book for its unique style, but I can not stand to read it. The tangents are too long and the overall style just isn't for me.With all that in mind, I say that The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy is a decent book with a good story to tell, and tell... and tell. So if you like older writings with a twisted sense of humor, pick this one up."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Dr. Johnson (he of the first dictionary) famously said about this book, An odd thing will not last. Little did he know. Dr. Johnson is no longer much read (though he is mentioned), but Sterne's odd masterpiece is read and chuckled over three hundred years after being written.Which just shows that the only definition of Art is: That which lasts. If it lasted, it is Art. If it didn't, then it isn't. (Or wasn't.) Opinions of individuals do not count, only those of Humanity as a whole, which votes with its Collective Attention over dozens, or preferably hundreds of years.

The result is \\"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,\\" a gloriously rambling, richly entertaining sort-of-novel.\\"I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me.\\" So begins Tristram, who starts his life story with his \\"begetting,\\" and attempts to tell the story of his birth and life, as well as the descriptions of relatives -- his lovable uncle Toby, his eccentric dad, his patient mother (who's in labor for most of the book).But as he tries to tell us about his life, Tristram keeps getting sidetracked by all the stories that surround him -- his uncle's romance with the Widow Wadman and the war in which he received a nasty wound in a sensitive spot, the French, the doctor who delivered him, letters in multiple languages, the parson, the personal history of the midwife, and what curses are appropriate for what occasions.Most novels are pretty straightforward -- they have a beginning, a middle and an end. But \\"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\\" totally ignores that, by having a beginning that lasts for the whole book, dozens of \\"middles,\\" and no real end (it just stops at a suitable spot). All of this is without a real structure.And he took this postmodern, break-all-the-rules mentality all the way, by including odd little illustrations -- when speaking of the death of Parson Yorick, Sterne includes a black page.

Sterne was a creative genius, and pulled no punches when telling the story of Tristram Shandy, gentleman. Not only is this a shaggy-dog story, and a prototype for &quot;experimental&quot; writers like James Joyce and William Burroughs, but it is also a (remarkably early) meditation on the self-referentiality of literature, and the fine (nonexistent?) separation between a book's abstract textual form and its physical, material, paper-and-ink form. Like a good postmodernist, Sterne realizes you can't very well separate the two.You didn't like this book? Well maybe Sterne didn't want you to like it. Maybe likeability should not be the primary project of a text. One of the meta-statements Sterne seems to be making is he has no respect for your time, nor your desire for narrative cohesion -- and why should he? Defiant, Sterne is. Very defiant. Cool."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"There is so much in this novel one hardly knows where to begin, which is Sterne's hilarious problem for the first 300 pages or so. Tristram Shandy is a comic masterpiece, like Fielding's Tom Jones, which arose barely after the invention of the genre. Even Sterne's name almost seems a play on words and it's easy to see why great minds who followed Sterne like Nietzsche (Note &quot;The Ass Festival&quot; in Zarathustra), Samuel Beckett (Waiting for Godot), James Joyce (Ulysses) and J.P. Donleavy (Darcy Dancer, Gentleman, The Singular Man, Balthazar B., The Ginger Man, Saddest Summer of Samuel S.) admired immensely and were influenced by him. One has to love the way that Toby explains to Mrs. Wadman where he was wounded during one of her sieges of his fortress. One has to laugh at Sterne's tearing out of chapters, allowing the reader to pencil in his favorite profanities, making sense of pages of black ink, marbled patterns, blank pages and squiggled lines marking little ups and downs -- as obscure as the raw meaning of life itself. He writes chapters about whiskers, noses, buttons and nothing. I especially enjoyed the dedications to famous persons before several of his volumes. The epigrams were delicious and the careful reader is rewarded on every page for paying close attention to Sterne's often subtle comic style. Sterne certainly opened up the genre with an experimental literary style in which he created a vibrant, raucous, hilarious novel still relevant 300 years after it was penned. I can't say enough about the contribution of this comic gem to the literary works that followed, especially in Ireland. If you're a serious reader with a sense of humor, you'll be amused and enlightened by Sterne's intrepid wit."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"I can't believe there aren't any reviews here, yet. At any rate, this is an absolutely fantastic book -- it's more performance art than anything else, really.

This accomplished editorial cartoonist pokes fun at 'heritage' illustration and costume drama, instead matching Sterne's words with his lively images and contemporary, knowing commentary. Though he shows an affectionate regard for the original, Rowson is not afraid to bring to his own work a brand of mockery not far from Sterne's.In comparison with John Baldessari's recent photo-collages illustrating the same novel, Rowson is much funnier, more accessible, and more faithful to the spirit of the original.In summary, a very funny, very successful re-interpretation of this sometimes difficult classic.

That was not usually an era of radical experimentation and, but Laurence Stern's TRISTRAM SHANDY is the oddest duck of English literature from that era. As the young gentleman Tristram Shandy sets out to write his memoirs and offer his views on life, he cannot help but going off on tangent after tangent. Only at the end of the second volume is he actually born. Soon the narrator basically gives up on his own autobiography, preferring to tell of the odd people around him. There is his eccentric Uncle Toby who, after being wounded in a siege at the turn of the 18th century, spends all his days constructing miniature citadels on his bowling green in which to play war games. There's his father, struggling to maintain the greatness of the Shandy family against his poor bad luck. And there is Parson Yorick, an Anglican cleric who doesn't always keep to the orthodox line, and so is a self-portrait of Sterne himself.The novel is revolutionary as literature, foretelling the narrative games and unreliable narration of 20th century Modernism. But is it actually fun to read? Sadly, I found TRISTRAM SHADY a wearying experience. This story based on digressions is woefully uneven, and for every laugh out loud moment there were two or three lame episodes.

One of the things that Sterne believed about humanity is that things were constantly changing; always in flux, if you will. Historically speaking, he was of the Lockian generation which displaced uman understanding into two categories, wit and association. Sterne was a believer in association, and attributed to that the idea of the &quot;hobby-horse.&quot; This meant the menial quirks that each and every human had, such is the case with the sexual expeditions of the characters within. With the idea of human flux and the hobby-horse, we are brought to the &quot;marble page,&quot; which is, in and of itself, a hermeneutical circle for defining the rest of the book. Sterne presents this page to illustrate uniqueness of individuals and the unpredeictability of the process of writing. Which brings me to my next point, the concept of narrative failure. Throughout the strange goings on of the book, we come to points in the writing in which Sterne includes the reader into the disorder of the narrative. In Volume IV, Sterne mentions the process of the book in which he has done one year of writing, and yet come only to the first day of his life. This is the failure he is showing us, and the manner in which he creates this outrageous tale. These two aspects of Tristram Shandy are intrical in understanding and enjoying the chaos of this book."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"I just wanted to note that pages 29 and 30 of this edition are supposed to be black, not blank. Whether this was a simple mistake by the publisher or just a way to save money-two black pages must take alot of ink-doing so alters the possible interpretation of Sterne's work. Given the fact that Sterne closely watched the original publishers to prevent deviations from his intent, I expect that Sterne would be appalled that the black pages were not included.Otherwise, I have no negative comments about the work. While many complain that the narrator jumps around to much and it is difficult to understand, that is part of the fun of reading the book. The narrator essentially makes the reader a character in the book-ground breaking methods which are way before his time.

You'll be happier."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"This novel has the length of a Victorian work but both its vocabulary and subject matter are not at all puritan. Themes discussed include for instance intra-uterine baptism and accidental circumcision!The running joke is that the reporter constantly digresses from his digressions and seems incapable of ever getting to his point. In this pseudo-autobiographical work, the narrator's birth finally happens only a good fourth into the book! Presumably, the intent is to be comical but the result is rather silly and even tedious to a modern reader.Published in nine volumes in the 1760's, the novel definitely appears unstructured. It ends without any true conclusion and one feels that many more volumes could have been written and published. Anyhow, there is no plot as such and, despite the title, little is actually learned about Tristram Shandy and his life. The main characters are really his father, a superficial man with very set preconceived notions on a whole series of subjects, and his rather pathetic and anti-social uncle, marked by his war injury _ in the groin!The author succeeds in being very original in a variety of ways: by very frequently addressing the reader, by limiting some chapters to a single sentence and even including blank ones, by making very long quotations in French and Latin or long pointless lists such as the number of streets in each of the various Paris neighbourhoods, etc.Overall, this book can only be recommended to those interested in the history of the British novel with a marked curiosity for atypical 18th century works."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"\\"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\\" is a terrific novel; yet it is very demanding upon the reader. Before you begin to read this book you must first have read Don Quixote, and more importantly Henry Fielding's Tom Jones. No one should really even attempt to read Shandy if you have not read Tom Jones because Fielding's novel will at least \\"warm up\\" a reader to the writing style in Shandy. Also, you should be very aware of Locke and his views as they are deeply seeded into this novel as well. If you do not have a strong literature background, I do not recommend reading this novel as it will either only confuse you or you may miss very important aspects of Shandy. (Even an undergrad literature education is probably not enough for one to fully comprehend this work). However, if you do decide to read Shandy, make sure you have a good version of the book, I recommend the Penguin Classics. Of all the versions of Shandy which I have encounted I have found Penguin Classics to have the best Notes in the back of the book. Also, if you are going to read this novel, ***read the notes in the back as well, they are there for a reason and quite helpful.(Another important hint, research Sterne's life before reading this novel; one cannot fully comprehend a work without great knowledge of the author)"},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"When Laurence Sterne, in 1760 wrote the first volume of TRISTRAM SHANDY in what was to be a series of nine, no one had any idea what this new genre of literature was meant to be. The only models that Sterne had were Henry Fielding and Samuel Richardson, so the field was pretty much wide open in terms of any competitor's choice of content, style, or theme. Sterne noted from these two that their successes were based on their characters' being placed in wildly varying and potentially threatening situations. He took these twin concepts of changeable location and possible harm which he incorporated into the first volume of Tristram Shandy, and then proceeded to turn the incipient world of novel writing over on its very young head. What differentiated this book from those of Fielding and Richardson was Sterne's abandoning the tidy world of the classical insistence on the need for unity. In a style that centuries later would be adopted by Joyce and Proust, Sterne twisted the relation between plot and time into a pretzel. To begin with, the title itself is a misnomer. The titular hero, Tristram, is not even born until midway through the book. He is born, appears briefly, disappears for lengthy periods of time, and then reappears briefly at the end. A more honest title would have been \\"The Life and Times of the Father and Uncle of Tristram Shandy.\\" It is Walter Shandy, Tristram's father and Toby Shandy, the uncle, who dominate most of the action. And it is not simply a misdirection of who the primary protagonist is to be that gives TRISTRAM SHANDY its off beat flavor. What distinguishes this book from both its predecessors and most of its descendants is Sterne's refusal to use structured time as the unifying glue.When Sterne presents his action in a manner that seems to defy the laws of causality in that results may precede causes, he does so by his novel use of the association of ideas which act to reconnect threads of thought that are snipped here and spliced there. Such cycles of snipping and splicing lead to digressions such as when in Volume II, the removal of Walter Shandy's wig leads his brother to be reminded of military tactics from his participation in a long past war. Such digressions take on a life of their own, like baby universes after the Big Bang with each one branching off to a possibly related clone. Sterne asks a lot of his readers to tolerate these rapid and often extended shifts in time and perspective. For those readers who are nimble enough of mind to follow, they are treated to some very comic scenes of humor that range from the broadest of satire to the most scatological of coarse jesting. By the time that Tristram makes his initial appearance, the reader has already learned to anticipate the many detours (some would call them roadblocks) of time and space that Sterne has inserted. Many of these scenes of digressive humor are so bizarre and pathetic, that the reader is not sure whether he should laugh or cry. And that perhaps is the magic that causes each new generation of readers to return and follow the twisted paths of time and space that even now can wring tears and laughs from them, sometimes in the same breath."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"There is a spirit of Tristram Shandy I am not sure I know how to define it. It is a making a game of everything in life including the writing of novels. It is a spirit of play which finds in the most commonplace things surprising reversals of fortune. It is in people who are stuck in their own character and for whom character is a gesture of repetition. It is for each and every thing not being where it should be, and not being what it should be but something else and different from what we expected it to be. It is an upside down turn around world where the child wonders what its parents were about when they begot him and the parents do not know why and where the clock in their hearts was ticking so fast at that particular moment.. It is much matter confounded with more mind, and above all that kind of surprise which makes us laugh.As one Amazon reader wrote even Sterne's name is a kind of fitting upside down crazy joke."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"No need for me to precise or set out plot, for if you read this review you may well have plodded through the 70+ reviews already available on the site, some of which do that in detail. (Possibly in itself the 70+ is an index of how popular this book still is.)Despite having heard a bit about it, twigging that it was a big joke, a shaggy dog story, I have to admit to not enjoying it the first time nearly as much I had expected to. However, I picked up some fabulous quotes, as well as timeless turns of phrase.Now I am reading it a second time, some years after that first read. This time I am enjoying it a lot more. I still find his ancient sentence form often confusing, and am sometimes left without understanding of his intent. But in the main I am picking up many more jokes than I did the first time around, and seeing in the dialogue particularly some delicious send-ups and gentle put-downs.There is one particular section, where Mr Shandy is talking of his desires for his new son, and a group of them get to discussing famous babies and how good they were at very young ages. Each tries to up the ante on the previous speaker by making his subject younger, until finally we get to one who describes how an infant gave forth some genius fresh upon birth. (Whereby Uncle Toby proclaims he should have been cleaned up immediately.) This sketch reminded me of the old Yorkshiremen in Monty Python, upping each other on the \\"we had it tuff\\" theme. I laughed and laughed. Now, I missed the significace of that at first read. So it has been well worth my while to take it on again. It suggests that as years go by I should aim to read it again and again.A true classic. Four stars."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"Due to all the previous reviews, we know the plot and themes of this work: Shandy tells us his story while beating around the bush. He tells us about his uncle and other stories that he thinks are necessary to explain his own life -the joke is that he really doesn't tell us much about himself and what we do get to know is spread out over the entire book. He sees himself as unfortunate due to some events caused by circumstances not of his control -his nose is flattened, he is accidentally circumcised, he was named Tristam by accident and so on.I get this was written a long time ago and was a book pioneering the concept of a novel and it was supposed to be a comedy. BUT, I found it too difficult to read due to all the scattered plot elements and interjected stories that really had nothing to do with what I was trying to find out - Tristam's real own story. That's what was supposed to be funny - Tristam putting off his own life story. But, it irritated me more than anything to have to wait and wait and ride out the convoluted episodes.I like reading classics. The title of the book intrigued me. Others had given it great reviews, so I wanted to give it a shot. But, this was just not my thing at all. The writing style it was written in was too difficult for me to stick with. I don't want to give it less than three stars because I recognize this has merit and is a classic of sorts. But, it did not make it a fun read for me. I am taking the advice of others and will watch the movie version - and will also read the History of Tom Jones to see if I find it to be more enlightening."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"With &quot;Tristram Shandy,&quot; Sterne invented postmodernism 200 years before it supposedly was initiated by the likes Joyce, Burroughs and Pynchon. The book is hilarious. It is supposed to be the life and opinions of the narrator. Instead, it takes about fourhundred pages to even get to when he was born. The book radically changes tone in the last hundred pages (as, I think, Sterne was nearing death), and the then present day Shandy is finally presented. Some of these scenes are touching, but the final chapters become redundant. The book is completely inconsistent, the narrator interrupts at all possible times ... But it works! Read this book, but be advised to possibly skim the last fifty pages."},{"Title":"Tristram Shandy","review":"While I had to force myself to finish it, placed in the context of 18th Century literature, this book has some surprisingly witty moments. Sterne is extremely self concious of himself as a writer, there are moments when he is speaking to the narrator that are both funny and confusing (it's hard to tell when he's speaking to the narrator). I would reccomend this book for those readers who are looking for a challenge and who know a LOT about 18th C. novels. Otherwise, you'll probably be bored and perplexed. It's a love it or hate it kind of book and there's a good reason why most literary scholars won't go near it. It was extremely popular when it was published, but as far I as know, only the connoisseurs like it now."},{"Title":"Meals On The Move : Rush Hour Recipes (Trim & Terrific)","review":"I have all of Holly Clegg's cookbooks and I think that &quot;Meals On The Move&quot; is my all time favorite.

The weakness of the book can be nicely summarized by Holt, himself (this is on pages 310 and 311 of my copy ofTall Stories: Contains Expecting Someone Taller and Ye Gods! (Omnibus)(just after the main character (Jason) meets Prometheus)). Prometheus asks Jason what he thinks of the morality of the situation. With the following ellipses being mine, Jason replies:\\"...'Think?' ...'Morality?' Jason's brow furrowed, and he considered long and hard. 'Dunno,\\" he said at last.... 'It's not something I think about a lot... in my line of work. I'm more, you know, blue-collar. Mine not to reason why, that sort of thing.... The way I see it is, somebody somewhere knows what's going on, so who am I to make difficulties?'\\"Now, I realize that I don't read Holt for depth. I read him for light, clever humor. But, that exchange is Jason (the main character, mind you) in a nutshell. There's almost nothing in the book about what Jason thinks of anything, why he's doing things, what he wants, etc.. He just reacts to things. Usually, people complain about lack of character DEVELOPMENT in a book. Well, in this case, we don't get any character AT ALL. Essentially, we get a lot of actions and events, but nothing that makes them MEAN anything. To make some modifications to Macbeth:\\"... [Jason's] but a walking shadow, a poor player,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage.......It is a tale......full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.\\"That said, the events, actions, and situations in the book are described with Holt's usual good wittiness and technical writing ability. If he had just done the same for the motivations behind them, this would have been another very good book. But, unfortunately, I'll have to rate this at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Ye Gods!","review":"This book has everything I look for in Holt. Good fun, literate humor and a plot that won't tax the mind too deeply. It centers on Jason, a nice enough young man. He has a few bad habits, like killing things, and he sometimes wanders off to supernatural realms without leaving a number where he can be reached. Outside of that, he's the kind you might take home to meet your family. Then there's his family ...Holt manages to sustain a seriously slanted view of a world that very nearly makes sense.

She figured out from the Books of Mormon and from the Bible that we are not meant to die, but to conquer aging and death, and then translate into light.

She writes in very biblical language and describes, at points, her own relationship to the process and what she felt Jesus was teaching her in her prayers. Although I prefer a more Buddhist approach, there is something wonderful whenever anyone makes their faith work for them and creates positive and loving changes in their lives. It is rare, too, that we hear about any demonstration of such an advanced state of being in our time period. Whether or not she actually translated into light is something each person is going to need to decide for themselves, but if a person wants a tested map about how to translate into light, this just might be the one that speaks to you."},{"Title":"Ye Gods!","review":"Holt must be in serious debt.

It is a history of the social reform movement to liberate women from domestic constraints in south India between 1870-1930. In this era of ethnic and national awakening, Indian men and women refashioned educational norms for women, while they tried to overturn the customs of early marriage, the ban on widow remarriage, and women's domestic seclusion. Hindu, Muslim, and Chrisitan reformers began modern schools with a secular but Indianized curriculum in response to European missionary proselytization and to drab government schools. They fought to raise the legal age for marriage, challenged erroneous interpretations of religious texts on widow remarriages; 'rescued' temple dancers called devadasis from prostitution; and attempted to remove the custom of female 'pardah' seclusion amongst Muslims. The book critically examines their idealism and prejudices through various sources. These include private and public school records from the 18th-20th centuries; colonial government and missionary records; letters from reformers; Tamil novels; journal essays by women and men; biographies and autobiographies; oral history."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"In the early pages of Josh Emmons' splendid first novel, THE LOSS OF LEON MEED, the author notes that dreams and the imagination, \\"like all engines of terror and transcendence, can do anything,\\" and with those words guides the reader into this delectable story. The book explores the ambiguous conjunction of reality and the imagination through the intertwined experiences of a cast of about a dozen main characters. It is an audacious and spellbinding debut.The mysterious Leon Meed, who appears and disappears throughout the novel, is perplexed by his journey into, and out of, the lives of the townspeople of Eureka, California, just as those residents are puzzled by Leon's sudden appearances. This gives the book a fascinating structure and provides for moments that are both comic and evocative as Emmons explores traditional themes of loss, love, redemption, and forgiveness.Emmons is a solid novelist--and, if he ever turns his hand to short fiction or screen plays, he'll prove to be an excellent writer in those genres as well. He has a wonderful gift for characterization, dialogue, and sensory description. The cast of characters is varied, by age, gender, race, national origin, and personal experience. He is equally adept, for instance, at creating a young Korean who longs for love and wants to start his own restaurant, a black man who is a recovering alcoholic, and a middle-aged female school teacher whose marriage is dissolving. Emmons is also capable of making the small town of Eureka into one of the novel's main characters.I won't give away the story. It is too good to spoil. Emmons can do amazing things with language to evoke moods and feelings and characters. He is in firm control of this material, but one of the things I most admire about the book is that the author doesn't tie things up neatly. This is a novel about mysteries, about the important things in life that are hardest to grasp. The book's emotional and beautifully written epilogue--perhaps the most affecting passage in the book--leaves the reader with a deep appreciation for the power of the unknown.This is a terrific book. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"For anyone living in northern California and has spent time in Eureka, this book is a must. It is beautifully written both in tone and description."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"I had difficulty putting this book down. As someone who grew up in Eureka, I was impressed with how Josh Emmons was able to capture the essence of the town, of Humboldt County and in general of the lost coast of California. For those not familiar with the area, you will feel like you've been there after reading this book. Each character was a true representation of the odd mix of people one can find in this strange town in one of the most beautiful places in California. I couldn't wait to find out what was next in store for each character as I turned the pages.Lines like \\"it was 4:30 and Barry was not gay\\" - to describe a young man at the cusp of admitting his homosexuality to himself - were constantly popping up in this book. The writing is fresh and takes chances.Loved it."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"The author manages at once to evoke the vast expanses of the astral planes and the microscopic and endless labyrinths of the human heart. From the first page, drawn deftly into the into the familiar, yet layered world of Eureka, California, I was hooked. Emmons takes us into the lives of a disparate troupe of seekers--some of whom do not know, at first, that they so yearn--all whirling around the cryptic figure of Leon Meed. Eureka is not just the setting of this book, it is the feeling that one gets on the last page. I had never been to Eureka, but now I can say I have found it. Thanks to this author. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"This is one of the smartest, funniest, most well-written novels I have ever read. How Emmons manages to lasso a dozen different characters-all of them real, all of them alive-into a single forceful narrative set in Eureka, Ca. (of all places) defies imagination. It is a Tolstoyian feat that, alas, may be lost on those who prefer Potter to Proust. Emmons is that rare talent that, like Murakami, implants unforgettable images into the minds of his readers, not through gimmickry or stylistic affections (are you listening Saffron Foer?) but the old fashion way: through smart, simple, and clean prose. Prose so clean you can eat off it. This is literary genius. Eureka, indeed!"},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"Josh Emmons has created an imaginative, page-turner of a novel with a host of charactors from the mists of northern California. The charactors seem like Humboldt County singulars, reminiscent of Sherwood Anderson's grotesques from Winesburg, Ohio. An excellent, comic and complex first novel."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"\\"The Loss of Leon Meed\\" is a book you don't want to leave for a second. I read it in two days, captivated by the painfully real characters making their way through the quirky alternative culture of Eureka, California--each character as distinct as this hideaway town. Josh Emmons has done something I haven't seen in recent novels--somehow he's raised the questions of how we interpret the ghostly, the bodily, the miraculous and the mundane, all at once in this amazingly crafted, sometimes hilarious story. Because of all the unanswerable questions this book approaches, I think it is perfect for book group discussions. It's endless with possibility. I'm telling everyone I know about this book."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"The whacky, compelling, suffering characters living in Eureka, California unravel the mystery of the missing Leon Meed.

A great read!"},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"Few things please me as much as an ambitious debut. And with TLOLM, Emmons has given us just that! Expertly juggling a large, colorful and wildly divergent cast of characters in Eureka, California, Emmons manages to achieve a sort of Dickensian fluidity with the mysterious disappearing act that is Leon Meed as his nexus. These characters will stick with you."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"The smarminess of the author started really getting to me about midway through the book. The small town nature of the book and people that make up such a city is such an easy target to tackle as an author. Much Like building a small city out of Legos, it is fun for a few moments if you are really bored. But then after awhile it just seems like it is a waste of time to keep pretending.That is what this book is like, a big exercise, in sheer authorial vanity, it almost made me offended."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"Emmons' novel, it's true, has a broad cast of characters, but each is so well characterized that they are easily distinguished from each other if the reader is willing to actually read the words on the page.Each character has a vivid and distinct character from the next, lending the book a variety and scope that is sure to entrance the reader! And, accordingly, each character understands the mysterious appearances and disappearances of Leon Meed in their own appropriate way.This book is a delightful read; it was great to curl with in bed and yet it also grabbed my attention mid-afternoon. It's an any time, any person kind of a novel, and those don't come along often!"},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"If your someone with a limited attention span seeking a good casual read this is for you. Yes, there is a larger cast of characters under the protagonist, and it does take a while to sort out who is who. However the characters share an indirect connection to eachother so it makes it easier to identify them. Each of the passages are short and distinctly marked so it makes it easy to leave and come back. The book is divided into three sections further simplifying the reading. It is an under the radar book from a new author and is original, well written, and flows like a swift cool creek in summer. The diverse characters, contemporary conflicts (i.e. homosexuality, redefining of family, and addiction problems), attention to setting, macabre plot, make this work a good example of contemporary Americana. It does not follow the trend of many contemporary Americana works, crappy writing pretending to be good. It is a book you only have to read once, so its better to get it from a library. I look forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"Emmons has created a cast of characters so distinct and engaging, they stay with you long after you've finished the book. The answer to what the mystery of Leon Meed means to each of these men and women is as individual and complex as they are, so readers looking for a simple answer may be frustrated. But readers who appreciate richly drawn characters portrayed with frankness and humor will not be able to put this book down. The story surprised me at every turn, up to and including the very end. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"The Loss of Leon Meed is a tour de force--crisp, funny, insightful, with a magical plot that builds to an unforgettable conclusion. I stayed up long past my bedtime finishing the book, and I kept thinking about Eureka and its inhabitants for days afterward. Josh Emmons creates an astounding cast of characters--I grew to love all of them, even the villains--and through them he tenderly, hopefully asks what we are doing here in this life. Emmons allows each character to find his or her own answer, or to find an answer that leads to the next question. A beautiful, generous book."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"I should have hated this book. I lived in Eureka for 16 formative years. I graduated from the same high school as the author, and too aspire to write novels, none of which have, as yet, made it to paper much less shelf.Like is not strong enough a word to describe my admiration for this work (though Love is admittedly too strong -- and too gay). This book is at once intriguing in its American everytown/no-town details and with its able determination to enthrall the reader with a delicately woven handful of characters, each despicable and attractive in his/her own unique way.Shall I dare say it? I had trouble putting it down. Like many of the most memorable things experienced, it carefully avoided bashing me over the head with anything (moral, meaning, false profundity), and instead rang true with sincerity.And sincerity does not come easily."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and would highly recomend it. It has it's odd moments and explicit moments but overall holds your interest and keeps you wondering and thinking until the very end. Congratulations to Mr. Emmons on a great novel."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"THE LOSS OF LEON MEED marks the beginning of a brilliant literary career. In this novel Josh Emmons weaves a hilarious tapestry of small-town life in Eureka, California, where everyone is lonely one way or another and living mainly inside their heads. Emmons can inhabit a 15 year-old Wiccan as effectively as a middle-aged Korean man, channeling their small hopes and fears like a ventriloquist. It is a pleasure to be in the company of such a droll and intelligent writer."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"I was blown away by the Loss of Leon Meed, and by the author's uncanny ability to see the world through the eyes of the characters. It's been a long time since I've read such an effective novel, one of this magnitude and scope. The language is beautiful and the story is a page-turner. I've already bought the book for three of my friends, and one read it in two days. I savored it, every word, and I'm sure you will too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"I found the characters difficult to distinguish. There were so many characters that I got confused. Most of them were not distinctive enough to be remembered, so I kept having to go back and see which character I was reading about. Eventually, I gave up and could not finish the book. It was too much effort. The writing was fine, but certainly not captivating."},{"Title":"The Loss of Leon Meed: A Novel","review":"This book is pretty funny in the beginning. But as the the story unfolds you get the sense that the author is trying to make the characters in the book \\"supremely meaningful\\", when if it was just about the humor and interaction between the people that populate the weird hamlet in which this book takes place, you would have a pretty comical book and pretty good, then it just drags."},{"Title":"Newnes Control Engineering Pocket Book (Newnes Pocket Books)","review":"This is a great book for Control systems.

A major instance of a contemporary poet whose writing deserves attention from a wider readership is Philip Levine. His book, &quot;What Work Is&quot; won the National Book Award for poetry in 1991. He has produced an impressive quantity of poetry which, in its very restraint and poignancy, can help bring meaning to people.This is a short collection, consisting of four untitled sections. Section III consists of a single extended poem, &quot;Burning&quot; which is broadly autobiographical in character. The remaining three sections consist of a number of short poems with essentially two themes: the lives of the working poor prior to WWII and Levine's experiences as a boy growing up in Detroit. The poems with these themes overlap and are interspersed throughout the book with the earlier sections emphasizing vignettes of individuals doing the ordinary, desultory jobs that are the lot of most of us (such as &quot;Coming Close&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Every Blessed Day&quot; and &quot;What Work Is&quot;) while the latter section emphasizes Levine's Detroit experiences, the toughness of being a kid, his relationship with his brother, his love of boxing, and his exposure to Anti-Semitism. (&quot;Coming of Age in Michigan&quot;, &quot;The Right Cross&quot;, &quot;The Sweetness of Bobby Hefka&quot; &quot;On the River&quot;.)The poems are lucidly written with understatement and a lack of sentimentality which underscores the emotions and the passions they contain. It might be useful to compare these poems to the work of three other writers.First, the poems reminded me of Walt Whitman, in their compassion for an attempt to understand the American worker. They lack Whitman's bravura and optimism, however, and content themselves with painting harshness and with emphasizing the tenacity people need to get by.A writer with somewhat similar themes to Levine is the under-appreciated Victorian novelist, George Gissing in his books of lower class life in Victorian London such as The Nether World. Levine has a similar sort of attraction to the life of the poor, the unsuccessful and the down and out. He has at once a sympathy for his characters and a distance from them that Gissing seems to lack, for all his portrayals and descriptions.A third writer is the late poet-nnovelist Charles Bukowski, a favorite of &quot;underground&quot; readers. Bukowski writes of ne'r do wells, prostitutes, and drunkards, -- as well as doing a lot of writing about himself. Levine has some of the same attraction to the scorned of society, but his people are the working poor, and their stories are told with restraint and dignity, unlike those of Bukowski, and also unlike the work of Bukowski, with literary skill and grace.This is a book of poetry that has both the sadness and the grittiness of life and the toughness to understand and surmount it."},{"Title":"What Work Is","review":"A devotion of Levine's life's work, the world of work, at last becomes one of his book's true focus and shows Levine, one of our greatest living poets, at his best. The controlled lyricism of his narratives hone in with precision, as when he pulls in on a woman's forearm at work, a minute detail in a vast world of labor to show us the universality of a struggle Levine himself has endured. While not every poem lives in the factories and workplaces, the fundamental aspect of work in our lives manifests itself in each piece. The short lines and continual enjambment gives his stanzas both the feel and appearence of quality reportage and yet are infused with an empathy and passion for his subjects that both moves and educates. This is the democratization of poetry that Wordsworth aspired to and Whitman acheived. Levine carries on in that tradtion and concretizes, with this book, his place among those American poets to be read in the next century."},{"Title":"What Work Is","review":"Philip Levine's \\"What Work Is\\" represents one of the most powerful reflections on labor in modern American history, comparable to some of the great Walt Whitman's own compositions on the lives of those defined by the sweat of their brow and the strain in their backs.Levine's words are at once intensely emotional while also tightly crafted with the elegant precision of a jeweler. Each piece dignifies its subject with a timeless quality that manages to avoid the sentimentality of similar attempts to ennoble the working poor.One of the greatest accomplishment of the book is Levine's ability to structure complex meditations with a language that suits his subjects; each piece challenges its reader to dig into the text with the same shoulder-to-the-wheel dedication of those described in each poem.\\"What Works Is\\" is a book best suited to those who desire a permanent addition to their library worthy of reconsidering every few years, for it is a piece that rewards those who accept its challenge to pore over each poem with the tenacity of a farmer in a field or a lumberjack in the forest. The deepest beauty of Levine's poetry is revealed in the third and fourth reading, after the reader himself has unwrapped the words in the joyful labor of discovering what work is."},{"Title":"What Work Is","review":"Mr. Levin does a great job with the poems by associating them to the life he had when he was working in the jobs he is refering to. He also gives a sense of hope that although people work these jobs they do not like but they still work them to support their families. Great book of peoms to relate with the days of old and looking forward."},{"Title":"Best of Greek Cuisine: Cooking With Georgia","review":"This is an excellent book on Greek cookery. It is filled with tasty recipes that you would find served in any Greek home.

Chef Sarianides was born in Amalada in Peloponnese, Greece, and this cookbook contains the traditional Greek recipes that she learned in her Mother's kitchen, and also those that she has created herself. All of the recipes are uncomplicated, delicious, and satisfying.This 176-page cookbook is divided into five sections, Soups, Salads, and Vegetables, Savory Pies, Main Meals, Fish, and Pastries. The recipes represent a wide selection of traditional Greek foods, including such favorites as spanakopita, dolmades, pastitsio, and Greek meatballs. The instructions are straightforward and easy to follow, and most recipes are prefaced with additional background information or serving suggestions. Recipe titles are in English, followed by the Greek translation. The cookbook does not offer photographs, although black and white line drawings are included.I particularly enjoyed the additional reference material this cookbook had to offer. For example, the Herbs and Spices section lists and defines the popular seasonings used in Greek cooking, such as basil, oregano, and olive oil. The General Food Tips section provides practical advice for choosing, preparing, and storing all types of foods, including garlic, tomatoes, and chicken. The Working with Phyllo dough section provides valuable tips and advice, and the Wine Selections section outlines the origin of six different Greek wines, and offers serving suggestions.I highly recommend this cookbook as a wonderful source of traditional Greek recipes, and as a valuable reference for anyone interested in Greek cuisine."},{"Title":"Best of Greek Cuisine: Cooking With Georgia","review":"This is a wonderful greek cookbook.

Besides much research (I personally enjoy the footnote information), I was very moved by the last 2 chapters; Hell, followed by heaven.There is one point in the chapter on Judgement that went on a bit longer than I found needful, utilizing a story from another writer, O'Connor. I may've missed his point there, but got bored with that part and skipped over it!I was glad the chapter on hell was placed before that of Heaven.

There are many quotes from famous and not-so-famous people intermixed with his own observations. Always orthodox Catholic viewpoints.

Excellent choice for research but not necessarily for those looking for a quick review of the subject."},{"Title":"The Last Things: Death, Judgment, Hell, Heaven","review":"As a practicing and believing Catholic I found Dr. Martin's book fascinating.

The author draws on Catholic 20th c. poets and many other literary sources, but has no sympathy for any of the divergent theological positions even within his own tradition. This is a good readable presentation but it has an idealogical edge that will turn off liberal Catholics, many Protestants and almost all secular readers."},{"Title":"The Last Things: Death, Judgment, Hell, Heaven","review":"In fact, I bought this book on recommendation, thinking that it actually was a book of quotations.

Her mother is forcing her to stick with ballet, even though she wants nothing more than to rock out on her hidden guitar, Roxie; her older sister, Venus, is a certifiable genius, and now Nova's going crazy. I mean, she has to be. After all, it's not everyday that someone claims to have seen a secret message pop-up on the screen of the ATM machine, like Nova did. Her message? \\"Act like a rock star in front of a group of strangers.\\" How would the ATM machine know that she loved the guitar, and that she truly wanted to be a rock star? Now, in between her daily duties as a library volunteer, ballet prima donna, and Joe Tsai gazer, Nova has to also play the part of detective to figure out what is truly going on.From the very first page of NOVA ROCKS! I knew that STAR SISTERZ was bound to be a popular new series for middle readers. Nova is a fabulous character, who has the snottiness of a 14-year-old, accompanied by the need to be cool, and normal feelings of not being accepted. Her lingo is hip, and will draw readers in by the hundreds. Overall, this is a wonderful new book that will leave readers grappling for the next release in the series CARMEN DIVES IN.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Nova Rocks: Star Sisterz, #1","review":"The Star Sisterz series has been the redemption of my daughter's reading habits. She refused to read for a long time until I gave her the first book Nova Rocks. She devoured the entire series in just under two weeks.

I have been teaching \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" for the past thirty years, and during that time have accumulated numerous reference materials to aid in my understanding of this most American of classic novels. Let's start with the claims on the front cover:\\"The Complete Original Work\\" - Yes, this is the complete, unabridged addition of the novel. Unfortunately, it includes fewer than a half dozen of the original E.W. Kemble illustrations.\\"Expert Commentary\\" - Richard P. Wasowski has a masters degree and taches literature and writing at Ashland High School in Ohio. He groups the novel's 43 chapters into twenty-one clusters. At the end of each of these clusters, he provides insightful commentary covering both plot and theme. The average length of this commentary is a single page. A couple times it is two pages, but many times it is only a half page.\\"Notes and Definitions\\" - There are brief notes at the beginning of each chapter. These essentially are a quick summary of what to expect in the chapter before actually reading. (I'm not sure of the advantage of these summaries. In my mind, they are plot spoilers for the first-time reader.) The definitions, on the other hand, are a different story. These are very helpful. I wish the edition that I use in the classroom (see my review for ISBN 0-486-44322-1) had this feature. This novel was published more than a hundred years ago, and words that every reader would have known then, are too obscure for most of today's reader to know. Here's the list of words just from chapter 1: sugar-hogshead, victuals, snuff, middling hard, pecking. In addition to definitions located on the outside margins of the page, each word is boldfaced in the text.\\"Exclusive Character Map\\" - This one's a stretch. On page 14, there is a list of eight of the characters and a chart to show how they connect to Huck, but this is of marginal help. There is no comprehensive list of all of the characters.However, what IS informative are pages 1-13. Here we are provided with important information on Mark Twain and the novel itself which provides some historical background to enhance the appreciation and understanding of \\"Huck Finn.\\"At the conclusion of the novel, there is a review test that includes both objective and short answer questions (and an answer key). There is also a list of discussion questions and activities.Bottom line? This would be an excellent teacher resource for someone who has never taught \\"Huck Finn\\" before. However, I would not recommend it for student use. Too many of them would skip the text and simply read the notes and the commentary, and doesn't that defeat the purpose of reading a novel? Could some of my struggling students benefit from this? If they used it as a resource instead of an alternative to actually reading it, then, yes. But let's be real, most of my students would be looking for shortcuts, not extra reading."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Cliffs Complete)","review":"Cliff Notes are great, especially when its the first time you are teaching a novel you are not familiar with.

The book's &quot;Ages and Stages&quot; section was one we always anxiously referred to when one of our children was doing something unusual. It was reassuring to us to find out they were each very normal for their age. In fact, it almost seemed like the particular section had been written after observing what our kids were doing at that specific stage in their development. Today it is not unusual for one of our children to call us with a question they have about their kids. Even though our original copy is over 35 years old, the examples and descriptions still fit. Many things may have changed over the years, but children seem to develop and react similarly to specific situations.

For some reason, the age diffence bothered me. So, I purchased a used book from Amazon due to my skepticism. But, the book turned out to be time-tested afterall. The authors mentioned early on in the book that children's behavioral cycle can shift on the age time-line, but that the order of the cycles are quite stable. I'm assuming that it depends on whether a child is more or less advance than his/her peers and what environmental issues are involved (i.e. parents getting a divorce, moving to a new location, switching schools, etc...). I've found the cycles to be quite accurate so far.I love the feeling of knowing what my kids are going through are a perfectly normal behavioral stages in their lives and that they will grow in and out of them. I feel calmer knowing rather than stressing over things that my kids do. My daughter is shy/reserved one year (i.e. won't volunteer during circle time or stand up when it's her turn for show and tell) and a major risk-taker who's outgoing the next (i.e. will run around the neighborhood ringing doorbells and phoning friends out to play). I guess God made us that way to balance us out (i.e. to prepare us to be more balanced adults. Otherwise, we'd be stuck either as super shy or as a major risk-taker if we are not allowed by our parents to try out both ends of the spectrum to get to that equilibrium."},{"Title":"Child behavior,","review":"Really good book with descriptive information...not prescriptive.

It gives common and not-so-common types of behavior arranged according to age. It also gives explanations and some advice. When children start doing something new and unexpected, I look up the notes around that age, and find that it's common and passes. It's very reassuring. Also reading ahead can prepare you for what's to come."},{"Title":"Michael Hague's Magical World of Unicorns","review":"I have been a fan of Michael Hague's unicorns since 1986, when my parents bought me a calendar featuring his artwork. His unicorns are absolutely fantastic! This book is no exception to that. The drawings are vivid in detail and color. One could get lost in his paintings for hours! As he has does in his other book, The Book of Dragons, Hague uses poems and quotes describing unicorns to accompany his pictures. I highly recommend this book to any unicorn or fantasy lover or Hague lover, adult or child.

This book is about Helmuth James Graf (Count) von Moltke, a fascinating member of the conscience-based German resistance in WWII. While this figure particularly intrigued me for his serious Christianity, I believe even non-Christians would find much to admire in his conscientious, principled resistance against the Nazi menace, from within.This biography contains hundreds of Motlke's more than 1600 letters to his wife Freya from 1939 to 1945. Because both of their handwriting was wretched, the legacy of Moltke's family name, and his work inside military intelligence, he was able to write quite openly and unhindered to his wife about countless details of the regime's atrocities, his office's attempts to blunt those evils, the development of his thought, and the rich love he had for his bride and their children.Moltke was the great-grandson of Bismarck's Field Marshall and the man who founded the estate of Kreisau in what is now Poland. Incidentally he was also the grand-nephew of the Kaiser's Chief of General Staff in the first half of World War I. His parents were some of the most prominent Christian Scientists in Germany, including being the main translators of 'Science and Health' into German, yet they raised their children as Lutherans. As the family estate had become heavily indebted and because he did not wish to be a rural farmer vocationally, Moltke sought a legal career, pursuing it in both Germany and successfully passing the English bar. He would later use this career for great good, first as a lawyer in Berlin in the 1930s who assisted Jewish families in fleeing the country. Though offered a judgeship, he declined it because he would have to join the Nazi Party. In August 1939, he successfully got posted to the International Law section of the Abwehr, German Military Intelligence.From this posting, he did a number of remarkable things to blunt the evils of the German regime. For instance, he successfully pushed for better treatment of POWs and captured resistance soldiers using international law. He also used his posting to warn Danish officials about the impending deportation of its Jewish population, ensuring that an overwhelming majority of them would safely escape the country. Moltke also arranged for a copy of the last phamplet the White Rose student resistance created to England for it to be distributed across Europe en masse. Moltke also provided assistance to various resistance movements against the Third Reich in Europe.He also helped informally gather a group of German clergy and laymen to help discuss ways that a crushed and defeated Germany could be rebuilt along Christian lines. While one may disagree with some of the ideas in it, particularly his economics, bottom-up societal structure, or his explicitly Christian foundations for this state, Moltke nonetheless represents a highly principled thinker who placed others' interests ahead of his own.What makes Moltke particularly intriguing for a Christian to study is that Moltke started in the 1930s as one who was unsure about Christianity and ended up a devout Lutheran by the early part of WWII. For reasons of conscience and out of fear for making him a martyr, Moltke opposed attempts to assassinate Hitler and rather would have sought to try him before the world.After he was arrested in early 1944, he later eventually became linked to some of the July 20 assassination plotters and thus was slated for trial before the People's Court. Fascinatingly, all of the charges against him were dropped due to lack of evidence and his vigorous defense. What he was eventually executed for was as he put it \\"how Christianity can prove a sheet-anchor in time of chaos.\\" The German judge, the infamous Chief Judge Roland Freisler, actually openly admitted that \\"only in one respect are we (National Socialism) and Christianity are alike; we demand the whole man!\\" Similarly he asked the rhetorical question of Moltke, \\"Who do you take your orders from? From the Other World or from Adolf Hitler? Who commands your loyalty and your faith?\\" Moltke's final two letters to his wife are powerful farewell in this world letters that point deeply to his faith in Christ and hope in eternal life. Here is a man who had learned to live and die well for the glory of God. It is also a great look at a how a lesser magistrate can alleviate and blunt the evils of even the most totalitarian of states.Finally, there's a reflection about God's providences within the timing of his imprisonment that is truly remarkable from one of these final letters to Freya.The decisive phrase in the trial was, \\"Herr Graf, we National Socialists and Christianity have one thing in common and one only: we demand the whole man.\\" Was he clear what he said there? Just think how wonderfully God prepared this His unworthy vessel. At the very moment when the danger arose that I might be drawn into active preparations for a rising [Stauffenberg meeting a close associate of Moltke's right after the latter was arrested in January 1944]...I was taken away, which means that I was and remain free of all connection with the use of violence. Then He endued me with this socialistic leaning which frees me as a great landowner from any suspicion of looking after my own interests. Then He humbles me as I have never been humbled before, so that I must lose all pride, so that at last after thirty-eight years I understand my sinfulness, so that I learn to pray for His forgiveness and trust in His grace. Then He lets me come here so that I may see you standing firm and can be free of thoughts of you and the boys, that is to say of worries about you. He gives me time and opportunity to arrange everything that can be arranged, so that all earthly cares may fall away. Then He lets me experience to their utmost depths the agony of parting, the terror of death and the fear of hell, so that all these are behind me. Then He endows me with Faith, Hope, and Charity in such measure that it is really overwhelming. [He then describes a long list of specific providences that cause his trial to focus solely on Moltke's and others' Christianity.] Then your husband is picked out and, as a Protestant, attacked and condemned primarily because of his friendship with Catholics, and therefore stands not as a nobleman, not as a Prussian, not as a German---no as a Christian and nothing else."},{"Title":"College Algebra (8th Edition)","review":"Incomprehensible is the best word I can find for this book.

I'd encourage any professor with a choice not to use this book.So what to do if it's required, like it was for me? I'd say buy the book used (lots of low priced options currently), and use the savings to hire a good tutor to help explain what the book doesn't. I did this, and it did help a lot.

The sad part is that I really wanted to like algebra and this book has made it almost impossible."},{"Title":"How to prepare for the coming crash","review":"I purchased and read this book 39 years ago when I was a private first class in the Army. This was about the time of the Yom Kippur war and the Arab Oil embargo, and some of us thought the end was coming. Gas prices doubled almost overnight from 33 cents to 60 cents a gallon. I developed a survivalist mentality, traded in all my savings for silver bullion (about $5 an ounce), bought Ruger 10/22 rifle with five mags, and got together as much backpacking & camping gear as I could afford. The book said that the Government would make sure that we soldiers were fed when the rest of the country couldn't, because we were needed to maintain order. But eventually, even the Government and the Army were supposed to disintegrate. When that happened, my platoon sergeant told us we would simply \\"take\\" one of the Army's 5-ton trucks, head north to Canada, and form an armed colony. Well, that was 39 years ago and there have been a lot of ups and downs. I long since gave up preparing for the end of the world, went to college, started a career, began a family, and am now retired. My father, now in this 80s, remains a committed doomsday prepper. I think the greatest disappointment of his life is that he will probably not live to see the end. He built his whole life around building a remote bunker complex stocked with food and a massive arsenal. In the last 20 years, civilization has encroached on his hideaway and his bunker is now surrounded by a semi-rural community where people live normal lives and no one threatens to steal away his food. End of the world doomsday thinking is, more than anything else, escapism for those who are dissatisfied with society and their position in it. In the post-apocalyptic world, they will be the wise men who had the foresight to prepare. Until then, they live a life a mediocrity."},{"Title":"How to prepare for the coming crash","review":"This out of print book should be in every hosuehold so that more of us could understand where the money goes in our American system."},{"Title":"The Star: A Story to Help Young Children Understand Foster Care","review":"Disappointed in this book.

The writing is not the best- but it is a decent book in a hard-to-find genre."},{"Title":"The Star: A Story to Help Young Children Understand Foster Care","review":"The Star: A Story to Help Young Children Understand Foster Care, by Cynthia Miller Lovell, is a refreshingly sensitive book that affirms and encourages children who have been taken from their homes and placed in foster care. The author addresses feelings and questions that children typically have and supportively lets them know that they are not alone. Examples of some issues that are broached include the following: &quot;What does being a foster child mean?&quot;, &quot;Am I a foster child because I did something bad?&quot;, &quot;Can I eat an apple from the table?&quot; These simple questions are emotionally charged and are of utmost importance to children who ask them.This easy to read book with beautiful watercolor illustrations of children from various cultures and socio-economic groups, is a non-threatening medium to address this sensitive topic with foster children. It indirectly inspires hope, comforts,and affirms each child's uniqueness. The handbook that can be purchased in addition to the book, is a must for adults who wish to indirectly ease children's transition into foster care. This user friendly book provides questions about the main character of The Star and fun activities for the children who read this book. By engaging in these short activities, caregivers can help nurture the bond between themselves and the children whom they help. Because they can also gain insight into the foster child's psyche, they have more tools to effectively help each unique child. In addition to helping foster children and foster parents, The Star can be useful in building sensitivity of this issue and eroding at the stigma of foster care,for peers,educators, social workers,nurses, churches, communities and occupational therapists. As a professional advocate of children in urban and rural areas, this is the only children's book that I have seen available for foster children. It is a must for school and private libraries."},{"Title":"The Star: A Story to Help Young Children Understand Foster Care","review":"We received this book yesterday and I read it to my two foster sons (aged 7 and 8) at bedtime. The asked me to read eat over again until I got too tired! It follows a girl named Kit from when the social workers arrive at her mother's house to pick her up, to feeling more settled in her foster home. My sons felt less alone in their experience when the story explained that there are other children feeling the same things (sometimes happy, angry, confused, sad). It ends on a positive and personal note that they will be okay. I did think it odd that a star speaks to and comforts the child, but one of my sons said he especially liked hearing about the star. One caution: they were not familiar with the name &quot;Kit&quot; and thought she was being called &quot;Kid.&quot; I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Star: A Story to Help Young Children Understand Foster Care","review":"My husband and I are foster parents. Inspiration from this book prompted me to decorate the bed room, where our foster child sleeps, with stars. It turned out really cute.

But after reading Dave Andrews I no longer associate the Jewish Messiah Jesus with Christianity. I now see that Christianity is a religion that has been irreversibly distorted by its neglect of the actual figure and teachings of Christ.The most appealing thing about the book is that Andrews commitment to what he sees as the non-violence of Jesus is even carried into the way the book is written. He doesn't appeal to the reader to come over to where he stands and see it the way he does rather he (with the integrity of a true anarchist) is not a reformer but proposes a new open(!) construct that people can engage with total disregard for the drug that has met it's used by date: Christianity.I have not yet finished but I would also recommend \\"Not Religion, but Love\\" which Andrew's also wrote.

In contrast to \`closed-set' bounded Christianity that defends beliefs and behaviours, Andrews claims \`open-set' inclusive Christi-Anarchy is the way of compassion, nonviolence and liberation that centers on Jesus. He includes imaginative poetry of Jesus' ministry and passion, and shows how we can be inspired by Jesus' compassion and hunger for justice to work among marginal groups for real transformation. He writes from his experience of suffering, despair and following Jesus' example - notably being thrown out of Dilaram Community by YWAM and his current community building with \`the waiter's union' in Brisbane.Originally reviewed in Darren Cronshaw \`The Emerging Church: Spirituality and Worship Reading Guide.'

I find it hard to imagine someone taking the time and energy to complain about a book they spent a dime on (!) But like almost everything both Ruth Knauss and Maurice Sendak did-- this book is special-- and here's why: it teaches kids to think unconventionally and to see the world through their prisms-- and for every kid to embrace and value their own whimsical imaginations. So much of youth is spent teaching children to conform to a rigid, unyielding world. Books such as these are liberating and freeing (even to the parent, who can sometimes forgets what being a child is like). I'd recommend reading it again with a more open (less critical) mind and try to see how the authors tried to capture the adventurous spirit and imagination of the small boy-- and how that might also spark the imagination of your own child.

Be sure to read his threatening reply to my review. True enough, I only skimmed through this book, but why would I want to read the work of a guy who spends so much time bad-mouthing credentialed scientists? A scientist would not threaten people who merely quoted a few of his controversial ideas. His scholarship has been criticized by Eric C. Cline (From Eden to Exile,) and researchers at the University of Chicago: [...] Kaulins may have a few valid ideas about depictions of astronomy by ancient man and the importance of the Baltic languages, but they're getting lost in his shrill denunciations of mainstream academia. Read his bio, his own academic background is in law, not linguistics or archaeology.From his Lexline journal:\\"I am still working on my formal write-up of my Gobekli Tepe decipherment which will show that G&ouml;bekli Tepe is astronomical in nature and oriented to the stars ca. 3800 B.C.I conclude that this location near Urfa is where the Hebrew Calendar began. Gobekli Tepe is only 12 kilometers (about 7.5 miles) from Urfa (currently called Sanliurfa or Edessa), the legendary birthplace of the Biblical Abraham, and only 38 kilometers (23.75 miles) from his later residence at Haran. (see Am Anfang war Anatolien)I initially dated the installation of the standing stones by what I have deciphered to be the relief depiction of the appearance of Halley's Comet on one of the stones, which by its location on that stone can only be ca. 3800 B.C.\\"\\"My interpretations of Stonehenge by astronomy date the large megaliths at Stonehenge to 1749 BC.\\"\\"I have been able to decipher several of the Balkan Danube Scripts (ca. 4000-3000 BC) from Transylvania (Romania), Karanovo (Bulgaria) and from Thracian Greece as astronomy. In addition, I have been able to decipher the Djer wooden and ivory tablets from Abydos and Saqqara (ca. 3000 BC) - also as astronomy. In my view, this resolves the question of the origin of Pharaonic writing - it derives from what are today called the Danube Scripts, whatever their provenance may be.\\"\\"The identity of Tutankhamun can be explained as follows:In my opinion, the evidence is incontrovertible that King Saul = Echnaton (Akhenaten), King David = Sethos and King Solomon = Ramses II with Shishak = Ramses III.Accordingly, Tutankhamun can only be ATON, i.e. JON-ATHON (\\"young Aton, young Adonis, \\"Jaun-(IE)donis\\"), one of the sons of Saul in the Bible. Saul was Echn-ATON viz. Akhen-ATEN (\\"old Aton\\", old Adonis, \\"Vec-(IE)Donis\\"). The other brother was Semenchkare, Biblical Ish-Boshet, who served a short time as Pharaoh before being executed.\\"So there you have it- you decide, based on his own words, about the quality of his scholarship. Needless to say, he doesn't accept carbon dating. There's also a strong streak of \\"the Europeans/Hebrews did it first\\" in his theories.

Unfortunately, his intellect seems to fall short of the critical acumen he has developed as a Doctor of Law when it comes to dealing with archaeological evidence.He accepts untenable ideas about the past, such as the existence of ley lines, a fantasy dreamed up in the 1920s by the Herefordshire businessman Alfred Watkins and thoroughly debunked in the 1980s by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy inLey Lines in Question. He finds cup-and-ring marks on stones that supposedly depict constellations in the southern hemisphere (such as Musca) that were not defined until the sixteenth century: remember that constellations have no objective reality in the sky, that they are arbitrary groupings of unrelated stars and that different cultures make different groupings. His mangling of linguistics allows him to state that the name of Merlin - who is identified as a genius behind megalithic carvings that no-one else has yet recognised! - can be derived from a root \\"MER- meaning \\"measure, survey\\" in ancient Indo-European\\" when it comes from Welsh Myrddin, probably derived from the Brittonic placename Moridunon, now Carmarthen (Caerfyrddin in Welsh), meaning \\"sea fort\\".There is little point in trying to do a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal. The evidence simply does not stack up. While Andis Kaulins is evidently an accomplished lawyer and translator, I find nothing in his excursions into archaeology, ancient history and biblical exegesis that is really worth spending time on."},{"Title":"Stars, Stones and Scholars: The Decipherment of the Megaliths as an Ancient Survey of the Earth by Astronomy","review":"I personally believe that one should never let reviews determine whether one researches a particular field. I think that the fact the author does not have a degree in history does not necessarily hold him back. It gives him an open mind which has not been inundated with historical dogma that has been handed down by the victors over the centuries. I have found this author's ideas to be incredibly fascinating in regards to ancient geodetic Earth measurement. The ancients knew very well how to travel the world and were no dummies. I suggest to anyone reading this review to go watch the documentary &#34;revelation of the pyramids&#34; to begin to understand how the ancients built ancient civilization according to a code.

Don't waste your money!"},{"Title":"Stars, Stones and Scholars: The Decipherment of the Megaliths as an Ancient Survey of the Earth by Astronomy","review":"It is rare for a book to cover the distance and depth found in Stones, Stars and Scholars by Andis Kaulins. However the conclusion of the book, that the ancient megaliths tell a story about a world wide system of surveying and measurement well in effect in 3000 BC, will turn the world of scholarship upside down. While it is a pioneering work, there is more than enough information here to prove the authors basic premise that the megalithic sites, all over the world, represent a map of the sky on the ground.Implications in this book for historians include granting ancient peoples much more credibility for understanding our place in the solar system, movements of people and ideas in the ancient world, the origin of scientific methods and an uncanny knowledge of these ideas around the world.When I was growing up I always heard that our human cognitive abilities were developed in part from observing the sun, moon and stars. This book begins to develop the meaning of that statement by showing that the depth of understanding of the relationship of the sky to terrestrial geography was profound in the human species for a very long time. It is a shame that most historians and archeologists have forgotten or never knew basic astronomy and its relationship with the reality structure of ancient people. This book begins to mend this problem.A bonus with the book is the linguistic comparison of the names of the constellations, stars, megalithic sites and local town names with the local native language, and other languages including Latvian. This analysis supports the theory that the ancients were aware of precession, the pole of the ecliptic and other astronomical facts that historians are reluctant to admit.The dating of the monuments by analyzing carvings on the stones to represent moments where solstices and other astronomical events occured in the past is revolutionary. The author presents the idea that &quot;modern time&quot; began on December 25, 3117 BC and is found in carvings supporting that idea located around the world.This book requires close study but is extremely rewarding in understanding human development: As above, so below."},{"Title":"Stars, Stones and Scholars: The Decipherment of the Megaliths as an Ancient Survey of the Earth by Astronomy","review":"Stars, Stones and Scholars is a pioneer analysis of prehistoric art, megalithic sites, astronomy, archaeology and the history of civilization. The book title is an intentional play on the title of C.W. Ceram's famous book, Gods, Graves and Scholars, which analyzed the history of archaeology from a quite limited perspective - starting with the Gods and the Graves, placing too much emphasis on the Scholars, and ignoring the study of the Stars and the workmanship of Stones which PRECEDED them. Stars, Stones and Scholars presents the decipherment of the megaliths (standing stones) as an ancient survey of the Earth by astronomy. The book presents initial proofs and discussion claiming that ancient megalithic sites are remnants of ancient local, regional and worldwide Neolithic surveys oriented to the stars. This hypothesis is not even speculative - in ancient days, no other means except astronomy were available for earthly orientation. The book's ca. 40 photographs, 240 drawings and 80 maps show how megaliths were carved and &quot;sculpted&quot; with figures in relief (what can still be made of them) and cupmarks (holes in the stones) to intentionally represent specific stars, constellations and asterisms, long before our modern astrological Zodiac was allegedly known. Megalithic sites from around the world are analyzed and shown to be part of ancient SYSTEMATIC survey systems covering entire regions ca. 3000 BC. The countries analyzed include, for example, England (all the major Neolithic sites including e.g. Stonehenge, Wayland's Smithy, Kents Cavern), Wales (all the major Neolithic sites including e.g. Paviland), Scotland (all the major Neolithic sites including e.g. the Clava Cairns), Ireland (all the major Neolithic sites including Newgrange, Knowth, Tara), Germany (most of the major sites including the Externsteine, Nebra, Gollenstein, Felsenmeer), Benelux (Weris), France (Carnac, Lascaux, Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc), Italy (La Spezia), all the Malta Temples (e.g. Tarxien and the Hypogeum), Scandinavia (Tanum), as well as individual sites in the Baltic, Russia, the Near East, the Far East (China - the Great Wall, and Japan - e.g. Asuka, Kanayama), Africa (e.g. the Central African Republic), Central and South America (Tikal), Oceania (Hawaii), the continental USA (Cahokia, Miami Circle) and Canada (the Peterborough Petroglyphs). Many of these sites are examined and deciphered in great detail showing a site such as the Peterborough Petroglyphs in Canada, for example, to be an ancient map of the heavens and the Ki'i Petroglyphs on the island of Hawaii to be an ancient map of the world. The intent of the author is not so much to convince the reader of the correctness of his analysis, but rather to urge the reader to look at ancient sites and stones differently than before and, for example, to examine old vacation photographs of Stonehenge or similar sites, and see the figures carved on the stones. As far as the interpretation of the megaliths is concerned, there is no question that this is the way of the future."},{"Title":"Cast Down the Waters : A Bosnia in Flames","review":"I've studied the Balkans and picked up the book on a whim.

So Warren G. Harris's \\"Sophia Loren\\" is an interesting read, if a somewhat plain vanilla one. Good photos, some amusing anecdotes and a basic summary of Sophia's life are what readers will find.It traces her life from a scrawny illegitimate baby (whom a wet nurse described as looking like a rat, and who was later nicknamed \\"Toothpick\\"), whose mother was abandoned by her father, leaving her alone with two children. But Sophia Scicolone (later Sophia Lazzaro, and then Sophia Loren) rapidly bloomed into a beautiful woman, becoming a beauty contest champ and then an actress. Despite a string of flops and a controversial relationship with a divorced man, Sophia became one of the most beautiful and women in the world, and the first Oscar winner of a performance in a foreign-language film.The best description of this book is \\"adequate.\\" It's not amazingly written, researched or presented. Rather it presents the basics of Sophia's life up the 1990s, which seems to have been a fairly straightforward, open one. There isn't really much that is new in this, but what is there is usually presented in an entertaining manner. Between the \\"battle of the bosoms\\" and Frank Sinatra teaching Sophia some obscene questions in English, we hear some funny events as well as a few bittersweet ones. And unlike many biographies, this one gives detailed summaries of her various movies.Sophia herself is presented as a warm and sweet person, who cabled flowers to Clark Gable's widow and befriended nearly every costar (entrancing a few as well). The pictures are not well-chosen, as there aren't as many as there could have been, and quite a few seem to focus on Sophia in various stages of undress (ranging from her see-through prostitute gown to her merry widow to her topless dance number in \\"It's Him -- Yes Yes!\\"). Carlos Ponti, her husband, is a nebulous figure -- we don't learn much about him. Sophia's family and friends are better defined, such as her never-say-die mother Romilda, her commitmentphobe father, and the extremely emotional Cary Grant.It's not outstanding, but it's a big plus for fans of the amazing Sophia Loren. For the basics on her life, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Sophia Loren: A Biography","review":"I am only a sophomore in High School but I did read this book for a biography project I had to do and it was very informative for a biography paper.

Knowledge about astronomy, e.g. star constellations and star names, about chemistry, e.g. atomic structures, and about biology. Further more, a spiritual sense for nature and existence combined with a questioning but open mind should be part of the reader's characteristics. If you have all this, you will love to explore this book, just like me. You will find questions you are asking yourself, too, as well as new hints and new perspectives to look at &quot;things&quot; written in an almost poetic language. And, that's the best, you learn. Even though theories about quarks or the beginning of the universe and our existence are hard to understand, you will get an idea about it all with this book. Theory is presented in an easy to read way and written in a wonderful descriptional language using parabels and comparisons to create pictures in your mind. I am already halfway through and I do not want this book to end. It is going to be one of my very favorite books."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"A remarkable book written by a remarkable man. Not often have I come across a book that speaks of an utter enchantment with the stars, and so accurately tells of the grace inherent in them. I, too, am an astronomer, and am often at a loss for words for a description of the beauty that I try to relate to friends and, indeed, to myself. Chet Raymo's work is pure poetry, containing the symmetry of a love-affair with science and the acknowledgement of the unknown. From &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot; to &quot;The Blandishments of Color&quot;, he guides you through the convoluted terrain of the night sky. Delirious with his sublime prose, I can only finish by saying this- Read This Book. It ought to be required reading for every survey class in astronomy, and will be well-loved by anyone enthralled by the stars."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"I read this book for a college course on Ecocriticism and was totally spellbound. I read it in one sitting and it made me crave for that feeling you get while standing under the stars--realizing how small you are--and how infinetly wonderous at the same time. Everybody should read this book, it is beautiful and important for understanding humankind's place within nature."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"Allow me to start with a personal anecdote. At age 44, I still remember vividly taking a sort of &quot;preference&quot; test in junior high school ... you probably know the sort, a series of questions with two answers to choose from ... stuff like: Would you rather kick an annoying poodle or eat an Italian dinner? I scored so low on the on the questions skewed to &quot;science&quot; that there wasn't even a place for me on the graph!About seven years ago, I picked up an earlier edition of &quot;Soul Of The Night&quot; in a used bookstore on a friend's recommendation. Finally, a couple years ago, I got around to reading it. Inside I found descriptions, ways of seeing that I could have never managed on my own.Although it's not a religious book, I (as a Christian) found myself inspired and challenged and not a little awestruck by Raymo's writing. If you are not so inclined, don't let my mention of this dissuade you ... I would not wish to do a disservice to Raymo or the book in that way.Pleasures abound here and for a decidely non-science/astronomy reader, I was ushered through a door I never thought I'd find. Raymo's style is so friendly that I can also apply to him what I have used to describe Jimmy Webb's amazing book on songwriting (&quot;Tunesmith&quot;) ... the only thing that's missing from the book is the author's physical presence and the beer!"},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"&quot;The Soul of the Night&quot; reads like poetry as the author describes moonlight caught on moving water, his coming upon a flower of an unexpected color in the woods, the movement of the earth through space in the time it takes a child to fall. He also makes the mundane periodic table sound poetic: &quot;Standoffish helium. Spooky boron. No-nonsense carbon.&quot; He can quote Wallace Stevens and Sylvia Plath and still find time to discuss black holes, comets and red shifts of galaxies. It is a joyful, dreaming celebration of the universe."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"As an avid astronomer, I am always seeking ways to put the fantastic things I see into words, to make the infinite understandable.

What is our place in the cosmos?"},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"&quot;Soul&quot; is one of my favorite books of all time.

While it really doesn't contain very much information (try Stephen Hawking), as with an author such as Umberto Eco, one is expected to enjoy the beautiful writing style of the author. As I said before, this book doesn't have very much hard information, but is delightful and insightful to anyone with even a passing interest in astronomy. Great for naturalists, too!"},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"I have to add my five stars for THE SOULD OF THE NIGHT.

Raymo has a marvelous way with words and an interesting viewpoint on the sciences."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"Raymo, like Lorne Eiseley before him, is a scientist with the soul of a poet. I have read a number of his books and each one (with the possible exception of his novel about St. Valentine, which wasn't his best) leaves me with a sense of wonder and a renewed awe in creation. I am always amused when Raymo, who is Jesuit trained, says he doesn't believe in God. Certainly the God he doesn't believe in is one I couldn't believe in either, and yet his work is unmistakably spiritual, arousing in this reader a deep sense of the holy. His book, \\"When God is Gone Everything is Holy,\\" is one of the most spiritually enriching books I've ever read.In this book he tackles the night sky, and although I lack the scientific background perhaps necessary to completely understand everything in this slim, yet weighty, volume, Raymo's writing is simply so beautiful, his prose so alluring, and his wealth of knowledge so vast, that even someone like me is entranced by every mystical and enlightening essay.Raymo guides the reader through the stars, and refreshes at each new constellation by sharing the myths, poetry and stories humans have created about them generation after generation. Although Raymo is a meticulous scientist, his quest here is not into the mathematics of night (although there is some of that) as it is into the title's soul of night. The essays are elegant, lyric and mysterious. His erudition shows as he quotes everyone from Thoreau (with whom he has been compared) to Roethke, Rilke, Shelley, Thoreau, Buddha, the Bible and the Koran. His comparison of the night sky to Melville's great White Whale, is inspired.Originally published two decades ago, The Soul of the Night is a classic work that is a must for those interested in the relationship between science and faith."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"I already owned this book and I usually re-read it about once a year. I love the writing. It takes scientific concepts and turns them into a poetic prose that reminds me of the writing of Thoreau, Emerson, and Whitman.I purchased this copy as a gift to a friend who was flying to Australia. What better way to spend the hours in flight than taking flight with Chet Raymo."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"Reading Chet Raymo is like taking a deep, cleansing breath and exhaling slowly--one is filled with inspiration and joy. More than learning about the wonder of the night sky and beyond, you become part of it. This is my fourth Chet Raymo book, and I look forward to another."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Night: An Astronomical Pilgrimage (A Ruminator Find)","review":"In THE SOUL OF THE NIGHT, a collection of tender, lyrical essays praising the night sky, astronomer, physicist and college professor Chet Raymo teaches by example that science and passion are intimately, irrepressibly connected; they're meant for each other.Through his eyes and pen, Raymo draws breathtaking pictures of our universe and connects them to mythology, literature, religion, history and anthropology. He calls on Roethke, Rilke, Shelley, Thoreau, Buddha, the Bible and the Koran, among others, to inspire his instructive reveries. He compares the night sky to Moby Dick, a butterfly's chrysalis to stardust, and the Earth's cone-shaped shadow in outer space to a wizard's cap &quot;8000 miles wide in diameter at the rim, where it fits snugly on the Earth's brow.&quot; And when the sun and moon come together in eclipse, he transforms the view into a gentle kiss between lovers.Now THIS is the way to learn astronomy.Raymo deserves to be savored slowly, by candlelight."},{"Title":"Air Disasters","review":"Stewart's penchant for detail is evident throughout this seminal work. A compilation of airline accident investigation findings which run the gamut from design flaws and adverse weather, to impatient pilots, and distracted controllers. Superior in content to many books written by non-investigators, or &quot;hired-guns&quot; who work for lawyers, the book does not elaborate on the events which occurred after the cause was determined, or the disposition of recommendations forwarded from air safety investigators. Though this may seem an oversight, some of these recommendations are STILL being considered by-or are rejected in compliance with-the regulatory body (in the U.S., that is the FAA). Nevertheless, one can gain a valuable insight into the root causes of many air disasters."},{"Title":"Air Disasters","review":"Aircraft Disasters covers the major accidents in modern aviation history beginning with the R101 airship fire and ending with Boeing 747 disasters in 1985. I really appreciated the excellent balance maintained throughout the book between technical detail and readability. Each accident is expertly described with its unique features carefully brought out. The author takes pains to highlight all the relevent factors necessary to understand the reasons why a particular crash occured. An example would be the exhaustive water tank testing done at Farnborough in England on a DeHavilland Comet airframe to discover the cause (metal fatigue) of the Comet crashes in the early 1950's. Another example would be the detail description of the DC10 cargo door latching mechanism that failed and which resulted in the crash of a DC10 near Paris in 1974. I particularly appreciated the author's second by second recounting verbatim of aircraft-to-control tower communication - one really feels the situation in the cockpit in the vital seconds prior to impact. The only negative experience I had in reading this book is knowing it would end. I have read it twice and anticipate reading it again soon! I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in reading about prominent air disasters in a way that extends beyond a superficial description and yet is more readable than say, an Aviation Week and Space Technology accident report."},{"Title":"Air Disasters","review":"Stewart's book looks at twelve of the most terrible and important accidents in aviation history. Chapters are included on the crash of the R-101 airship, the Trident crash of 1972, and the 1976 midair collision over Yougoslavia, among others. This book is excellent. Stewart's writing is both factually informative as well as psychologically thrilling. He takes us moment by moment through each crisis. While none of the chapters are poor by any means, I think the best covered the Trident crash of 72 and the Munich football accident of 58. Each is written in the style of great fiction, but both are wholly true! I would recommend this book for anyone with an interest remotely close to the subject. Too bad that the book is out of print."},{"Title":"Air Disasters","review":"When you read a horror novel or murder mystery, you know something horrible is going to happen. Yet you read on anyway, as it can be thrilling. Air Disasters reads easilly like a horror novel; and gives you the same thrills and chills. Stewart's intense detail and moment by moment desciption left me white knuckled and in a cold sweat at times. In addition to this it disabused me of many misconceptions that I had about the most famous crashes in the world. A great book for any aviation enthusiast!!!"},{"Title":"Air Disasters","review":"I must be a rubber necker to the highest degree because I always enjoy these type of books. It has the standard fair, nothing really new on the format. The author does give us a good amount of detail, which he is known for. I would always like more photos, but there is enough to tell the story. If you like this type of book then you will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Air Disasters","review":"I was hoping for something more in-depth/technical. Unfortunately, the descriptions and analyses are about what one would expect to see in a typical weekday newspaper article."},{"Title":"In Search of America's Past: Learning to Read History in Elementary School","review":"Ask a classroom teacher what he or she thinks about educational research, and there's a fair chance you'll hear, \\"It's fine, but it does little to help me deal with real classroom instructional issues.\\" In fact, that would've been my response until I read Bruce VanSledright's \\"In Search Of America's Past.\\" Not only has this book challenged the way I look at research on teaching and learning, but also it has impacted how I see the discipline that I teach (history) and the ways that my students can conceptualize and work within that discipline.Through \\"In Search Of America's Past,\\" VanSledright escorts the reader through his quest, as both classroom teacher and researcher, to change what a group of fifth-grade students think about history from \\"just a bunch of facts\\" to an investigative process by which interpretations are built on documentary evidence. After several chapters, it becomes obvious to the reader that the author is an experienced classroom teacher and researcher who effectively balances both roles and understands how to communicate his findings and ideas to educators at the K-12 and university levels. He empathizes with teachers who try to make their content meaningful to students in the face of watered-down, high-stakes tests. He offers suggestions for modeling and reinforcing good historical investigation strategies with students. And he is both realistic and responsible in discussing his expectations for deep analysis in the history classroom and the purposes of such analysis.Many middle- and high-school teachers will see the subtitle, \\"Learning To Read History In Elementary School,\\" and consider passing up this volume. As an eleventh-grade history teacher, I can assure you that doing so would be a huge mistake. While VanSledright notes that his efforts with fifth-graders were \\"met with some conditional success\\" (p. 134), he establishes that elementary students are capable of demonstrating basic competencies in dealing with historical ambiguity and biased or conflicting evidence. Just think of what a high school student could do with proper instruction! As well, he discusses issues that are important to social studies teachers and scholars across the board, from critical evaluations of \\"typical\\" social studies textbooks to the struggles involved with trying to change student's perceptions of what history is and why they should learn it.Admittedly, VanSledright's teaching context is as unique as yours or mine, and therefore, his book should not be read as The Solution to all things ailing social studies teachers and teaching. But it is strong in documenting innovative methods and key questions about teaching and learning for social studies teachers to consider, and it provides a forum for bridging existing research on history teaching with classroom practice. Kids are thoughtful inquirers, not living encyclopedias, and Bruce VanSledright shows us that. Can our students construct their own informed interpretations of history and articulate their positions? They can if we show them how to do it. I'm in search of more work like this."},{"Title":"In Search of America's Past: Learning to Read History in Elementary School","review":"Thank you so much.

It assists one with thinking beyond.

My desire is to become an elementary school teacher, but I have always dreaded the prospect of having to teach America's version of American history. I'm a die hard believer in primary source instruction and have felt for a long time that children deserve the truth- even if it isn't a clearly plotted storyline with a happy ending. Our history can offer lessons about respect, learning from mistakes, etc., yet it feels like the main goal of history textbooks is to make children patriotic.Ok, that's enough about my general point of view. Let me tell you what I love about this book. VanSledright works through primary sources with his 5th grade students and lets them try to interpret history. Often they can't come to a definite conclusion about an event, but it is wonderful to read how critically they are thinking about them. Details about famous American events like the Boston Masacre and the Boston Tea Party are present in textbooks as complete stories, but the fifth graders uncover conflicting details and erroneous assumptions, and are not as quick as historians to make absolute conclusions.VanSledright offers his research honestly and admits its limitations. As far as I know, there aren't many other books like this (if there are, tell me!)."},{"Title":"PPG-2266: A surgeon's war","review":"Here is an amazing Patriotic War diary of a world-renowned Russian heart surgeon. As a young medical graduate, Dr. Amosov volunteered for the front, where he was given charge of a horse-drawn mobile field hospital (PPG). The inexperienced young surgeon and his newly arrived staff of physicians and nurses were immediately innundated by masses of wounded. Working up to eighteen hours a day, they developed new lifesaving techniques under the most appalling aseptic and primitive conditions. As they continuously relocated with the fluctuating front, their &quot;hospital&quot; was hurriedly established in dugouts, peasant huts, barns, and burned-out buildings. Wounded arrived stacked on carts, packed into trucks and boxcars, or by ambulance-biplane, after having received only the most basic treatment from battlefield aidwomen. Under the roaring of artillery and aircraft, Dr. Amosov fought his own four-year war against hemorrhage, gaseous gangrene, frostbite, and lice. His grim accounts of injuries, suffering, and death are at times almost unbearable. But overall, his memoir is a tribute to the courage and determination of his Soviet people: his patients and overworked staff, heroes all. This is a truly inspiring book. It reads like a fast-paced novel. Those who enjoy true-life medical adventure stories will appreciate it. History buffs will recognize the locales and various defeats and victories of the Red Army, as PPG-2266 follows the front lines. From Barbarossa to the Fall of Berlin, Dr. Amosov's journal provides an unforgetable, physician's view of the Eastern Front and its cost in human lives."},{"Title":"PPG-2266: A surgeon's war","review":"This is a fascinating account by a surgeon in the Red Army. It includes compelling information about the state of Soviet medical care during the Second World War, with some surprises for most Westerners. The author is frank about both good and bad experiences, about his knowledge of the war in general, and about political views. An extremely useful source on individual experiences in the war. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"Nevil Shute's style will probably not please the modern reader much, and that is unfortunate. His love of detail and the pains he goes to make sure of what he is stating are characteristics that I enjoy in his texts. Sometimes, he goes to an almost ridiculous extent to flesh out the reality of his background, when it probably would not be missed. Yet just as he does this, you can see him entering a truly fictional world in which, whoops, his characters suddenly do resemble real people and his narrative suddenly comes to life. It might be the extra effort Donald Ross goes to get the wireless to work, something banal and silly like that, but we know, almost without realising it that Shute is suddenly expanding a fictional context to include the all too likely possibility of future danger, and we realise just how much care is being taken. The work is not sloppy; it is methodical and I admit, at times a little dry. Yet when Shute's work really fires, it is because of this attention to the right kind of detail.\\"An Old Captivity\\" has long been one of my favourite Shute novels. In a way it's an experimental sort of book: it takes the long wide arc of a journey from Britain to Canada via Iceland and Greenland, as its background. The path of a small seaplane is traced with infinite pains to capture the solitariness and the arduous nature of the voyage. Its three passengers are linked together in interesting and diverse ways. Slowly, against the further background of the Icelandic sagas, the tale emerges and, as usual with Nevil Shute, it is not what we are expecting. Just when the clean, crisp, almost mechanical prose has us thinking one thing, Shute leaps off into a void composed of history and imagination. It's an extremely disciplined piece of writing and I hope you'll enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"Initially published in 1940 it is a touching story of a pilot, a scientist and his daughter who in the early 1930's are early North Atlantic aviators as they fly from England to Iceland and on to Greenland to search for evidence that the Irish may have accompanied the Vikings in their year 1000 AD colonies. Nevil Shute combines his incredible love of aviation and his admiration of pilots, with the mysticism which later becomes very much of a trademark in many of his books. A sensitive love story ties the present day characters to the ancient Norse sagas. Further underlying the tale is the question of how far west did the early voyagers to Iceland and Greeland actually get. I personally find it fascinating to note that years after Nevil Shute wrote this book, compelling evidence of Viking settlements on the North American continent itself has been found."},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"Most people today think nothing of getting on airplane, and a few hours later, arriving at their destination half the world away with no more to complain about than poor service by the stewardess. It wasn't always this way, and even today going to some remote locations has at least some difficulties associated with it. This book details the adventures of three very disparate people, an Oxford don, his class conscious daughter, and an independent-minded pilot as they embark on a trip from England to Greenland during the mid-thirties in an attempt by the professor to prove that the Celts came along with the Norsemen during their exploration and colonization period of about AD1000.Greenland is not a very hospitable place, with few inhabitants, almost no ports, unpredictable and typically highly inclement weather, and ice-locked most of the year. The preparations needed to go there at the time of this novel were extensive, approaching the level of effort of the Scott and Amundsen polar expeditions, though on a much smaller scale. Almost all of this effort falls on the shoulders of the pilot, from purchasing, assembling and testing an appropriate sea-plane to ordering supplies, obtaining the required documents, setting up logistical support bases, and finding and hiring an appropriately skilled photographer, all while working under a time deadline dictated by Greenland's very short summer.Nevil's description of all of this work and the thought processes of his pilot are vivid, detailed, and highly believable. While progressing in the story line, his characters are richly developed. There is a natural antipathy between the working-man pilot and the daughter, who has led a very sheltered upper-class life, who naturally can't believe the cost and preparation required for the trip, so naturally believes that the pilot is merely out to pad his own pocket. But once they embark on the trip itself, the pilot's unstinting devotion to his work slowly wins her over, and a very predictable attraction starts to form between the two.This is very typical of Nevil's work, as he was excellent at characterization and defining romantic attractions in a very believable and satisfying manner. Also typical is the fact that there are no bad guys or any high dramatic tension here. Instead his stories revolve around his characters, often very ordinary people dealing with the very mundane realities of life. This is a somewhat slow-moving book, typical of English novels written prior to WWII, but once adjusted to this novel's pace, I had no trouble remaining engrossed in the story.There are some items here, though, that are not so good. Shute was an avionics engineer, and his knowledge of airplanes is very much on display here, probably a little too much so, with too many details about the plane gone over multiple times. There is a section near the end that digresses violently from the main story, almost a separate story in itself, that I did not think Shute did a proper job of preparing the reader for. The final ending that ties the main story and this other one together reeks of mysticism and was, I felt, unnecessary to completing his character's story arc.Still, a very likeable read, probably not at the incredibly high level of things like his On the Beach or A Town Like Alice, but worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"I enjoyed every bit of this story, but it wanted more. More of an ending. More of a wrap-around of set-up plot elements. More expansion on some very critical scenes.And yet, the book as is remains vividly and fondly in memory a couple weeks after reading it. The writing is lovely, the main character soundly developed (secondary characters are somewhat shadowy at times), with a lot of excellent and smoothly written detail. But... the thrust of the story came in a bit late and without complete set-up. Elements that were set-up and needed resolution were left undone with some characters left hanging.What was extremely good... the wonderful detail of flying from England to Iceland to Greenland. Beautifully done. The book is worth the price for that alone."},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"This is a good story which could have been richer, but fell short of being great because of a major structural problem in the narrative. That's a lot to say in one line and I'll try to get to the main point without spilling much of the story itself.We have an aeroplane pilot by the name of Ross, a Professor Lockwood and his daughter, Alix. The professor wants to undertake a photographic survey of an archeological site in Greenland. Now, Ross and Alix made a bad first impression, which is the first real complication in the story. I wouldn't elaborate on it, because the relationship problem is, well, a standard plot element for any story.After some initial problems with getting the expedition underway, the three of them are off. The daughter Alix is an unwelcome addition to the trip. Like I statement early, a standard plot element.The story proceeds as a low level adventure, which is rugged, and this novel was published in 1940, prior to WWII, so this adds a solid historical approach. Ross is flying a sea plane so we're given a well written, informative story about flying, navigation, potential-problems and problems related to air travel.The next paragraph reveals an important port of the story, so you are now forewarned.Ultimately, they reach their destination; almost complete the photo expedition when a mystical sequence occurs. Ross, while in drugged sleep, has a reincarnation based dream experience, taking place during Viking colonization of Greenland.First, I liked the idea, and the read was good, but the built up was too long. The novel is over 330 pages in length, and the dream occurs well into the last third of the book. The dream experience, related by Ross to the professor, should have been longer and in greater detail.The conclusion of the story left me wanting more, and in a way, unsatisfied, but not cheated. The book is worth reading.Shute has written a wonderfully variety of works, On the Beach, A Town Like Alice, being the most well known, and An Old Captivity, is a good story, with an apt title."},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"I am a new owner of a Kindle and have been browsing to find old favorites. I was so happy to see this book and others by Nevil Shute available on Kindle. I have read & re-read his books over many years, mostly from the library. Now it is hard to find them there. Now I can download them and read the over and over again without having to try and find them elsewhere."},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"Love this book about a very early flying trip (1930's) to Greenland on a float plane with a brave pilot, an academic archeologist and his daughter. The pilot overworks himself, takes sleeping pills and dreams of Viking visits to the same site in Greenland. Shute theorizes that the Vikings also traveled to Cape Cod. Interesting characters, flying and sailing, and a lively story, vintage Shute."},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"Nevil Shute was an extraordinary and imaginative story-teller, and I have enjoyed many of his novels, as well as his memoir \\"Slide Rule\\". He was an aeronautical engineer first, and several of his novels involved flying. But \\"An Old Captivity\\" is my favorite: I first read it in the 1940s, and have gone back to read it many times since. What \\"captivated\\" me is the combination of very factual and informative details about the challenges of flying a small plane from England to Greenland in the mid 1930s, and the fantastical story element in which the chief character is led, throughg a dream, to recapture a prior life as a Scottish slave of the Viking explorer Leif Eriksson. A mild romance lends the story more charm."},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"An Old Captivity is an overlapping tale of what Shute began in Vinland the Good. Shute's stories can be considered quaint, or old fashioned, by some, but in today's rushed society his characters are refreshingly dedicated to their trade/duties, and well thought out in their actions. This story is about an air adventure to seek archaeological data in a remote area of Greenland with just the right amount of reality to make the reader feel like they could be there.Shute always does an excellent job in making the reader \\"feel the struggle\\" on a personal level. In today's novels, the inner struggle, or process of dealing with moral dilemmas, is too many times minimized or completely missing. Shute does a service to those who acknowledge the greater aspects of ones choices. He acknowledges in great detail the struggles within which we all face, yet rarely talk about or teach to the next generation. While Shute's novels are fiction, his characters are more real than the ones we will find from most any other author. A great adventure, a great read!For those wishing to know more about Nevl Shute, an internet search for the Nevil Shute Norway Foundation will put them in touch with much information as well as other Shute enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Old Captivity","review":"Shute uses the device of separate hisotries separated in time but not place to weave and intriging story.

This latest book is aimed at helping pastors who are starting out in a new congregation or pastors and congregations who want to renew their relationship. Callahan has a fresh focus for this reader. So many of the church experts today urge pastors to focus on the problems of their new congregations. Callahan insists that the key to an effective ministry is an early focus on relationships. He describes how a new pastor should plan the first three months around key visits to regular worshippers, shut-ins and hospitalized. He also has suggestions for getting quickly involved in the community, scouting out the church's mission field, developing a team of leaders and setting goals. The best thing about Callahan's approach is his gentle and confident attitude and the flexibility of his advice."},{"Title":"A New Beginning for Pastors and Congregations: Building an Excellent Match Upon Your Shared Strengths","review":"During a recent pastor's coffee in a state far from my own, I asked for advice as I prepared to move to new churches and a very different situation from my previous pastoral experience. Dr. Jim Carpenter lent me his copy of this book (I have since purchased my own)with a stern warning to return his copy. After reading, I understand why. The book is full of friendly annecdotes all pointing away from the stepping-stone and mega-church model back into the mission-oriented church we all dreamed of at seminary.The narrative style runs through the book, but Callahan doesn't stop with annecdotal information. He makes clear and convincing arguments for doing certain things certain ways - much of the advice goes against the words of wisdom offered me at my last church. The words are well measured and warm in tone.You'll finish the book on a quiet Friday... but you won't be finished with the book and its ideas for many months.

In fact, I incorporated some of Callahan's insights into a devotional book for new pastors and church members to read during their first 12 months together. Jesus began his public ministry with 40 days of prayer (Matthew 4), so you may wish to check out \\"Welcome, Pastor: Building a Productive Pastor-Congregation Partnership in 40 Days.\\" Starting well deserves your careful, prayerful attention.

Another Georgian not only makes the cut, he advances quickly to the major leagues, where he is universally hated by the players for his dirty style of play and the public for tales of his wife-beating, drinking, and low-living. Ultimately, he becomes the top player of his age and very wealthy through Georgian business ventures (think Cobb and Coca-Cola), but he always refuses to see the old town and gang.Ben and Foster meet Lottie Parker on that train. This enigmatic creature is both innocent and way too worldly for her teenage years, but never one to be forgotten. Lottie changes their lives for several generations. Foster and Lottie marry, and name their son Little Ben. Ben goes home, takes a job in the dry goods store, and becomes engaged to the proprietor's daughter. Foster, Lottie, and Ben have a subsequent encounter; when Foster and Lottie are working a travelling carnival baseball game of skill, they make Ben look like the town hero and get him very nearly killed.Several years pass and then Ben comes to see a dying Foster, who makes him promise to take Lottie home. Both Ben and Little Ben take ill, and end up in the care of Ben's lonely widowed mother and Ben's fiancee. Lottie becomes the talk of the town, first rumours spread that she and Ben had an illicit relationship, then she wins over all with her charm and grace, then she falls in love with Ben's long-suffering father-in-law, finally she leaves town to return home, just as rumour surface that she is the famous carny girl of many years earlier.I have not read any other Terry Kay novels, and I highly recommend this one. It has a few slow places, especially in the beginning, but it gracefully ties together America's past-times of baseball, commerce, and raising families in the hard-scrabble turn of the century days without much medicine, transportation, employment, or money, especially in the rural South."},{"Title":"Taking Lottie Home: A Novel","review":"Reading Terry Kay's huanting and wrenching \\"Taking Lotte Home\\" brings the reader in the hands of a writer who is completely comfortable with a genuine mastery of his craft. This novel is an engrossing work which not only absorbs the reader's attention with its sensitive and provocative treatment of the twin themes of fulfilled and unrequited love; it engages the reader in a profoundly personal manner through its exploration o the inner lives of its complex, sympathetic and utterly believable characters. Set at the turn of the twentieth century in rural Georgia, \\"Taking Lottie Home\\" is an utterly modern novel as well; its characters' yearnings, frustrations and anxieties elicit the deepest sympathies from the reader.\\"Taking Lottie Home\\" treats an enigmatic, yet magnetic, girl-woman, Lottie Barton and her eliptical travels through the rural southeast in an attempt to discover \\"home.\\" Lottie's exquisite physical beauty casts a surreal attraction from both lustful men and jealous women. The product of squalid poverty and blighted hopes, Lottie ironically becomes the focus of a liberating friendship with Ben Phelps, whose altruistic interest in Lottie results in numerous moral conundrums. In her life's travels, Lottie, through volition and resignation, has submitted to prostitution, an troubled marriage and attractions understated, Lottie becomes the focus of the three main male characters in the novel. The aforementioned Ben Phelps befriends Lottie and serves as her guardian at the request of his baseball-playing friend, Foster Lanier. Lanier and Phelps share blighted athletic careers, though their friendship circles around Lottie. Lanier marries Lottie and fathers her child; Ben learns that platonic love carries explosive connotations. Ben's ultimate employer, Arthur Ledford, will nurture his own complicated relationship with Lottie, and Kay masterfully interweaves the complications of these connections throughout the novel.One of the marvelous qualities of \\"Taking Lottie Home\\" is that although it is not a terribly original book, it succeeds on every level. Kay's creative treatment of the awful consequences of tormeted silence, innocent deceit and unfulfilled dreams is nothing less than brilliant. Lottie and Ben arouse enormous empathy as they grapple with their decisions and directions. The author's accurate portrait of small-town Southern life some hundred years ago strengthens the novel's thematic coherence and integrity of characterization. \\"Taking Lottie Home\\" packs an enormous emotional wallop; it is an inspirational, challenging and evocative triumph."},{"Title":"Taking Lottie Home: A Novel","review":"Like many others, I too started reading Terry Kay novels with &quot;To Dance With the White Dog.&quot; I received this book as a Chrismas gift and finished it in the time it took me to fly from L.A. to Fiji. What a way to spend a 10-hour flight! I won't recap the synopsis, but suffice it to say that this book will capture your attention from page one and hold you there until the epilogue. The epilogue is what really makes this a GREAT book and you can actually picture this book being a made-for-tv-movie. I'm re-reading it just to make sure that I didn't miss anything the first time!! A definite MUST READ for anyone that is a Terry Kay fan!"},{"Title":"Taking Lottie Home: A Novel","review":"&quot;Taking Lottie Home : A Novel&quot; is a good summer read that will pull you in, without knowing it. I saw this book on the discount shelves at the nearby conglomerate bookstore, and with its warm cover, I bought it. I was worried that the plot would revolve around baseball, but it only ties the characters together. It revolved back to teamwork and comradeship. The chapters will fly by, and before you know it, you're at the epilogue. That's where the story lost me, and I became confused. The references to grandma, Gra-Ma, mother, father, etc., made me confused about who was who. It's best to just leave off after the final chapter is finished. An enjoyable read. I recommend."},{"Title":"Taking Lottie Home: A Novel","review":"When I learned about Terry Kay's work, it came to my attention that he had run into trouble getting one manuscript accepted for publication. His agent looked at it and told Terry to move on to something better, more likely for commercial success. Terry persisted, but could not get any respect for it. He eventually put it aside and left it for twenty years or so. Fortunately, for all of us, he did not forget it entirely but persisted. It ended up being published and was called Kay's best book...called that by the author Pat Conroy. Very recently, here in 2012, and knowing about this background, I picked it up to read the first fifty pages. I couldn't help being curious about how an agent could have had so little sense. I worked through the first fifty and decided then to continue through the first 100 instead. By the time I passed the first several pages, I was hooked. The characters mattered a great deal, and the story that grew out of the characters drew me on from page to page. Lottie ended up being somewhat mysterious, and most attractive. I ended up wondering less about the place she identified as home. Instead, I learned to view her as home for another key character. Taking someone home to Lottie made perfectly good sense eventually.Mr. Kay should be especially proud of this lovely romance that he created. Whoever told him to turn aside from it and to forget it should instead be pushed aside and forgotten entirely by any of us.J.P.

Even though there is the threat of war, things seem to be much simpler--people a lot more laid back. Although the book itself was a nice, quiet read, I didn't care much for Lottie. Although she was supposedly one of the main characters, I enjoyed the book more when I placed her in the setting of a secondary character and stopped focusing on when and where she was going to fit into the storyline."},{"Title":"Taking Lottie Home: A Novel","review":"Terry Kay may be best known for his wonderful novel, TO DANCE WITH THE WHITE DOG, but he outdoes himself in this spellbinding tale of love lost and found at the beginning of the 20th century. The novel is so rich in characters and plot that it would be difficult to summarize either without falling short of the dimensions he's created on both counts. In Lottie Lanier, he has discovered a girl/woman for the ages, a character at times so simple, yet at others, complex, mysterious, and so downright appealing, you literally feel like she's in the room beside you as you continue reading.

Then I read the epilogue. At that point, the book became the great book. When a writer can write and make his reader feel the joy and pain of life as it really is, then he has risen to the top of the craft. He becomes like Hemingway or Steinbeck.

I would recommend this book to anyone, young and old!."},{"Title":"Taking Lottie Home: A Novel","review":"Some books, as well as characters, can haunt you for days, maybe years, after the reading is done. \\"Taking Lottie Home\\" is such a book. And Lottie Lanier is just such a character: part girl, part woman, and all too giving, with eyes no one ever forgets. So, too, is the character Ben Phelps, the young would-be dream-catcher, who catches the ball but only worships the dream, living it vicariously through the faraway exploits of the intangible, aloof Milo Wade. And there's Foster Lanier, who tastes the dream, only to see it turn bitter before finding his final, brief comfort in the arms of Lottie. Then there is Arthur Ledford, a lonely, tormented, fair but angry man, whose role in Lottie's life turns out to be nearly as surprising as Lottie herself. Even the minor characters are hard to forget: Ben's mother, Margaret Phelps, who clings to Lottie's child, little Ben; Ben's fiancee, Sally, who sees Lottie as the greatest threat to her happiness; Arthur's wife, Alice, a cold, hateful woman who seems to believe all women should be miserable by nature; Coleman Maxey, a pain-in-the-butt redneck troublemaker, and an assortment of other town characters who are either enthralled by Lottie or unnerved by her. There is also the strangest alliance of carnival bad guys ever to appear in a Kay novel: a one-armed giant and a midget. Lottie's story takes place in early 1900's Georgia and Kentucky, when it was still the train that took people to faraway places. It, too, could be considered a character in this story, as could the town of Jerico, which sounds a lot like long ago Royston, Georgia, just as Milo Wade sounds a lot like the baseball great Ty Cobb.Two great contemporary Southern writers are Terry Kay and Pat Conroy. It struck me, while reading this book, that the two men are interesting contrasts, especially regarding the way they write about the South. It reminds me of two men I once heard trying to describe the taste of a persimmon. Both liked the taste, but one said it was bitter, with a little sweet in it; the other said it was more sweet than bitter. For bittersweet stories about the South, it's hard to beat Conroy or Kay.

Why do we fall prey to people who promise us that they know something about the end times the rest of us unwashed masses don't? Over the course of these four books, Bonnie has moved the date of Jesus several times. Now she's conveniently got it firmly planted about 26 years from today (2006), giving herself plenty of time to write more books in the meantime.As for gematria, hey, I was one of the early converts to the Bible Code. At least that has scientific standards and statistics to adhere to. Gematria, as applied by Bonnie, has absolutely no guidelines. She pulls numbers out of midair, it seems. For example, she claims the diameter of the sun to be 864,000 miles. We all know (yeah) that a square drawn around the moon is 8640 miles around its perimeter. Which connects the moon to the Pyramid and the Nile's Delta which.... which...which. But wait, before you fall asleep from a cascade of numbers and nebulous associations, run a google search on the diamter of the sun. It's really 870,000 miles. As Roseanne Rosanna Dana of SNL used to say, \\"Never mind!\\" But I'm sure such a correction wouldn't deter Bonnie. She'd just find another verse with another gematria attached to it to link to 870. And maybe she'd use the diameter of the moon multiplied by the Golden Mean to come up with a \\"meaningful\\" number.Do you follow me? It's hocus pokus. Units of measurement mean nothing to her. Miles, feet, furlongs, meters, pyramid inches, cubits...whatever works for the moment. (Don't tell her that inches back in the Pyramid days weren't the same as today's inches.)But she keeps up the book machine, writing more and more drivel to suck folks like you and me drier and drier.

The book in my opinion endeavors to convince the reader that there was no direct US participation in Pinochet's coup and that Allende's efforts to govern were self-defeating. But the larger context, the general nature of US relations with Chile years and months before the coup and days and years after, is of great importance in understanding our foreign policy at the time, overt and covert, and the economic and political interests it served. I recommend an interested buyer first review current books and resources such as the Chile section on the National Security Archives site, which has many documents released after this book was written. Note the Nixon tape released in 2004 where Nixon appears to say that Korry, the ambassador to Chile prior to Davis, was instructed to keep Allende out of office through covert means but had failed to do so. Some obvious questions arise: why was Korry replaced and what type of ambassador would be selected as his successor? Would the CIA likely have worked with Davis, or work covertly without informing Davis? Did covert operations end when Davis began his service in Chile? Then turn to this book and see if you can penetrate a style of writing that, to me, raises as many questions as it answers. I think it likely this manuscript was carefully edited by the state department.

I admit, I bought it because it was free, yes - but I enjoyed it greatly. Granted, I do have a soft spot for that victorian-esque fiction...."},{"Title":"The Green Mouse","review":"In The Green Mouse (1910), Robert Chambers treats his readers to a familiar format: a series of goofily optimistic romantic tales, all loosely linked together by some sort of haphazard narrative device. In this case, the stories begin with the tale of William Destyn and Ethelinda (eeek) Carr. Destyn has been crushed by a recent financial upheaval - Mr. Chambers' favorite tactic for upending sedentary noble types.Despite four years at Harvard and a post-graduate degree in Engineering, Destyn \\"had not the vaguest idea of how to make money\\". However, he does have some skill as a stage magician - a handy knack that he developed in order to impress people at parties. Wisely, he realizes that card tricks are more useful than a Harvard degree and sets out to make a living as an entertainer.Destyn practices in the park, where he has easy access to the small woodland creatures that are integral to his act. It is here that he meets the lurvely Sacharissa Carr, a struggling artist whose studio is based in his building. Their acquaintance is deepened when one of Destyn's prize performers, a green-dyed mouse scampers into Carr's studio.It seems that there has been a bit of mistaken identity involved. Ethelinda isn't a struggling artist: she's proper old money that's slumming it with a middle-class studio. And Carr, who she assumed is an acceptable society twit, well... still is a twit, but one that's on the verge of taking a profession. Ethelinda marries William in the nick of time - had they fallen in wuv 24 hours later, he would have already been committed to doing something useful with his life.Once married, it turns out that William did learn something in graduate school after all. He learned of psychical waves. Mr. Destyn helpfully expounds upon his theory:\\"These new and hitherto unsuspected currents... are not electrical but psychical. Yet, like wireless currents, their flow eternally encircles the earth. These currents, I believe, have their origin in that great unknown force which, for lack of a better name, we call fate, or predestination. And I am convinced that by intercepting one of these currents it is possible to connect the subconscious personalities of two people of opposite sex who, although ultimately destined for one another since the beginning of things, have, through successive incarnations, hitherto missed the final consummation-- marriage!--which was the purpose of their creation.\\"Ladies and gentleman, we have ourselves a linking device.The rest of The Green Mouse falls neatly into order. With the backing of his wealthy father in law, Destyn creates the first of his devices and sets about the exponential growth of his business. The first step is to convince the rest of his family, and fortunately, Ethelinda's lovely older sister, Sacharissa (double eek!) is on hand for some experimentation. Skeptically, she gives herself over to the teleloveomitter in The Green Mouse's second tale.After her, the fledgling \\"The Green Mouse, Limited\\" is now out to find outside backers. And from there, the world... each tale explains how the dubious fall like dominos and the world steadily gives itself over to the match-making autocracy of the psychical transmitter.The Tracer of Lost Persons - Robert Chambers' most similar collection of linked love stories - is somewhat salvageable in that its core conceit, \\"Mr. Keen\\", became a strangely-compelling archetype. That collection was also substantially more diverse - Mr. Chambers punctuated the fatuous society love romances with other, outside interests such as Egyptology and the occult. The Green Mouse has no such saving graces. The sole story with any interesting component at all is the initial romance between William and Ethelina. William's financial plight gives his situation a sense of drama and Ethelinda's secret studio makes her slightly more than a paper-thin character. Had that particular drama continued - with William accomplishing the unknowable and actually doing something with his life - The Green Mouse would have been infinitely better. Instead, this collection is a paean to Aryan twittery - an endless collection of superficial, useless lumps all magically pairing off and sparing innocent people.The Green Mouse would have also been saved, if only for posterity, if Mr. Chambers acknowledged the utter worthlessness of his protagonists. Instead, he revels in it - an endless, unironic celebration of the absurd and the meritless. Even in his society novels - The Firing Line and The Fighting Chance especially - Mr. Chambers occasionally manages to sneakily insert some praise for the praiseworthy. In The Green Mouse, he never even bothers with this mild act of subversion. It is well worth reading Mr. Chambers' books - just not this one."},{"Title":"The Green Mouse","review":"This was a fun, free book, if you like turn of the century romances.

Specifically I reached location 236 or 12% of the book. The thing that stopped me was the overly gushy romantic relationship that was being described between the protagonists. Prior to that I was not pleased with the fantastic events introduced, although I usually enjoy reading well worked out whimsical prose. I am giving it 2 stars instead of one because I don't think I have given it a fair trial. But there are too many really good things to read on my Kindle for me to go on with this one"},{"Title":"The Green Mouse","review":"Based on some other reviews, I gave The Green Mouse a try. I was disappointed, but hey, free ebook, so there was no harm in trying.The book starts off with hints of further interesting things about two characters ... and then just walks away from them, except to take one character's invention to link a few vignettes. The invention is a device for finding one's soulmate, quickly and with 100% accuracy. Based on what the book presents, one's soulmate is always nearby, always physically attractive, always healthy, and always of suitable social standing from a good family. The book entirely ignores the many possibilities that such a device would offer up, like what happens if:- your soulmate is from a demographic you'd normally avoid as a romantic prospect (the \\"wrong\\" age, race, economic bracket, disability, religious or political affiliations, etc.)- your soulmate is thousands of miles away, or unreachable- you're already married, and your soulmate isn't your spouse- you're already married, bored or unhappy with your spouse, but your spouse turns out to be your soulmate after all- your soulmate is still a child, or hasn't been born yet- the device sometimes makes mistakes- the device can't find someone for you- your soulmate dies before you meet- you meet your soulmate, embark on \\"happily ever after,\\" but then your soulmate dies; do you get a second one?Instead of exploring any possibilities, it feels like the same vignette over and over. The end. The story of the character who doesn't want to use the device plays out just like all the others: the soulmate was conveniently nearby, attractive, and socially acceptable.The dialogue was often tiresome. All of them stammered, a lot, in response to just about any state of mind: confusion, nervousness, surprise, anger, or whatever. It be-be-be-came a ch-ch-ch-chore to -- to -- to -- to read all tha-tha-that st-st-stammering."},{"Title":"The Green Mouse","review":"The main plot ended weak, but the individual stories that support the plot are wonderful.

Worth the reading entertainment."},{"Title":"The Green Mouse","review":"I downloaded this book because it was free and have now downloaded all the other free books by this author because I enjoyed \\"The Green Mouse\\" so much.

At least, I think it is trying to be a comedy. Its sociology is extremely dated or was it supposed to be dated when it was written? A very perplexing book, but probably someone's cup of tea.

We read the story, then went back and inserted his name where Sam's was, and his sister's where Sophie's was. The illustrations are charming and tell the story well.

He tells all the ins and outs of the manufactured home buying process written from the perspective of a guy who is simply trying to tell you the truth. He is sincere and *very* knowledgeable and will save you significant money and hassle.As one reviewer noted, this is not the best editing job. There are a number of grammatical errors, careless things like a missing pro-noun or mispelled words. But you don't buy a book like this looking for pulitzer prize level literature. You buy it to arm yourself with information. Mr. Burnside does a very good job of doing just that, arming you, and does so in an easy to read/understand fashion. I read the whole thing in about 4 hours.He gives tips on all aspects of buying a manufactured home and setting it up on your property. But the primary focus is how to handle the home dealers and how to get the best deal with the right options. In that light it would be wise to have this book as but one book in your home buying collection. A great book that covers other important areas like finding and buying land (etc) in a more comprehensive way than Mr. Burnside's book is \\"Finding and Buying Your Place in the Country\\" by Scher & Scher (husband wife team). This is also a *must* have book. Do not as much as set foot inside a manufactured home dealer without reading this book.Good Luck! It is a best seller for a reason."},{"Title":"Buying a Manufactured Home: How to Get the Most Bang for Your Buck in Today's Housing Market (Home Resources Series)","review":"Kevin Burnside does a good job of covering the comprehensive subject of &quot;Manufactured Housing&quot;; what we used to call mobile homes. He reveals the secrets of the dealers and arms the buyer with the tools needed to make a good deal and avoid the scams of high pressure salesmen. The author also details the best options and features to order along with those features to decline. He reveals the type of construction that is desired and the type of contruction that is not desired. He includes real life dollar figures to guide the prospective buyer and provides the needed help particularily for first time home buyers who lack the knowledge and experience to distinguish between a good price and a bad price. This book is long overdue and brings the author's expertise to the table. There has been much written on car values and how to get a good deal on a new car. This book is one of the few written for mobile home/manufactured home buyers. I recommend this book to anyone looking to buy a new factory built home. I would have liked to seen the &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; article reprinted in the book instead of merely mentioned; and I would have liked some attention to used or older homes not just new homes. Perhaps that will be Mr. Burnside's next book?"},{"Title":"Buying a Manufactured Home: How to Get the Most Bang for Your Buck in Today's Housing Market (Home Resources Series)","review":"When Mr. Burnside first got this book published back in 1999, it was probably the best book on the subject, and helpful to consumers. The truth is, though, it is embarrassing by almost any standard today. The editing is non-existent, and that just shows the lack of thought that went into this. It was thrown together, and omits more than it conveys. There are far better choices now; most notably Wes Johnson's \\"The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook\\" that just came out. The latter is an outstanding book, well-researched, far more thorough, and much easier to read. It will also save you more money than any other book on the subject that I've read.

A manufacturer list or customer service survey of manufacturers would be nice too. Last but not least, the author's credibility was not helped by all the mis-spellings and errors. Didn't anyone edit this book for him?"},{"Title":"Buying a Manufactured Home: How to Get the Most Bang for Your Buck in Today's Housing Market (Home Resources Series)","review":"This book is amazing! I picked it up and opened to the middle, where the story of 'Travis and Tara' sounded way too much like the encounters my wife and I have had over the past few weeks.

The statements in themselves were like mini works of art. I started dog-earing pages that I wanted to be able to refer back to, and quickly noticed I was marking nearly every page.

Christina's lucid writing style is a pleasure to read, and her understanding and compassion emerge page after page almost like from an ocean of wisdom. It's the kind of book that it would take a lifetime to understand, in each reading seeing something in a fresh way or finding new gems of teaching through changing life situations. I found especially empowering her sections on bringing a radical light of awareness to the belief systems we accept and/or internalize. Her exploration of the subject opens new doors in seeking and finding our own belief systems that are of benefit to ourselves and our world. This can be a tough journey to navigate, and she gives not solutions but compass points by which to travel our own, individual, unique journeys. What a truly beautiful book, it is a gift to come upon! I am buying more copies to give to others - I came across it through the lending library of my meditation group and want spread the joy around plus have my own copy.

Ms. Feldman radiates a beautiful and empowering spirit, it is a blessing to come upon her writings."},{"Title":"The Quest of the Warrior Woman: Women As Mystics, Healers and Guides","review":"This book is a 21st century non-stop treatise on the inate attributes women possess and what they can accomplish by becoming more aware. This is not an anti-male book and the warrior image is not one of conquest or destruction. Feldman's woman warrior is focused on improving our society by rallying herself and others to effect the present by having the capacity of \\"being\\" aware and in the moment. This is essential in a world driven by \\"doers\\" who neglect the present in favor of a self-serving, tunnel-visioned future. The body of the work is filled with apt examples. Subtly weaving Buddhist priniciples throughout the text serves to anchor the meaning and wisdom of all the book encourages. Ms Feldman's writing is thoughtful, full of energy and insight and will be inspiring to women at whatever stage of life they find themselves."},{"Title":"Show Biz from Vaude to Video","review":"Abel Green's and Joe Laurie Jr.'s SHOW BIZ FROM VAUDE TO VIDEO (1951) is an amazing work: 650 pages (total) of smaller-than-usual font, it's jam-packed with fascinating trivia on all aspects of the American entertainment industry during the 20th Century's first half.Green was the editor of VARIETY. This anointed successor to owner/publisher Sime Silverman created that paper's unique style of slangy abbreviation, a slanguage that has been forgotten in modern times. Green's most famous headline, STIX NIX HICK PIX, from 7/17/35, meant that rural folks didn't like movies about rural folks.VARIETY lingo (&lt;--a good example right there) shortened words that often weren't in need of it. CRIX meant \\"critics,\\" CHIX was a chiseler, CHI meant Chicago. NABES were neighborhoods, B.R. was a bankroll, and B.O. wasn't what you think, but \\"box office.\\" Other terms were quite original. A MUGG was a Variety staffer. A TRENCH UNIONIST played in a pit orchestra. TOOK THE VEIL meant retiring from public life. THIRD SEX is one that survives. Others still in use are OBIT, PREZ, ORG, EATERY, DEEJAY and VIDEO, all words that first appeared in VARIETY.Joe Laurie Jr. was a vaudeville monologist who found a new career on radio, as a regular panelist on \\"Can You Top This?,\\" the riotous joke-telling program. His and Green's knowledge of Show Biz arcania is simply astounding.We learn within the covers of SBFVTV, that television was already a coming thing in 1926, and that the CBS system for color broadcasting was made standard in 1951. On the gossipy side, Al Jolson was sued for $500 K by D.W. Griffith when he quit a 1921 film that was only partially finished. Will Rogers' radio impression of Calvin Coolidge was so spot-on and humorous, the Prez boiled over it.A 1916 Hawaiian-themed song craze resulted in such gems as \\"Yacki Hacki Wicki Wackie Woo,\\" \\"Since Mary McCue Came Back From Honolulu\\" and \\"Yacka Hula Hicki Dula.\\" Too bad there wasn't radio back then!Celebrity passings are noted throughout this chronological popular history. Broadway shows and the film industry are covered as is radio from its infancy. Vaudeville's demise following the perfection of sound films is also detailed. To give an idea of how extensive this work is, its 40 page index contains somewhere near 4,000 names!

One contributor, Robin Winks, concludes that US intelligence (CIA) is not getting &quot;the right stuff&quot; now for four interlocking reasons: 1) academia by and large no longer cooperates with the intelligence community; 2) academia lost its interest in being helpful when it became apparent that the covert action tail was wagging the intelligence dog; 3) the intelligence community, apprehensive about recruiting from open institutions permitting violent war protests, made the clearance process so convoluted that it began averaging eighteen months; and 4) the agency began to recruit people who badly wanted to join and were willing to put up with a recruitment and clearance process that the best Yale students, the ones who withdrew from consideration, described as &quot;curious, stupid, degrading, and off-putting&quot;, with the result that the agency ultimate lost access to &quot;the self-assured, the confident, the questioning, and the adventurous-precisely the qualities that has been so attractive to the OSS-in the process.&quot; I myself know from discussions with the head of the office responsible for evaluating incoming Career Trainees, that the standard profile of a desirable candidate has always been &quot;the company man&quot; who goes along, except in two years-1979 and 1982-when they went after &quot;self-starters.&quot; Within five years, both those classes lost fifty percent of their numbers to resignation, and I believe that this problem continues to persist.

This year, I bought THE AMORALISTS, a collection of Colter's stories which includes the stories from THE BEACH UMBRELLA as well as four others. Those four are by far the weakest stories in the book.Colter was black and the vast majority of his stories are set on Chicago'ssouth side and feature black characters. I know this because Colter describes them as black, but the stories are universal and are equally relevant to any human being.The common theme in Colter's stories is the vague unhappiness of his characters. They come from all walks of life from upper class black society to middle class working families to down and outers and to more than a few elderly people whose useful life has passed them by and who wait, alone and lonely and with varying degrees of dignity, to die.Colter's characters are unsure of themselves and their lives. They are dissatisfied in their marriages, isolated, yearning for emotionally satisfying relationships; and their often imperfectly examined insecurities and anxieties are the basics with with Colter works.Colter's writing style is stately and somewhat old-fashioned, even for the 60s and 70s, and the dialog often has a feel of the late 40s and early 50s. But it is also quietly perfect, presenting his characters in a dignified and understated manner, intimating to, rather than coming right out and telling, the reader of their sadness. Colter understands the nuances of people's sorrow and his writing presents that understanding beautifully.Anyone who is interested in Colter would probably do just as well to read THE BEACH UMBRELLA as THE AMORALISTS, but either one is fine.I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"High-Resolution Electrophoresis and Immunofixation: Techniques and Interpretation","review":"An excellent discussion on theoretical and practical uses of serum protein electrophoresis."},{"Title":"High-Resolution Electrophoresis and Immunofixation: Techniques and Interpretation","review":"I am not a pathologist or involved directly in the medical profession. That said, I did have occasion to review this book which is unintelligible from beginning to end. I don't think ANY word is under 20 characters, unhyphenated or to be found in an English language dictionary. The experience is like reading a car mechanics guide but more specialized and much less interesting. A jargon fest.Although not from this publication, it reads somewhat similarly to this small, more comprehensible tract on a related topic also by Keren: \\"The buffer cations flow towards the cathode creating an endosmotic flow. Because of this reaction, some proteins that are weakly negatively charged and that would be expected to migrate toward the anode are found cathodal to the origin after electrophoresis is complete. Indeed, in CE, the endosmotic flow is responsible for pulling the proteins past the photodetector.\\"Not recommended to any reader but the pathologist living in a seemingly humorless alternative world."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Happiness: v. 6 (The Sufi Message)","review":"This is a book which really speaks in a simple, clear-cut voice of the beauty of the mystic path...it's the essence of esotericism without the obfuscation of intellectualism...It is a book to be read many times, even though you will understand it the first time through..."},{"Title":"Forty Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"During Barthelme's lifetime, I think many readers thought that his work would permanently alter the short story form. He achieved such powerful effects; his stories were so funny, so moving, so original and offbeat, and yet so deceptively simple and effortless-seeming. I certainly expected that other writers would come along and produce similar stories, since he had shown how it should be done, and we would be innundated with Barthelme-like fiction. But I don't think that's really happened. There have been imitators, of course, but they've been mostly embarrassingly flat, replacing the master's edgy brilliance with silly incoherence. Barthelme defies all imitators; his stories continue to stand as one-of-a-kind monuments, written in a truly singular voice by a truly singular talent, to urban life in the late 20th century. Read them. I particularly love \\"The Genius,\\" with its poignant and yet absurd portrait of the world's most brilliant man, and \\"At the Tolstoy Museum,\\" with its hilarious drawings of the great author's supposedly gargantuan coat, etc. It's funny because it's (somehow) true, like all of his work. \\"40 Stories\\" is the best introduction to Barthelme, so if you don't know him, this is the place to start."},{"Title":"Forty Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"This collection has many great short stories within it. Often, within this book, Barthelme shows himself to be an extremely creative and insightful writer. &quot;Jaws&quot; is a good example of this. Basically, it's a story about how people deal with their dissatisfaction in relationship; how lovers cope with significant others' inevitable inability to meet all their (the lovers') expectations. It follows a workers at a local A &amp; P while he mediates the relationship of two customers (who are married to each other). He acts as a sort of counciler in their marriage. The interaction between the couple is extremely humorous, and yet very sad (as, I suppose, dysfunction can often be). It's an excellent piece of work, and it deals with a common theme throughout this collection: The dissatisfaction of couples in long-lasting relationships. &quot;Chablis,&quot; &quot;The Genius,&quot; and &quot;Paul Klee...&quot; are also all excellent short stories. They exhibit Barthelme's ability to be humorous and yet still get at an interesting/serious point (that is, not lose himself in zaniness).After such praise, however, I must admit that this collection isn't without flaw. Out of the forty stories that are included in this book, I felt that about ten of them could have been pruned away. These stories (for example, &quot;On the Deck,&quot; and &quot;Blue Beard&quot;) seemed unfulfilled, and worse, overwritten. These, perhaps could have used a little more focus on content rather than style. It's true with almost any collection of short stories that not all of them are good, enjoyable, or interesting (that is, not all of them will catch your imagination). However, with this book there seemed to be quite a few of those. So despite the fact that many of the stories in this collection are great, I'm only giving it three stars.I would recomend this to anyone in search of a humorous, challenging read. I would also, recomend this to someone who is interested in cutting edge, stylized short stories (after all 25-30 of them in this collection are very good). Many of the short stories in this collection are written in an unusual manner. For instance, &quot;The Bodygaurd&quot; is compose almost entirely of questions. I'm also of the opinion that those of you who like both Kurt Vonnegut jr. and Thomas Pynchon would find this collection interesting."},{"Title":"Forty Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"Just over ten years ago a deeply righteous hombre with a handle to match--Omnipot, tray bong, non?--wrote right here on Amazon a nifty little five-star review of Mister Barthelme's Forty Stories. So here's the thing: the dude's opening paragraph mirrors so exactly what I myself wanted to say about my own recent encounter with the approximately fantastic Donald Barthelme that I'm going to go ahead and reprint the whole thing and hope Mister Pot doesn't sue me:\\"I laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and couple three times was even a little sad and one two times was made pensive with head on hand till I laughed and laughed and laughed and finished the story and read it again and laughed and laughed and laughed...\\"That was me to a total tee too, right down to the last laugh. Seriously, that's the whole nine yards in a single nutshell right there, O-Dog, you sum up in extra fine what a confounded pleasure it is to be shot full of magic bullets by this particular Don. Kudos to yudos in any case, Omnipot, I literally could not have put it better myself. All I can add I guess is even if the rest of you punters out there only end up reading a couple of these sublime flash fictions try to make sure the ones you choose include The Genius, Sinbad, especially Sinbad, Chablis, Construction, Lightning, RIF, and Letters to the Editore--mini masterpieces each one, massy minor triumphs in comic brevity. This dude Donald indubitably knew wherefore his Sam and knew wherefore what's more his Flann too the cheeky old devil and these wide open channels condense here to sometimes thrillingly familiar effect. In The Explanation, for instance, a zippy little page-turner composed entirely of questions and answers and illustrated to boot with a big black square, Donny Boy even manages to miraculously conflate his two rightly revered Irish forebears into one hysterical question: \\"Is the bicycle dead?\\" Brilliant. Just in case I'll mention the stupendous Sinbad one more time coz this lethally funny word weapon had me in the crosshairs from the opening salvo. One last thing: skip the utterly charmless introduction by super sap Dave Eggers, it adds precisely nothing to the otherwise wacky and wonderful proceedings and seems animated mostly by a grotesque self-consciousness laced with the lamest light touch this side of Dave Barry. Oof sez I. Remember in The Simpsons when a bespectacled Radioactive Man was about to be engulfed in a giant wave of green toxic sludge and he yells out, \\"My eyes! The goggles do nothing!\\"? Well Eggers here is the goggles. Or should that be are the goggles? Who cares, yank and flitter this witless dweeb's feeble farking flapdoodle and go directly to the straight dope by Don B. This wickedly funny wordy gurdy man is the prose equivalent of The King Biscuit Flower Hour and his shorty shorts are perfect jets of the purest japery--like the great Omnipot sez, read 'em and laugh and laugh and laugh..."},{"Title":"Forty Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"I agree with every word of the previous review, but think we shouldn't overlook Barthelme's cutting wit. His style of often sarcastic and edgy humour is possibly the most intellectually stimulating out there. It's one thing to be creative, but to not only purvey a state of mind-expansion in your reader but make him/her smile or laugh while doing so deserves kudos. &quot;The Baby&quot; and &quot;Porcupines&quot; are perhaps his finest examples in this regard... brilliant. My dinky little review doesn't quite do this man justice, just pick this book up for starters then graduate to the slightly more challenging &quot;60 Stories&quot; when the hooks are planted."},{"Title":"Forty Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"Bartheleme's work energizes creativity. It is playful in a way that beat writers never achieved. By letting images and thoughts run loose, he inspires creativity in the mind of readers. You do not need to take creative writing classes to learn how to write-you simply have to let your stories come out of what your imagination wants to say. This is the enlightenment that Bartheleme inspires. And reading this collection will vastly improve anyone's writing. It's complex, but never difficult and its effects are always surprising. He was as original and inspiring to writing as Jimmy Hendrix was to music. You will like this book."},{"Title":"Forty Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"As an aspiring writer, these stories by Barthelme give me hope that experimental literature still thrives in this sound byte-, laugh track-, talking head-prompted, fast-paced MTV culture of ours. For the most part, the stories take a level of patients foreign to the average reader, but are so creative, so clever, so breathtaking (to sound clich&eacute;)--and let's not forget: short (most average 6ish pages)--and so on that before you even have a chance to let one story sink in, you're already well into the next. Which, I might add, is a good thing. The stories challenge but, unlike contemporaries who mimic Barthelme's style, are not challenging in such a way as to detract or distract. They stick with you long after you've read them and, like Eggers says in his introduction, it's hard for someone who writes to make it through a page without being struck by an idea of their own. Inspiring stuff."},{"Title":"Forty Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"Donald Barthelme is one of the very few masters of the short short story. The only others that come to mind are Saki, Borges, and Franz Kakfa. Few of the stories in this collection extend past three pages. All are marked by the same virtues evident throughout the collection: surreality, inventiveness, enormous humor, a sensitivity to our collective culture. Some have commented on the collection being uneven. Perhaps. But the stories are quite diverse, and I suspect that what some find uneven is actually their diversity, some of them appealing more to one's particular bias more than others.This is a great collection for shaking up your perception, for making you reconceptualize the short story form. Anyone liking these stories should go on to try some Saki (the author, not the beverage). Although not as surreal as Barthelme, his stories are just as short, just as funny, and just as delightful."},{"Title":"Forty Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Marx brothers and origami have an affair.

However, a surprise awaits Mr. Waters when not one, but two adult children surface.The plot thickens not only with the discovery of the twins, but also when Clay realizes that someone is out to murder Georgie. However, that someone is set to not only destroy Georgie, but must destroy Georgie's twin sister, Bree in order to get what the murderer wants.Toni Shaw, Georgie and Bree's mother, and Charles Waters (Chuck) lover years ago is forced to protect her children in any way possible. Toni must confront Chuck after years of separation, but will the confrontation also bring to surface Toni's undying feelings of love? A love that was never buried even though Toni thought Chuck had neglected her in a time of need years ago. Toni must now confront all of her feelings for all the right reasons -- those for her children as well as to put a close to a past that held deep love and a future that still has love in it for Chuck. Those feelings of love are not only from Toni, but Chuck must also realize his feelings and what he gave up years ago.&quot;All the Right Reasons&quot; has suspense and romance.

But, the action flows so fast you won't have time to bite your nails! And if the hunt and chase is not enough to keep your heart pounding...the attraction between Georgie and her man Clay most definitely will!Once again, Ms. Sims uses a strong loving family as a backdrop for her story. True to her literary form, Ms. Sims develops all of her characters very well - even the household staff. The scene between the household cook and the killer will have you rolling! I also like the fact that the ladies in this story are not those faint-hearted, &quot;Owww, I twisted my ankle&quot; kind of women.Janice Sims does it again. All The Right Reasons is the fourth Janice Sims novel that I've read, and as always I was completely drawn in! Great job Ms. Sims. Keep'em Coming! Now that things have settled down, I'd like to know what happens to Toni and Chuck too."},{"Title":"All the Right Reasons (Arabesque)","review":"Janice Sims has a way with words as she writes this romance, adventure, murder mystery novel. She seems to be able to craft a story of romance with the twists of excitement of adding mystery. This is what we get, Toni Shaw, mother of twin daughters, Charles Waters, Toni's ex-lover and father of the twins, and Clayton Knight the private investigator. So with these major characters we get lots of humor, serious unresolved issues, major love sparks and some dangerous murder attempts. All this wraps up to be one good book that is worth every bit of time you give to read it all. I just have one problem with this book, it leaves us with so many unresolved answers to what happens to the major characters. But then again, I guess we just have to patiently wait for Janice Sims to give us a sequel to find out!

Overall it was enjoyable, however, I felt the love story between Georgie and Clay was lacking. There were so many things going on and so many characters being introduced that it was a bit confusing at times. I felt that Georgie and Clay's relationship was being overshadowed by the reunion of Georgie's mom and dad. I became much more interested in her parents relationship than I did with her own. I also feel that Sims did not spend enough time focusing on Georgie and Clay's romance.Although I have yet to read &quot;A Second Chance For Love,&quot; which is a continuation of this novel, I think I will like it better than this one. If you ask me, she could have combined both stories into one book, focusing on Toni and Charles's (Georgie's parents) romance."},{"Title":"Lee the American,","review":"This book differs from the many, many biographies of Lee in that it focuses on his psyche rather than his experiences. The author attemps to analyze the character himself in his various roles as soldier, leader, husband, father, private citizen, university president, etc. The writing style did not please me as much as the content. It was interesting to see the different facets of the man presented separately and with supporting documentation from Lee's own recorded words and the anecdotes of others. For those who cannot get enough of Robert E. Lee, this a good addition to the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Lee the American,","review":"Robert E. Lee remains one of the most well-studied men in the history of the world. This fine book was first published in 1912; it has, of course, been superseded by \\"R.E. Lee\\", Douglas Southall Freeman's definitive four volume work. Even when written, it was far from the first study of General Lee. But, this was the first biography by a Yankee, a highly distinguished author from Massachusetts. Dr. Bradford's people had fought against General Lee...removed from the veneration shown by some of our Southern authors, including Dr. Freeman, the respect of the author for his subject is all the more impressive.The work is divided into sections, chronological, and by subject. Lee's early years, and service in Mexico, are well covered. The agony that General Lee faced when following Virginia out of the Union is poignant. Dr. Bradford earned my respect by stating that he hoped he would have the courage to follow Massachusetts if ever faced with the choice. Various aspects of Lee's relationships during the war are covered by section...his dealings with Jeff Davis, the civil government, the Army, his family, Stonewall Jackson. There is a superb chapter on just how the General approached a battle, though this is not a comprehensive military history. See \\"Lee's Lieutenants\\".General Lee was a difficult man to know, which Dr. Bradford points out quite well. He suffered a miserable marriage, which the author is decent enough to keep quiet. A whole chapter is given to Lee's profound Christian faith, the real secret of how he kept going. His years at Washington College [now Washington and Lee] are impressively studied; he wanted to help young men be good citizens of one nation.This is an excellent, though short, work. It should not be anybody's first, or only, study of General Lee; Dr. Freeman took care of that. It may be tough to find [I got mine in the NPS bookstore at Appomattox]. Still, if you want a well written, respectful, and fairly complete, study of the greatest soldier who ever lived, it will well repay your time."},{"Title":"Lee the American,","review":"Bradford analyzes the mind and psychology of Robert E. Lee. Lee was perhaps one of the best known persons of the American Civil War, and both enemy and friend admired him. Bradford seeks an understanding of what made this man work. Why was he so loyal to Davis. What admirable qualities did he have? How did he treat his family? These are all answered in this book. The essentials of what made this old world man lead and fight in the biggest conflict of his time are all answered. He may have been on the losing side and fought for slavery, but there are great qualities about this man.This is an OK read about a great man. I learned something of Robert E. Lee that I didn't know before."},{"Title":"Notes to Draw From, Vol. 1: Comic Book Illustration","review":"This one is a keeper.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"J. Madison Davis argues that of all the story elements plot is the most important. Some writers might insist that characterization or theme would trump plot. Davis would answer that we can't know these characters until they actually do or say something. \\"We cannot know a character without that character undergoing a test, that test is the plot.\\"Much of what Davis says about plot is basic, but even accomplished writers need reminders, especially those that are blocked. One very helpful reminder is that plot is chronological. Even if your story starts in medias res (in the middle) the writer must know the beginning. Davis also stresses a causal chain: problem leads to solution, which leads to another problem, which leads to another solution until we finally reach climax where the story problem is solved. The intensity should also build, the main character's choices becoming fewer and fewer until he must choose at the climax.Davis also addresses such technical devices as story frames, which can help with suspension of disbelief. In CONNECTICUT YANKEE, for instance, Mark Twain has his main character get hit in the head before he travels back in time to Camelot.A bone of contention that Davis examines is the plot outline. Some authors worry that an outline may hamper spontaneity but Davis likes them because they give an overall view of the entire plot and help point out problem areas.Another helpful hint is the superiority of implication to outright statement. Keep back story to a minimum. Davis recommends music playing on the radio, news announcements, or headlines from a newspaper which can help to imply setting while characters are engaged in action.In the last chapter Davis addresses \\"Ready-Made\\" plots. It is his contention that there is no such thing as an original plot. As a matter of fact, he whittles them down to two: someone goes on a journey, and a stranger comes to town. Each of us, however, brings an original personality and perspective to the plot and that's where the real writing begins."},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"This book is short and sweet.

The author makes his points by reference to books, some of which you probably haven't read, but no problem--he summarizes the plot of each for you in enough detail to make his point."},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"If you're a beginner it might be useful, but you can get the same info written in a way that makes you really 'get' it, in a lot of other books. And you won't have to listen to someone telling you the plots of books you might like to read someday, and music he thinks you should hear - instead of this, try Jack Bickham's work, or Dwight V. Swain."},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"Although written with a swaggering condescension usually reserved for nannies, traffic cops, and other petty dictators, this book does have the merit of being the only one among the many how-to's I've read that offers methods for examining your plot rather than a description of what plots are and some of the things that go into them. Where most writer's guides give little real advice (I do not count such vagaries as \\"try to write scenes that advance your plot\\"), this one sets exercises that establish basic technical understanding and engagement with something that is generally vast and difficult to pin down."},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"If you're very confused about plot mechanics, you may find this book useful. It goes through the bare elements of how to create a plot and build it to its conclusion. It's nothing new for anyone who's read much about the process of writing (and the advice is not particularly well stated or illustrated), but if you're puzzled as to what plots are supposed to do, you might find it handy. In addition, it offers some \\"ready made plot\\" ideas, which I guess could be helpful if you had this awesome world and characters and were trying to brainstorm a plot for them."},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"This is a book written by an academic and aimed at beginning writers. To hype it as anything else is misleading, and to criticize it for not being something more is disingenuous. I'd be willing to bet Professor Davis simply decided to turn himself a handy profit by turning one of the beginning writer courses he teaches at the University of Oklahoma into a book. Nothing wrong with that.Here's what works: Prof. Davis puts those \\"purists\\" who scoff at the plot as a pesky hindrance to greatness squarely in their place. Plot, he points out, is the foundation upon which a story is told, and even writers who claim they simply sit down and write -- if they're honest -- would admit they actually have a fair amount of plot in mind when they start. Just because they don't make outlines doesn't mean their stories spontaneously generate from some fabled artistic well that only they can tap.Each of the plotting problems new writers fall victim to is named and dissected, and then solutions to the problems are presented. Unlike some of the other currently popular books on writing, this one doesn't glibly promise that it's easy and anyone can do it; writing a novel is one tough endeavor, and you have to do it right if you want it read. Shortcuts don't cut it.What doesn't work: True to its academic origins, this book is as much about analysis of the novel as a form as it is about writing a novel. There's hardly a shred of nuts-and-bolts, practical how-to. The flaw in this is that, by the time a person decides to write a novel, he probably already has a pretty darn good appreciation of the form.If you're looking for lists of the different types of plots and how to make them work, this probably isn't your book. However, this quick little read -- about 2 hours for me -- would make a nice jumping-off point for someone who isn't yet certain that novel writing is for him. If you *are* certain you want to write a novel, though, move on to _The Writer's Journey_ by Christopher Vogler."},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"I loved this book! I'm a multi-published author and a freelance editor. I've read a lot of how-to writing books and J. Madison Davis' book is one of the few that remains on my keeper shelf. I have a number of pages permanently marked for reference. It's a wonderful resource for any writer who wants to strengthen his plotting skills."},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"Davis writes as if he's been wounded. He's been damaged by the people who do not believe in \\"the supremacy of plot.\\" So this how to guide reads more like a manifesto, with that bitter tang from the slobber the author left on every page, hard at work, grinding that axe. I am not one of those people who think the \\"plot-driven\\" story is a lesser story. Character and plot are too intertwined to distinguish which keeps the story alive. Even though I believe that character and plot are two sides of the same coin, I still want to improve my plotting and I was hoping this book would actually help me do that. But what I got was a book that is more like a celebration of plot and less like a useful guide.Victoria Schmidt has a book called Story Structure Architect. She lists the different story structures and situations that one can build on to create plot. She outlines what should happen and when and uses a question section after outlining the necessary elements of a given design. She tells you what universal story structures there are, but by asking questions encourages you to use that structure for the story you want to tell. If you're a little more advanced and want a deeper look into all the elements of story, check out Adam Sexton's Master Class in Fiction Writing. His book also ends each chapter with a reading guide, but it's a specific list of works that exemplify the story element highlighted throughout the chapter.Or you can do what Davis himself suggests, read Aristotle's Poetics, which he uses as the basis for his entire thesis/guide to creating plot. Davis says that \\"Most how-to books are second-or thirdhand updates of The Poetics, expanding, but not really improving, Aristotle's insights.\\" That comes on page 8. How could I not think, \\"then what am I doing reading this?\\"(Of course I've read The Poetics. It's not as wonderful as Davis' hyperbole would have you believe, but it's definitely better than his book. I prefer Sexton and Schmidt.)"},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"Anyone who gives this book 4 stars or more has to be an English teacher. There's no WRITING in this writing book!Now, there are lots of writing books that all are presentation and are still quite good. Anson Dibell's &quot;Plot&quot; comes to mind. This book, however, features &quot;workshops&quot; at the conclusion of each chapter, so one might expect more hands-on work with plotting. If so, one would be disappointed.The workshops are *not* about writing; they're about reading and analysis, where you take existing novels and analyze them for technique. Unlike other books on this topic, such as &quot;Building Better Plots&quot; by Robert Kernen, none of these &quot;workshops&quot; offer any opportunity for hands-on practice and experimentation with your own writing.This is fine for an absolute beginner who has never written or for a reader of novels who wants to learn appreciation of novel structure. But there are no suggestions or guidelines for the novels you select for analysis, just &quot;ones you like.&quot; Novels can vary enormously in application of various techniques and in how successful they are - or aren't - with those techniques. An absolute beginner would need more guidelines in selecting good material, knowing what to look for, and evaluating its success or failure.For anyone with more experience, or who is eager to find ways to apply plotting techniques directly to their own writing, this book falls short."},{"Title":"Novelists Essential Guide to Creating Plot (Novelists Essentials)","review":"The discussion presents some interesting ideas and points, but the author uses obscure examples from ancient Greek stories.

It is, by no means, a gangbuster keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat John Grisham thriller. Nor is it a fluffy ersatz literary attempt like so many books today.The main character of this novel is a perpetual contemplate. He is a kind of circuit pastor who is constantly in thought about theological issues. He has a one-track mind that is completely focused on God, until one day, it's not.What I loved most about this book is that there is no incredible heart-pumping climax--no one is running from the law, no one gets shot, and nothing blows up. The story is simply a level piece that whose crisis is seemingly minor, and whose climax is wholly conveyed through the thoughtful, philosophical, and searching mind of the protagonist. The protagonist, in his journaling, will often reference a Bible verse, and then, he will expound and expound as though he were giving a sermon. But his thoughts aren't preachy, rather, they are simply the internal workings of a man whose focus is on nothing but how God is working in him, through him, and around him. Hobbs' writing is so compelling that you will suddenly you find yourself empathizing with his protagonist. The struggle through which the protagonist goes is so innately human that you will quickly see the world through his eyes. You too will find yourself on a journey with this pastor, and amidst his crisis of faith you may find yourself amidst your own.And so, if you begin this book, make sure to read it through. Allow Hobbs' beautiful prose to bring you full-circle, so that both his protagonist's and your soul may find themselves at ease."},{"Title":"The Short Day Dying","review":"Not often does one come across a novel that is original both in content and style. Peter Hobbs' debut novel is one of those rare cases. Hobbs manages to draw the reader into the world of the narrator, Charles Wenmoth, within a couple of pages, and remains faithful to his approach thereafter: Using simple prose interspersed with powerful images and similes, and a rhythm dictated by Wenmoth's thoughts and state of mind. The reader begins to see the world through Wenmoth's eyes and is utterly gripped by his determination and shocked by his occasional lack of sensitivity, especially in matters of the heart. Where lesser novels or TV soap operas need explicit action scences or a soppy soundtrack, Hobbs manages to create extreme suspense and atmosphere by slowing down the narrative pace, sometimes almost to a standstill - only to speed it up again by throwing in a one-page chapter or a summarizing paragraph here and there. And always sticking to Arthur Schopenhauer's advice: Use ordinary words to say extraordinary things. Or, sometimes more appropriately in Hobbs' case: Use ordinary words to say ordinary things in an extraordinary way. A thoroughly enjoyable and thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"The Short Day Dying","review":"Set in 1875, The Short Day Dying is reminiscent of a mellifluous tone poem, a spiritual ode to one man's hard driven life has he struggles to come to terms with his faith and the glorious natural beauty of the world around him. Narrated in the first person, author Peter Hobbs stunningly emerges us into the world of Charles Wenmoth, a poor and solitary Methodist lay-priest who spends his days preaching to townsfolk and attending to the sick, whilst working as a blacksmith at the local forge.Life for Charles is tough; he's a lonely and somewhat tortured soul, who throughout the course of the novel is forced to question his faith. A simple man \\"unfit for beauty and grace,\\" he admits he has an untutored mind and often he struggles in his sermons to get to the truth of things. It is only when he is wondering through the bucolic beauty of the Cornwall countryside that he manages to feel rejuvenated and at peace.When Charles visits Harriet French, a young local woman who is dying, her deep illness acts as a catalyst and he begins to question much of what he sees around him. There's much anger here - anger at his people who have turned away from faith and who now have so little love for \\"the Lord,\\" abandoning their search for the \\"pearl of great price,\\" determined to satisfy themselves with worldly ambitions.There's also anger at the men who once came and opened up the land with mines and quarries, extracting its wealth. For this is an area of England where villages that were once prosperous with farming have now decayed, becoming cracked and grimy; the mining does not seem to have bought riches to these communities. Over the years, families that Charles has loved, preached to and cared for, have fallen on hard times.The mortal sins of drink have also struck the land, causing a terrible curse, with people destroying themselves, and there are those who have invited it to the family's table as though it were food to live from. A reunion with James, a childhood friend, causes Charles to reflect and remember, but his memories cannot bring back happiness and every delight he has in them seems but a form of sadness and loss. It's \\"where the past is a small domain, it's boundaries are thin and close.\\"Throughout the course of the novel, Charles's faith is constantly tested. He's beleaguered by regret and melancholy, and often feels quite downcast - there's \\"a darkness to his soul and he wonders what spirit or sadness possesses him\\" - and he even becomes conscious that God himself and the holy savior are perhaps testing him. It is only through his relationship with the land that he realizes \\"heaven resides at our feet as well as over our heads.\\"The text ignites as the author contrasts the struggles of Charles as seeks to offer the ailing Harriet spiritual solace, whilst enduring the aloofness of her younger brother and her lonely mother. He also must contend with the constant antipathy of his landlady who seems to resent his obvious poverty. Only with patience does he manage to keep his faith a hard stone, \\"a small thing but powerful and not easily crushed.\\"Told almost in a stream-of-consciousness style with very little punctuation, The Short Day Dying takes us into the very heart of one man's journey towards redemption. Hobb's theme is one of healing, no matter the damage and empathy for a world that often seems careless of human feelings and their place in the universal scheme of things. Totally encapsulated in a world of faith and belief, we see \\"how God and the world are one, the land a proper representation of his order.\\" Mike Leonard July 06."},{"Title":"The Short Day Dying","review":"I picked this book up at the library eventhough it isn't the type of book I normally read. It was a slow read for me. The main character (dont' think I learn his Christian name until midway through the book) speaks through the pages as I would imagine someone from that era to speak. He's a simple man who lives to please God. His life is rough and burdensome. There's never enough of money to do the things he wants and needs to do yet he still finds time to give to those in need. He's giving of his time especially to a young blind lady on the threshold of death. His landlady will make you despise her. She's a cruel being. This book has a very morbid, depressed \\"theme\\" BUT there are so many passages that I re-read and actually THOUGHT about because it resonated so with my own life. That desire we all have to return to childhood and simpler times. That urge to be with old friends of our youth and fight against adult hood and it's seriousness. There is much talk of death which causes even more reflection. I kept wondering how could someone who doesn't even know I exist possibly know that's is EXACTLY how I feel?This book is definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"The Short Day Dying","review":"A dense, well-crafted novel, The Short Day Dying is narrated by a young preacher, Charles Wenmoth, who slogs through the mire of both uncertainty in his commitment to his faith, and his nostalgia for childhood. Set in 1870, the book has an integrity of pacing and voice that is like being lifted unawares by a cherry picker, startling at first, but then soothing with an enjoyable view. Though Wenmoth is a preacher, the reader never feels preached at and instead becomes immersed in the problems of spreading belief in times and towns full of poverty and disease.To read more reviews check out Void Magazine's website."},{"Title":"The Short Day Dying","review":"This is my favorite book of all time, perhaps because I grew up as a son of a preacher. I too questioned my faith as the young preacher of the story does countless of times. As he I too enjoy the outdoors and have cherished beautiful relationships with those whom I admire.

I am on my third or fourth read."},{"Title":"The Short Day Dying","review":"I really enjoyed reading this story about a lay preacher in the 1800s in Cornwall.

This one will go on my favorites shelf."},{"Title":"The Short Day Dying","review":"This is Peter Hobbs' first book and one of the most touching works of fiction adressing the purpose of life, search of faith and reliance on family I have read recently. Set in late 1800s, it is written in the language of that time, having young apprentice priest for a narrator. This young priest ministers in the area where poor people live, working in fields or mines. Misery is all around it with illness, deathly accidents in mines, inhabitants' affinity for drinking and gambling, lack of hope that leads people in disarray both spiritually and physically. In the process of ministering to his parish's needs, young priest comes in contact with dying Harriet French who is blind and has difficulty breathing. In spite of her illness, Harriet is faithful and believes that she is going to a better place, full of light and love. She surrenders to her fate without any resistance or regret and just observing her in her process of dying sends young priest for a quest of search for the Grace of God. For he is a decent man, honest and sensitive, too poor himself to help his parishiners financially. Upon Harriet's death, young priest is on the crossroads of his own life, his professional calling, his desire to go to Australia. He wishes to be able to experience the grace of God, but that will be no easy task for him. We can feel that life itself is a burden to him. In spite of his love for his family and his brothers, he is lonely and troubled. We can only wonder what life will push in front of him before he can make a choice himself; a choice long lasting with real consequences that he alone will have to bear all alone, on his own terms. I am looking forward to reading Mr. Hobbs' future published works. He is a great talent."},{"Title":"Understanding Research in Second Language Learning: A Teacher's Guide to Statistics and Research Design (Cambridge Language Teaching Library)","review":"\\"Understanding Research in Second Language Learning\\" is the perfect book for any teacher or researcher who would like to be able to critique or assess statistical research papers without having to spend an inordinate amount of time studying math in the process.

What it reveals is the connection between his success at investing and his character.&quot; -- Daily Telegraph"},{"Title":"Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett, Abridged Edition","review":"First, I want to mention two constructive feedback about this book. One is that this book is probably only suitable for Warren Buffett fanatics/fans. For general investors interested about Berkshire Hathaway or how Warren Buffett invest, this is probably not the best book to read (as it has so much more info. i.e. more than 1000 pages). Second is that I have read this book more than once and I still don't know how the book is organized (the chapters aren't following chronological order, alphabetical nor topical order), therefore it is quite confusing to read as you progress from one chapter to another. Only after you read enough chapter (or completed the book) then you can put it all in the big picture in your head (from Warren's childhood till his current Berkshire days). Nonetheless, kudos to Andrew Kilpatrick for putting this book together. Moreover, once you know the limitation, this book is easily considered the best book about Warren Buffett in my opinion.Now about the content of the book. You will learn a lot about Warren Buffett and his life, and not only investing topic (investing decisions that he made throughout his career) but his life principles, family, and business in general as well. You will learn about his first job delivering papers when he was 13 (he filed income tax and deducted the bike as business cost), and how he build his first business (pinball machine business), created Buffett partnership, break it up (liquidate), acquire berkshire mills, creating Berkshire Hathaway as investment vehicle, and many other great investment decision/story that he made (Geico, See's Candies, Dairy Queen, General Re, Coca Cola, Salomon, Washington Post, Gillette etc)Buffett concrete rules for investing are:1. Never lose money2. Never forget rule #1I know it's easier said (what he say above about to never lose money) than done based on my 10 years of invesitng experience , but then again I'm no Warren Buffett.In my opinion, here are the 5 strategy/skills that Warren Buffett uses (Mr. Buffett, please correct me if I'm wrong):1. Intrinsic Value2. Margin of Safety3. Temperament (discipline and understanding Mr.Market)4. Circle of Competence (knowing what your circle of competence)5. Common Sense (which I think is the most important factor and encapsulate everything about Warren Buffett.)You will learn that Warren is very good with numbers (calculating in his head) and memorizing so many facts and numbers. You will also learn that Warren is a man with a very good sense of humor.There are so many things/chapters that I like on this book. Let me try to mention two of my favorite sections.One is when Warren need to make a decision who would run Salomon ($150B institution with 8000 employees) within 2 days during their first crisis. There are 12 top-level managers that he interviewed. \\"This was the most important hire of my life\\", said Warren to the Columbia business students. The chapter explain his thought process of this candidate selection in detail. Warren mentioned that the good news (for the students and the candidate) is that he didn't ask what their grades were (laughter). Warren also said, \\"Somebody once said that in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence and energy. and if they don't have the first, the other two will kill you. if you think about it, it's true, if you hire somebody without integrity, you want them to be dumb and lazy\\" (laughter). And he conclude the topic with this statement which I think is very powerful: \\"Pick the kind of person to work for you that you want to marry your son or daughter. You won't go wrong\\". By the way, he picked Deryck Maughan by the way for his integrity.Another chapter that I really like is how Warren put the audience (of more than 2000 people) through Business School in an electrifying two minutes (The chapter about \\"Generics\\"). See how Warren answer the question of \\"Will developments in the generic brand area hurt coca-cola?\\" which is a very important questions. I'll try not to spill too much and take the joy of reading this chapter yourself but he basically explains in a nutshell (with all the details and numbers) how business and competition works (and using several other example like Gilette, Marlboro, Sam Cola etc) and how he convinced the audience (and me as a reader) that coca cola is considered immune to generics. He explains how one can save $500 for smoking generic brand (vs Marlboro) which is a lot of money. While a man will probably will only save $11 per year by not using Gilette Sensor and probably leave band-aids on his face and an uncomfotable experience for opting for generics/lower quality blades. And for coca cola, the net profit margin is only 1 cents per serving (can) while a lot of the ingredients cost (such as the aluminium close to 6 cents a can, sugar 1.3 ounce per can or 1.75 cents etc) the same regardless for coke or other cola company.I'll stop here before it's getting too long. In summary, If you are a Warren Buffett fans, then this book is for you. If you are uncertain, you can get other books first (potentially less thick book), like \\"Warren Buffet Way\\" or maybe \\"Buffettology\\", and if you like them (Warren) or want to know more about Warren then get this book. I personally don't like it in the beginning but as time goes by (and after I re-read the book/chapters), I changed my mind, this book is a masterpiece.As a Berkshire shareholder, I want to encourage all berkshire shareholders (and potential/future shareholders) to read this book to know more about the person in charge of your berkshire investment. I also want to encourage all shareholders to go to the annual shareholder meeting while Mr. Buffett is still in charge.Last but not least, if I have to sum this book up in a word or two, I would use the word \\"WISDOM\\" to describe this book, though I have a strong feeling that Warren will disagree with me and think that the more suitable phrase is \\"COMMON SENSE\\"Happy Investing!Sidarta Tanu"},{"Title":"Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett, Abridged Edition","review":"This is obviously the most comprehensive book ever written on the life of Warren Buffett, the undisputed world champion of investing.

The book is written in the third person, by the way. After the disappointing, The Summons, Mr. Grisham is riding tall again with this fast-paced, woven cloth of a tale that follows the mercurial rise of a burned out Public Defender, Clay Carter, as he becomes the King Of Torts. Clay is injected with sudden wealth by a deal with a mysterious, rattle-snake-booted man, Max Pace. Dat Max, he be de debil. Max puppets Clay in a lightning settlement for the families of murder victims, whose assailants were deranged by a cryptic, anti-drug-abuse drug made by an invisible parmaceutical company. Clay's soul is further bartered for a tip from Max about Dyloft, an anti-inflammatory that causes bladder tumors. Max provides the damaging insider research and Clay is rocketed into the solarity of mass tort litigation, a galaxy of massive egos, Gulf Stream private jets and lots of good meals. He becomes adept at six figure mental calculations. The unraveling begats exquisite discomfort as Clay becomes The King Of Shorts. Sub-plots of lost love, a father turned Hemingway, an achingly beautiful Georgian (that's the Georgia where vodka is preferred) model and the power of friends are masterfully integrated into this tellers tale. Grisham exposes an important truth: mass litigation, when fueled by soul-less greed, can bring mass pain and ruin lives. I took a break from my re-write to read this. No regrets."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"When one is reveiwing products, books, movies, what have you, it is essential to find the difference between what you dislike and what you realize, objectively, is just plain lousy. There are movies and books that you realize are well done, but they just rubbed you the wrong way. Then there are works like the King of Torts, which you realize are just plain awful.I read on the inside cover of the King of Torts a blurb about how a public defender was taking on the case of a seemingly assuredly guilty murder suspect. Ahhh, said I, virgin territory for Grisham. Through brilliant legal work the protagonist will foil a seemingly airtight case. Alas, the book was nothing like that. Now, the blurb-writer is not to blame, for trying to summarize the plot of this book is like trying to hold water in a sieve. Suddenly people are throwing money at J. Clay Carter, offering him millions of dollars to start a lawfirm and get paid millions for settling easy cases (something that, no doubt, occurs often in the real world). This mysterious character keeps sending him cases that make him millions, earn him a beautiful girlfriend, millions of dollars worth in luxury items, and the title of the King of Torts. Then everything goes downhill, including a baffling scene in which the main character is beaten and in the hospital and his friends look at him and start laughing at him, and eventually J. Clay Carter is left with nothing, except his old girlfriend who comes back to him when he has been sufficiently humbled. Of course, the book ends with the typical Grisham, \\"Character leaves his hometown, never to practise law again.\\"Huh? What? Why? Is this some modern retelling of the story of Job? Was Grisham just not rich enough and had to churn out filth for a quick million? Who is the mysterious character who takes it upon himself to make Carter a millionaire? Where is this book going...did it go anywhere? How could any book possibly make The Summons look decent. Two words: look elsewhere. 1/10"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book starts off well and gathers wonderful pace in the middle. I thoroughly enjoyed the the first three quarters of the book, but I felt Grisham lost his way towards the end of this story and didn't really know how to finish what he had started. I think the main problem was that it became increasingly difficult to continue to like the main character as the story developed. I guess this is a reflection of the trade he had chosen to ply - does anyone like a tort lawyer? One knew that as the story went by it looked increasingly likely that Clay was going to be hoisted by his own petard, but I was really looking for a story twist that would bring him out on the right side. I felt let down.This is well short of his earlier quality demonstrated most memorably through A Time To Kill. On reflection I suspect he wrote this book in something of a hurry, he probably had an obligation to his publisher. Sorry John, you can do better."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I just finished listening to this book on Audio CD. Let me clarify; I didn't actually listen to the entire story. I simply got tired of listening to a story that dragged on and on without much action.

I took the lazy way and had someone else read it to me. Otherwise, I might not have read very much of it.The book starts out smart as the plot develops. But during the second half, I realized the plot was not building toward anything. I didn't find myself wondering (or caring) what was going to happen next.I have just a few chapters left, but I really don't care how it finishes. I'm going to find something else more interesting."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter is a young Public Defender and has held the job for five years; he's sick of the job and wants to have a real job in a real firm. His wish is granted when, with the help of an undercover source he uncovers a major conspiracy involving one of the biggest drug companies in the USA. Clay quickly makes a fortune and gets into the buisness of mass tort lititgation( which is where the big bucks are made in the attorney world.) Will Clays rapid success make him lose his mind, money, and girlfriend, or will he come out on top as the new King of Torts? The King of Torts by John Grisham is a book with many twists, turns and a subplot of love, and overall an outstanding book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you like books closer to real life, where the line between villian and victim is grey, you will probably find this a very good book.I thoroughly enjoyed this book for the main reason many didn't, you had to look to your own moral compass to distinguish sinner and saint and not rely on the author to all but spell it out for you. Which I believe gets us just a little more acquainted with who we are.John Grisham, as his manner is, takes the reader on another crash course of law, in this book, tort litigation. John Grisham is adept at weaving this education into his books without you realizing it until you get into a conversation with someone and the things you read roll of your tongue as if you are an expert yourself.The story line was excellent, interesting and insightful. However, the romance is a bit vague and disconneted (to me this has never been one of Grisham's strong suits anyway). Overall, I found it to be a book hard to put down."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Following the $253 million judgement agains the maker of Vioxx, I heard a Seattle radio host mention \\"The King of Torts\\" as 'one of Grisham's best,' a book that deals precisely with huge verdicts against pharmaceutical producers. Days later, I had waded through yet another disappointment from a writer whose popularity absolutely escapes me. Perhaps it's the PREMISE of his books that lure me in: lawyers for the mob, young attorney takes on big business, etc. Nevertheless, I continue to be numbed by the pedestrian writing of John Grisham, his often awkward phrasing and complete lack of energy when it comes to plotting.Out of respect for potential readers, I will not reveal the precise details of the book's major disappointment but it concerns a far-off trial that captures the attention of the main character. It is critical the outcome falls in his favor, and from all reports he receives, the trial is going well. The plaintiff's flamboyant attorney out West is shredding the opposition, demolishing the opponent's case and frightening the defendant into asking for a settlement. The case is so strong that the defendant is begging for a settlement which is rejected out-of-hand. Finally, when the decision of the jury is announced, the verdict goes completely the Other Way. HUH? Grisham not only gives us no reason to suspect this possiblity, but even worse, there is no explanation for such a turn. Folks, this is not a twist, this is a failure on the part of the author to respect his audience and a failure of his editor to say, \\"Hold it, John, you're letting down the reader here, they deserve to know WHY this happened.\\" Nope, not a hint. The book then wraps up with a whimper, devoid of suspense, tension or relief. (And don't even get me started on his nonsensical love/hate relationships!)If there's one good thing that came of this, it's that \\"The King of Torts\\" cured me of reading John Grisham EVER AGAIN."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am a fan of Grisham and have been for many many years. This book, however, is so full of holes that I was amazed that I was reading something by the same author that wrote a 'masterpieces' such as \\"The Firm.\\"Clay Carter is an overworked public defender, having worked five years in the Washington, D.C. public defender's office. He is suddenly offered the chance to earn a quick $10million by persuading victims' families to accept a no-questions-asked $5million rather than suing a pharmaceutical company. He is then offered a second, larger case through which he earns $100million. Then things fall apart with the third case.I did not care for the main character at all and while that happens sometimes in books, usually it is a device to prove a moral. In this case, I didn't like him because he did things that no lawyer with any intelligence (and supposedly this Carter is intelligent) would do. For example, he performs some insider trading without blinking an eye. The whole set-up for this to happen was ridiculous.Secondly, I guess I was supposed to feel something for him and his girlfriend. They break up, she gets married, and I guess I was supposed to wish for them to get back together and/or to feel sorry for Carter. I didn't do either mainly because there was absolutely nothing written to show that they even cared about each other, with the exception of some stereotypical sexual encounters - she in particular came off as nothing more than a spoiled rich girl.All in all, this is the absolute worse book by Grisham I have read and I have to say that I would not recommend this one to anyone unless they are truly diehard Grisham fans."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Poorly written. Lacks real tension. The denoument is as predicable as it could be. The thread is meandering, and plot development is written in a &quot;by the way&quot; style that is extremely annoying. I finished the book, but recommend skipping it."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham has the power to entertain which continues with King of Torts. A frustrated lawyer in the public defenders office gets a taste of wealth and fame that proves to be addicting and takes him on a wild ride that can only end in disaster. Along the way, this book is an indictment (and education for the reader) against greedy lawyers who grow wealthy through the filing of mass class actions. What makes Grisham so enjoyable is his ability to make the characters seem alive. In this book, I found myself wondering what I would do in such a situation. The reader is a fly on the wall of the tale of a protagonist on a downward moral spiral worthy of a rock star. Unfortunately, just when the plot starts to climax, the book screeches to a halt. Although he created a great story-line, Grisham owed us an ending too."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham is my all time favorite writer, and this book solidified it for me. The characters and sceneries are well developed in this book.

Hardworking and underpaid public defender J. Clay Carter becomes ensnared in the vulture culture of mass tort litigation and greedy trial lawyers. Although he easily adjusts to the trappings of the easy wealth that comes with massive fees earned in his schemes, he ultimately learns that everything comes with a price. This book is an indictment against trial lawyers and class action law suits brought against deep pocket corporations and their entities.Grisham can do better than this. The book may have held my interest more if there was a twist in the ending revolving around the illusive and mysterious fireman Max Pace and the vacuous Ridley."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I really enjoyed The Brethren and Rainmaker. Both those books had charm. In the Brethren, there was a bunch of \\"lovable rogues\\"...the book was written with obvious pleasure, which the reader could enjoy.On the other hand, The King Of Torts is too mechanical.I have not yet read the full book, but half of it reads like a manual on how to start a stellar law business. Almost there should be a web site where you could download the financial spreadsheets that are discussed in the book....a slight disappointment for me."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I love John Grisham books.

Clay Carter resigns his job in the D.C. public defenders' office to follow the advice of a shady stranger in the pursuit of a multi-million dollar settlement from a drug company. This deal gives him the resources to plunge into several lucrative tort cases and draws his practice to the attention of other hugely successful attorneys who specialize in these types of lawsuits. Clay is at first appalled at the trappings these lawyers have acquired, including private jets and posh homes, but he soon feels the need for all these luxury items, including a trophy girlfriend. We know that it's only a matter of time before his house of cards tumbles to the ground. The question is when and how everything will start to unravel as Clay becomes increasingly more cavalier about spending huge sums of money. Meanwhile, the love of his life, Rebecca, whose nouveau-riche and obnoxious family never approved of Clay's public defender job, has dumped him and married someone else. At first, I was hoping Clay had won the attorney's equivalent of the lottery, and I applauded his apparent disdain for going overboard with the accoutrements that go with his newfound success, but he disappoints in every way. From a reader's perspective, this is not necessarily a bad thing, since we know he's going down eventually. Will he find redemption and win Rebecca back? This question is what kept me reading."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The main conflict does not happen until about 1/4 of the way through. It should have happened much earlier. I almost stopped reading at that point, wish I had. The first quarter of the story could have been condensed, and it would have made it much more interesting. I wish I could say the rest of the 2/3 of the book was good. :* The rest was predictable, trite and shallow. Shall I go on? Why? What a waste of time. Sorry Grisham - a miss."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I totally enjoyed reading the King of Torts. It was unpredictable from the beginning to the end with lots of character development and intrigue. I thought the ending would have been different as I was hoping that Clay would have been rescued in the final minutes by a huge settlement. Of course, this would only have delayed the self destructive direction of Clay Carter and his legal \\"get rich quick scheme\\". The story provided an interesting insight into the Tort legal process with all of the moral and ethical issues overshadowed by greed."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I always look forward to a new novel by John Grisham, having read all of his previous published works. Although his last four novels did not exhibit quite the intrigue, character development, and spell-binding plots, typical of his earlier works, they were interesting nevertheless.For some reason, however, I was expecting more from THE KING OF TORTS, and hoped that it would capture some of the qualities of THE FIRM, THE CLIENT, et al. In keeping with Grisham's trend of declining creativity, though, THE KING OF TORTS was enjoyable, but not outstanding. The ending was particularly disappointing, as Clay's (the main character) avarice had been self-condemned and, as such, should not have cost him EVERYTHING."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book has Grishman's tried and true formula. He does an excellent job of developing the characters. The first two-thirds of the book are great. The last third lends itself to a quick crash and burn. This may work the first time. However, as soon as the course of the book changes, anyone who has read any of the previous novels will guess what is going to happen next. It is just a matter of when.The interesting part of this book was the main character's willingness to cut corners to get ahead. At the same time he is very naive as to how big business really works. This makes Clay a much more believable person for this book's storyline. One area that was totally unbelievable was the insider trading issue. Anyone graduating from Georgetown law school would know these laws."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is an okay book, reminiscent of Grisham's previous works. Characters are only moderately interesting and the plot is really quite boring. What really bothers me is that he doesn't really break any new ground with this effort, and I have to wonder what his future plans are. I think he needs to make a major change with his next book and break out of his current mold. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham can weave a great story, but sometimes he just feels like regurgitating the same tired formula. An underdog, poor lawyer goes through some life changing thing, fights off some highly paid unstoppable law office, struggles a bit, but in the end finds out true happiness. This book isn't really that different from the rest. While not as obvious or black and white as The Street Lawyer, it definitely doesn't compare to the Rainmaker, the Chamber, or his non-law books like a Painted House or Skipping Chirstmas.This time the young lawyer is a young district attorney who stumbles onto a case where he meets a mysterious man who leads him into a mass tort litigation. After leaving his girlfriend of many years, he quickly becomes entangled in the rich mega lawyer lifestyle of mass tort firms. He changes from a man who cares little about money to a money hungry lawyer who has a trophy wife and plane.Of course, anyone can predict how the whole thing would end, so there is no big surprise. Grisham continues his predictable formula once again. Though not really bad, it's nothing great. At times enlightening, it's mostly made so anyone can quickly breeze through it. As usual, Grisham remains fluid and doesn't get sidetracked or bogged down in annoying or useless details.A decent book, but a somewhat bad one for Grisham."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is by far one of Grishams lesser novels. The Summons sputtered and died at the end and this dog was sputtered and died after the third chapter."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This books was amazing, I was surprised to see that John Grisham has returned to his legal classics. Last year, The Summons was a good book, but when you look at this book, this is a masterpiece.This was riviting, definetely a thriller till the end. Clay intrigued the reader with his antics and his skills. Something different about this book was that we were able to know more about Clay then most of the Grisham's characters. Clay was more personable. Also his wit was clever and the fact that a young'n was able to play with the big hotshots and become The King of Torts, (even though Ms. Warshaw &quot;intervened&quot;), was truly amazing.Great book, better than his past two legal thrillers!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I love Grisham's books mainly because they are interesting and not too deep. I liked this book because it taught me about torts which I previously knew nothing about. Otherwise the story is pretty weak, nothing unpredictable happens, the guy starts at the bottom, gets to the top, then falls to the bottom and becomes &quot;humble&quot;. That's pretty much it. I wouldn't say it was a waste of time reading it but it sure wasn't worth paying for the hardback. Wait for paperback or borrow the book from someone."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you enjoy playing with Monopoly money, like to count clam shells at the sea, are impressed by the beauty and fine worksmanship of a barbie doll, or can find nothing better to do in the evening than read old real estate listings, then this may be the book for you. The hero has a heart of paper, his number two squeeze was xeroxed from a fashion magazine by a machine that lost what soul was left, and not a single interesting place or thought or person occurs anywhere. Money shifts hands, and falls seemingly from the sky. Lawyers lust over big airplanes. Some get rich and drunk and argue. People fly off to an island paradise that might as well have been a sand box at the local playground, for all the attention it sparks. (No, I take that back. My boys found much more fascination in a sand box.)I have enjoyed several of other Grisham's novels, and am surprised at how hollow this one turned out to be. In his other books, he described a small town in the south through the eyes of a seven year old, and I was captivated. He caught some of the charm of a city in northern Italy and could grasp what an alcoholic might feel when he found God. I even enjoyed his grinch-like main characters and the bitter fun of Ditching Christmas. But this one lacks all charm.Perhaps Grisham wants to tell a morality tale about the seductive evil of vanity and riches. Problem is, his hero and heroine are as cardboard as the model he saddles the one with, and the blow-hard developer Dad he trussles the other up with. Who cares what happens to them? And the story ends as flat as it begins. (Then Grisham throws one of his \\"I don't take my research seriously, why should you?\\" postscripts at us, to add insult to injury.)One might I suppose salvage from the wreckage of this novel a bit of pity for the rich, and for the author. As Chesterton observed, life is romantic because we are unable to control it; the rich, having the luxury of forming their worlds, often live in the lap of tedium. This story is terribly predictable. And my dog has more personality than all its characters put together. But for any real enlightenment or even enjoyment, read Christmas Carol instead: that's how to describe the decay of rich fools.author, Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've read about 7 or more Grisham books and this is easily the least satisfying. It is however, the fastest to read.He tries to write a moral tale of lawyerly greed, arrogance, self-indulgence and easy (come, easy go) money playing on the recurring issue of tort reform. But with poorly developed characters and a sleepy, if steady, but sometimes over-the-top narrative I found myself not caring a great deal.It would be a fine read for a beach somewhere warm, with a cool drink at hand when you don't want to tax your brain. The book would also make a steady sand coaster."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I love John Grisham, at least the old John Grisham. THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF were classics. Underdog lawyer trying to do the right thing, terrible greed, and exciting plot twists that kept the pages turning very fast. But The KING OF TORTS was just a story of the underdog lawyer, so to speak, immense greed, but no interesting subplots or twists that kept you going. At page 324, I decided to skip ahead to page 424 to finish it. I found that I missed nothing in those 100 pages that I didn't read that I couldn't figure out by page 427. This book left me very unsatisfied, as did the wwful THE SUMMONS and wondering if John Grisham has just lost his original touch to write a great legal thriller. I hope not."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am a John Grisham reader and fan. Normally I enjoy his novels. I did not particularly like this one. Primarily because the main character, a public defender turned tort lawyer, is greedy, shallow, and ridiculously naive. Unlike other Grisham novels where the hero is trying to fight society's wrongs (or at least the Firm's), this book's plot is about screwing the little people (even ruining an entire small town) to make millions and buy jets. I found the whole concept rather disgusting and the hero got off way too easy in the end."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read every Grisham book written, that I know of, and enjoyed almost every one of them, which is why I was so surprised when I found myself hating this book. I was bored to tears and disgusted with every page. I am used to Grisham books with fascinating plots, intrigue, and deception countered by ingenuity and strength of character. King of Torts was missing everything...The main character is empty. He is supposed to be the protagonist, but he is just a shell bouncing from one person to the next and taking whatever advice they give him, getting himself into more and more trouble with each step. He is even described as smart toward the beginning of the book, but he is not. I wonder that he actually went to law school and passed! How could anyone so obtuse pass law school, not to mention the bar?! And how am I supposed to like someone so unscrupulous?The plot - where is it? I'm still waiting for something to happen and I finished the book two days ago. I found myself racing through the pages as quickly as possible to get to the part where something happens - it never did. There was no build-up, no climax, no resolution. Grisham relied solely on introduction and conflict for the entire book, and it got old very quickly.Most importantly, who is the antogonist in this book? There isn't one, unless you count the protagonist or defer to some intangible such as greed or money. Anytime the protagonist is also the antagonist, you had better have a very complex, intelligent, riveting character as the main character. This book has no such character.If you have read all of the Grisham books, I recommend finding another author this time. If you have not read all of Grisham's books, go back and read one of his other books - you will enjoy it much more than this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter is a young lawyer working for the Office of the Public Defender where the hours are long and the pay is less than generous. He is dating a woman from a rich family that doesn't consider him son-in-law material.Out of the blue, Clay receives an offer that is too good to be true. As a reader we realize this, and one would think that any decent person would see it as well, except if the person's judgement is clouded by greed. This is what this entire novel revolves around.Clay completes a few extremely lucrative settlements, guided by a mysterious source named Max Pace that just happens to have access to secret reports that can help him win his cases.In my opinion, the story drags on a little bit when Grisham describes the various cases his main character is involved in, especially since there doesn't seem to be a common thread between them. There also doesn't seem to be much in terms of a resolution in the story involving Tequila Watson, the case Clay was working on when he sold out for the money."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Characters are flat, unlikable. Not one had any redeeming qualities. The plot makes no sense. There is no plausable explanation for the protagonist's radical change in worldview. Unlike JG's other works, there was no suspense, drama. I kept reading, hoping that eventually it would pick up. After getting about 3/4 of the way through, I found that it never improved."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham's stories can never be described as boring. I began reading King of Torts in the same vein as some of his better novels - speeding through the book, always eager to see what the next page held. The book was indeed enthralling. Sadly, the ending of the book was significantly poor, and really disappointed me. Grisham has been guilty in the past of wrapping up the endings of his books neatly and in an attempt to break from this tradition, he simply has very little ending at all. It almost seems as though Grisham was rushing to meet a deadline over the last 20 pages. The book leaves a lot of loose ends and as I closed King of Torts, I was struck with a feeling of...incompleteness. But, minus the ending, the book is a great read and a classic Grisham lawyer yarn."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book in many ways reminded me of THE GREAT GATSBY. Now of course Grisham is not the writer Fitzgerald is, and the ending is no where near as satisfying as that classic's heartbreaking finale. But Clay is much like Gatsby, a man who does whatever it takes to win the love and respect of his dream girl -- a girl who clearly represents more than she actually is. Gatsby did business with gangsters and bootleggers, Clay goes into mass torts to make his fast buck. Gatsby had Meyer Wolfsheim to show him the ropes, Clay has Patton French. Both men gain their fortunes and lose their souls. And that is a classic American story and when it's told well -- or at least entertainingly, as it is here -- it never gets old. Like many reviewers on this board, I was pretty appalled at the way Tequila Watson is tossed aside here. I hope that Grisham's cynicism is not a real reflection of today's America."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts by John Grisham moves much quicker than his other books. The pace is almost too fast at times, but allows the reader to feel some of the excitement and anxiety that Clay is feeling with his new found fame. This book also opened my eyes to all those commercials I see on tv and hear on the radio concerning damages done by a certain drug or product."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"On the positive side, this was a compelling read - suspenseful, with interesting characters and decent plot development. Sadly, it ultimately disappoints. The main character's journey into greed and arrogance would seem to lead the reader toward something either meaningful, catastrophic, or in-your-face-greed-is-good cynical. Maybe it tries to do all three, but sadly, it succeeds at none. The almost inadvertant climax leads into an unsatisfying, incomplete, unresolved, weak ending with the reader (or at least this reader) feeling, &quot;So, what was the point of this again?&quot; Grisham seems to have been drifting toward this type of unresolved ending, with no clear resolution. &quot;The Summons&quot; ended with a similar lack of resolution, but worked better.With &quot;King&quot;, Grisham just left me wanting. Not more, but something else."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham is not going to win any prizes for literature, but when he tries, he can sure win a prize for page turners. This one was better thought out than most of his recent efforts. He clearly knew how he was going to end it before he started writing which is not always the case with Grisham. While there may be literary flaws in his character development, the book proceeds at a lively and generally logical pace. It also sheds some light on the problems associated with the &quot;class action&quot; mentality in our legal system these days.It is what it is, and it is an excellent read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham past the peak of his writing with the Rainmaker and now continues to publisher a book every March, whether he has written anything worthwhile or not. He has the potential to write great popular fiction, but quite obviously didn't devote much time to character or story line development in this sad effort. Perhaps Mr Grisham should disregard any contractural agreements and leave the story writing until he feels creative. How much longer can his novels wear the title &quot;bestseller&quot; merely based on his old reputation as a great fiction writer."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"A good read and somewhat plausible. A young man seduced by the promise of quick success. He tries to share this success with his friends, but his clients are another story. The ending appears a bit too slick with the message that whatever hurt you've been responsible for, you will not necessarily pay the price that justice requires."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was a little surprised about some of the reviews for this book. It was one of the best I have by Grisham.First of all, if you don't enjoy all of the tedious lawyerly stuff (e.g. motions, strategy, filing briefs, courtroom drama, etc.) you probably won't enjoy any of Grisham's book.This book is a great journey into the world of class action lawsuits. I had literally no idea how they worked. This book is an incredible journey into that world. You will learn about the egos, the incredible money, the risks, the rewards, etc. etc.I found this to be a fairly fast paced enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book was just plain boring. I really liked Grisham's older work, and even more recently The Brethern. But this book was so unexciting. I didn't even look forward to where I left off. I think I'm finished with Grisham."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book was certainly not one of Grisham's best, however it was at least good enough to finish. The plot was extremely predictable. Halfway throught the book the ending could be predicted. A few plot twists would have helped the book along. Ghrisham has written some great books, it's just that isn't one of them."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Like reviewers before me, I was completely disappointed in this book. Thankfully, I found it on the discount table at my local bookstore so I spent very little money on this horrible Grisham tale. Perhaps Grisham is too busy lately to actually put any real effort into crafting a plot line that captures the reader. I will think twice from now on before picking up anything by this author."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Author Bio: John Grisham lives with his wife Renee and their two children Ty and Shea in Virginia and Mississippi. He graduating from law school at Ole Miss in 1981, and practiced law for over 10 years. In 1983, he was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1990. Some of his books include A Time to Kill, The Chamber, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Partner, and The Street Lawyer. Some of his books have been made into films including The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, and The Chamber. His books continue to top best sellers lists around the world.Annotation: As a young lawyer, Clay is employed at a low-paying public defender's position. He is dating a prominent man's daughter, Rebecca, who is constantly offering him high-paying jobs that he repeatedly denies. Rebecca decides she is sick of his low paying job so she leaves him for someone else. Shortly after, Clay has a meeting that will change his life. Soon he is engaged in mass tort lawsuits, which earn him millions. He is pulled into a whirlwind of money, power, and damaging secrets.Evaluation: I became interested in this book because I had seen the movie version of John Grisham's book The Runaway Jury, and I found it to be very original and exciting. The King of Torts dealt with mass tort lawsuits, which I also find very interesting. The plot was very well constructed, and there seemed to be just enough action to keep the reader interested. The different array of characters made it appealing to different types of readers, and it included elements such as romance, deception, greed, and power. There is also a hint of mystery involved, which even added to the quality. At some points in the novel you can't help but feel bad for the young lawyer Clay Carter, and at other times questions his real intentions and morals. He finds himself among some of the top lawyers in the United States, and in turn, would like to acquire the power and wealth they posses. He gets caught up in his newfound money and power, and suddenly must deal with consequences he could have never imagined would happen to him. I would recommend The King of Torts to anyone who is looking for a suspenseful law story with a couple twists and surprises."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"No one confuses John Grisham with Ernest Hemmingway, but he has show a talent for creating well crafted stories in the past. And he continues to do so here, weaving the story of the rise of one lawyer who essentially sells his soul to become the titular king of torts. If you know Grisham, you know what to expect - quick action, simple writing, legalese and a quick resolution. The problem here is that he tries to build up some characters but never delivers on them. Most prominently is the character of the model Ridley, who he gives dubious motives and hints that there is more than meets the eye, but then just drops her out of the story when convenient. A lot of wasted efforts to produce such a throwaway character. Essentially this book, like the others, are perfect airport reads - pick it up, enjoy it for what it is and let it while away the time while you wait."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter is a young, likeable lawyer working in the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) in Washington DC. He is in his early 30's, hopelessly burned out, snubbed by his girlfriend and her society parents, and basically looking for a miracle to drop from the sky. Lo and behold, it does! Max Pace is an enigmatic sort who promises Clay that the mysterious murder case that has just landed on his desk is no coincedence: if Clay will only take the case, representing the defendants against a greedy and unscrupulous pharmaceutical company, soon similar cases will fall his way and untold riches will be his. Farfetched?? Of Course! Remember, the author is John Grisham, king of the Lawyer's Fantasy stories, who takes the most outlandish cases, makes them just barely plausible, and sends the young, ambitious (male) lawyer on the rollercoaster ride of his life through unspeakable danger to love, wealth, and riches in a getaway fantasy land (usually in the Carribean). Anyway, Clay swallows the bait, makes ungodly amounts of money, shortchanges his clients, and dates an exotic beauty. Yes, but soon, all goes tragically wrong as our lawyer, dubbed the King of Torts by the press, soon becomes the King of Shorts, as his enemies and clients alike seek revenge for his excessive greed. Fortunately, our hero has sown some seeds of goodness as well, and two former colleagues return to his life to offer aid and comfort when he needs it most. A return of his former girlfriend is just as inevitable; however, their reunion is as hard to swallow as their breakup in the first place. (Especially since they tossed each other aside so callously to begin with.) However, no matter. All ends well, and the reader once again finds that John Grisham's world, overly cynical though it may be, is worth exploring, and that the King of Torts is yet another worthwile, entertaining read from an author who has made a career of them."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham takes on mass tort litigation in this latest legal thriller. Although &quot;litigation&quot; is part of the term, there was no litigation involved in this book. In fact, the most I've seen is amongst the various reviewers here.Grisham's latest protagonist, Clay Carter, is a lawyer slaving away in the public defender's office. While he lacked the cynicism a position like this should inspire, he is tired and somewhat frustrated. Doing the right thing doesn't seem to be very rewarding when even your fiancee looks at you as though you are letting somebody down with your lack of career aspirations. As his personal life collapses, a career opportunity drops into his lap. He can make a lot of money; all he has to do is throw out a few people nobody cares about anyways and maybe he'll be able to win back the heart of his true love. A couple of lucky breaks, both incredibly illegal, and next thing you know Clay is the &quot;king of torts&quot;--the best at playing a game that only lawyers can win. The plaintiffs are losers, as well as the large corporations that wind up financing the whole mess. I found the inticracies of the tort system to be interesting, although the cases themselves seemed a bit unbelievable. I am not a lawyer, but could easily make some arguments that could defeat Clay's legal maneuvering. But apparently for these companies, it's easier to just fork out some cash than fix the problems you have created. Is this stuff really true? Does this really happen? Probably, but lets hope in a more intelligent manner than in this book.The characters seem a bit stereotypical and as I was reading it, I fully expected some surprises. Maybe one of Clay's fiancee's parents would turn out to not be such a snob. Maybe Clay would ingratiate himself in the mass tort community and cause it's collapse. Perhaps his fiancee would help him see the error of his ways, they would win a huge settlement for some horribly disfigured victims of a poorly tested pharmaceutical, give all their money to charity and devote their lives to providing for the disadvantaged. NOT. Everybody in this book is exactly what they seem to be. Weak, spineless, completely lacking in ethics, any sort of moral compass, and conscience.While the characters become somewhat tiresome, the ins and outs of this legal game are interesting. Grisham has taken on a segment of the legal world usually limited to bad jokes. It's interesting to see what money does to someone who has never had it.Characters: weak, don't fulfill their potential.Plot: interesting, enough to hold your attention until the end.Ending: No surprises, a bit routine.Overall: An interesting, mildly entertaining read, suitable for airport reading, or a long car ride. Won't keep you up at night, but will hold you enough to want to see what's going to happen next.If you like a book with a little tension, read it!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Before I begin, I should admit that I am one of the few readers out there who has not read a Grisham novel and I picked this book on a whim. This is the first book I've read from this genre of the &quot;legal thriller&quot; and I was impressed with the author's storytelling. This was a modern day tale of a guy who was tempted by quick wealth and greed. Inherently the main character, Clay Carter, is a good man at heart, yet he stumbles into the overwhelming temptation that accompanies sudden wealth; fast car, nice house, etc. The book doesn't wait to get your mind going as it hits the ground running from page one.You can identify with Clay in that he was at about mid-career and 31 years old. He was at a transition in his life and lots of changes were happening, personal changes, and a guy shows up to Clay and offers him a chance of a lifetime. The lucrativeness of the mass tort cases blew me away and for me it proved informative. I was also blown away at the sheer hedonism of what people with money will buy to make them feel adequate. Forget the spending that you see movie stars like J-Lo make because that wealth doesn't even come close to what the tort lawyers in this book spent their money on; that whole part of the book was inebriating. It's really a moral tale though and in the end everyone gets what they deserved. The plot seemed &quot;cookie-cutter-like&quot;, a format that would appeal to a large mass market audience, but the narration and the topic of torts was interesting which brought in characters from very different points of view and the author did a good job of bringing attention to the plights of various minor characters who were involved in Clay's cases in one way or another. Frankly, I didn't really expect that many people would actually not like this book. Some of the reviewers here gave average or poor ratings but I think that they were probably offended by the hedonism described in the book and they couldn't take another get rich quick wondergenius and his pompous windbag &quot;friends&quot;.Nevertheless, this book is a good read and good for someone looking for a change of pace in reading a different genre of fiction. You'll come away from this book with a newfound perspective of tort law and how much of an impact it can have in our lives."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is much better than his last few legal thrillers (The Summons, The Bretheren...), but I didn't like it as much as A Painted House, and it's definitely not as good as many of his earlier novels. But, I really enjoyed reading it. The story is fast-paced and interesting. The characters are well written and likeable.This reminded me a little bit of The Rainmaker with the inexperienced newcomer, shady characters, big corporations, and big, big money. The story seemed a little unrealistic, but that may just be because I don't live in the world that it is set in. Also, there were a couple of loose ends in the story that were not resolved to my satisfaction, but nothing so important that it would ruin my overall impression of the book.If you're a Grisham fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The first and last 30 pages were okay. It was the middle 310 that were the problem. It reads as though it has been cranked out like the mass tort settlements Grisham loathes. This book could use some serious editing. It is also cynical, cliched, and predictable. To be sure, this is nothing new. Grisham's books are typically cynical, cliched, predictable, and in need of editing. What is different is that this book inspires little more than long fits of boredom punctuated by short bursts of tedium. Grisham thrillers are usually at least, well, thrilling. Not this one. I admit that because I liked the Summons, I'll buy the next one. But if they come out any faster, the bookstores are going to have to start selling them on the magazine racks."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is the same story that Mr. Grisham has told before with a different cast. A young lawyer sells his soul for money. He rises like a rocket from nowhere to become the &quot;King of Torts&quot;. His subsequent fall is no less than meteoric. The ending is less than satisfying. Wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I AM ALWAYS SURPRISED BY HIS ENDINGS. I COULD READ HIS BOOKS FOREVER.

Had me hooked half way through the first chapter. Kept itup to the very end,"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is the first book I have read from John Grisham. Based on his movies, I figured his books should be must reads. Despite its brevity, Grisham puts together another thought provoking yarn about the legal system and attorneys in general.

King of Torts is just as well written and conceived as the rest and I look forward to actually reading the above mentioned as well as the others in his collection."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"There is no one to empathize with and it reads like a series of events that someone is listing, as opposed to an intriguing plot with characters and interesting happenings. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I love poverty to rich stories. It's always interesting to see how the money was received and spent.

Typical John Grisham, couldn't put it down until I was finished"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"\\"The King of Torts\\" is certainly suspenseful enough to keep you turning the pages to find out what happens next. It is the story of Clay Carter a young but worn out lawyer at the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) in Washington, D.C., who is assigned a case of a young man who commits a murder for no apparent reason. While investigating the case, Clay is approached by a mysterious person, who will pay him 10 million dollars. All he must do is drop his case as defender, open up his own law firm and get the victims of this murder (and a number of other mysterious murders) to settle for 5 million dollars. A drug company is involved and doesn't want it to get out that they have created a bad drug and could be liable for billions. Clay goes from making 30 grand a year, to being a millionaire practically overnight. He then takes a crash course on mass torts and starts raking in the dough from major drug companies. While it's fun to see Clay go from rags to riches, the reader is left with the auspicious feeling that Clay is way in over his head. Clay's world starts to collapse and it will take some major maneuvering to escape jail time. This book certainly educates about tort lawyers as well as entertains."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read and loved Grisham since the release of the Pelican Brief. But I have been increasingly frustrated by the endings of his books. Ever since hitting the big time and signing a publisher's contract it is obvious that Mr. Grisham no longer has the time for the attention to detail that made books like Pelican Brief and Time to Kill such fine literary works. The ending of King of Torts is just one more in a string of Grisham books that start out so well just to end abruptly all wrapped up in a mismatched bow.Picking up on a larger than life character and a theme of class action law suits broached but not fully explored in The Summons, Mr. Grisham creates a bright but unambitous attorney who gets a large and questionably legal tort case served up to him on a silver platter by one drug company looking to kill the stock of a rival company by exposing their drug's lethal side effects. He is pining after his long-time love who has just dumped him for a more ambitious type, has time on his hands, and getting her back in the back of his mind. Looking at the possibility of more money than he thought he'd ever see in a lifetime, Clay Carter takes the case and wins, making millions for himself and the little firm he created just to handle the case. On the journey he meets the \\"infamous\\" Patton French (the same French from The Summons) and gets a taste of the \\"good\\" life of corporate jets, vacation mansions on exclusive islands, and women for the asking. He is at first repulsed. But as the green-eyed monster would have it, Mr. Carter quickly morphs into a freewheeling, big spender chasing the next case, which also was given him by the same shady character using illegal insider trading sources. He throws around millions the way most \\"regular\\" people throw around ones or tens and has everyone including the reader secretly enjoying the romp but screaming at him to slow down and quit throwing it all away. Throughout the story, even at the height of his greed, he remains our somehow loveable but flawed hero. The reader really finds himself pulling for our suddenly rich \\"underdog.\\" Therein lies the suspense - will he crash and burn or pull it out and come out on top?So what of the ending that makes it so unsatisfactory? Throughout the entire whirlwind that becomes Mr. Carter's life he thinks about reuniting with his ex-girlfriend, now someone else's wife. He has two conversations with her in several hundred pages. We get the idea that Grisham wanted us to project that Carter was pining after her, but it just never came through. Carter (and the reader) are far too wrapped up in the suspense and excitement of the million dollar drama to give too much regard to the peripheral ex. So when, in the end, Carter recognizes his greed and his myriad mistakes and she, the one who left him for ambition, is suddenly back in his life, it is both unconvincing and hackneyed. We just don't care about the two of them and their fairy tale ending. Show us the money! Show us an ending that isn't predictable and prosaic. Mr. Grisham, show us an ending that doesn't appear to be an afterthought whipped up to meet a publishing deadline."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"All the books I read from John Grisham, The King of Torts might be one of his best books. The King of Torts thrills the reader so much, that you just can't put it aside. The second you start it you will always wonder what will happen next. The King of Torts starts out with a poor Office of the Public Defender (OPC) lawyer, Clay Carter. Clay Carter always had plans of quitting the OPC office, since all the bad cases would land on there shoulders. Then he gets stuck with a strange murder case. This murder case opens the gates of wealth, and hell at the same time. A strange man contacts Clay Carter, promising some clues on the investigation. Max Pace tells him that more than ten of similar murder cases were due to drugs that healed people from addictive drugs. That's where Clay Carter biggest his journey to becoming the King of Torts. The first case was easily settled, and involved a lot of money. Clay Carter receives his share of the wealth, and is kind of clueless of what to do next. Then Max Pace comes again, and tells him of yet another bigger law suit. After his third successful law suit Clay start to wonder where Max Pace gets all these vital clues from, but it's to involve making more money that he doesn't really realize that Max Pace is doing something illegal. Clay keeps on going until the train stops. Will Clay Carter be able to keep going at this rate without really knowing Max Pace? Read the book and find out, it worth every minute."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've read almost all of Grisham's books and can usually count on them for a good read. This book disappointed me greatly. The main characters, Clay and Rebecca, don't turn out to be very likeable; he's as greedy as all lawyers are made out to be and she's a golddigger. I found myself not caring whether they got back together, and actually hoping he might do some jail time.At the end we find out that greed is good if the cards fall your way, and if they don't, well, you still get the girl, your friends will give you some of their misbegotten fortune, and you can fly off to London and start a new life. Quoting, &quot;He had Rebecca all to himself, and nothing else mattered.&quot; Well how about the thousands of people he screwed over in order to maximize his own wealth... don't they matter?Grisham did a good job of exposing the greed behind mass tort reform, but the story he wrote as a vehicle for his expose left me cold."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was about half way through this book when I realized it was going nowhere. I was expecting something, anything, to happen. The characters were thin and the plot bounced along from case to case. Really glad it's over."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read all of Grisham's works and this is one of the least impressive. The plot was predictable: Down on luck lawyer has woman problems, mystery man gives him the case of a lifetime, lawyer makes tons of money, gets investigated, loses money, gets girl back. I knew the ending around the fourth or fifth chapter. Grisham has to get out of the rut he is in before his loyal fans go away."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"While not too spectacular, it does make for fast reading.

How I wish I could get those hours back!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I happend to like this John Grisham book. Alot of other reveiws said that it did not keep you on your toes. I Thought the characters had multiple levels to them. I just did not like how the book had a sudden change to it. The book did make up an unbeilevable story about the drug that made tequila kill people. The whole rags to riches was kinda hard to believe about clay carter too. Overall I did enjoy wandering what hoop to jump through next."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've read all of John Grisham's books and was severely disappointed with this one. There was no character development, I never could figure out if I liked or even disliked Clay Carter because I didn't know him--or any of the other characters. The book read (or listened, as I did audio) like transcripts--I even found myself re-checking the jacket to make sure this was listed as fiction. There was no conflict until the last of 8 tapes--and I can't say that I cared once it arrived. I had much higher expectations when I got this book, I've really enjoyed all Grisham's other books, even the 'unusual for him', Painted House and Skipping Christmas."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Yes! Finally mr. grisham is back with a juicy book! This book carries the story of a young lawyer faced with ethics, money, romance.

Another sprint-to-the-end novel, a character with &quot;Clay&quot; feet, a boring bimbo, friends who are too good for him. I'm glad I got it from the library. In the last few years, authors who have given me years of enjoyment have apparently tired of their craft, and I wonder why they keep writing. Can it still be the money? Still? With The Summons I thought Grisham was &quot;back,&quot; or at least heading in that direction, but guess not. I feel like a fair-weather fan, but I think I'm entitled."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I love John Grisham's books, but this one is honestly NOT good. At first the story caught my interest, but as the chapters slowly slide into each other and as money and greed come to the main character, educated readers already know what is going to happen. There is usually a twist toward the end of Grisham's books and you can foresee even what that will be. This novel got so boring that I finally skipped to the end of the book (which I have never done with one of Grisham's books before). Sure enough, all my guesses were correct. I am very disappointed."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is the third Grisham book I have read. The first was The Firm and the second was A Time to Kill. I started one other book by Grisham, but put it down for the same reason most people start a book and don't finish it (the one with the old man is in prison on death row). A Time to Kill was my favorite and it was difficult to put down. The Firm was also hard to put aside, and its perfect description of Memphis, TN and Destin, FL was appealing since many southerners know these places well. I felt that I knew every corner Grisham was descirbing. In The King of Torts, the character is easy to follow and so is his message concerning the abuses of Tort law (unfortunately to the point that the end is predictable), but it seems that Grisham isn't nearly as descriptive of DC, Flagstaff, and of the islands that Clay visits as he has was of places in earlier books. I can appreciate all of the places Grisham has described since I have been to most of them, but again the lack of decription did not take me there! I don't know if Grisham's lack of detail to specific places, but rather more of them, is his effort (or his publisher's) to appeal to a greater number of readers, but I long for Grisham's ability to be descriptive ( I don't care if he is describes MoFo, Japan :)) and for him to write with the intensity and unpredictability that he did before he began churning out books. He is one hell of a writer but it seems that numbers have blurred his vision.

You read to the end and you find yourself left way short. So we received a short lesson on mass tort litigation.What happened to all the characters?

It's a great story and the characters are, by and large, well developed and endearing. This one really read like a screenplay. Don't be surprised if we see it soon on the big screen.Sure, Grisham ebbs and flows with the consitency of his books. But, can we expect every effort to be like \\"The Firm\\",\\"The Pelican Brief\\", or \\"The Client\\"? On my personal list, I rank \\"King of Torts\\" in the upper third of his work. It blows away \\"The Chamber\\" and \\"The Partner.\\"I don't suppose I will ever understand people who read Grisham for entertainment and then review the book as if it should have changed their lives. Read \\"King of Torts\\", relax, and enjoy the ride that only Grisham can provide.So maybe we won't put Grisham's work in a time capsule along with \\"The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire\\" or \\"War and Peace\\", but if we include articles reflective of how we entertained ourselves, you better believe JG will be included.There is one consistency you will find in this book that is matched by all JG's other works: You will look forward to the next opportunity to get back to the story.

He became filthy rich, through less than honest means, and embarked on a journey that had a inevitable ending.

Like all Grisham's legal thrillers, the research in class actions and torts is an eye opener for those who are not involved in the legal system.

A man of his intelligence could write this shallow waste of time in a day, and he probably did just that. If a book was ever written simply to profit on the author's name (or what's left of it) this is it. The plot is preachy and predictable, the characters are unremarkable and poorly developed, and the ending is incredibly flat. What's worse; a book written by a lawyer is packed with legal errors, from ethics to procedure. Grisham seems somewhat apologetic in his afterword, and he should be for stamping his name on this thoughtless wonder.

This was my first John Grisham novel, and I thought it was just fine. It appears to be written for about a 5th grade reading level and vocabulary, so it's a quick read, and the plot moves quickly. I guess my major complaint is that Clay is just way too dense. Come on, I could tell from the first meeting that Max Pace was going to be trouble, and that Clay was guilty of insider trading. Clay also moves very quickly from his disdain for the mass-tort bottom feeders and their expensive toys, to becoming another one of them. He's not a very likable guy, so you don't mind the inevitable crash & burn so much when it comes. My advice for Rebecca is stay far away. If he could be this corrupt in his professional life, what kind of husband and father do you think he would really make?There probably was room here for some serious commentary on tort law and class-actions, but there's not much. We get heart-wrenching tales of people being shafted and lives upended by the greedy lawyers, and people being hurt and killed by bad drugs. And in the case of Maxatil, we get an offhand comment that the CEO knows the drug is far more dangerous than anyone realizes, but nobody will ever be held accountable (and nobody will be compensated) for this. If this (fictional) book is to be taken seriously, then the drug companies are really the evil ones. The mass-tort lawyers are greedy and skim too much off the top, but I don't think it's practical for 100,000 people to all file suit separately when they've been hurt by corporate wrongdoing. And I think the cement company was really an anomoly, as a company that would actually make a good-faith effort to fairly compensate customers for monetary damages incurred by buying a faulty product. So showing the devastation wreaked by the lawyers here is kind of like burning the straw man.Despite this all, it's an entertaining, if superficial and easily predictable story."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I loved The Firm, The Partner, and several other books by John Grisham. While I was reading this one I keep having this hard to supress sensation that someone else had written this novel. It's definitely my least favorite Grisham novel and the only one I've read I can't recommend.Either a ghost writer actually penned this or Grisham rushed through it just to get another book out."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Having worked in the D.C. Court System from 1991 to 1995, I suffer the unique perspective of experiencing the workings of the Justice System first hand. One flaw I found in this book was the reference to bail bonds. There are no bail bonds in the District of Columbia. The Pretrial Services Agency supervises all defendants awaiting disposition of their cases. No money, no bail bonds. A small point I know.The rest of the book rings true. Grisham seems to rehash some ideas that made his earlier works successful. Nonetheless, still a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If this novel had not captured my interest from the beginning, I would be giving it a one star. The plot was very interesting, the there was a ton of suspense. I enjoyed the jump that Grisham made from the ghettos of DC to the luxurious life of a mass tort lawyer.However, near the ending, I did not feel as if the novel was complete. Many details were forgotten, and many questions were left unanswered. Its as if Mr. Grisham took his time writing the novel, but near the end got hurried into finishing it. For example, the CEO of one of the evil pharmaceutical companies mentions that there is a dark secret about his drug that no one must know. And a source attempts to contact Clay, but never does. None of these points was answered at all.Overall, I must say that I liked reading the book very much, but was very dissapointed with the ending."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham's The King of Torts focuses on a lawyer named Clay Carter. He's a small time attorney in the public defender's office who is handed an unwinable murder case. A young man has shot someone in cold blood and Clay has to defend him. Just as he is about to get his way out of the case, a man approaches him and gives him the opportunity to make a lot of money by dropping the case, quitting his job with the PD, and opening his own firm. He learns that the young man who he was defending may not have been completely responsible for the murder and a drug company wants things swept under the rug.This starts a chain of events that leads him to the top of the legal profession by doing mass class action suits, settling the cases, raking a third off the top, and paying his clients the pittance they had been promised. He wants more than anything to get back his girlfriend, who dumped him when he had no foreseeable future. Now he has a new life, new woman, new friends, and even his own jet.But things are not all well. He is blind to things happening right in front of his face. I mentioned in my title that this book is like Citizen Kane. The main character in that film, Charles Foster Kane, is only concerned with money and power, and he achieves it at the cost of all human personal relationships. Clay Carter is also power hungry, but in a different way. His wealth is more tenuous and he eventually succumbs to his desires.This book is very well written, interesting, fast paced, and fun. I read it in one evening, without putting it down. The message is a good one and it is something different from Grisham. Not a second of this book is in a courtroom. The legal proceedings take place in the form of settlements. After the many books he has written, Grisham still has the ability to weave interesting stories around great characters. I loved this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This was an enjoyable book. I liked the humor. My favorite scene was the wedding reception. It's not really a thriller; it's a morality play about selling your soul. What I like most about Grisham is that he can write (something a lot of bestselling authors don't seem to know how to do). It's amazing how he can make a topic like torts sound facinating."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you are a Grisham fan, you will not be disappointed. If you question lawyer's ethics and morals, you will not be disappointed. John Grisham takes us for another spin 'round the legal system, and this time you should fasten you seat belt! A quick and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am a huge fan of John Grisham. I have read every single one of his books and to date my favourite has always been A Time to Kill followed by Runaway Jury. However, lately his books are not living up to the same standards he set when he started it all with A Time to Kill. Since The Testament I have been disappointed with his works and frankly have been bored with some of the story lines. The King of Torts, was somewhat enjoyable, but still not as good as I would expect from Grisham. I would still recommend people to read it but don't expect the same quality as his older novels."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was really disappointed after I finished this book. It started like a great read but ended with me asking... Why did I waste money on this book? I was looking for the chase, the thrill like his earlier works but what I got was a dud. Lacking any excitement, you'll be left wondering whether Mr Grisham's star is on its way down."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The story just seemed to go no where. Just about a lawyer who took an underhanded deal to make a lot of money and just kept on doing the same thing when other opportunties came along while missing his girl friend the whole time inspirt of the honey on his arm. Of course he lost all the money, never helped out the little community that he broke the biggest employer in and after getting beat up won the old girlfriend back and headed to the islands with some money his over paid employees gave him. John's run out of good lawyer stories."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I enjoyed this book. Sure it was predictable, but it was entertaining and well written. Grisham is a master story teller and develops his characters well."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Loved this book, as I knew I would. Quick, easy read. I will forever look at the 800 numbers flashing across my screen and wonder what kind of evil tort lawyer is behind it. :)"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham's \\"The King of Torts\\" is a fast paced pop novel.It is what one has come to expect from Mr. Grisham. A young, idealistic lawyer who is tempted and ultimately corrupted by untold riches...followed by a quick attempt at redemption.Clay Carter (the central character) is well developed, as are many of the supporting characters. A couple are somewhat cartoonish. Most are interesting, and a few are very important to moving the plot alongIt is somewhat of a morality tale a/o parable in part. The different paths Clay and the three associates who received the largesse that came with moving from the Public Defender's office to private practice is telling.As with many of his novels, the conclusion is less than fulfilling. However, it is a marvelous ride, and the journey trumps the destination; making for a most entertaining read.It is not deep and ponderous; it is simply good escapist enjoyment."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"By the time you get to the middle of the book your wondering what is the whole point. I eagerly kept reading waiting for it to get better and it never did. &quot;I want my money back&quot;"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham is probably best known for his legal thrillers. And when he wrote A Painted House and Skipping Christmas, some of his legal thrillers' fans thought he was losing his touch. The Summons was a very welcome change, but it didn't seem to be up to the standards of The Client, The Firm, The Pelican Brief or The Runaway Jury. Just when some thought the Grisham boom might finally be over, there rose to the the throne, The King of Torts!What a wonderful book! What a unique aspect of the law! How well written! Grisham's play on words, his ability to describe places in such beautiful detail that you can imagine the location, the scenario, and even feel as if you're part of it, are at their peak. Having lived in DC, I could picture each scene vividly.Who would have thought that a story that begins at the obscure OPD would end up so dramatically?!If you love Grisham, then you'll love this book!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham's latest is less a thriller as advertised but more simply an old-fashioned fable about the allure and dangers of money, luxury and myopic power. Although it started well by involving the novel's protagionist, Clay Carter in a murder case with mysterious circumstances, the novel quickly escalated into a story of the rapid ascent and predictable descent of this character. The book is appealing in describing how tort lawyers manipulate the legal system to achieve ridiculous fees often at the expense of individual clients and defendant companies. Nonetheless, I soon found myself losing interest in the book's storyline and its characters as their fate became increasingly obvious. Moreover, it becomes hard to be sympathetic to Carter as he continues to fall deeper and deeper into the abyss of greed. Rarely, does he exhibit any conscience or intelligence as avarice obscures all reason on his part.All in all, not one of Grisham's best. What happened to books like The Firm, Time To Kill and The Partner?"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"My biggest beef with Grisham's books is that the ending is worthy of a mistrial. He has acquitted himself well with \\"The King of Torts\\". Clay's character doesn't seem the type to do what he did - is this moral ambiguity or an incomplete character?"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is a rather unique Grisham book. At first, it seems like everything is going the protagonist's way. But beneath it all is the palpable sense that Clay's bubble is doomed to burst. It just keeps swelling larger and larger until the reader is almost cringing. How far will he fall? How bad will it get? From which direction will it come? Clay is an everyman upon whom enormous wealth and power is thrust virtually overnight. Suddenly he's the biggest shot in law in Washington D.C. His smiling face is in Time and the New York Times. While Clay enjoys his sudden lucre, what tickles him more is to realize that the nouveau riche parents of his ex-girlfriend (who thought he was a loser in a dead-end job) must be hating his launch into high society.Readers can see that his upswing has to come to an end. They will shudder at the way he bleeds money, wasting it on frivolous things like, oh, a private jet and a house in the tropics for his trophy girlfriend.This is risky stuff for Grisham. Having the main character's story arc suddenly plummet near the end may not be to every reader's liking. But Grisham is writing about truth -- about hubris and pride and being blinded by sudden fame. It's easy to step back and say \\"I wouldn't behave that way,\\" but [millions of] dollars can do strange things to anyone!Watching the crash is sort of like watching a car accident. It's horrible, but you can't look away. This is powerful writing and a refreshing change of pace for Grisham. I enjoyed every moment of it -- though it had my nevers on edge the whole way through."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read several of his books and this one is one of my favorites. I actually listened to it on a long drive and it was perfect for passing the miles."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am reviewing the audiobook version of this book, which I believe is an abridged version of the original.I found the story shallow and predictable, there were no surprises or intrigue like in Grisham's earlier novels. Perhaps he felt like he exposed the world of mass litigation on his book, but I didn't feel I got any insider info.All in all one of the weakest stories from Grisham that I've read thus far."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you like Grisham, you'll enjoy this. Not his best work in terms of drama, but up to par in terms of story-telling and character development. This is a great practical and up-close primer into the world of mass torts and class action law suits."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"AWESOME...his best book to date!! I read some of the negative reviews here (one about the temperature accuracy in Flagstaff- give me a break!) Grisham can always create interesting desriptive characters but sometimes faulters on the plot. In this book he nailed both. I was disapointed with the Brethern and Testament but I couldn't put this book down!!! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I thought this was one of Grisham's best. I read &quot;The Brethren&quot; before this book, but didn't become quite as attached to the characters as I did in this book. Even though Clay was greedy he captured my heart and I couldn't wait to see what happened to him.I thoroughly enjoyed this book for an easy and fun read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King Of Torts by John Grisham is a great novel full of suspense. A man named Clay is the main character. He is a lawyer who doesn't make much money. One day, a man named Max Pace offered him millions of dollars to file law suits against different companies. One was making medicine to relieve artheritis pain but a side affect that the public didnt know about was that it creates tumors in the bladder. Some of them are cancerous and others are not. After Clay's first case was over, he bought himself a new car and house and much more.The King of torts is an awesome book and everyone should read it at least once in their lifetime. So if your searching for a good book, read The King Of Torts by John Grisham."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I listened to this book on CD and although I didn't care for the reader of the book, I did enjoy the story.The King of Torts is about Clay Carters rise to the top of tort lawyering (through some shady dealings) and his fall back to reality. In a matter of a year Clay is able to make 120 million, but at the end of the year, he's back to where he started (counter sued) and much happier with the love of his life."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Interesting insight into tort law and class action suits even though it is fiction. Enjoyed the story, characters were easy to keep up with. Not a page turner for me. Better than the Testament and Runaway Jury. Enjoy Grisham's writing style. I enjoyed The Last Juror more."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"In some of Grisham's latest works, the ending is not a knock-out punch as they could be (such as Last Juror), but he makes up for it by spinning such a fine tale until then. That's often life, right? The conclusion to an event often isn't as compelling as the event itself.This audio book took us from Oklahoma to Nevada to Utah to Colorado and back to Oklahoma last year. It kept the pace of the dry landscape around us (especially western Oklahoma) and the otherwise-tedious hours going and going VERY well.The intro grips us (again, unlike some like Last Juror) and the story that follows unravels itself nicely.You may read reviewers who were disappointed in the ending but we were not. A knock-'em down stunner ending is always welcome but NOT always needed. It's a shame that so many base a book on the lack of such an ending."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham is in classic mode here in this pretty-OK book in which a drudged-out, burned-out lawyer is exposed to the glamorous, high-rolling world of class-action lawsuits. The lead character gets kicked upstairs from lowly public defender into mass litigator, a world that is superficially jet-set appealling but ultimately rife with greed and corruption and all but inescapable (sound familiar)?I'm going to briefly sketch the plot in this paragraph so skip it if you don't want to hear--Clay Carter II of Washington, D.C. meets a mysterious type who gives him the inside dope on how to sue a drug company for surreptitiously testing a new drug inside the USA--completely against FDA rules--and pretty soon he gloms onto the perverse world of mass torts, USA style. The jury system be damned: it all depends on the leverage of data, and who can be blackmailed with it. Almost always neither the drug company wants a jury trial that would expose the corner-cutting and lobbying that puts its &quot;miracle&quot; (and sometimes carcinogenic) new drugs on the market; nor do the litigators who run inflammatory TV spot ads for 1-800 &quot;hotlines&quot; in order to gather lists of those who had been prescribed the drug, so that they can initiate class-action suits of thousands of plaintiffs vs. the drug company. (The lawyers can then take a cut of as much as forty percent of the award, and whether or not the amount of money that trickles down to the actual injured parties is enough doesn't much bother these vultures.)As for the abuse of the tort system in terms of mass class-action suits, Grisham understands and reports the scenario pretty well. My experience with the overall silliness: because I was overcharged for some generic medications, and because my name was pulled off of some databases somewhere, I received two checks as part of mass settlements; the two together totalling less than two dollars. Pennies don't mean justice to me, but pennies times hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs, over and over, keep &quot;superstud&quot; attorneys in Gulfstreams and private islands and $250,000 Presidential dinners.Aside from the current-events factor, though, KING OF TORTS has serious structural and generic flaws. Clay Carter II behaves &quot;Just like a man,&quot; and I mean that literally: he acts just barely like a man, such a stereotype that after he makes the hop into the hyperspace of nine-figure earnings, despite a leavening of guilt he seems little more than a machine capable of work-drink-eat-drink more-work-drink-find something attractive to go to bed with. Though now a generation older, Grisham owes 32-year-old males more in the way of character development.Worse yet is the way Grisham has become proficient in editing out Act III and thus eliminating a true climax from KING OF TORTS. The first and latter halves of this book do a great job of setting inexperienced Clay up for a true legal battle in front of a real jury with a REAL antagonist--a non-drug company that made a simple mistake--no politicking or skulduggery involved. That opportunity was denied when the whole Carter law firm was forced to shut down due to lack of werewithal. Imagine how indignant 1930s audiences would have felt if there had been no last reel of &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;: if Congress had adjourned as Jimmy Stewart was running down the hall to give his marathon filibuster AND his seat was eliminated due to redistricting over the summer! That's a lot like what happened here.I for one do not like it when an author creates a hero and then settles for a &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; ending, and that's what we have in this exposition, both ethically and geographically.."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book sucks, plain and simple. I could use fancier language, but why bother? Grisham didn't bother so I won't either. He admits in his brief author's note at the end of this dreadful novel that he hates doing research and reserves the right to just make stuff up if he can't get the info he wants with a single phone call. He also claims to have rewritten this book \\"four times\\" but if that's the case, why is it so awful? I guess four times just wasn't enough.His main character is just an excuse for him to spend hundreds of pages explaining to each reader how mass torts work and criticizing the lawyers who engage in it. Criticizing greedy lawyers is as obvious as criticizing genocidal dictators, so he gets no points for that. He should have been capable of creating a main character who made us feel something -- ANYTHING! -- and inspired us to root for him to succeed or root against him and want him to fail. I felt nothing for this man even once, in 470 pages. We learn hardly anything about him except that he's extremely stupid and credulous and greedy as hell. It was obvious that he was in for a fall, and obvious when the fall was coming and how it would happen. The female characters are a joke. He has a girlfriend he's supposed to be so in love with, but we see no evidence (ha ha!) of that anywhere. After he makes it big, he dates a mysterious supermodel about whom we discover nothing. Maybe she's bisexual, maybe she isn't. The main character never even asks her, so if he doesn't care and Grisham doesn't even care, why should we? The tidbit exists for no reason.Basically, this entire book feels like an outline that Grisham simply added more words to. The main character gets a mysterious offer from a mysterious man, gets rich overnight, breaks up with this girlfriend, rises, falls, gets the girl back, the end. Sorry if I just spoiled it for you, but if you spend -- excuse me, I mean WASTE -- any time reading this, you will quickly realize that there is no more to the story than this. It's pretty much spoiler-proof, because not much actually happens. I read it expecting to at least be entertained (and, I should add, because I was stuck in a situation where I had nothing else to read). There's zero character development for anyone, from the main character on down. In fact, several characters feel like the same cookie-cutters Grisham used in previous novels but with name changes. The main character's dad is a lawyer with a drinking problem who lost his license and is in every other respect pretty much identical to Lucien Wilbanks inA Time to Kill: A Novel. (Which is, I might add, a book by John Grisham that is actually quite good. He can clearly write if he puts some effort into it. This book often feels like just an excuse to show off how much time John Grisham has spent vacationing in the Caribbean.)Oh, you might notice I keep referring to the main character without ever putting in his name. That's because I've already forgotten what it is. That should sum things up for you."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read most of Grishams novels and I find this one to be the best so far. Not being a lawyer, I found the world of class action torts to be quite a provocative topic. Clay Carter's character was well developed and interesting. His overnight lifestyle explosion created an exciting plotline. Also, Grishams style of portraying a \\"less than admirable\\" person with common, every-man characteristics is done well here and in most of his books."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is a review of the audibook read by Michael BeckGrisham's \\"The King of Torts\\" continues the trend that he started in other books such asThe ChamberandThe Runaway Jury. The book isn't really about the characters or the plot. Instead, it's a easy to swallow education into how the legal system actually works.In \\"The Chamber\\" the reader sees how death penalty cases work in detail. In \\"The Runaway Jury\\" the readers sees how a civil jury trial works in detail - from selection of the court venue to clothing worn by the attornies to jury selection specialists.In \\"The King of Torts\\" we learn all about how the class action lawsuit works. Ever wonder how former presidential candidate John Edwards made his money? This book well give you a good idea. Grisham argues all sides of the class action lawsuit as he tells the story. It can help and hurt the little guy. It can enrich an attorney, but that's not entirely a bad thing since he's put money into telling people about bad products that injured them with no promise of an actual payoff. It can wipe out businesses, but if you've put a bad product out there why shouldn't you be hurt? Then again, wiping out a bad business still puts a lot of people out of work through no fault of their own.Grisham argues all sides and leaves the reader to make up his or her own mind. It was a wonderful education, well-read by Michael Beck who created dozens of voices for his narration. However, the actual story was less than satisfying. The plot seemed to meander around with pointless interludes that did little to advance the plot but did take up lots of time. I gave it 3 stars - 5 for the education, 1 for the plot. It's worth a listen, but only for the education."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I found this book particularly interesting because I work in health care. Health care has spawned the side industry of health-related legal settlements. Class action lawsuits have taken this industry to a whole new level, and this book exposes the mechanisms of this legal area with Grisham's usual attention to detail and to the meticulous unfolding of the story. When thousands of people are physically or emotionally harmed by medications, products,etc. and hundreds of millions of dollars are mobilized, who benefits and why? Luxury jets, palacial homes, yachts, Caribbean getaways, mistresses populate this landscape. The view leaves one nauseous. The book has excitement and suspense and moves swiftly to the end."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After reading John Grisham's book \\"The Firm\\" I have read just about every book written by him and in my opinion \\"King of Torts\\" is right up there at the top. It's a stunning and education portrait of mass tort litigators and what happens to the clients that they are entrusted to represent. Mr. Grisham's writing style captured the true effects of mass tort on the victims. The main character, the young attorney Clay Carter, finds himself in a different world than the standard practice of law, or the standard life style. This is a excellent account of the actual ramifications of such mass litigation. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham presents an interesting case of a long shot win or lose gamble by a lawyer to win monies for plaintiffs who were wronged by a drug company. This story has been done many times by now, but as a fan of this author's, the book is well written and the stories' characters are well developed."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The popular accusation is that Grisham doesn't cut it like he once did a decade or more ago, and while that's probably true, if this was a debut novel by an unknown writer my guess is that it would be hailed as a triumph and great things would be forecast for his future. I thought this was simply a fascinating story very well told, casting an insight into the monumentally litigious world that is Corporate America, Inc. Of course, Grisham is always at his most convincing in and around the courtroom, and in this tale I was happy not to analyse its accuracy or authenticity and instead just enjoy the wild ride.For the record, I think this is one of Grisham's best efforts of recent years, in particular for entertainment value."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts by John Grisham is an average novel by his standards, probably above average by most other authors standards. The protagonist in this book is gets caught up in the world of mass torts against rich companies, primarily pharmaceutical companies. The sad part of this story is how true it rings. The fact that some ambulance chasing attorneys find opportunity when people fall victim to heartless companies is sad and pathetic.A three star read, not a bad pass time for a plane or beach."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts is like most Grisham books, fast-paced, entertaining, and filled with high-powered lawyers, women, shady informants and a sprinkle of violence. The recipe for a great read. However this book has little else with the exception of an obvious moral at the end trying to teach you something about greed. But mostly it's just about lawyers and money.The story is a very exciting and quick read so if you're looking for something to pickup for a few days and to entertain you go with this or any other John Grisham book. If you've read alot of Grisham and are looking for something else this won't provide that. It's the same story just with different details."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The irony of this book is in the moral of the story which is about a how a young and decently moral lawyer becomes overwhelmed by the greed and lifestyle when he is given the oppurtunity to earn what he discovers is easy money within the legal system by becoming a tort lawyer. The irony is I believe these are some of the selfsame demons that Mr. Grisham is wrestling with by cranking out novels like this one. The novel is fairly entertaining but by no means one of his best. I found the novel to be at it's most interesting when his protagonist (Clay Carter) is struggling to make an existence within his life as a public defender. Grisham is at his peak in describing the conflicts and angst that Clay Carter is experiencing on a daily basis and detailing the inner workings of the public defense system in a very intimate manner. The rest of the book seemed predictable and formulaic is describing Clay's rise and fall as a tort lawyer and did not seem to have the heart that the beginning of the book possesses. This one was just an effort to fullfill a contract and falls a little short of Grisham's potential and is nowhere near as good as The Street Lawyer or A Painted House. Not to say it is a bad novel but Grisham is capeable of so much more."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Could this book be any more boring? Okay, possibly there's some mildly interesting information about mass tort litigation in the United States, but that's about it.There was no suspense about what was going to happen in the end. We all knew Clay Carter's greed and profligate spending would bear a hefty price tag at the end. It did. We knew he'd get the girl. He did.I'm a fan of Grisham's earlier works (&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; excepted, of course), but this book comes nowhere close to the level of the others. I kept waiting for something interesting or unexpected to change the course of the story, but it never did."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham is a little like Clay Carter, his protagonist in the King of Torts. He has risen to the top of the legal thriller genre, indeed, he is King, although more recent books have hinted at his possible downfall. Yet Grisham remains at the top of his game with King of Torts. His characterization and plot development is just complex enough to be enjoyed by the masses. (Albeit, there are some slight faults in the plot that a close reader will pick up.) Overall, King of Torts is a predictable but enjoyable (and timely) thriller."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"AN exciting story that will educate you about ... tortlawyers in a way you won't forget.Many people don't understand the word let alone what a King of Torts would be. This is a FIVE STAR education in which you will love JCCarter II, hate him and then like him in the end. Carter never tried a case in court and now never will.As a public defender and as a tort lawyer he settled all cases out of court. By inside info he signed upthousands of people who were hurt by a new drug on the market that had long range ill effects on some of the people taking them. Who was responsible: the drug companies, the FDA and the doctor prescribing the drugs too soon and too eagerly. Who suffered: the patient and the family. Who profited: the drug co. Who made the most money: the tort lawyer by getting awards of $15,000 per claiment while taking as much as 40% per claiment in fees. This effort resulted in his annual income hitting hundreds of million of dollars, some of which was used to pay his overhead expenses. You will follow Grisham's easy flowing story about how Carter rises to the top,falls victim to greed in spite of himself and how he handles his own self and others on the way down. This is one legal story that you can read without getting bogged down in all the legalese that abounds in too many legal-court battles....one you can enjoy for a change."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham's work on Clay Cater's meteoric career and demise was an enjoyable and pleasing reading experience. It is popular fiction and as such can be enjoyed by those who understand what it cannot be. The psychological study of Clay Carter could have been developed more completely but for someone who is a hardworking accounts payable auditor for a government operation the thrill of Max Case's generous offer was a kind of virtue unrecognized but rewarded scenario. I do recommend this work to readers with an interest in health care litigation and the trials of underpaid civil servants in American society."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"When you read this book, you'll understand why oten times lawyers are called crooks.Clay Carter, a 31 year old rookie was interested in bigger things than representing indigent clients in his Office of Public Defense practice. So it happened one day that he got an offer by a friend of his father's, Max Pace, to set up his own practice suing drug companies that have literally destroyed people in some way or other through dangerous drugs.Clay suddenly now finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy to horrible to believe. It is a case against one of the largest phramaceutical companies in the world. He is looking at the kind of settlement that would totally change his life, and would make him, almost overnight, the professions newest king of torts. But making piles and piles of money off of these cases isn't everything. Not after all the trouble it will cause in Clay's life.This book makes you wonder what will happen next."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Were we supposed to LIKE Clay? What about Ridley or Rebecca?Characters came and vanished from the plot like ghosts.The aspects of the story line that were developed (the trial in Arizona or Rebecca's marriage, for example) were predictable and concluded in a paragraph.I should have known better to pick up this book when my 16 year old (a huge early Grisham fan} couldn't get through 3 chapters of this one.Don't waste your money--based on the descriptions of the &quot;high life&quot; in this book--John Grisham doesn't need it."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Just like when you go to the cinema to see the latest Vin Diesel movie, &quot;The King of Torts&quot; delivers a fast moving, action packed plot that has little or no depth.As in all Grisham novels of the last few years, this one is extremely formulaic and based on the premise that he will sell millions of copies no matter what he puts out. I understand that it is extremely difficult to come up new and intriguing stories, but at least he made an attempt in &quot;A Painted House.&quot; In this book, he resorts back to the formula that served him so well for so long. Unfortunately, it has become tired and self serving.If you are looking for a good legal thriller read something from Turow. Grisham has truly gone commercial. He has become to legal fiction what Jordan is to fantasy, Clancy is to espionage and Cornwell is to crime stories. . .the Rain Maker :)"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you didn't dislike litigators before, you certainly will after reading John Grisham's latest book. Greed and the misuse of power are rampant throughout the story. The main character is Clay Carter, a young attorney who works for the Office of the Public Defender in Washington. He is discouraged by his low pay and lack of advancement, and is burned out because of the hopeless people that he defends. His girlfriend, Rebecca, and her overbearing parents are growing weary of his seeming lack of initiative and they begin to feel that he is not a good marriage prospect. When Clay rebuffs Rebecca's father's efforts to find him a higher-paying job, she decides to break off the relationship. At about this time, Clay is tempted to become a litigator and he is presented with a golden opportunity to make a lot of money. Clay goes for it, and begins a downward moral spiral where his disregard for his clients is only exceeded by his greed and pride. Although the original premise of a drug which causes people to kill is a bit hokey, the story is one of Grisham's usual page-turners and should please those that enjoy his courtroom dramas."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"When this book arrived in the mail from the Book of the Month Club, I realized I had forgotten to decline the offer, but, as I have an aversion returning things, I kept it, even though my stack of waiting-to-be-read books is rather high and has some likelier candidates. As it turned out, I was glad I did. Suffering a headache from non-fiction burnout, I picked up \\"The King of Torts\\" and, by the end of page one, knew I would not put it down until I finished it. Authors write and readers read for myriad reasons; when the reasons match up the result is satisfaction. Such it was with Mr. Grisham and me: I wanted something interesting and entertaining to read and that is what he wrote.Not that \\"The King of Torts\\" is all fluff. Grisham dissects the world of tort law and examines it from all angles, adding some flesh and blood to the lawyers that everyone -- including other lawyers -- loves to hate. Along the way, he pays literary homage to sources as diverse as Goethe (Faust), medieval morality plays, and William Dean Howells (\\"The Rise and Fall of Silas Lapham\\"). Within the first few chapters, J. Clay Carter, II (the Faust character):- ends a four-year relationship with the love of his life (whose parents are absolutely insufferable),- leaves his job as a public defender,- opens an extravagantly expensive law office complete with ever-expanding staff, and- moves income brackets from $30 thousand a year to more than $100 million.The impetus for most of this change (excepting the break-up) is a vaporous Mephistopheles who goes by the name of Max Pace (if Mr. Grisham is an opera-lover that name is probably a sly homage to \\"Der Freischuetz\\"). Pace goes by as many names as Mephistopheles, and, like that character is a mercurial presence who eventually disappears altogether, leaving the reader (and Clay) to wonder if he really existed at all.Once in the big-time of tort law, Clay does not handle his newly found wealth any better than do some of his clients and he seems to be a fish out of water in the presence of the other big tort lawyers. Eventually, he finds redemption, though, since he never really completely looses his soul (only a little common sense and a lot of money), the relief is not as palpable as if he had truly faced off with the devil and survived.Considering the critics and readers who readily criticize Grisham for writing, \\"just to make money\\" (as opposed to changing the world?), Clay may, in fact, be Grisham's surrogate. Both paid their dues before joining the big leagues and both endure their share of media criticism. Grisham knows how to pace a novel and develop believable characters and often uses a few well-crafted phrases to insert his literary dagger, my favorite example being his description of Rebecca's mother's plastic surgery &iexcl;V truly wicked fun, and right on the mark. (The self-righteous and pompous head of the rehab center was a close second.)No, this is not \\"War and Peace\\" (or pretend to be) nor did it have the same emotional appeal for me that \\"Painted House\\" did, but, as I wrote at the onset, I was looking for interest and entertainment, and that is what Grisham had to offer: a good match."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter had worked at the Office of the Public Defender for too long. His uptown girlfriend, Rebecca, wanted to stop working, get married, buy a large home, and have children. Her parents keep sticking their rich noses into the situation also. Of course, this made the situation worse, especially when her daddy gets Clay a high paying job (thinking Clay would never be able to get a better one on his own) and expected Clay to snatch it up. But Clay refused to be beholden to her family or under their thumb, even if it meant losing Rebecca.Things changed when Max Pace entered the picture. Max became Clay's source to getting several cases against pharmaceutical companies. Clay's settlements would change his life. Then he stumbled upon a conspiracy too horrible to believe!**** While reading this book I kept being reminded of John Grisham's last novel. I now believe it was foreshadowing this book. There is nothing shocking to the reader here or any unexpected twists. Any reader with a lick of sense will easily be able to predict what is going to happen in the main character's near and distant future. However, the story is still pure joy to read and written in a way that only John Grisham can do. Recommended reading! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As I began to read the King of Torts, I was under the impression that Clay Carter of the Public Defenders Office was going to sue a drug company and make billions. I thought this would be just like the Rainmaker or the Street Lawyer with Grisham taking on evil, corporate America.Clay Carter does get this chance and he makes a quick fortune through dubious methods and then takes on a case that could make him millions of dollars. At this point, the King of Torts switches gears and becomes something totally unexpected and also pretty boring and dissappointing.Clay Carter started out as an underdog with a chance to change his life. But then Clay turns into the person we all hate, the evil tort lawyer. Grisham shows his obvious distaste for the evil greed of the bigtime tort lawyers, and that redeems this book in some fashion. Yet the story it is trying to tell takes on more of a biographical tone of Clay Carters life. There are no twists or turns or good guys or bad guys. Things just happen to Clay Carter, good and bad, and we are along for the ride.I didn't totally hate this book because its message is against tort lawyers and their greed, but the King of Torts is a big disappointment. There is no depth to the characters. All characters are just an accessory to Clay's life from the bimbo girlfriend to the jilted fiance to the other lawyers who work with him.Grisham has definitely been in a slump lately, with the Painted House being his best work. Grisham is still obviously a great writer, I just hope he soon decides to write a thriller type novel instead of a biography of a greedy tort lawyer."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I probably should have given it 4 stars. The book was a quick enjoyable read. The main charachter Clay is someone you root for. I just thought he could have put a better ending especially because Grisham set up and ending that would have been awesome , but he didn't go that root. But how can i rip on a book that took me 2 days to read and didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"\\"The King of Torts\\" by John Grisham reminded me a lot of \\"The Firm\\". No one can write a sleazy lawyer better than Grisham. I haven't liked his more recent books as well as the first ones, and this one is more like the old Grisham. \\"A Time to Kill\\" is still my favorite, though. That's Grisham at his best."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I enjoyed reading this book although I was hoping for something more. As an aspiring lawyer, I was hoping for a captivating insight into tort law and the life of a mass media ambulance chaser. However, I found this installment of Grisham's legal series to be a lot like watching reality tv (All entertainment, no substance). The story had all the drama and romance a popular novel enthuiast could ask for and I found the story line to be a page turner. I would recommend this book for the person who likes a good drama and cares little about the legal field."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It held my attention through 75% of the book and then I got lost in the boring end. I really like Grisham as a writer and always expect a lot. He's always good and this started great but I did not like the latter part of the story. I'll continue to read more Grisham books but this was not one of his better works."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Matthews is an attorney laboring in the halls of public defender when an unbelievable offers falls into his lap. Max Hayes arrives on the scene and convinces Clay to leave behind his meager career and move into swank offices and become the hotshot in the legal world. The money scenarios he throws at Clay areunbelievable and the case he is giving him I have read before in a novel. What makes this novel work is Grisham can take a yarn and spin into a masterpiece. Before Clay can catch his breath he is raking in millions of dollars and has more cases for civil action that he can imagine. His colleagues who traveled thispath with him are starting to get preoccupied with the money and don't see the bridges burning underneath them. In the end Clay gets what he really wanted when he took the first case. Grisham last two novels were lackluster in my opinion and wrote for the big screen. In this novel he wrote with passion and didn't let the lure of Hollywood force his characters into stereotype situations and the ending wasn't abrupt. SinceI read this book in 24 hr. I must rate it a 10 which it greatly earned in my opinion."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Same plot, different names. Lawyer gets suckered into shady dealings, after many problems complicated by his own character flaws, sees the light and tries to redeem himself. I just wish that the main character could, for once, do some jail time for his misdeeds and not end up on a jet to some foreign paradise with a faithful lover and a couple of mil stashed in a Swiss bank. I did enoy reading about the machinations of class action suits. This book is a good way to spend a few hours on a plane, if one doesn't mind stereotypes."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After having read some of the other reviews I would have to agree that John Grisham has not put much effort in his last few books. I felt that in The King of Torts he floundered with his character development. I also felt he never completely developed the story.I also had a hard time with the story because it hit a little too close to home for me. I am also taking an arthritis drug of the newer generation and am concerned about potential side effects in the future. My only hope is that I don't end up with as shallow a lawyer as was portrayed in the book if I should!All in all though, I would have to say that if John Grisham put out a book tomorrow I would be one of the first ones in line to buy it!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I picked up this book because the title was so nifty and I found that it was a page-turner. I am so impressed with John Grisham's story-telling. This one was one of his best!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book is right in line with all of John Grisham's stories. I thought that it was wonderful and certainly up to the standards that I expected from him."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As a past fan, I looked forward to reading the latest from Grisham. Alas he is no doubt under contract to produce a new title every so often and this one was written with an eye toward little other than fulfilling his obligation to his publisher. All the worse for his readers! The mental machinations of the main character defied explanation and the plot was obvious from the get-go. One spent the first half of the book hoping for an unexpected &quot;gotcha&quot; and the last half dreading what had by then become the inevitable predictable outcome."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book has 72 pages left to get good. My wife gave me this book for Valentine's day, and I'm laboring to finish it. I have all of JG's books since the very beginning because I'm a fellow Mississippian. I even have an autographed copy of &quot;The Client.&quot; &quot;The King of Torts&quot; - no mystery, no redeeming qualities in characters, no intrigue - the most boring book I've read in years. Why do I keep buying his books? In the hopes that I'll be pleasantly surprised which hasn't happened in years (with the lone exception being &quot;A Painted House&quot;)!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've been a big fan of Grisham's since The Firm, but had lost interest with his last couple of books. This was going to be my last crack at him and I was pleasantly surprised. The King of Torts was a fast, easy read that kept me captivated.If you're not a big fan of lawyers, this book will definitely fuel the fires! I found myself ticked off at lawyers in general by the end because of the extravagant lifestyle portrayed in this book and the lack of concern for clients by some of the characters. It was a great fantasy, however, that most of us have dreamed of at some time - almost like winning the lottery. If you're in the right place at the right time, money will seem to rain out of the sky and your financial problems will be over. Unfortunately, that part is not believable by any stretch of the imagination. On the other hand, this story provides a fabulous insight into the tort system and clearly depicts why tort reforms are so desparately needed.This book is definitely worth the read - especially if you're looking for an escape for a while. It's got wonderful entertainment value, but I would rate it low on the \\"thriller\\" scale."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"We sympathize with him...we cheer for him...and we watch the money and success corrupt him at the expense of the innocent. Its a good read, a terrific object lesson from Grisham on tort action and reform...and how power can corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.But if you've read the rest of Grisham's work, you know how this will end...somewhere in the Carribean."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Really a good read. I really enojyed the explanation of how torts worked. I know about them but not in as much detail as given in the book. This one rates in the top 5 of my favorite Grisham books."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is the sixth novel that I am reading of John Grisham.As usual 'The King Of Torts' also disappointed me with its poor ending.I wonder whether the author is trying to fill in the pages.I liked the theme as a whole.The first 100-150 pages is really interesting leaving some suspense the readers expect in the pages to come.But there Grisham failed to keep the pace.After reading it I never felt satisfied.The picturisation of the Hero is not good.Except for some dialogues the author fails to touch the heart.The reader can never get the feeling that 'CLAY' is a hero.For I got the feeling that 'Fast Cash' is the hero in this novel.And the ever lasting theme of Man's Greed-if that was the theme the author tries to tell -then I feel that is not handled properly.I could never get the feeling that the story has a moral.It lacks pace and suspense-and not touching too.The author fills the pages with more than 100 characters but not even a single character influence the reader.The only dialogue I liked is that of Jarret-'Money is not everything'.And the same I tell about this book-This book is not worth the money the reader spends and above all the time too he spends on these pages.I was expecting 'The King OF Torts' to be 'partner' to the author's 'The Partner'-but it can never be.Hoping more in his next book.But I have only good words about the research Grisham should have made in writing this book.That is splendid."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I enjoyed this book by Grisham very much.A young lawyer discovers the money to be made from 'class-action' law suits.The story charts the rise and fall of the hero as he firstly becomes immensely wealthy on the back of some inside information, and then discovers the perils that can follow in its wake.A classic tale of greed corrupting."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It has a nice start. An interesting case presents itself to a young lawyer. However, you continue to read and you feel as if there is about to be an interesting plot twist. The only surprise is that it never comes. There is also little if any development of the main character, which there was certainly room for. The book can be read in a minimum anount of time and was at least partially enjoyable during the flight in which I read it. I would wait for the paperback or borrow it. It is not worth the price of the hardcover."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was disappointed in this book since I thought that it was going to be one of his great legal thrillers with some sort of twist at the end. This book started out really well but halfway through it became entirely predictable. It's like Grisham started the book in his usual style and then got bored and took off for a holiday and let someone else finish it for him. Maybe he should take a much longer holiday!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I expected this book to make many more turns than it did. It was hard to get into, and then when I did, I waited and I waited and I waited.....no meat......then waited for a great ending and was disappointed by the &quot;settled for&quot; ending.....John...give us the real you."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"&quot;...but lose his soul?&quot;This is the central conflict in John Grisham's THE KING OF TORTS. Clay Carter is a young criminal defense attorney working for peanuts in Washington DC's Office of the Public Defender. He is approached by a shadowy figure whose scheme could make Clay rich beyond his wildest dreams. The scheme works and soon the shadowy figure has more, increasingly riskier lawsuits promising even bigger payouts. Clay Carter rakes in millions of &quot;easy&quot; dollars and is dubbed by the legal community &quot;The King of Torts&quot;.The fame, money, and influence are not without their dark sides. Clay, naive as he is, initially believes he won't get roped into the trappings of private jets and private islands. He couldn't be more wrong.While not spectacularly written, this novel is a decent exploration of human nature when it's confronted with the Goose and her Golden Eggs. It's hard not to grab all you can get, even if you have good intentions. Clay Carter's character takes on his first class-action suit with noble intentions of righting corporate wrongs, then transforms into a mass-litigator without regard for consequenses, either personally or for the greater good of his clients or defendants. Understandably, he's blinded by huge money. He makes his fortune in less than a year, and when the millions are his, Clay is further blinded by the narcissism of the extremely wealthy.John Grisham crafted Clay in such a way that you can't help but cheer for him (because he was once one of &quot;us&quot;) and hope he gets his comeuppance at the same time (because now he's one of &quot;them&quot;). Though Clay puts on his ethical blinders, he never completely kills his conscience. When Grisham pulls back the curtain to the inner-workings of a high-powered attorney's mind, one can see why they do what they do, yet loathe their chosen path. One can empathise with Clay's actions, and at the same time despise him for actually going through with them.While it's probably too quiet a book to make the leap to the silver screen, THE KING OF TORTS is a quick and easy read with some keen insights and fun wit. More than once I chuckled out loud at Grisham's observations of human relations and behavior. I'd recommend THE KING OF TORTS to Grisham fans as well as those few not yet familiar with some form of his work."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"We all hear about ambulance chasers but this is written in an eye-opening way and exposes Insurance fraud. Many a lawyer will be quaking in his 'proverbial boots' after reading this one. Grisham lays it out in black and white and does it with finess and in his own style. One of his best works."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I used to love Grisham. His novels were fun, fast-paced and exciting. Maybe my literary tastes have changed, but \\"King of Torts\\" was disappointing. If you want a light read, this may be the ticket for you, but I'm tired of the predictable formula.Grisham gets brownie points for research perhaps, but I thought there were BIG plot holes and credibility problems in this book. I've read almost all that Grisham has written and just get the feeling that his writing is getting watered down as he's \\"compelled\\" to keep cranking out the books. Yes, we've finally gotten out of the South, but really, this is a pretty flat read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I think I am through with John Grisham. His earlier books were exciting and featured some actual character development. His later books are completely formulaic, predictable and shallow. Perhaps this is because he is turning out books at a rapid-fire pace.To accept this book, you have to get past the initial actions of the protagonist, Clay Carter. Carter is a burnt-out public defender assigned to represent Tequila Watson, a 20-year-old recovering addict without a history of violence, in a murder trial. The murder is perplexing; Watson shied away from any confrontation and seemed to have no motive. Enter Max Pace: a \\"fire fighter\\" for a major pharmaceutical company, who explains that Watson has been taking Tarvan, a prescription drug rushed into the marketplace prior to the completion of a thorough study of its side effects. In a small percentage of its users, it causes sudden, unprovoked violent outbursts. Pace offers Clay millions of dollars to drop Tequila as a client, start his own firm, and represent the victims of the Tarvan killers in a quick and low-profile settlement.And so Clay does! He drops his client, keeps the scandal of Tarvan silent, and leaves Tequila to be sentenced to a life term in prison without ever mentioning Tarvan! From there, he enters the mass tort game, suing huge companies in class-action suits, angling for the biggest settlement possible--not for the good of the class-action clients, but for the greedy lawyers' benefit.How are we supposed to like this character whatsoever? He wrestles with the moral obligations to Tequila for about half a second before dumping him, and we are supposed to think that he has any scruples? His character, and the characters of his girlfriends and associates, are completely undeveloped and superficial.I give this book 2 stars because Grisham's take on the world of mass-tort law was interesting. I have no idea if it is accurate. I am a lawyer, and I bristle somewhat with the notion of portraying personal injury lawyers as greedy. Generally, the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies are greedy--not the attorney suing these companies who is actually working in his clients' best interests.I think Grisham writing a book about greed like this is particularly interesting. I wondered the whole time what he was getting paid to write this shallow book, if he has a private jet and a Porsche. He definitely worked harder when he wrote books like A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, and The Pelican Brief, and the results were a hundred times better."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"We read it because it is Grisham...like a skipping stone. Nothing was developed. It skipped through plot and informed us that possibly our math wasn't as good as it should be. It skipped through characters...Like they were are in the shade waiting for something to happen.In fact, many characters left the book after making their money only to return to save the day and the main character. Yuck, skip it or maybe borrow but do not buy!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"About a 31-year-old lawyer. Act 1: poor, ill-paid, but honest, still with \\"ideals\\" (fading, however, and with a lot of inner grunting about it) about his profession. Act 2: greed, easy money (lots of it), lavish spending it. Act 3: punishment (bankruptcy) and repentment, with the added but undesired bonus of an inflicted bilateral leg fracture and brain concussion (it does have a cathartic value). This is a re-hash, concerning the legal profession, of what A.J. Cronin gave us in 1937, with \\"The Citadel\\" about the medical one (be it known that I AM a doctor of medicine...), the only differences are in what money can buy in 2,000 a.D. and what it could buy in the '30's. However, Mr Grisham's description, with his inside knowledge, of the lawyers' arrogance, invasiveness, deviousness, greed and corruptness and being just hot-air balloons is always delectable and is worth the price of the book. Buy it to enjoy this description, it's the book's only redeeming feature and it justifies its still too-high price. Better to wait for the paperback edition, however. Mr Grisham had us used to much better stuff coming from his pen."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Question: What is six Lawyers bound and gagged at the bottom of a lake?Answer: A good start.I'm not a proponent of hanging all lawyers from the nearest tree, there are some decent hard working ones, but I personally would like to see a few in hell.When it comes to the law, I can't seem to get over the hump. I'm like the guy walking around with his personal rain cloud 12 inches above his head.It doesn't matter which side of an issue I'm on, or how strong my case is, I seem to be on the wrong side. No matter how bullet proof my case seems to be the law twists it around and makes it weak. And of course my attorney, whom I thought to be a brilliant, eloquent tactician turns out to be Elmer Fudd in disguise. Beware of people that get injured while setting a fire to your house, they will get a lawyer or two and sue.Now John Grisham on the otherhand, is a winner when it comes to the law. He writes about about unsavory unethical members of the legal profession and makes millions doing it. Good for him. He's strayed a couple times but his best work is legal thrillers, and don't you get the feeling that it's a labor of love. That he despises the profession as much as we do and gets his jollies exposing unscrupulous characters. Oh sure it's fiction but can you doubt the truth is far away.The King of Torts like many of Grisham's novels is a story with a moral, no make that two morals. Moral one is that easy money leads to greed which leads to unscrupulous behavior, which then leads to a win at all costs mentality. Moral two I'm saving for later. Our protagonist, J Clay Carter, scoffed at the silliness of the wanton spending and bravado of the mass tort lawyers at a mass tort convention one week and two weeks later was coveting their possessions and several months later buying one expensive toy after another.This novel starts out slowly with our quasi-hero J Clay Carter, who is a Washington DC public defender, getting corraled into taking murder case of a young black male, Tequila Watson who inexplicably shot another y.b.m for no apparent reason.J. Clay Carter has been a P.D. for five years and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. This annoys the lovely Rebbecca, Clay's girlfriend of four years and her gruesome parents to no end.At one time Clay's star shone very bright as his father was a prominent DC litigator and the plan was for Clay to join him. That plan fell through when the father was about to be indicted for some offense and made a deal with an assistant Attorney General to give up the practice and leave the country. This obviously narrowed Clay's options so he become a low paid P.D.Back to Tequila Watson. As Clay looked into Tequila's case, it didn't make much sense because Tequila only had a passing acquaintance with the victim, didn't have a history of violence and he himself didn't know why he shot the victim.Tequila was on a two hour pass from an inner city drug rehab lockdown joint when the incident happened so he went their for the records and gets stonewalled. In the meantime Clay's romance hits the rocks and they break up.The next day at 5:30 in the morning Clay gets a call from a Max Pace, with an offer of a lucrative job but when he gets there Max has a different agenda. It seems he is a fireman, as in damage control, for a large drug conglomeration. It seems that this drug company was surreptitiously testing a new drug called Tarvan, which killed any addiction. Unfortunately it made killers out of five percent of the addicts.Max Pace proposed that Clay quit the Public Defenders office, take a couple of their more talented employees with him and open up his own office whereupon he was to enlist the families of these senseless random murders as clients and pay them each five million dollars for their releases.Clay was to receive the gross figure of fifteen million.When this is complete, the mysterious Max sets Clay up for another windfall, a mammoth class action suit against another drug company. Clay jumps in and is soon joined by every major ambulance chaser in the country in a mega suit. Don't you just love it, the egomaniac sleazy lawyers in a battle to the death against the equally distasteful legal drug monopolies.As time progresses Clay's company needs to grows to accommodate the massive lawsuit, which means that they need more suits to cover the spiraling expenses. Of course Clay's accountant is worried but Clay constantly reminds him that \\"if you want to make it, you got to spend it\\".If you don't want to know the ending, stop right hereWell Clay goes on to be recognized as a rising superstar lawyer while Rebecca gets married and Clay brings a gorgeous model, Ridley, to the wedding reception and then takes up with her. but things are just not right. Clay misses Rebecca terribly and the lawfirm has grown to fast and pretty soon the house of cards is falling apart.At Max's urging Clay takes on giant manufacturer Goffman(sounds like Johnson and Johnson), which turns out to be Clay's first big mistake. They're a tough nut to crack and the beginning of the end for Clay's law firmIn the end Clay gets his girl back and like the protagonists in his other novels, gives up law and rides off into the sunset, which is kind of what the author John Grisham has done.Oh, and moral number two is, \\"Money isn't everything\\", although the author is fabulously rich."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The Grisham formula has become too predictable. This book follows the familiar lawyer is tempted by something too good to be true, rises to fame and falls to failure within the pages. The characters aren't very endearing and the ending is weak. This book can be a &quot;beach book&quot; since it doesn't require a lot of concentration or involvement to read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham is loosing interest in his writing; it shows in his skill and recent style of writing. This book goes down with his other bomb, \\"The Brethren!\\" I have fourteen of his books resting in my book-case and I just don't feel that his desire is writing legal suspense stories any longer. The first half of The King Of Torts is a page-turner as he develops the characters. I read it quickly while on the plane from Los Angeles to Lima Peru. A trip I made by the way because of an interest in South America that was stirred up by his earlier book, \\"The Testament.\\" The next half of the book was very preachy like reading an editorial from the Sunday newspaper. There was no excitement. I was sitting poolside in Palm Springs, soaking sun and enjoying the people watching much more than The King Of Torts. Although, it was a good conversation starter when other Grisham fans came over to me to discuss if I like his new book. I finished the last few chapters while serving my civic duty sitting waiting to be picked for a panel on Jury duty. I don't know what was worse, just sitting there bored, or reading the ending to this book. If you like legal thrillers don't look to this book this year. Pick up \\"First Degree\\" by David Rosenfelt. Here is a fresh new author who will have you tearing through the pages not believing your eyes as the suspense of the story \\"FIRST DEGREE\\" unfolds."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is more a moral fable than a thriller... Easy to read, you finish it very fast but not 'cause of the fast pace but because the plot is very very easy. In fact the book has three episodes very similar one to the other: once you've read the first one, the other ones are variations on the same topic, making the terrain ready for the big and very predictable crash of the main character since the tenth page. At the end, you don't have the sensation of having pass through a great and creative plot, but a soft ride in some park: just above plain boring, enough to be finished and take another novel without a second thought about this one. \\"The firm\\" or \\"The client\\" or \\"The jury\\" are very far away now."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I put off reading The King Of Torts for a long time due to the many average-to-below average reader reviews posted on Amazon. I'm glad, however, that I finally decided to read it, as it is the best book Grisham has written in a long time. The King Of Torts is about morality (or lack thereof) and greed. Without going into detail, the plot involves a lawyer who decides to give up his job as a lawyer in the Office of the Public Defender after being given the chance to handle a major mass tort case against a pharmaceutical company. He goes on to become the King Of Torts, as well as fabulously wealthy and extremely greedy in a very short time. A lot of information is learned about tort lawyers and their relentless pursuit of major corporations at the slightest whiff of impropriety. Grisham's hero, Clay Carter, can also be considered the villain in this very interesting and exciting thriller. I think what led to many of the negative reviews of Grisham's latest book is not that it is boring or poorly written or unexciting, but more to the contempt he creates about the main character due to the extent of his of greed and immorality. As such, unlike in most thrillers, the reader doesn't have a &quot;good guy&quot; to route for. Further, deep down I think many of the readers crticize the book because of the very good job Grisham does in getting the reader to route for the villain. The King Of Torts is the best book I've read by Grisham in years and, having been steadily dissapointed in many of his more recent, am once again a &quot;big fan&quot; and anxiously awaiting his new book due out in a few weeks, called The Last Juror."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Mr. Grisham, something has gone wrong in the writing of this book called The King Of Torts. I know you have what it takes to create a great book because you have in the past. It seems when really good writers get to the big time they start relying on their name alone and fail to remember it still takes good writing to hold on to your fans. I'm a fan of your past books and know you still can produce great books to read. We know how the legal system works with it's fat attorneys and their greed for the all mighty dollar. We also know how the attorneys are wrecking American with all the lawsuits. Mr. Grisham write a book on how America is changing because of the greed of the lawyers and their lawsuits for the greed of the green. If you are a Grisham fan you will probably like reading this book too, but don't be surprised with just a little bit of the feeling of a let down by the author. Remember the name of the author does not always mean the book is good. Larry Hobson-Author-&quot;The Day Of The Rose&quot;"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read a few of John Grisham's books, but certainly not all of them. Nevertheless, I consider this book to be his best work by far. It took me only a few days to get through the entire text.John Grisham does a great job in showing what big money can do to people's souls and how moral standards can change overnight with a little (in this case a LOT) cash on the side.I have to admit that my review is biased because I love the law, courtroom action, and anything having to do with legal procedures - as long as it's exciting. My girlfriend bought me this book for Christmas and although I hadn't read a book for a while, this one hit the spot.Entertaining, exciting, and lively is how I'd sum it up."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is the first Grisham book I have read. It started slow. Around page 80 the story got interesting and remained that way to the end, although nothing was gripping. As a lawyer, I liked the basic story line. However, if this book is typical of Grisham's writing, then in my view his success is in his ability to spin an good story line, not in his actual fiction &quot;writing&quot; ability, which seems to be quite mediocre."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've been disillusioned with John Grisham for quite some time now. His latest books have just not measured up to the earlier ones, which feature thrilling plots and characters that you care about.This isn't one of those earlier books.Frankly, the minute that Clay Carter \\"sold his soul\\" for 15 million dollars (in the first few chapters of the book), I could predict the plot and the character development in two seconds. And I was pretty dead on.The rest of the book is a dreary bore; attempting to give the reader a lesson in ethics, integrity, and doing the right thing. The problem is that Grisham is using Clay Carter, who has just taken 15 million for participating in a massive cover up with a big-wig pharmacutical company. With that small problem stuck in my mind, it was totally impossible for me to note or care when Clay suddenly decides to make it all better or do the right thing. Which was basically how I felt about all of the characters, from Clay's shallow, materialistic ex-fiance (real love-give me a break) to Clay's boring, narcissistic father.Take it from me: skip this one, go back and read \\"A Time to Kill\\", \\"The Firm\\", or \\"The Rainmaker\\". It will be time better spent."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts starts out with a compelling story about a lawyer who is determined to be his own man, but quickly falls into a predictable tale of compromising your ethics to make a fast buck. The last 200 or so pages predictably depict the rise and fall of a greedy personal injury lawyer on a mass scale. I kept reading waiting for the twist that Grisham often puts in his novels, but was left wanting in the end. I really enjoyed his earlier works, including the non-legal ones, and hope that Grisham once again takes a chance in his writing with twists and turns to keep the reader interested."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've read many Grisham novels and this is by far the poorest entry. It was so predictable and flat that if it had been any other author I would have put it down before finishing. If this had been a first novel, I would never read another. This may have been my last Grisham."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King Of Torts is somewhat different from John Grisham's standard lawyer books. Rather then tracing the struggles of a hopeless hero, this book follows a richly successful lawyer through a series of successes only to find out that success can be difficult to manage. John Grisham's best talent is for creating heros you really like and he has done so here. I would easily recommend this book to any one."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"How many stories has Grisham written now in which the protagonist is lured by, and corrupted by, huge sums of money? I've lost count. But people keep buying the books. I can only conclude that readers like to fantasize about being in such a situation -- coming into possession of millions and millions of dollars, saying goodbye to job and humdrum life and living -- at least for a while -- like Patton French on his 200-foot yacht or his Gulfstream V, downing shrimp and steak and vintage wines etc. Speaking of which -- Patton French AGAIN? Is Grisham going to keep bringing him into his novels, or maybe even center the next story around him?"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Along with Britt Gillette's CONQUEST OF PARADISE, this is my favorite book of the year. The title of this one from Grisham is quite unusual as compared to his other books and the story is also quite unusual. In THE KING OF TORTS, Grisham shows what happens behind the scenes and beautifully writes about the meteoric rise of a lawyer from nothing to a star and his equally fast downfall. Compelling and enjoyable and a good departure from his last so-so novel, THE SUMMONS. Grisham is back! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Not usually one to disappoint, Mr. Grisham has captured his audience once again by giving his readers a glimpse into the lawyer's world of mass tort/litigation. In this tale he creates the engaging Clay Carter, a young lawyer who spends his days toiling away for pennies in the Public Defender's office, defending the poor and downtrodden. By night he romances the lovely Rebecca, his girlfriend of many years who works as a congressional aide but secretly longs for the career of her mother (shopping and charity luncheons). The truth is, Clay does not measure up to the expectations of Rebecca's very rich family...and eventually Clay's apparent lack of desire to better his career and as a result his finances proves fatal to their relationship.Then, out of nowhere Clay is approached by a stranger to discusspossible litigation involving a pharmaceutical giant--and a bad drug. Hence, he is introduced to the world of mass torts, greedy lawyers, personal jets and more money than he'd ever dreamed...True Grisham fans will find this to be a real page-turner, as Clay learns that nothing comes without a price.............DYB"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If one has to believe the King of Torts exists, that has to happen in the USA although surely there are more modest versions in another countries, as in USA reside the biggest enterprises and laboratories susceptible of demands. Innovations in industry, pharmacy etc are good but have a dark side if the results are not enough tested. But furthermore, as this novel shows there appears a parasite phenomenon: the pressure groups of lawyers specialized in demands with or without reason against these companies. At first to plead against a factory of defective product can seem good, but when one abuse of this method, all that ends in a useless, vicious practice because the affected people theoretically defended by advocates as the King of Torts suffer innumerable worries while at last they follow in falling sick or simply doesn't get so much money as thougth, because the big percentages of incomes go invariably to the hands of these attorneys who wins millions of dollars paradoxically without raise any quarrel. Furthermore, all this procedure elevates the price of medicines and other products for common people. This book teaches much about all this. Clay Carter, the protagonist, is at first is an official advocate of criminals without resources and earns a very low salary. He's in a crucial moment of his life because his bride, that he loves, belongs to a rich but insufferable family. She abandons him. Under this condition, an hazard in defending the case of Tequila, a young but non violent thief without future induced to kill by a defective drug get him in knowing to Patton French, a mature and well experienced King of Torts. Clay is a wise man and soon understands the mechanics behind all that, winning astonishing amounts of money, luxury cars and ever airplanes, but not all the enterprises demanded are guilty of bad practices, and some as the Hanna company, builders of houses, simply are victims of bad times or low sales. This novel has a dubitable moral end."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Just finished reading the book in question. Better than his last few titles (Testament, Summons, Brethren) but realy, not a big deal. Your life won't be changed if you read it.Grisham's heroes are always incredibly passive: things HAPPEN to them, and they don't actively fight for their survival or the things they want. Case in point: boy loves girl, boy loses girl, boy makes a 100 million USD (again almost by chance and by the machinations of others), then girl decides to come back into boy's life.You'll know the formula for his protagonists' character arc by now. Also, a lot of the description in his books are of the &quot;tell, don't show&quot; format, which can be dull, and reading it can be like reading an affidavit (albeit a well-written, concise one). Which is what one wants while waiting for the plane, or lying by the pool."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Just finished reading this captivating and thrilling book. The author brilliantly exposes the mysterious world of mass tort lawyers and big drug manufacurers. Twisting plot with a lot of romance, lust, greed and real world finale."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Having taken a massive sabbatical from reading Grisham, &quot;The Bleachers&quot; doesn't amount too much for me, I enjoyed returning to Grisham's stellar performance in Torts. Rather than bore you on with rehashing what everyone else loved about the book, and yes it was absolutely as wonderful as they say, I'd like to just air my one disgruntle without giving anything away. Grisham develops such an intrict and complex plot lines. Sometimes it can get quite perplexing keeping up with all the irons in the fire. I practically forgot about Pace, I didn't know if this was Grisham's intnet. But then something happens that just practically closes the whole book!!! Grisham wraps up what feels like 5 or 6 storylines in a couple of paragraphs. I'm not sure he intended for this or he was just realizing the book was getting a little too long (only about 50 pgs remain after the &quot;incident&quot;). I feel that the Grisham didn't do the ending true justice. I was left feeling somewhat mixed rather than having true closure. But it is an excellent read, I'm glad I chose it to return to reading Grisham. Thanks."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"A public defender is given the chance to settle a class action lawsuit before it gets known publically. He then is given the documentation for another case against a major drug manufacturer. He wins and ends up enormously rich, but then greed takes over. He goes for a third case, but ends up burning through money at an incredible rate. Meanwhile, the FBI and SEC are looking into his background, and he's facing malpractice from the second case when it turns out the drug was even worse than expected (and the settlement is peanuts). A good look at greed and what it can do to you."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is John Grishams best book in a long time. It is not his typical legal thriller. But rather a light and free flowing story of someone who literally stumbles into millions in mass tort settlements. It teaches a good lesson."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I had great hopes through the first 2/3 of the book - but couldn't believe or excuse the wrap! I love to read, so it's not often that I want to send a book back and ask for a complete refund but the King of Torts isn't even worth the paperback price let alone the hardcover I purchased.John Grisham abandoned the book mid-way through.The King of Torts is a King of Disappointments. This book is one I would never recommend."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After making young inexperienced lawyers the heros of his novels in the past, Grisham finally sticks it to greedy, blood-sucking trial lawyers. He does a great job of exposing the fraud that goes on in the mass tort field today. Although a work of fiction, there is a lot of truth to many of the points he makes including the fact that there really is an organized group of trial lawyers who meet to discuss who to bring down next. These people are what gives the profession such a bad reputation. I think a lot of these \\"mass tort\\" lawyers ought to be investigated for insider trading and unethical legal practices. They are ruining corporations and costing us all money. And no, I'm not a CEO or anything; just your average citizen that sees what's going on out there in our ever-increasing litigious society."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After \\"The Chamber\\", you can separate John Grisham's annual legal thrillers into two categories:A) Rich lawyers who stumble upon millions of dollars, andB) Poor lawyers who stumble upon millions of dollars.The amount of millions in each novel may vary -- $50 million in \\"The Rainmaker\\" spiralling all the way up to $106 milion in \\"The King of Torts\\" -- but the common thread is that fortune is illusory. Another point is that, up through \\"The Chamber\\", Grisham's protagonists usually got happy endings -- he left a good portion of Southeastern lawyers swanning about the Caribbean -- but since then, most of his lawyers wind up with nothing.Working within this narrow formula, \\"The King of Torts\\" is probably Grisham's most interesting legal thriller since \\"The Street Lawyer\\". Clay Carter, a 31 year-old criminal defense attorney, spends the first 75 pages of the book toiling in anonymity in Washington D.C., and these pages are well done. No sooner has Clay spurned a lucrative job offer and been dumped by his (very attractive) girlfriend than does a mysterious windfall appear, brought by a shady figure called \\"Max Pace\\". For a while, Clay becomes uber-rich, running scam after scam for Pace and his unseen cronies. But the pursuit of money inevitably leads to mayhem and intrigue in these books, so you know all the warning signs even before Clay's new world collapses around him (shortly after page 300 in the paperback, if you want to skip ahead to his downfall).If you like the formula, you'll like this book better than most. Clay's mistakes are more egregious than those of previous Grisham characters, and his fate is the dimmest of all. This gives \\"The King of Torts\\" a little more unpredictability.The most (or least) interesting twist to \\"The King of Torts\\" is returning character Patton French, who had a pointless extended cameo in \\"The Summons\\". Here, French and his ilk (mass tort lawyers thriving off the federal class-actions system) take center stage. Their scenes are played for comedy: gigantic private jets, luxurious yachts, beautiful women, enornmous amounts of money, etc. A few lawyers are given depth, but you have to buy into the notion that the one-dimensional super-rich actually exist, before you can enjoy their scenes. In the end, Grisham is not so much decrying their system, as he is the way they practice law: that is to say, without ever setting foot in the courtroom.Come to think of it, it's now been years since Grisham wrote a novel that took place in the courtroom. Maybe it's time he moved away from the piles of money, so he can get back to reality himself."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"...while I really enjoy John Grisham's legal thrillers, they all have the same formula. Good guy gets into a bad situation, learns his lesson in life, and some how gets himself out of it. This story follows the formula - Clay is a lawyer with the OPD defending the criminals. He likes his job, has a long-time girl friend who wants him to take on another job that pays more but he refuses and they break up. After the break-up, Clay is contacted by a mysterious man who has an 'offer to good to be true' and Clay decides to take the offer (similar to the Firm and other Grisham books). In the beginning Clay is overwhelmed by his good fortune - however begins to realize the greed and guilt associated with this new lifestyle is too much to handle.I am still compelled to read Grisham's books - and truly enjoy reading them, BUT they are getting almost too familar. If this is your first Grisham book - you will really enjoy it. Grisham is a great writer and story teller - he just needs a new story to tell."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I think that Grisham needs to take some time off and get back to what made his earlier books so good: an interesting and believable main character and a storyline that holds the reader's attention. I found myself skimming after the first chapter; once the main character set up his office and started spending money, the book was over for me. From there on out, is was a list of the stuff he bought, with a little tort action thrown in. Seems like Grisham has gone the way of the last few Cornwell books -- let's just crank them out to make money."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham continues to bring me back for each new story, yet not blow me away when they come. This one was a good solid read, which I admit I looked forward to getting back into each night, yet when complete I wasn't totally impressed. While I still encourage Grisham lovers to invest in this new story, I long for the day that he truly comes back and hits us between the eyes..."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"King of Torts does not rise to the level of a well thought out and written story line that has made John Grisham one of my favorite authors. I was disappointed in the lack of depth of intrigue and planning that his other novels are so superbly centered around. I think he needs to go back to the word processor and give his fans a novel worthy of John Grisham."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I never bought a Grisham book. Would always check them out at the library. And I really like his writings and always look forward to them coming out each year. This time I purchased the hardback, and I was really dissapointed that I spent all that money."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After reading the negative reviews, allow me to simply state my option of this book and allow you, the next reader, to discover the reasons I hold this belief.&quot;The King of Torts&quot; is the best novel written by Grisham since &quot;The Firm&quot;."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have found this book rather boring - not quite like the other books by Grisham"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Like most \\"legal thrillers,\\" this story was not very believable or plausible but it is exciting nonetheless. The protagonist, who yearns for fame and money, desires to leave his dead end job at the public defender's office and hits the \\"legal\\" lotto, so to speak. A story in which the author tells how we can fall so far and so fast when greed gets the better of us."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book started off really well, and I was preparing for a wonderful story. I was dissapointed. The story drags, and you tend to get really tired of it. If you have no interest in law, then you may find this book boring. The story is very predictable, and comes off as just a moral lesson. Clay Carter who starts off as the good and humble guy, gets greedy. He pays a huge price for his greed. and then gets back with the love of his life at the end. Not one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was really impressed by Grisham's King of Torts. I have liked almost all of Grisham's books, The Summons probably being my least favorite, but I thought Grisham really rebounded well here and wrote a great book.As for all the negative reviews you see on this site, why are there people who have read all of Grisham's books, but hate all of them? Something doesn't make sense to me there. Boo you!As for me, I have enjoyed a number of Grisham's later books, The Brethren and the Street Lawyer I thought were awesome, and you can put The King of Torts on that list.Look, there may be parts of this book that are a little stretched or unrealistic, but the pages fly like an eagle in this one. It's a great story with a character you really care about. I could see myself being Clay Carter.A lot of people won't like the ending to the book, but it's one you sleep on and agree with I think. I loved the King of Torts, and I look forward to reading the Juror. No, Grisham may not be William Faulkner, or take his works to an emotional or artistic high. But he's a darn good writer, and one of the best storytellers we've got.In the King of Torts, Grisham delivers."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Maybe it's me but I don't find these later books as riveting as the early ones. I just finished the Summons which disappointed me and before that King of Torts. While I am enthralled by the mega-billions that changed hands in this book, I mean the sheer greed was enough to keep me interested but the end sucked. I can't believe I suffered through that for nothing."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I'm not gonna read into what other people say about this book because I like to have my own opinion without any influences. This book was greatly written by one of my favorite authors John Grisham. I think the best characteristic of the book is that it could actually happen in real life, it't not a fiction. Clay Carter is an understated lawyer barely making money. A random mysterious person named Max Pace gives him all sorts of clues and evidence of a bad drug and wants Clay to sue the company because it is hurting the company that Max works for. Clay gets a thousand or so clients and recieves huge settlements or torts. His clients, however get nothing. Max suplplies him with a new way to get mass torts. Clay received 10 million from the last one so he agreed. He opened his own law firm and bought expsensive cars. Another lawyer comes out of the blue and sues him for taking settlements from his client's. This book is one of my favorite's if not my favorite. The author puts you in the story and puts you in Clay's mind as if you were making the decisions and you are looking at the consequences. I recommend this book for anyone who is into thrillers. I was pinned to my bed reading this book, I found time in every day to read this book and it wasn't even a reading assignment."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read several of John Grisham's novels over the years, beginning with The Client and A Time to Kill, and including The Chamber and The Rainmaker. I thought i had tired of that kind of reading and stayed away for several years, only to be drawn to The King of Torts, which I picked up at a used book store. I was eager to read Grisham again, and happy to begin. This book however was a huge disappointment and I may have to stay away for a longer time now. The central character falls into the Tort system by sheer luck (?), and immediately makes huge gobs of money that even he has trouble spending. I wont go into details of the book, as there is no need to. The end is not in keeping with how it should have been for him, tho, because as the villian in this book and also the sympathetic lawyer who has been screwed and beat up, he really pays no price for what grief he has caused. He gets away with the girl (of course),as well as a good portion of the money and no lasting repercussions to my mind. The characters are poorly described and have little dimension, and I therefore didn't feel close to anyone or relate to anyone or sympathize with anyone, except maybe the patients... I think that to truly enjoy a novel you should at least identify with one character, if not more.. You should at least relate to someone somewhere. John Grisham needs to explore the human side of the lawyer and the victims and the legal eagles just a little deeper and then maybe these convoluted plots will make more sense."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've never read Grisham before and, as someone who spends most of his waking hours as a trial lawyer, I should have better things to do. I found Grisham not to be a particularly good writer and his plot quite predictable. And yet I thoroughly enjoyed the book, at least hearing it on tape. Maybe much of it was the wonderfully rich and varied voice of the reader. Max Pace sounded so evil and enticing as the disbarred lawyer--ruthlessly working behind the scenes to save his corporate clients from their competitors and from their own, sometimes deadly, products. Carter Clay quickly succumbs to Pace's machinations, abandoning his client and the Public Defenders Office, to become a mass tort lawyer, collecting millions of dollars in contingent fees without ever stepping inside a courtroom. One first feels the exhilaration with which Clay gets and spends his ill-gotten gains. Then one experiences an even greater satisfaction when it all gets taken away. In the process, there is insight into a certain segment of the bar, and why tort reform has become so appealing."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book allows John Grisham to showcase the ugly aspects of the world of mass torts. Here Clay an aspiring young lawyer goes from ruins as a public defender to riches and back to ruins in a matter of pages. Clay's quest for happiness will keep you entertained as he tries out supermodels, houses, planes, yachts and other material goods. While the emotions and characters are realistic the outcome is sadly predictable. For Grisham fans this is a must read despite it not being even close to his best work."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"What with all the clamoring and law-changing going on with tort laws in this country. This solid piece of Grisham writing is a painless way to learn about the greed and mechanics of class-action lawsuits, especially for those of us who received some worthless coupon. The big payoffs are for the lawyers. We follow a hard working lawyer seduced by the dark side of greed and money (where have we seen this before). Although Grisham's excellent writing and fast developing plots suck you into the story so that it flies by. Besides the main character, Clay Carter, whose motivations in abandoning the Office of the Public Defender for the lucrative lure of grabbing 30% of the settlement of a massive class action lawsuit are explored. The rest of the characters are 2 dimensional props to be moved around and interact with Clay. The relationship with his girlfriends are as stunted as the lawbooks he studied in school. Nevertheless, the highly entertaining storyline is able to partially make up this deficit. Paying the price of the hardback is not worth it, but the paperback is."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you're looking for a good page-turner I'd recommend this book. I found the lead character likeable, and his ride to riches, fun and exciting. The story whooshed along like a cool movie you can't take your eyes off. (I kept seeing Charlie Sheen as Carter). I wish Grisham gave this book a little more substance and suspense towards the end so I could give it more than 3 stars, but it still was a good read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is definetely not one of Grishams best novels. But it wasnt as bad as I have been reading on here. People are murdering this book but I on the other hand didnt think that it was that horrible.grisham does a great job, as usual, at grabbing your attention at the beginning of the book to keep you reading. Once I got through the first chapter I had to keep reading to see what happened next. Grisham did a good job with his story telling, but it wasnt his best story. I recommend this book to anyone who is into Grisham or any type of book that deals with the law. A good read if you have a lot of time on your hands.People quit killing this book.... its not that bad..... Good for Grisham fans."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I had always heard about John Grisham, America's bestseller for however many years I've never really figured out. However, after I tried to read \\"The Firm\\" I had gotten through the first ten or twelve pages and gave up.\\"The King of Torts\\" I had stumbled into in a friend's dormitory, and read the first few sentences out of curiousity. Then the first few paragraphs. Then the first few pages. After that I knew I wouldn't calm down until he'd lent it to me.One thing for sure, Grisham usually knows how to start off a book right. As opposed to a number of other authors, his start always classifies in some way what the whole book would be like, how it would be written, in what style. Even though he doesn't use too many descriptive words, he never seems to lack a fair introduction and good character development. And even though he didn't go too deep into the main character's subconscience, I could easily relate to most of his feelings.I also admired Grisham's way of describing the main character's child-like obsession with the model from Georgia. Me being born just miles away from the character's hypothetical birthplace, I could almost relate to a lot of the woman's emotions and personality traits. Therefore, however he did it, Grisham truly did a good job at doing his homework and getting in depth with his \\"Georgian\\" side. I never at all doubted from her descriptions that she really is from the former Soviet Union.For the plot itself, it certainly only scrubs the surface of the characters' minds; but I never got the feeling that it wasn't enough. I guess I just wished for more romantic scenes, since everything else John Grisham had pretty much mastered to the bone :):)."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Young lawyer lucks out, gets rich, gets greedy, learns lesson. You can see it coming a mile away. Hardly to the standard I expected from this author."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"JG's latest is a good one for a vacation. It's fast and fun and you'll find yourself drawn back to the book.It was the first JG book out of the last several that rminded me of his ealier novels. An underdog lawyer goes from rags to riches but the money isn't as green as it initially appears, al la Mitch McDeer. JG brings us back to the Caribbean, but not as convincingly as he did in The Firm and not with a character as likeable as Mitch McDeer.But this is still a fun one and I definitely recommend it, especialy for a beach read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As I began to read the King of Torts, I was under the impression that Clay Carter of the Public Defenders Office was going to sue a drug company and make billions. I thought this would be just like the Rainmaker or the Street Lawyer with Grisham taking on evil, corporate America.Clay Carter does get this chance and he makes a quick fortune through dubious methods and then takes on a case that could make him millions of dollars. At this point, the King of Torts switches gears and becomes something totally unexpected and also pretty boring and dissappointing.Clay Carter started out as an underdog with a chance to change his life. But then Clay turns into the person we all hate, the evil tort lawyer. Grisham shows his obvious distaste for the evil greed of the bigtime tort lawyers, and that redeems this book in some fashion. Yet the story it is trying to tell takes on more of a biographical tone of Clay Carters life. There are no twists or turns or good guys or bad guys. Things just happen to Clay Carter, good and bad, and we are along for the ride.I didn't totally hate this book because its message is against tort lawyers and their greed, but the King of Torts is a big disappointment. There is no depth to the characters. All characters are just an accessory to Clay's life from the bimbo girlfriend to the jilted fiance to the other lawyers who work with him.Grisham has definitely been in a slump lately, with the Painted House being his best work. Grisham is still obviously a great writer, I just hope he soon decides to write a thriller type novel instead of a biography of a greedy tort lawyer."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book is a pleasant read, better than Grisham's recent offerings but lacking the depth and substance of his earlier works. The theme \\"greed is bad\\" is simplistic and the plot moves straight ahead with no subplots to add interest. Clay Carter as a main character failed to win my empathy simply because he was so weak. Greed sucked him up as easily as a lint ball under a vacuum cleaner with no protest or moral battle on his part. And his girlfriends were almost cartoonish, especially Ridley, who seemed nothing more than an adolescent male fantasy of pumped [breasts], perfect body, and a constant desire to get naked. Rebecca was almost as bad in her own way, with little redeeming qualities to recommend her. Further, her motive for the eventual and sudden springing loose from the tight parental paws was never explained. Another detraction was the ludicrous names Grisham chose for the supporting characters. Patton French? Zach Battle? Tequila Watson? He must have pulled them out of the phone book after a bad night's sleep. I also found the repetition of pet phrases tiresome. By the middle of the book, I felt if I read \\"I'm listening\\" or \\"serious money\\" one more time, I was going to rip out the pages. Nevertheless the book had enough interest to keep me reading and offered a glimpse into a life most of us will never experience. Grisham's style is always easy to read and at least he doesn't find it necessary, as so many authors do, to descend into sordid sex and foul language as an excuse for poor plotting. However, Grisham can do better. Maybe he's not up to it anymore. The pressure to be brilliant repeatedly must be overwhelming. Since he's still a favorite author despite his flaws, I'll give him four stars. Anybody else would get three."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Being a fellow Mississippian, I am a fan of Grisholm's and actually like the real life portrayal of the law industry that Grishom always gives his readers. If nothing else, this book makes you think about the real life issues of tort and of all the reasons you hear about industry, pharmaceutical companies,and businesses yelling for tort reform. Tort Reform has been a HOT issue in Mississippi during the past couple of legislative sessions. With this and John Grishom's imaginative way with words, I think this one is a best seller and a great one for a movie!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am an avid reader of John Grisham. Several of his books do an excellent job building characters, plot, background, and provide a good descriptions of the time and place the story takes place. The \\"Painted House\\" and \\"A Time to Kill\\" are examples of such books. Unfortunately, this one is another \\"Cookie Cutter\\" book by John Grisham. He has the template for a great book. It glosses over places where details would make the book more intriguing. This book with 150 more pages of plot and character development and developement would have made it an outstanding read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books, and I'm generally a big fan. This one, however, had few redeeming features. The lead character was weak, and not very likable. The plot was contrived and full of holes. The romance was tepid at best. It felt like Grisham had an ax to grind against class action suits and the lawyers who file them. He got so caught up in this that he never got around to character development or telling a good story. Save your money."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am so glad to know that Grisham still has it after reading this book because the Testament, the Brethren and the Summons were horrible. Especially the Summons...I was so disappointed after I read that one. I've always been a Grisham fan so The King of Torts was refreshing. I COULDN\\"T PUT IT DOWN!!! That has not happened to me with a Grisham in a long time.

In a twist, however, our hero, Clay Carter, grabs at the brass ring and jumps into the sleazy world of mass tort litigation. His ethics are questionable, his motive is greed, and his rationality vanishes. He spends money like mad, selling out his clients in the process.You don't like the guy for most of the book, a point that is driven home by Grisham time and time again. I won't give away the ending here, but I'm glad Grisham didn't turn things around all rosy and happy - that would not have been realistic.The book is a quick and easy read. I enjoyed it more than I have more of Grisham's recent efforts. It's not as good as his early works (Time to a Kill and The Firm) so I can't give it five stars. Four will have to do."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was fast moving and really made you think about how lawyers can operate.

That sobered me up..."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The first half of this book is a well-written page-turner. The second half is a wrap up job that bangs you over the head with a lesson on greed. For the reader well versed in picking up subtle clues, the last half of the book will annoy the tar out of you.I read the entire book only because the first half was so good. I kept thinking it would get better, but it never did. Still a good read if you're a Grisham fan, just borrow it from the library or wait for paperback."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"We listened to this book on tape during a very long drive across the country. That is the good part. It was better than random FM or AM stations. I was very disappointed in the lack of conclusion. It was as though his time was up and he quit writing. Morality tale? The main character ... had a few million flowing around him .... Not like he was a pauper or back to OPD. Characters were dropped off and not resolved. Story lines were abandoned. Sure this is a wonderful morality tale. Don't fall for the Grisham hype again."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Now that John Grisham has established himself as a leading author of legal thrillers, just about anybody will pick up his books, regardless of how good or bad they may be. His publishers may even be pushing him to finish a book a year. The result, however, are books written very rapidly, or at least they appear to be. This is not my favorite Grisham book by far. But it is not a bad book either. And regardless of how fast his books continue to come out, I will still read them. Why? Because I have read enough great Grisham books in the past that I have the hope that his next book will be his best. In other words, I still believe that Grisham's shallow, rapidly-constructed stories of the past several years can return to be the great legal thrillers of a decade ago. And it is this that keeps me reading his books."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The Summons - burned out lawyer has immense wealth dumped on him unexpectedly, indulges his greedy desires, goes one step too far and loses the money, and is now a better man for having gone through it (oh, and he bought himself an airplane).The King of Torts - burned out lawyer has immense wealth dumped on him unexpectedly, indluges his greedy desires, goes one step too far and loses the money, and is now a better man for having gone through it (oh, and he bought himself an airplane).It seems that Grisham called up his manuscript for The Summons, made a few changes to the plot (how the lawyer acquires the money, the setting, etc.), performed a &quot;Find and Replace&quot; with the names of the characters, and voilla, a new book for 2003.I enjoyed The Summons a great deal, and thought Grisham was back to his old form after some disappointing efforts. I read The Summons a second time, but didn't realize it until I was almost all the way through it because it was cleverly disguised as &quot;The King of Torts.&quot;This would have been a good and enjoyable read if it weren't a retread."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Among his most recent disappointments King of Torts is quite reasonable but in no way near the quality of books which John Grisham has written in the distant past. The start of the book is good but the end is abrupt. I suspected halfway in the book that what if the hero gets beaten up badly buy a grieved client and the book ends. And exactly that happened. I wonder what has happen to this talented and used to be entertaining writer. I am glad that I did not pay for this book, got it as a gift."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Not only is the plot stupid (a shady character tips a lawyer off who proceeds to roll the dice and hopes his mega-suits settle) but the main character completely violates the main rule of fiction - he is so greedy and evil that you hope he goes down in flames. By virtue of the fact that he's the main character, and therefore ought to be sympathetic, his final come-uppance is deeply flawed. He doesn't pay for his crimes and his redeeming vlues are so meager you can't help but feel that the time spent reading this has been wholly wasted. It's time to send Grisham to Iraq."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Medicines that have some nasty side-effects are put on the market and lawyers, like ambulance chasers, file class action suits to make a killing on other people's misery. This book personalizes this scenario to make it real for the reader. I'm not sure what negative reviewers were expecting as this is pretty much like other Grisham novels. It's a topical story about the legal profession. Not great writing, but a good story well told."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Unless you want to learn about mass tort law, skip this book. It's boring. The main character isn't even likeable! A great disappointment and waste of money."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Like many of Grisham's recent works, this one disappointed mightly. The first 3/4 of the work was interesting although many questions were left unanswered. The ending is where I really felt disappointed and betrayed. It's as though he's writing to a certain page count and suddenly realized he only has a few pages left and so abruptly cuts to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed his earlier books which were well developed all the way through but his more recent efforts have displayed a tendency to just throw out some ending to meet either a page count limit or a publisher's deadline. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Use the copy from your local library if you want to read it. One can only hope that this once interesting author will put more effort into his future efforts."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I read this one when it came out, and in comparison to Grishams others this one falls behind.

I'm now heading for the The Chamber..."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Not up to Grisham's best abilities. This was a bare bones romance with a noticable lack of the colorful charactors and scenes that I usually enjoy with his stories. Whatever happened to Max Pace? Seems that Grisham simply rushed through this book and was saving on adjectives and adverbs. I feel like he stopped 'painting a colorful picture' after The Painted House."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This has to be the worst Grisham book yet. He must have to pay for a new pool or something. Painted House was a real novel, with interesting characters and plot.

Its quickly get repetetive.Designed for airport gift shops."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Mr. Grisham clearly has an agenda and a message he wants to convery with this book. Which is okay, because the story is still interesting and he doesn't beat the reader over the head (too much) with his clear dislike of mass tort litigation and the attorneys who handle those cases. I really enjoy reading Mr. Grisham's books. For the most part - particularly the earlier books - they were mostly legally accurate, but still interesting (which CANNOT be said for the movies made from the books). I'd like to see him return to the courtroom in his next book, where he really is at his best, like in A Time to Kill and The Rainmaker. The King of Torts was an entertaining summer read. I don't feel I wasted my time reading it, but I'm not sure if someone asked me in 6 months that I'd be able to remember the storyline."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After he strayed from the normal path with Skipping Christmas and A Painted House, Grisham returned with vengence to write a nail biting suspense novel that brings him back to the days of The Firm and The Pelican Brief.

The aptly names \`King of Torts' deals mainly with both the legal and political aspects of tort law, something he briefly touched upon in his excellent The Runaway Jury.Gone are the local Mississippi lawyers and judges, as Grisham continues to digress further from his own roots; in their place are presidents, fortune 500 CEOs, and the top lawyers in the country.Although Grisham has not lost his knack for storytelling, and King of Torts is certainly a compelling and exciting read, this book lacks the heart and sympathetic emotion provoked by his previous works. There is no loveable child or even adult wronged by the cruel world; the audience is torn between disliking and feeling empathetic towards the main character. Instead, Grisham presents a grim look into the world of not only tort law, but also social conditions, politics, and greed.Though the story, when contemplated apart from the book, is quite implausible, Grisham does manage to present it in a believable way. Although the King of Torts could certainly be written in more elaborate prose, it makes a good read that audiences should enjoy."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"What happened to the Grisham of &quot;The Firm&quot;? With the King of Torts, Grisham has finally sunk to the all time low of trashy Sindey Sheldon fiction. The tale is dull, predictible, unimaginative.

I am sorry to say, no more Grisham for me after this."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is a pretty good book, a quick summer read.

It read more like a biography, where a series of incidents occur--dramatic ones, admittedly--but with nothing that made me turn the pages once I realized it was \\"follow a lawyer's zaney career.\\" Stuff just kind of happens to the protagonist, with nothing for him to resolve.

Lacking any excitement, you'll be left wondering whether Mr Grisham's star is on its way down."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"A morality tale of a naive and greedy young attorney, rags to riches to rags, the SEC and the Caribbean. Sound familiar? This book is a quick read simply because you can't wait to see if Grisham has the audacity to end his book the way you know he's going to end it from page one. Exceptionally irritating is he doesn't even have the creativity or literary courage to change locations. Take a trip to Disneyworld on your next vacation for a change! Mr. Grisham brazenly recycles the same plot over and over and over again solely because he knows he can get away with it. We will pay him handsomely to do it. The irony? We fools pay this cynical and greedy man millions to write morality tales dripping with indignation about lawyers getting millions.Grisham obviously wrote \\"King of Torts\\" for his advance and his book contract.

Does he want her only because he can't have her? Clay admits that the romance was over - why then the change of heart?He does treat his best friends well, I'll give him that. But they did work for it. However, a lesser person would not have been so generous and it works out for him in the end.AGain, not one of Grisham's better efforts, kind of in the middle of the pack.

I thought that it could not get worse from The Summons, but again, it has.The story had no real direction, and I could not figure out the moral of the story. There was no restitution or retribution like there usually is in his other novels. It's just a story about a greedy lawyer. Nothing else, just his greed, and the extent he will go to get it. I will say nothing else but hope that his next book will be an improvement."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"\\"John Grisham\\" envokes thoughts of solid, fast paced, legal mystery books which evelope the reader and hold him/her steadfast in the plot until the last word.This book MUST have been written by someone else.As someone else has stated here, the books is a great introduction to the world of mass torts (while I have to say, much much simplified - most companies don't just roll over as they do in this book) it lacks the compelling tension that marked other Grisham novels before it. I kept turning pages for one reason - to get to where the plot thickened. The character of Max Pace is well done, but then left out to dry off, unused. The romantic element, which is so well laid out in the beginning, falls flat on its face. I would have been happy to read 5 or 6 more chapters if Mr. G would have continued with the structure he started with. It was like writing the blueprint for the Sistine Chapel design and then calling Maaco to finish up.The beginning is well scripted, lays an amazing foundation and then sputters to a pathetic close, which left me unfulfilled."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"With The King of Torts, Grisham is back with his best effort out of his left few novels (which were clearly below par). In a story of a Washington DC public defender turned mass tort attorney, Grisham brings together an interesting cast of characters. In tackling the mass tort issue, Grisham focuses on an area of the law that will increasingly impact many, either directly or indirectly. Regardless of whether you believe that the cadre of mass tort lawyers are philanthropic fighters for the common man or a greedy, self-serving scourge upon industry and the economy, there is something in this novel that will infuriate you and also resonate with your line of thinking. The story is an intriguing one. The pace is steady and builds throughout. Although not as good as some of the vintage legal thrillers done by Grisham early in his career, The King of Torts is probably worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"In this book he shows just how greedy people are.

At times I would sit down to read and I had in mind only to read for maybe a half-hour. That half-hour turned into two hours as the suspense dramatically increased.John Grisham's ending was perfect; a great way to end a novel that began modestly and became increasingly enthralling.Grisham's lastest book will certainly keep you turning the pages, the plot stalling you from putting it down."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter, 31 years old, is a financially poor, disillusioned Washington D.C. public defender. Although he just wrapped up a three year murder case and would definitely like a break, he doesn't get it. Instead he gets Tequila Watson, a young man arrested for a random murder. The sheer randomness sets Clay sniffing for clues, and what he sniffs out is more than he ever bargained for -- a visit from a stranger named Max Pace who is known in the legal world as a fireman, someone hired by large companies who have messed up to fix their mistakes behind the scenes. This time, a huge corporation's drug is making people kill. Tequila was on this drug. If Clay will quit his job and set up his own practice, the corporation will pay him 15 million to help them quietly settle with the victims. Unable to say no to so much money, Clay agrees. Besides the money, he gets as a reward a huge mass tort case and is soon richer than his wildest dreams. But even after he owns his own jet and fancy home and has a beautiful model on his arm, he doesn't have the woman he loves. And he doesn't have security. The FBI is sniffing at his heels. Former clients aren't happy. What will happen if the King of Torts himself gets sued?I never thought I'd see the day when I was ready to give a Grisham book five stars, but by the middle of THE KING OF TORTS I was planning to do just that. Somehow, without resorting to unexpected twists, violence, sex, or worldwide conspiracies (seemingly the fare of many thrillers today), Grisham managed to achieve incredible suspense. While certainly no master of setting, his prose is clean, his plotting tight and fast, and his message as clear as the nose on your face (pardon the cliche) -- mass tort litigation is bad! And I have no doubt readers will be convinced he knows what he's talking about, since I was.However, this book never actually made the five stars in my mind because of the last third. I can't point to any particular place where it went wrong, just that it slowed to the point where I was checking pages to see how many I had left and finally, in the last couple chapters, skipping paragraphs altogether. THE KING OF TORTS is like THE FIRM in many ways, from weak women characters to protagonists with poor morals to endings that sag. Grisham has remarkable talent, especially when it comes to writing books that would make great movies, but he also works from a formula and too often his novels reveal that formula. Unfortunately, THE KING OF TORTS is no exception.Although readers who enjoy high intrigue and lots of twists will probably be better off looking elsewhere, for legal thriller lovers and Grisham fans, THE KING OF TORTS is a solid, moralistic read I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Talented actor Michael Beck has much experience giving voice to the works of John Grisham - The Rainmaker, A Time To Kill, The Runaway Jury, and The Summons.

It seems as if Grisham is hell bent on sacrificing everything -- nuance, character development -- in order to move things along. The result is a page-turner with absolutely no meat. If you're not a Grisham fan, &quot;The King Of Torts&quot; isn't going to change your mind."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"just finished it today, and it was a good read. my all time favorite grisham is the testament, and this is not nearly that good. but it's better by far than the brethren or painted house or the summons. i kept reading just to find out what was going to happen to clay: you know that he's going to have a crisis strike, but you can't imagine which of his problems is going to be his downfall. he seems like a good guy who gets caught up in his desire to be wealthy.so, your basic grisham book. worth the time if you enjoy him, but not his best."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"King of Torts is a little different then the \\"average\\" Grisham novel. In a good way. While I love novels like The Firm, The Street Lawyer, The Partner; at the same token, something a bit different is good. Keeps things fresh. Because, who wants to keep reading the same sorts of stories, over and over again?This book, obviously, is about the tort system. Not being familiar with torts, I found the book enlightening and interesting. I read it in a week, it was a quick, fun read. Honestly, I read it quickly because I was enjoying it and wondering where it would go, how it would end. Albiet, the ending wasn't a complete surprise, there were surprises along the way which kept things interesting.While not the best Grisham novel, nor the most suspenseful, I think King of Torts is worth the read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Once upon a time, a man named John Grisham sold copies of a little book called&quot; A Time to Kill&quot; out of the back of a pickup truck. Hoping to sell some copies, Grisham did more than that as he quickly became one of the best selling authors of all time. Part of his success I belive was the fact that he didn't have the media, or anything to hype his book at the time, but only a plot that would forever be remembered.Now Grisham doesn't need the aide of a pick up truck. He has the media. He has all the time in the world to pump out a novel, because he knows that there is a audience always waiting. This is where Grisham's newest legal thriller comes into play.The King of Torts, a novel about mass tort lawsuits, quickly delivers the goods. When we first start reading we learn of a young, unde paid laywer, Clay Carter that just wants to make his place in the legal system. After a case is given to him, we learn of a murder case that can go so many ways with its page turning details. Unable to put the book down the plot suddenly takes a turn only to leave us thinking .....well thinking what happened here? Suddenly a murder case turns into a bigger case just because of a phone call from the middle of nowhere. Now the main character gets his big break, but the reader doesnt as the first couple of chapters soon become a faded memory. Especialy since the rest of the book dwells nothing on a murder case but the rich and posh life a laywer can live. I'm sorry but personal jets, a sad love life, and money can buy this fan of Grisham.So what am I trying to say? Grisham it seems has lost some of his good ways to write a plot. It seems to me that most of his first books always started and ended strong. Then lately there has been Torts, and others that seem to lack the page turning ability. After half of the book you start to wonder what is going on but as a true fan you finish the book. It seems as if Grisham is pumping them out faster than he can think of a plot that can keep the reader like the Firm and others were rich in.Read King of Torts if you are a hard core fan. If not, pass. If I have to wait till Grisham is forgotten and starts selling books out of the back of his truck I will. If that happens again at least I'll know an effort was made to sell something more than a title."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is the 5th Grisham book I have read [Chamber, Client, Runaway Jury, and Time to Kill] and it is my least favorite.Like other Grisham novels it reads well and raises many interesting questions about human nature and the nature of the civil and criminal justice system in the US.At the same time, I had a tremendously disappointing feeling after reading this book. I thought there were two stories that were fascinating - the Tequila Wilson-Tarvan story and the Max Pace guy. Neither of them are sufficiently described or closed out in the book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I think all of us can learn a lesson about how greed can change us from this book. I do agree however with other reviewers when they say that Max Pace's character did not find closure.

I loved the fast pace of the book and look forward to the next novel."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"For a long road trip over Christmas , I borrowed a friend's &quot;King of Torts&quot; book-on-tape and came out of it disappointed. When the book finally ended, I had the same feeling I have when I stay up too late watching a bad movie on TV - what a waste of time.When the book was about two-thirds of the way through, it was dragging. Grisham was *still* setting Carter up for the big crash - jeez, get on with it. By the time I got to where all the cards tumbled, it was too late and I was simply relieved that it finally happened.Rambling comments:1. For some reason, Clay is obsessed with Rebecca, but we really don't know why. She doesn't have much more substance than his bimbo model.2. There was absolutely no explanation of Max Pace, how he got his inside info, what happened to him, etc. He is the whole reason we have this story and it is never explained.3. The ending was weak. One last ride in the jet with his woman, Puullleeeze. The good part about it was that the book was finally over."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Like all Grisham novels, the words flow smoothly, except with this volume there just isn't much of a story. Yet I suspect this has little to do with the author and much to do with his publisher who is pushing to get another book by this big money-maker out the door. If you're reading, publisher, sit back for awhile and let the man write a great tale as we all know he can. In this story, composing a summary in one's mind of what will happen to the main character Clay Carter is all too easy almost from the very beginning, and that shouldn't be. For a good alternative read, try 'Spine.'"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Ok, daddy doesn't take the money away and it doesn't matter who does (why ruin the story?), but Grisham who had begun to bore me with more recent legal thrillers (the summons? snooze) tells a fascinating story that flies by. It is not a thriller--it more an inside look at a part of American law that can be disgusting (tobacco lawyers?)--but regardless of your feeling about the torts system, it is just a good story. Grisham is no hemingway (alas, or even a Turow), but the story is fascinating."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Its a vexing question? Do mass tort (class action) lawsuits serve or savage the public at large...Do they destroy good businesses that have unforeseen problems, or police the scallywags of corpoarate America? IS it fair for an attorney to bag HUGE profits if he uncovers a dastardly result from a consumer product gone awry?Yes to all, and herein lies the basis for this impeccible thriller about Clay the lawyer who is handed the case of a lifetime by a shadowy charcter, Max Pace. Rich beyond his wildest dreams, Clay goes from civil servant hack to a Gulfstream riding hot shot in mere months.the story is an excellent ride of suspense and intrique ~ of love lost and love gained and a scintillating morality play not be missed.. a great read!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham's tale of Clay Carter's rise to tort law fame lacks the suspense of many of his other works, but that doesn't mean it failed to produce a salient point about the tort law system in America. The system consists of simply a transfer of millions of dollars from big corporations to trial lawyers with the plaintiffs getting hosed two times over.Grisham has made it a point in recent legal thrillers like The Runaway Jury and The Summons to foucs on greed and human nature, and he succeeds with this latest attempt.It is my hope that Grisham's next legal thriller will get back to the page-turning drama of books like The Client and The Firm."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book as well as Bleachers is well below other thrillers I have read by this author. The book merely tells the story of a mass tort lawyer, and how fast he can rise to the top and fall back down. It seems that Grisham does a lot better when he is writing thrillers!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have liked Grisham's stuff depsite the archetypal characters and sometimes hackneyed storylines... that's part of the allure for me of reading Grisham. I was expecting a mystery or a thriller, etc but this book just dragged on and on... It was a boring lesson in morality and an attempt to document the decline of a tort lawyer. I kept expecting a mystery but instead got a boring tale of excess, greed, and torts."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The subject matter is compelling and interested me, but Mr. Grisham should have limited his scope (and page count) to an Op-Ed piece or a magazine article. There is simply no story here. None. You keep turning the pages waiting for something to happen -- surely this character will have an antagonist of some sort other than (or in addition to) the obvious one, himself. But no.This &quot;novel&quot; functions as a diatribe against greedy trial lawyers, much of which I agree with, but it's not a story."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I love the way Grisham writes. His characters are wonderful. However, I was really disappointed in this book. Like most people, I have a very busy life. Finding time to read an entire novel is such a hard thing for me to do. So I was very sad to see the 'hero', Clay,be such a greedy, cliche character. It somehow was made even worse by his tragic end, even though I suppose he deserved it. I would just like to read something a bit more uplifting - like Clay learns his lesson, but comes out with at least some dignity and money. The last Grisham book I read, Painted House, had an ending that also left me feeling empty, like there should be more to it. So I guess when I find a few precious moments to read, my next book will not be authored by John Grisham."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"With the exception of a look into the greed which propels the mass tort litigation system in American jurisprudence, this book offered little for the serious legal thriller fan like myself. It lacked suspense and excitement and contained far too many boring characters. Not even the protagonist, Clay Carter presented as a strong and fully developed character. I was hopeful that this book would mark a return to vintage Grisham as exhibited by the plot and characterisation in The Firm and The Client, for example.Once again I felt short-changed when I was finished reading this novel as I have with the last several Grisham legal thrillers."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you're going to eat this book, I recommend clam sauce."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"In this average John Grisham legal novel, the character has his life changed by sudden wealth stemming from his entry into the world of mass torts as a trial lawyer.We meet our young lawyer idealistically toiling away as a public defender and as the paramour of a rich girl who wants more than matrimony from her knight in shinning armor (she wants her knight to have wads of cash in addition to compassion and great performance in the sack). Fortune appears in the form of a mysterious stranger who offers the lawyer more money than he could make in a lifetime defending poor criminals. The source of his new wealth: mass tort cases handed up on a silver platter if our attorney will settle with the families of murder victims whose murdered loved one was the unfortunate side effect of a new wonder being secretly tested in drug clinics around the world.The young attorney accepts, holds his nose and settles the suits and becomes the new &quot;King of Torts,&quot; as his success suing his first drug company catapults him into the front ranks of the country's trial attorneys.His untold riches finance cars, planes, a beautiful consort, a national profile and the burying of his conscience. In the end, his world collapses when he reaches for a \\"case to far\\" and the FBI catches up with him for short selling the stock of a company against which he was about to file a class action suit.Riches gone, he wins back his girl (who finally decides that a wad of cash borne by the wrong suitor might be a worse deal than the right suitor whose only credit is his newly rediscovered character). They then ride off into the sunrise (east from Washington DC to a flat in London).This novel has some of the character development of the standard Grisham fare, though it pales besides some of his earlier work. The action is fast paced, and some of the early sub plots are interesting -- particularly the conspiracy with the original bad drug. His portrayal of the Mass Tort Trial Attorney world fascinates - particularly his Patton French character - the granddaddy of mass tort actions and a caricature of greedy lawyers at the top of their game. What this book is mostly is a morality tale on two levels. First, the evil of a legal system which allows mass tort trial lawyers to decimate companies good and bad with the no-holds-barred fee system that currently exists. Second, the evil effect of quick and ill-earned wealth on the character of otherwise normal people. (one quote from the book: \\"nobody, nobody earns six million dollars in six months\\")This book is interesting and a quick read. I thought the ending was not as calculated and dependent on the earlier story as has been the case in previous efforts -- it just kind of happened and was declared by the author. All in all, a middling effort from Grisham; still a good read because he is one of the best popular novelists around."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Over the years I have marveled at how John Grisham has been able to keep cranking out one page turner after another. At first he was the new, hot author of the legal thriller. Then he tended to become both preachy and predictable. Nonetheless, he kept cranking out very readable books.In the last few years he has ventured away from his Memphis city roots, and his familiar theme of hero on the run. Now he is back with King of Torts, and once again it is an immensely readable book, a book that can be finished in a very short time.But, we are once again being preached to as has happened before in his novels The Runaway Jury and The Chamber. Now he has tried to bring his writing style to tort reform, a topic to which there are really no easy answers.As a practicing attorney I find it completely unfathomable how Grisham's lead character can stumble upon a huge tort settlement, let his own client go to prison in the process, and then continue on his merry way. More than 350 pages are needed to tackle this topic, and Grisham tries to hard to preach of the evils of personal injury and tort attorneys, and forgets that in order for there to be such attorneys there has to be a bad product. Sure we have bad products in this book, but the true evil is not the product but rather the attorneys who are trying to quickly gobble up fees at the sake of their clients.He creates a character who in just a few short months turns his back on all his ideals and all he has believed in. Does this happen, sure! But nobody has risen and fallen in the legal profession as quickly as Clay Carter.A few years ago I stopped reading Grisham because he was too predictable and then he came back with some better efforts delving into different areas of the law such as The Testament and The Summons, plus his recent non-legal books. I had hoped for a better treatment of the topic than what I got in King of Torts. It is highly readable, it is a page turner, but in the end you do not have any connections with the characters and I am still trying to figure out his simplistic ending to the book ...I am sure his legion of fans will love this book, but for me it really lacked character development and was highly unbelievable."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham's latest is, of course, a page turner. I must say that I enjoyed this book far more then any of his recent law related novels. The characterization was above par, the plot was thick, and the kicker, the main character was sympathetic.Grisham loves to write novels about how the law creates a system that sours men's souls. The King of Torts is no exception. What makes this book that much more enjoyable is the almost happy go lucky, rags to riches, undeniably charming leading man.There are some downsides of course. The plot is a tad bit predictable and the reader is presented with Grisham's constant need to sneer at everything. At times it seems as if Grisham hates all things America; southern, mid-western rich, inner-city, suburban.So to take Oracle Grisham to the extreme, in order to be morally correct one needs to educated but not suburban, not poor, not wealthy, not too fat or thin. It is not clear who would actually fit into that demographic, maybe not even Grisham himself.Regardless, this book is worth the read, and would be a good shot as the next movie adaptation."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Tequila Watson is due to be prosecuted for the murder of Ramon Pumphrey, the victim on an unprovoked and seemingly motiveless shooting, and Clay Carter, a young lawyer from the Office of the Public Defender, gets landed with the defence case. There is no doubt that Watson did it, there are witnesses and even he himself admits to the deed, although his only reason seems to be a puzzling \\"I just felt like it.\\"Then, a mysterious representative of a large pharmaceutical company comes to Clay with a shocking secret. Evidently, a new wonderdrug, \\"Tarvan\\" - which cures drug addiction after a period of prolonged use - has some horrific side-effects that the company is prepared to pay millions to keep quite, and Clay was in the right case at the right time. This is a deal that could make all his dreams come true, and possibly even entice Rebecca - the woman he loves - back to him again, at the same time as making him the legal-world's newest king of torts...Now, this is my first Grisham book, so after hearing that his latest are disappointing, I came to it with caution. And soon found all my fears dispelled into the mist. Grisham seems to me to be just another of several mega-bestselling authors that have unjustly fallen victim to their own popularity. I found The King of Torts to be an absolutely marvellous tale of the cogs of law, thrilling, fast, and authentic, which carried me with it late into the night.His characters are a well-drawn, realistic lot, and their relationships are interesting. The plot in itself may not be full of action, but the book is nonetheless a pageturner, due in no small part to Grisham's wonderful writing style that is just so darn easy to read, without descending into Patterson-esque simplicity. I found myself carried along swiftly by it, floating along as if on a lexical cushion of air. It's a pageturner not because its exceptionally exciting (\\"interesting\\" is more the word) but because the prospect of reading another few pages is just so easy.This is a fascinating book or several reasons. The legal-workings. Clay's spectacular and cheering rise to the highest echelons of mass-tort lawyers. And, then, his even more fascinating fall from grace, which therein lies the none-too-subtle lesson of this morality tale.Grisham is a fantastic storyteller, and, like other popular writers who are supposedly going downhill, I found no evidence of that here. I suppose it might just be that over-exposure to his books dulls them a little, but at first glance this seems to me to be yet another writer the reports of whose decline have been greatly exaggerated."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you ever wanted to know some details about class-action lawsuits and the lawyers that generate them, this book is for you. You get to see how a tort case can transform a young, poor, public defender into a super wealthy head of his own law firm, specializing in suing large companies for millions of dollars. You also will see the sleazy side of this business and the damage these lawsuits cause to the community.I enjoyed this novel for the most part and finished it in 24 hours. The pacing is quick, and there isn't that much legal mumbo-jumbo included. I guess the main message is \\"Don't kill the golden goose.\\""},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is another book that the publishing industry has marketed to make money. Grisham has done much better. While the book is a quick read, it does nothing to engage the reader. Grisham creates characters whose actions are not only unbelievable but also unlikeable. There is no reason for the events that they find themselves entangled. Ensuing chapters read like a blow by blow a year in the life of a tort laywer. No lasting impressions and no redeeming qualities to this work. Save 4 hours of your life!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham began his writing career with a bang, publishing one great legal thriller after the next, a feat that brought him to the top of the publishing world very quickly. But in the last few years, his legal thrillers have been less than steller. Aside from his sweet, heartwarming A Painted House (which, ironically enough, was not a legal thriller), Grisham's novels have been on the boring side. Now, he returns with his yearly offering, a fun little novel called The King of Torts, a novel that brings him once step closer to regaining his title of King of the legal thriller.In the book, we find a young public defendent named Clay, who is given the opportunity to earn 15 million dollars with just a few months's work. Soon enough, he is thrown into the world of mass litigation, where lawyers sue big corportations with thousands of claims. The millions start pouring in and Clay soon finds himself at the top of his game.But what goes up must come down, a thing Clay does not seem to know. Halfway through the story, Clay realizes that he's in way over his head.In Clay, Grisham creates a character you will both love and hate. His rise to success his fun to watch, but his downfall is much more interesting. It's the part in between that's problematic. Because, while Clay is on top, he becomes so obssessed with money and fame that he becomes a character you will despise. It's hard to like someone who's complaining about life when they own a yacht, a million dollar house, a penthouse in the south, and their own 45$ million jet. So when his downfall arrives, it's hard to feel sympathy for Clay.The story is predictable, yet fun to read. Maybe the book would have been better had Clay been faced with harder, more problematic challenges and situations. As it is now, The King of Torts is a fund read that doesn't require much involvement from its readers. A good beach novel, but not much more than that."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Fans of John Grisham's earlier legal works should be pleased with this thriller set in the complex, greedy world of tort lawyers. You can't help but like and hate the main character, lawyer J. Clay Carter II as he changes from a low paid but dedicated attorney in the D.C. Public Defender's office to a high powered, freewheeling and greedy corporate lawyer. When the chance to cash in on 6 settlements for a new drug gone wrong lands in Carter's lap, he is lured into the jet-setting life of other wealthy attorneys looking for quick settlements. Even though you may not approve of their motives, the tort world is fascinating and a great story. As Carter buys into the lifestyle with a personal jet and home in the Carribbean yet seems unconcerned about settlements for his clients, you want to shake him. But those who rise quickly can fall the same way and the novel ends in a satisfying way.Lots of subplots, interesting characters and fast paced action keeps you on pins and needles until the end of the story. I think this is a four star book, not quite at the level of his earlier works (The Firm and Pelican Brief) , but a huge improvement over later works such as The Summons and The Brethren."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It's always hard to read a book that has a lead character with few redeeming qualities, and the King of Torts is no exception. While the story is fascinating in its details about tort law, class action suits, and class action lawyers, who come out rather like comic book characters, it is not particularly gripping, as Clay Carter's roller coaster ride is completely predictable right to the end. This is a modern morality tale about money, greed, and power, and a very average one at that. Don't skip reading it, but don't expect a lot either."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Lately, John Grisham's books have been pretty bad. Skipping Christmas, A Painted House, The Brethren and The Summons were very forgettable. The King of Torts is different. It is a rags to riches story in which you can't help cheering for the protagonist, Clay Carter. As the novel begins Clay is stuck in a dead-end job as a public defender. In a hard to believe plot leap, Clay is contacted by a &quot;fireman,&quot;(a person hired by big corporations implicated in lawsuits to get a settlement) Max Pace who gives him the opportunity to make millions of dollars. Clay gleefully accepts this opportunity and is soon a hotshot multimillionaire with a private jet, house on St. Barts, Porsche and bimbo girlfriend. But of course, this couldn't last... The King of Torts seems to me as an illustration of the contempt in which Grisham holds the profession of mass tort lawyers. It's a quick, great read that will be sure to please fans of Grisham's and also those just looking for a thrilling read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Like several reviewers, I have been less than enthralled with Grisham's latest legal thrillers. His last thriller, THE SUMMONS, in my opinion, was a yawner. However, after a brief sojourn into classic fiction with A PAINTED HOUSE and SKIPPING CHRISTMAS (which I highly recommend), Grisham has clawed his way back into the arena that made him the King of Legal Thrillers. THE KING OF TORTS is classic Grisham, in the form of A TIME TO KILL, THE FIRM, and my all-time favorite, THE PELICAN BRIEF. While KING OF TORTS still doesn't quite measure up, it is incredibly good.What makes THE KING OF TORTS so good is the conceptual elements fans have grown to love about Grisham's thirllers: an underdog young attorney, a mysterious and clandestine protagonist, greasy \\"ambulance-chasing\\" attorneys and unscrupulous corporations. In the end, as always, it's all about the dollar.Our \\"hero\\" in this thriller is J. Clay Carter II, a low-paid public defender in Washington, D.C. Clay has a well-to-do fianc&eacute;e, Rebecca Van Horn who, along with her pugnacious mother and father continually nettle Clay to take a more lucrative job. His future in-laws are everything Clay despises. When he wontonly rejects Mr. Van Horn's offer of a corporate position making more than twice his PD pay, Rebecca dumps him for an geeky Ivy Leaguer.Concurrent with his personal life heading south, Clay has just been ambushed into handling the defense of Tequila Watson, a young black man who shot a friend named \\"Pumpkin\\" (lively names). Although totally unmoved, Clay is intrigued as to why Tequila can't remember killing Pumpkin. It's as though his mind has been washed away...with drugs, Clay suspects. After issuing subpoenas for all the medical files from the street-tough drug rehabilitation center where Tequila was being treated, Clay gets the call of his young life. As Grisham describes him, \\"the man in black.\\" Clay meets the man in black, Max Pace, an ex-lawyer cum \\"fireman,\\" hired to solve problems on behalf of a variety of unnamed companies. His current \\"project\\" is on behalf of a major pharmaceutical company, which has just pulled the plug on a bad drug...a drug that has the side effects of making ex-addicts kill for no apparent reason. Pace's job for Clay? Offer the victims' families large settlements NOT to pursue any potential investigation or legal action. For this, Clay will receive a cool $15 million. Clay takes an extremely short moment and decides that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Why, he would be foolish to turn it down, wouldn't he?Sure to his word, Max makes Clay a millionaire with a few short weeks of work. And, to add pleasure to ecstasy, Max has another, much larger \\"deal\\" for Clay. This deal involves another bad drug but this time, Clay gets to play the mass tort game. This, all from \\"tips\\" provided by the mysterious Max Pace. As Clay's new lawsuit takes form, he lands thousands of class-action suits and is dubbed by the major media \\"The King of Torts.\\" As the pitiful pharmaceutical company decides to settle with Clay and his newly minted legal bretheren, Clay is two-for-two, only this time, his take isn't $15 million; it's $100 million! Like taking candy from a baby. Clay believes he's this good and here comes the element creating problems for most, greed.As Clay acquires a yacht (for his father), a private plane, an island retreat and a trophy girlfriend, he burns through his new found wealth at an astonishing pace both for pleasure and in funding his next legal bonanza. But, like Mitch McDeere, Grisham's protagonist in THE FIRM, Clay soon learns that his newly acquired riches come with a price he can't afford to pay.Grisham's glimpse into the world of mass tort attorneys is poignant and timely. How many commercials do we see on television from those soliciting our aches, pains, and more frighteningly, our health. The multi-million dollar advertising campaigns they use to attract clients and the huge sums they extract from big corporations are astonishing albeit fetid.Unlike many of the Hollywood stories, not all mass tort actions have \\"happy\\" endings. In some cases, attornys undeservingly obtain riches simply because the defendant corporation believes it can spend less to settle than to litigate. At some surreal level, this crack in our legal system is one that is uncomfortable at best; horrifying at worst. In many cases, good, well-intentioned companies are forced into bankruptcy and the victims, who suffered the most, are left with little after attorney's fees.Grisham sets a good pace for this storyline and develops the characters quite well. The only problem I saw with THE KING OF TORTS is, having set up strong characters and revealed the conspiracy, Grisham spins the story to a condensed close. While this glimpse of the Grisham of old is encouraging, the sprial down to climax was a return to the recent past. This doesn't spoil the book, as a whole, but it does bring the awestruck level down to solid.A good book, a fun read. I hope this is only peek into Grisham's future direction. Maybe, just maybe, we'll see another PELICAN BRIEF in the making."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am a long time fan of Grisham. I have read all of his law-based books. I have noticed a downward slide in his recent work. The earlier works have good plot twists and sometimes a surprise ending. Lately, the books have tended to end a little ambigiously or downright dull. This book is no exception. Good idea, neat plot line, but the character development is lacking. Some characters are developed and then set aside. When I finished this book last night, having stayed up late to do so, I was left with a strong sense of disappointment. Grisham fans beware. Not sure if I'd recommend this to anyone. Sorry."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It isn't exactly news to most Americans that lawyers can be a venal bunch of cads. Yet John Grisham pounds home his &quot;message&quot; with such forceful clarity, you would think he had just discovered Betsy Ross was a traitor.Mysterious Max introduces Clay Carter, a youngish lawyer going nowhere, to the shadowy world of &quot;mass torts&quot;. Mass torts are when a large group of consumers bring action against a corporation for a faulty product. One lawyer may represent thousands of citizens. The idea is to get the corporation to settle (without going to court). The payout is in millions; the lawyer skims his enormous fee off the top and frequently the consumers get only a pittance in a successful action.Clay's greed goes into overdrive and he is sucked into this new world of big money. By the end of his first year at his new job he is worth ten million, proud owner of a Gulfstream V, a gorgeous girl to hang on his arm and spend his money, and a definite thirst for more. This is a precarious and pressure-filled universe just barely operating on the sunny side of the law. One misstep is disastrous.Trouble is, the reader knows from the get go that Grisham is never in this world going to allow Clay to enjoy his misbegotten goodies. So we spend the whole book waiting for the other shoe to drop--and drop it does. Also given Mr. Grisham's former profession and his outlandish success at his present occupation, I think he is standing on a fairly fragile pulpit. Nevertheless, Mr. Grisham, as always, is a master storyteller so it isn't a chore to follow Clay through his Pilgrim's Progress and back. But be warned, this isn't a mystery or general fiction; it's an admonitory tale.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was hugely disappointed with this book. I had read a few of Grisham's early books a number of years ago which I enjoyed and recently thought that The King of Torts would be the sort of thing I needed for the beach. Boy, was I wrong.Where Grisham's earlier work (such as The Firm, The Client and The Pelican Brief) were fast paced legal thrillers with nice plot twists, The King of Torts is a moderately paced story about a greedy lawyer with no plot twist. I kept waiting for something to happen - and it never did. Talk about feeling cheated.I'm not sure that Grisham tried very hard with this book. I get the impression that he belted it out rather quickly. He certainly doesn't seem to have spent as much time developing the plot as with his earlier books. Here the main character (Clay Carter) has a major lawsuit handed to him on a plate by the mysterious Max Price. And then when Max Price has served his purpose of short circuiting the plot, he simply drops out of the picture.Why not have the main character do his own investigation to find the case? Why not have Max Price be an old friend of his estranged father or somehow linked to another character in the story? In fact, why not make more of Clay's father as a character. Why not make more of Clay's relationship with his girlfriend? There are plenty of opportunities for Grisham to make this story more complex and interesting but he seems to have missed them all. Not particularly satisfying.Even at his best Grisham is a rather formulaic writer of pulp fiction - but at least you know what you're going to get. Or at least, you should. What was so disappointing about this book is that I didn't get what I was expecting - a decent thriller with a plot twist to enjoy on the beach.Perhaps the irony is that the The King of Torts is a story about a lawyer who gets greedy, doesn't worry about it and then takes the money and splits. What is actually going on is that the author and publisher are churning out pulp to a public that deserves better, not worrying about it before they take the money and split."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After waiting a few months to get my hands on a copy of this book, I was not disappointed in the least. The last John Grisham book I read was The Runaway Jury and there were parts in The King of Torts that reminded me of that book.The book begins with Clay Carter, a lawyer working in the Office of the Public Defender (OPD). He is quickly assigned a case to provide legal counsel to a murderer. He tries to pawn the case off on another lawyer, but he's unsucessful in doing so. He soon gets a call from Max Pace, who seems to have the perfect case but all he needs is a good lawyer. Clay takes on the case and makes millions. Max happens to have more and more cases, each guaranteeing millions, but a what cost? After living in the lap of luxury, Clay realizes that it has all be at the expense of his clients.This book was such a fast paced read. Whether you're a John Grisham fan or not, any suspense fan would love this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Recent law-based books by Grisham have focused on unsympathetic characters and shady legal practices. From reading the reviews I was hoping for a story similar to the rainmaker. Unfortunately, I faced another novel in the vein of The Summons The Brethren and The Partner.He has written better."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Agreed that this is not as good as other John Grisham works. But definitely a worthy read - goes into the inner workings of how the tort system works - the good and bad of it - how it destroys companies and people employed.The book is certainly not a bad read - once you start reading you will want to keep reading it till you finish reading it. If you havent read it - it is definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is perfectly rendered with the highs, and lows, of tort law. Yes, he is the king, for a day or two, but the book shows just how precarious this spcialty practice is."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Great book from start to finish. The wonderful part about it is that John Grisham lours you in to make the certain conflicts obvious and predictable, then uses his writing genius to shift away from the conflict that was presented before you and create a whole new problem. Middle was a bit tedious but if you stick through the 20-30 tedious pages, the book will not let you down. Read this book while in Italy, did not disappoint. Extra points to short chapters, its always a better read when the chapters are short. Loved it."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham is by far one of the better mystery writers today! I've enjoyed every book and look forward to all future books too!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"King of Torts is the first John Grisham book I have ever read. I was hesitant to read this author because I predicted I would not be interested in his stories but I was dead wrong.This story was enthralling. Once the story started to get rolling I was enraptured and could not wait to see what happened next. John Clay Carter was a Public Defendant making a pathetic salary defending pathetic criminals.His life was pretty much stalled in every aspect. But this all changed upon receiving secret information from a mysterious character Max Pace. From this moment on Clays life changes forever.I found myself interested in this story because I was living vicariously through Clay for a moment. It is the ultimate rags to riches story.John Grisham makes the book seem like it is based on true stories, which makes the book that more interesting and life like.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and reccommend it. I will pick another Grisham book soon."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This Grisham tale is a bit stale and predictable. I did not have to struggle to finish it but there was more substance in Playing for Pizza."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham always does such a good job of fleshing out characters. So much so that the protagonists have their faults and the antagonists seems plausible. Here, the main character, Clay, just didn't appeal to me at all. I seemed to be rooting against him. There was no one to root for. I know every book doesn't need those things but Grisham's novels usually do. Oh well, they all can't be gems."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I picked up this book based on the back cover, which describes the book as the tale of one drug gone bad and some vigilante lawyer justice. However, that storyline is quickly dropped in favour of a get rich scheme. The lawyer is picked up and turned into a money making machine, outfitted with a convincing office and staff. But then they set to work on some compeltely unrelated case and it all comes crashing down with the espionage and the illegal and blah blah blah.I know this is the way of John Grisham novels, but the back cover is so off in tone one really wonders if the same book is being described. In any case, the book is pretty boring and lackluster."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It started with a Bang but around page 300 I started to get tired with the story and tired with the characters. I loved the Clay who had principles and a conscience then he degradedd into someone I kept thinking was stupid, then someone I wanted to see punished. Also his love interest was even less likeale than Clay. Lazy Gold digger it would seem. Though out his heartache I kept thinking if I am supposed to be rooting for them and I kept expecting Clay to develop some other meaningful realationship with someone else. I was dissapointed with the lazy end. Expected better. But I still love Grisham's style and through him and his writing I know a lot of ramdom stuff about almost every kind of law there is... I miss Bible Blet setting though, it made for colorful characters and certain sense that you knew them."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts by John Grisham is a quick and predictable read, but that does not mean it isn't entertaining. John Carter II is a character you'll feel for at first and hope he can do better. Then you'll get to watch him quickly collect millions. From the start of his rise to riches you'll think, \\"You better pull out now before it all crashes!\\" This question just becomes stronger as others do just that thing.Once at the top you'll see the greed take over and begin to wonder when he'll take the step over the cliff. At this point in the book it just becomes going through the motions as you wait for the inevitable to happen with the question, \\"How far will Carter crash?\\"Not Grisham's best works, but if you are a fan of his work or a fan of the legal thriller, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I remember being a huge Grisham fan several years back, when I was still in middle school. I read 7 out of 9 of his already published books within a year, borrowing from friends and the library as well as begging my mom to buy whatever I could. This summer, I randomly picked up _The Summons_ and _The King of Torts_ at a local library, and they were definitely not John Grisham at his best._The King of Torts_, unlike previous Grisham books, was not impossible to put down. After the first few chapters, the plot began to slow. I did not find myself siding with or rooting for the main character, as I did in _The Firm_ and _The Runaway Jury_. The story just did not seem to be as well told and seemed lacking in a way. The ending was unsatisfying, without a sense of justice or even resolution.However, the book was not entirely powerless. The book left me with quite a nasty aftershock. This book presents the current legal profession and the world of class action and mass tort lawsuits and settlements as a world in which morality is blurred, if not lost altogether. One begins to wonder if things are right. If this book describes reality, reality seems wrong. Mass tort lawyers toss around zeros effortlessly, focusing on their fees rather than their clients; they get rich quick and get away with corruption even quicker. Companies are forced to either own up to their mistakes and lose millions or to deny wrongdoing and bury the truth about harmful flaws in their products. The average person is caught between law firms and large corporations, with little gain and much loss, often kept in the dark and cast aside with a small compensatory sum. I do not know how much of this represents the way things work now, but I was very disturbed after setting the book down.Perhaps, in a way, the lack of resolution and the lack of a sense of justice may be a true representation of things as they are. Not a gripping Grisham novel, but a rather nasty depiction of the world."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham is a good writer, yet...This story lacks action. It drags on without much happening. One can easily rewrite the whole book in ten pages. To make this a better book, more twists could have been added."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I read this book in two days in the middle of the Iraqi desert last year. I had some time on my hands and was able to burn through this book pretty quickly. Wasn't too impressed with it and moved on to my next novel in the stack to pass the time. First off, this is the fourth Grisham book I have read and I am noticing a disturbing pattern, suggesting that Grisham has gotten lazy in his writing. I knew how this book would turn out after the first hundred pages: he would win the day, get the girl, and watch it all come crashing down before making his escape in the end. Why does it seem that ALL Grisham's books end with the protagonist(s) leaving the country or fleeing to distant lands at the end of his books? The idea of someone finding the wonderous and profitable world of the class action suit that late in life seems rather naive for the narrator. A lot of plot devices additionally seem quaint, unbelievable and very predictable. I am giving this novel two stars because Grisham has made a novel about class actions seem exciting. An accomplishment in itself."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Should I risk another legal thriller by the dethroned king? That was my question as I bought \\"The King of Torts.\\" Reviews of this book range from one extreme to the other, and, after laboring through \\"The Summons\\" (thin plot) and \\"The Brethren\\" (no protagonist), I feared this latest would be a disappointment too.What a pleasant surprise. Grisham opens with a random killing, drags in an unwilling public defendant, then mixes it up with a global corporate coverup and millions of dollars at stake...I was hooked.Clay Carter is our sympathetic hero, a man wrestling for recognition and love. He rises meteorically to the status of multi-millionaire when he uses insider information to file a class-action lawsuit against a pharmaceutical giant. Despite the sudden riches, he despises the greed in the mass tort law industry, and he also bemoans the loss of his girlfriend. Soon, however, the temptations drag him down into the very quagmire he despises, and Clay finds himself to the be one of the villains he swore never to be.\\"The King of Torts\\" takes on the form of a modern morality play, a bit preachy but effective. At times, it reads more like a nonfiction account...very believable, but clinical in its presentation of facts. Other times, Grisham reconnects with the passion and emotion of his earlier classics. Although he leaves a few plot threads hanging--whatever happens to Max Pace, for example?--he swings mightily and accurately in this latest novel. Maybe he hasn't lost the legal touch after all!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you want to learn a whole lot about mass tort litigation, this is an excellent starting point. The writing is digestible, mildly entertaining, and thoroughly believable.However, if you want a good yarn along with your education (which is what most readers have come to expect from Grisham), pick up a different book.The blurb on the dusk jacket is thoroughly misleading. This is not a story about a burned out young lawyer's uncovery of a conspiracy. On the contrary, the conspiracy appears and disappears very early in the novel, and while you keep expecting closure, you never get it.Max Pace, the mysterious mover and shaker of the book, is never explained or even fully identified with a real name. He repeatedly delivers insider tips to our protagonist and finally vanishes without a trace. I kept waiting for the \\"so what?\\" of the book, and it just didn't happen.Furthermore, I did not find a single major character in the story sympathetic. The lawyer protagonist is a man with just enough conscience to feel really bad, but not enough of a backbone to turn down money in order to do the right thing. Rebecca, the love interest, is a completely unsurprising, flat character. I kept waiting for either of them to do something that would make me care what happens to them, and they didn't.On the other hand, I'm not sorry I read the book. I learned a whole lot about mass torts. Just be aware before you buy that this is basically a textbook with a plot."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter had worked at the Office of the Public Defender for too long. His uptown girlfriend, Rebecca, wanted to stop working, get married, buy a large home, and have children. Her parents keep sticking their rich noses into the situation also. Of course, this made the situation worse, especially when her daddy gets Clay a high paying job (thinking Clay would never be able to get a better one on his own) and expected Clay to snatch it up. But Clay refused to be beholden to her family or under their thumb, even if it meant losing Rebecca.Things changed when Max Pace entered the picture. Max became Clay's source to getting several cases against pharmaceutical companies. Clay's settlements would change his life. Then he stumbled upon a conspiracy too horrible to believe!While reading this book I kept being reminded of John Grisham's last novel. I now believe it was foreshadowing this book. There is nothing shocking to the reader here or any unexpected twists. Any reader with a lick of sense will easily be able to predict what is going to happen in the main character's near and distant future. However, the story is still pure joy to read and written in a way that only John Grisham can do. Recommended reading!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"&quot;The King of Torts&quot; is a good one to read while on the tread-mill. It not only served as a carrot to get me on the machine, its intrigue prompted me to keep treading.In &quot;The King of Torts&quot;, John Grisham takes us on another ride of all rides. The story is a rags to riches, and then some, adventure. We experience the agonies of an underpaid Public Defender as well as those of, what appears to be, a highly successful tort attorney.As with previous Grisham novels, this one is a page turner that keeps you interested from beginning to end. Also, as in a few of Grisham's previous novels, the ending of &quot;The King of Torts&quot; is somewhat weak.Grisham fan, or not, you will want to read this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"There is not much I can say that the 140-plus reviewers before me have said. So you might wonder why I am doing a review at all!Well, to be honest, I have not read any of Grisham's more recent books. I have tried, but put them aside after 50 or so pages because they were of no interest to me. This book, however, grabbed me from the beginning, much as his older books did.The characters of the basically unlikable Clay Carter and the mysterious Max Pace were wonderfully drawn and kept me reading to find out how Clay would eventually &quot;get his&quot;. From his beginning as a D.C. Public Defender to his millionaire status, the reader just KNEW that Clay had to fall. In this respect, the book was predictable but I still kept reading because of all the twists and turns. I never really liked Clay, but I wanted to know what happened to him.Unlike many of his older books, I did have to suspend belief several times in this book when something was not adequately described or when all the rules of logic were violated.A quick read that kept me near the edge of my seat."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I finished John Grisham's newest novel in one day. While I'm fully capable of doing this on a regular basis, it's been a while since I've killed a book in a day. It's been even longer since a Grisham novel has been interesting enough to do so. This one was. The basic story has the protagonist starting as a public defender investigating a murder case. In the middle of the investigation, he meets a man who hands him a class action lawsuit to take care of. The man gives his name, but not that of his company. While the lawsuit is legitimate, the manner of acquiring this case and being assured of winning the settlement is a little shady. Our protagonist accepts and wins, and becomes rich. He is handed another class action lawsuit, a bigger one. This one he must do the work to get the clients, but the evidence is handed to him. He hits the jackpot with a 100 Million Dollar payday. He is dubbed the King of Torts. As time goes on and he continues to push for more money and bigger case, we see our protagonist go from being the perfectly honest public defender to being a typical, greedy lawyer. Until very close to the end, there is no true conflict in the story, it is driven instead by the character of the protagonist (his name really isn't important). Near the end, the legal issues of what the Protagonist has been doing finally comes into play.I'm not going to claim this is one of Grisham's best novels, because it doesn't measure up to his early work (everything is on the surface in this novel, there is no real depth). However, this is his most entertaining book in years, probably since the Testament. Grisham seems to be giving us the highly entertaining books spaced out between much weaker novels. Hopefully the next book will be as entertaining as this one and have the depth of the earlier works."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"National news coverage of the doctors' campaign against tort reform is just beginning. Grisham shows a side of the tort battle where attorneys wage war against pharmaceutical companies. Since neither (attorneys or pharmaceutical companies) can escape public scorn, it feels a little like the bad guys fighting the bad guys. So, it's a stretch to determine who you want to win!Grisham has an anti-hero, Clay Carver, in the role of legal eagle this time. We're supposed to believe that he's spent the better part of the last 4 years as a public defender, and in a relationship with a wealthy young woman whose parents are social climbers. You really can't get any passion out of his role in the Public Defender's office, nor out of his relationship. All this changes when he is offered the money of a lifetime ($15 million) to quietly settle as yet unknown claims of those who have suffered due to a risky drug. The offer comes from Max Pace - a shady character who plays \\"fireman\\" for a drug company and has access to all sorts of information unknown to the public. Shades of \\"The Firm\\"!Given that Clay realizes very early on the problems associated with this much money, and sees a demonstration of how successful tort lawyers spend and spend and never achieve what they seek in life, you would think he would not fall into that trap. But Grisham pushes him in with his eyes closed - even having him buy a Caribbean villa for his expensive mistress (with whom he has nothing in common) and a jet plane.Clay's friends from the OPD that join him in the new work do what we expect HIM to do -- take the early money and run. But he justs keeps his head in the sand and continues to burrow in, deeper and deeper.Thankfully, as in most Grisham novels, this does not go on for very long, as the book is brief, and the ending is predictable.I gave the book three stars, which is a star generous, because it held my interest, despite lack of plot and characterization. Grisham's ploy of using fiction to make a political statement about issues affecting the legal profession is always entertaining.But if I were you, I'd wait for the paperback!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Uninspired,Predictable. Probably written during commercial breaks of Law and Order (the commercials are better than this book) Seemingly well past his prime, The Runaway Jury and The Partner were Grisham's last decent efforts. The Summons,The Testament,The Brethren have all been weak. I'm through with Grisham, until Multiple reviewers convince me otherwise well after his next release. If you've never read Grisham please do yourself a favor and read A Time to Kill,The Firm,The Pelican Brief,The Client."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Lately, John Grisham's books have been pretty bad. Skipping Christmas, A Painted House, The Brethren and The Summons were very forgettable. The King of Torts is different. It is a rags to riches story in which you can't help cheering for the protagonist, Clay Carter. As the novel begins Clay is stuck in a dead-end job as a public defender. In a hard to believe plot leap, Clay is contacted by a &quot;fireman,&quot; Max Pace who gives him the opportunity to make millions of dollars. Clay gleefully accepts this opportunity and is soon a hotshot multimillionaire with a private jet, house on St. Barts, Porsche and bimbo girlfriend. But of course, this couldn't last... The King of Torts seems to me as an illustration of the contmpt in which Grisham holds the profession of mass tort lawyers. It's a quick, great read that will be sure to please fans of Grisham's and also those just looking for a thrilling read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Although I haven't finished reading the book yet, it certainly is not my favorite Grisham novel. His other books have been real page-turners, keeping me enthralled throughout. In this one, the main character (Clay Carter) is not very appealing, especially because he seems to be very shallow and egocentric (so far). The plot still hasn't gripped me (not like The Rainmaker or The Summons - couldn't put those down!) After checking the other reviews, I can see that many others feel the same way. No wonder I keep getting distracted. . . ."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is an excellent book. It was very realistic and believable. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts is not your typical Grisham legal thriller.Sure there is some courtroom drama and some legal maneuverings, but mostly this is a story of about how money corrupts. The result: 'action' and 'thrills' take a back seat to airplane lust and office procedures. It's not a bad trade-off mind you, but if you're looking for a story that dazzles you with lawyerly antics, courtroom posturing and legal/police procedures you're not going to find it here.The downside is that the hero is not someone most people will like (let alone relate to) as he makes his money by suing, with the intent of settling, major corporations, and his rise and, inevitable, fall is somewhat predictable. The only bit of guesswork is what, if any, epiphany the main character will have after the dust settles.All in all, The King of Torts was not a bad read. It did, afterall, provide some insights into the way class-action lawsuits are contemplated (from both the attorney's and corporation's perspetive). But, ultimately, hanging out with vultures for 300 pages leaves one feeling dirty and ready to move on something a bit more enticing.TKOT is worth a read for Grisham fans, but for others you might want to skip this one."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read many Grisham novels, some good The Client, some very bad The Firm, but this is by far the best book he has written. It's pace is fast and it had me almost laughing out loud at certain points! I recommend that everyone read this Grisham book before any of his others!! The character descriptions and circumstances were very visual and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Mass tort lawyers are the men who win billion-dollar class-action settlements from corporations selling bad products, then rake fantastic fees off the top, with far smaller payouts going to the people harmed by the products. Clay Carter is a burning-out lawyer at the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) in Washington, D.C., when he catches the case of a teen who, for no apparent reason, has gunned down an acquaintance. Clay is approached by a mysterious stranger, who says he represents a megacorporation whose bad drug caused the teen--and others--to kill. Thus begins the life of a tort lawyer.

It is just like a bitter-sweet dream."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This was the first Grisham book I ever read - amazing since I am in Law School and many of my classmates never shut up about him. I read this with the goal of summarizing it for a Prof. But surprisingly found myself enjoying it despite numerous legal flaws. Its the story of a poor criminal lawyer who is defending a man who killed another for no apparent reason. Enter the mysterious stranger who lets our hero in on a little secret - that a drug caused this reaction and there is a need to settle quickly and quietly... As a reward our \\"hero\\" is given a large civil class action claim against a rival drug company and the $100 million in contingency fees givers birth to the appellation The King of Torts... Then things don't go as plan for our new monarch. I read this in a few short hours and would say that it was on par with a typical movie. Nothing too brilliant but a good way to pass the time. Pick up a copy at the second hand store if you see it for a few bucks.Relic113"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Starts out good. Gets really slow in the middle. Predictable ending.

I'd probably givethat nod to &quot;The Firm&quot;, his first seller.That being said, its an enjoyable little yarn: young lawyerturns to the &quot;dark side&quot; of the law, learns a valuable lessonabout life, finds redemption in the end. You could almostterm it an &quot;After Law School Special&quot;. The story drawsthe reader in thoroughly, but it lacks the suspense ofthe real physical danger suffered by the hero in &quot;TheFirm&quot;, for instance. (There is some violence in thebook; I half suspect Grisham included it to prevent thehero with more that financial danger.)It is undoubtedly, though, a book with a message, and thatmessage is &quot;mass class action suits are a Very Bad Thing&quot;.The book pulls no punches it making the lawyer who getvery rich filing such legal actions look extraordinarilysleazy -- they're almost parodies of the &quot;flaunt your wealth&quot;rich.To be fair, Grisham does not call for massive reform ofthe entire civil justice system; he goes out of his wayto make it clear that there are people with legitimatereasons to sue and get large settlements. Of course, thesepeople end up harmed by being part of the class actionsuits.I tend to agree with Grisham on his points, but I preferto save my sermons for Sunday morning."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":".. and realizing you don't have as much in common as you thought.I DO love Grisham's books - fast-paced, suspenseful, rooting-for-the-underdog types of stories that hook you in and dare you to put them down. This, however, wasn't one of those stories for me.Don't get me wrong - all of the elements are here. But they just didn't work for me in this book the way they have in the past. Perhaps the biggest problem is that the 'underdog' in this story goes from principled, appropriately-struggling lawyer in public service to private practice ...in the space of about 10 pages. Morals vanish, clients are sold down the river, and money starts flying to such an extreme that it's almost difficult to read.I guess the one thing I've always liked about Grisham's books is that no matter what the temptation, his main characters have stayed above the board, but in this book, he goes south with the first check in hand.Perhaps the that's the whole point? While many have said that this is a scathing indictment of the tort / class action climate of today, it was more an indictment (in my mind) of personal morality and its fragility when money is involved."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I believe if Grisham wrote a book on the proper way to hold your fork while eating, that it would go to the top of the bestseller list. I for one do not understand it. Grisham uses his public popularity to not only put his political views on display (like Tom Clancy), but also his morality views. If the writing were of a higher quality I might see how his books go to #1, but his last 4 (exculding Skipping Christmas) were dogs. I mean if an unknown author took this stuff to a publisher there is no way it would ever get put in print. Anyway The King of Torts lacked suspense, believeability, and was a bore to read. I am glad I borrowed it."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As a legal story, I found King of Torts to be a fairly interesting read. I am not an attorney and have never been involved in a class action suit, so this latest addition to the Grisham legal series was pretty enjoyable for me.If this book is truly reflective of the class action law, I have to say that I was most struck by how minimal the level of genuine concern seems for the interests of the client on the part of many attorneys. After reading King of Torts, my conclusion would be, perhaps wrongly,, that attorneys serve their own interests for noteriety and financial gain far before they demonstrate authentic concern for the wrongs that have been done to their clients. And, if that's the case, there is surely something wrong with our legal system.I have read all of John's Grisham's books and liked them. They are usually a quick read and a good diversion. However, I have never thought they were brilliant, or great literature. Sometimes I think we are subjected to too much marketing hype about an author's next book and that often negatively colors our ultimate reaction to the actual book when it is finally published. John Grisham seems to be an author who is held to high -- if not impossible -- standards and expectations.They are decent stories, popular with many, but there seems to be quite a bit of over-expectation on how good we seem to want every one of Grisham's book, and then we hear about folks being disappointed by the book. Let's face it, some writer's stories are truly excellent, other stories are merely passable, and even good writers somethings turn out material that just isn't their best effort. And with John Grisham's works, we have been exposed to the good, the fair and the poor.Overall, I found King of Torts to be an engaging story with good characters and a writing style that allowed me to follow a legal speciality I am unfamiliar with pretty easily. Maybe I am one of the few, but I liked it!James J. MaloneySaint Paul, Minnesota USA"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Another two day read from Grisham that kept me up way too late wanting to get the whole story in.This is a good tale of rags-to-riches-to-rags; of legal abuse and using the system; of good boy goes bad.The main character toils on public service to indigent cases in need of protection and then eats the forbidden fruit on his way to wealth. Along the way, money clouds his judgement and his motives. I found myself both pulling for him to come out good in the end and to get what was coming to him for abusing the judicial system. In the end, he gets a little of both; something he wants and something he had.If you like Grisham, you'll enjoy Torts. It might not be his best...but it's better than most."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is a \\"rags to riches\\" story centered around Clay Carter an attorney in the Washington D.C. Office of Public Defender (OPD) who seemingly has no bright future as a lawyer. Suddenly, and almost unrealistically (but this is just a fictional story) he is established with his own law firm in first class offices and given, for starters, one extremely profitable case. This is a case in which a drug company has put a drug on the market with a very dangerous side effect in some instances, which impacts not only the person for which the drug is prescribed. As the story proceeds we are exposed to the process of accomplishing settlements of potential class-action lawsuits with large attorney fees and sometimes less than fair treatment of plaintiffs. We also find that at least in fictional characters there is a great deal of greed lurking in the law profession.Clay is romantically involved from the beginning with Rebecca, daughter of wealthy social climbing parents in D.C. Of course the parents aren't pleased with the OPD career of the potential son-in-law, and this helps the romance to go sour.I found this to be one of the most interesting of the author's novels."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I read through this whole book waiting for it to get good... it never did! I thought there was going to be some twist that made all of the foolishness worthwhile -- there wasn't! Obviously this was a cheap grab by the publisher and author to cash in before the Grisham franchise goes away completely. Bah!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have been a fan of Mr. Grisham since his first novel. But this one was not worth reading. The characters are one dimensional (not even good enough to be called two dimensional) the story in flat and uninspired. There is VERY little dialog beween the characters, rather most of the story is written in the third person. I was surprised that the price had a...discount sticker on it when I bought it. Now, I know why and it was overpriced even with the discount!!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you don't know how this is going to end half way through the book, you might want to get your head examined. While it's an interesting premise, the ups, downs and ending are very obvious from early in the book.This book isn't about a single case, it's about a series of them. None gets developed well enough to keep you interested.Overall, a poor showing."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Every time I finish a Grisham novel, I swear that I will never read another one. But later, in a moment of weakness while browsing an airport gift shop for a light read during the flight or flipping through a copy of his latest paperback that has been strategically placed with the other impulse items in the checkout line at the grocery store, I will pick up another.Like all of Grisham's novels, this was an enjoyable enough read, although painfully familiar and predictable to anybody who has read 3 or 4 of his other legal thrillers. However, I found this one to be one of his weaker novels. I found the main character, one Clay Carter, to be very unbelievable. Whether he was running his very lucrative, $100 million dollar law firm almost solely on basis of the vague tips received from mysterious stranger that he knows very little about or was short selling 100,000 shares of a pharmaceutical company on the eve of his firm's filing a class action lawsuit against that company - after instructing his accountant to be very conservative with the books (&quot;No sense trying to beat the government out of a some taxes. Pay them and sleep well&quot;) only four pages earlier, I had a hard time taking this character seriously. (What was more infuriating than the inconsistency regarding the insider trading incident was the fact that it didn't occur to Mr. Carter that there was anything illegal about the trade until about 200 pages later in the novel, and even then, he concluded that it was probably 'a gray area' - I guess Mr. Carter slept through those securities law courses at Georgetown Law School.)But more than that, when I finished this book, I was left feeling less than satisfied. Mr. Grisham is usually very good about tying off all of the loose ends and packaging his endings with a nice moralistic bow. Unfortunately, he doesn't do so with this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Oh no...this is surly not the great John Grisham who wrote this book. Come on. What is going on here. This book is full of trash. Aint written by the Grisham who wrote The Client. Dont waste your money folks."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I normally love John Grisham's books but I'm having a hard time with this one. I am more than 1/2 way through &amp; it's killing me to continue reading it. It's very boring and that is highly unusual for Grisham's work. Unfortunately for me, I am the type of person who HAS to finish a book...no matter how good (or bad) it is. Please let the misery end!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"There's an old line in morality. I'm not certain where it comes from although aspects of it are several hundred if not a thousand years old. It goes like this: \\"If a man or woman has integrity, nothing else matters. If a man or woman lacks integrity . . . nothing else matters.\\"So we find Clay Carter, a disgruntled burned out lawyer, given a chance to sell his soull. How much is it worth? How much can you sell integrity for, Grisham ponders?Clay Carter sells his soul for 10 million dollars, and eventually comes to regret it.Like characters in some of James Crumley's novels, you don't really care for anyone in the book. All of them, father, son, friends, associates, enemies, all are cloaked in varying degrees of despicability. All are tainted by greed, and that his friends who profited so greatly by Carter's greed return a portion of their gold to Carter to soften his eventual fall from grace, or the return of his true love, Rebecca, you still don't like any of them. At least I didn't. Like the lovely sirens in myth singing seamen to watery graves, Clays meteoric rise to wealth is surpassed equally by his meteoric fall.Grisham paints a dreary picture of the moral ambivalence of the legal profession, but unlike his characters in The Firm and Pelican, none rise above their greed. Clay is corrupted by his greed and in turn corrupts his friends. If you listen closely you'll hear Pink Floyd's chorus, 'money, money, money, money.'It's a good story and shouldn't be ignored. Mr. Grisham may be getting truly cynical however because while there was always a 'one good lawyer' character in his earlier works, we are really left with Grisham's indictment, there may be 'no good lawyers.'I hope that's not true. At least one would like to believe it isn't true. If there is a weakness in the book, it is simultaneously a long, long walk to get across the street while at the same time the climax lacks any real retribution. Living the rest of your life in London with the girl of your dreams surrounded by great theater and tremendous Rugby sure beats the heck out of five years in prison.Maybe 100 pages shorter would have made it less of an effort. It was pretty clear when it took the first 100 pages to get to the issues that it wasn't going anywhere fast. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"What is good about the book: the information it gives on all the players involved in mass tort legislation -- defendants, litigants, and the attorneys. If Grisham's goal was to reduce the likelihood of people signing on with frivolous mass torts, he convinced me; I have received solicitations to join in on three different mas torts in the past few months, and now refuse to do anything to help those attorneys and their ilk make a fortune while making a mountain out of a molehill.However, I think Aesop's story of greed was more effective, succinct, and interesting. As far as entertainment goes, this book is a loser. I kept waiting for the plot to thicken, and it never happened. I think Grisham is riding on his own coattails."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you would like to read this book, don't buy it....borrow it from a friend.I gave it 2 stars because I learned quite a lot about class action suits. However, other than that it is not worth it.Major problem: No character development, and most notably for the main character, although others in the book are just as badly developed, or should I say not developed at all.I would not say this is one of Grisham's best...but I would definitely say it's one of his worst."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I knew next to nothing about how the tort system works in this country, let alone how runaway class-action lawsuits are carried out, but this book educated me about both. Now whenever I hear about a class-action I will wonder about who's really behind it and who's making the money and whether or not the clients are actually being well served. I thought the plot was very interesting and seemed like something that could be going on right now in the real world. Clay was a very human character, with both attractive qualities that made me cheer for him and foibles that had me hoping for him to be knocked down a peg or two. That is unusual for me, so I thank Grisham for such a complex protagonist. So the ending isn't a stunner - no realistic ending could have been. It just told what likely could happen to a lawyer who had behaved as Clay did, which is never going to be happy. If Grisham has ever taught you something about the law in the past, let him do it again with this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham is such a great story-teller; and while other reviewers may carp about details, I guarantee you won't want to put this novel down until you've read the last page! I found it more interesting and well-written than any of the past dozen or so best sellers I've read recently."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"\\"King of Torts\\" is an easy read! The plot is fairly predictable, actually very predictable. This novel reminds me of a horse-race; whereby, the novel is quick out of the gates but falls short of full-speed-ahead at the finality. Grisholm is remarkable at capturing the reader's attention with subterfuge and an enticing plot.The main characters are fully developed and the story will keep you engaged to the end. Moreover, the end was too predictable, so one-star short of Five-r.An enjoyable and easy read, but don't expect too much deviation from the basic plot. Worth the read, since it's quick."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham goes on for who knows how many pages telling us that this dude is the king of torts, but anyone who's familiar with the academic literature on tort law knows this is a lie. What's even more annoying is that Grisham lacks the courage to argue straighforwardly that this guy is the king of torts; rather, he puts his weak argument in novel form, thereby using a gimmick of medium to obfuscate his fallacious message. That said, I think Grisham should win the National Book Award this year, on the condition that he accept his award naked, save for a Santa hat."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"GOOD STORY BUT NOT ONE OF GRISHAMS BEST."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book is the first one that is difficult to me to review it, is a book that will keep you reading, but is not a real good book, is a book that doesn't goes out of the story but sometimes is a little bit boring, is a book that it really has three separate stories that at the end the last one join to the first story, it has a love story that it isn't a love story but it ends like Cinderella, I really don't know what to say, I can't tell you that this book is a waste of time but I can't recommend to you as a good book, but you will have to read it to understand me.I am not a lawyer so I don't know if that end is possible or not. But even if you are a lawyer you have to take care of the sues you make, your work could be against you."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Usually a prolific writer like Grisham gets a bit stale if he is not up to standards that he as set for him/herself in previous novels. But, in this particular novel, Grisham sets a new level for ingenuity and complexity in plot and character development.Other reviews have mentioned the strange plot and design of the novel which will hold the reader in thrall. I suggest that if the artist keeps up with the branching out into new areas that are in this book, he will never disappoint. Excellent look into what is wrong with the profession today and how to correctit."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham had become a disappointment to me, until \\"The King of Torts\\". Still not as good as his earlier works - I wonder what has happened to him - but better than his last few. Of course, he is still writing the same basic premise - lawyer who goes up against the \\"big guys\\" - but all in all this one hopefully shows he's coming out of the rut in which he seems to have been stuck lately. I've been a fan since \\"A Time to Kill\\" which I still consider his best, and will continue to read, hoping for one as good as that."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham's \\"King of Torts\\" seems to premise the same as his predecessor novels: When the movie version appears, it will be a vast improvement over this half-vast fin de si&egrave;cle roman-flueve roman a clef novella. This tort feasor is the latest prurient excruience from Grisham's less than mighty pen.As many have noted, Grisham takes up a current topic, in this case the Class Action law suit, and builds an autobiographical less than tour de force to teach the ignorant masses that which passes all understanding.Barely disguised in this novella, are the phen-fen, thalidomide, and other drug histories caused by greed, need, and speed to finish the novel within his contracted for 372 pages. Race Horse Haynes must be amuzized by Grisham's portrayal.The plot starts out with a nice premise: a new drug to replace 12-Step pogams for the addicted works as claimed: it makes the hopeless clean and sober within a respectable period of time. But with a flaw, a small percentage of its users become homicidal because of its side effects. Grisham's distaste for those addicted, particularly those of African American ethnicity seeps through like mold under a wet carpet.From there, the young burnt out antihero becomes morally filthy, as well as filthy wealthy, and like a modern Candide, his descent into legal torment without any scruples leads us to a Dante Paradisio.So, with all this, the reader is the true hero of each and every Grisham work: the true hero is the person, like this Hon. reviewer, who reads the book to its diminished ending. Abandon hope all ye who enter Grisham's incompleteness, wait for the movie, and rent it from Blockbuster."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've read a bunch of Grisham's novel, not all of them, and this was ok. I found the story line to be rather interesting and learned a lot how the tort system works. Yet, my main problem with this book is that Grisham seemed to start a dilemma with the main character and then it was quickly resolved and onto a new problem. I felt a lot of this book was rushed and it could have gotten into more detail. I also noticed that many of his newer works seem to to be almost exactly the same length in pages. I am wondering if he has to meet a page limit and a lot gets cut out of the finished product.Overall I think this was a decent work but still doesn't live up to his very early works. Also, after reading the Summons, a lot of the info regarding torts was discussed in The Summons and it seemed like a copy and paste job was done."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've read all of his books, but like most, once finished they go out of the mind. This is no different, but I found it to be very interesting and informative. It's kept me turning the pages."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I will admit that the manner in which the prime character in this book enters the realm of \\"The Kings of Torts\\" is a bit bizarre. However, once there, this book really takes off and tells it like it is. I have been involved in the type of litigation portrayed in the book and there is much more fact than fiction in the telling of how this type of litigation is handled and the forces that drive the results. It is not a pretty picture and while the book gets melodramatic in places, it does give people a glimpse of what goes on in this type of lawsuit and what drives the participants. I found this to be an interesting read and worthy of recommending."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you are looking for a good beach book, &quot;The King of Torts&quot; is on the mark. It is light, fluffy, entertaining and will hook you very quickly. It is also a quick read. Unfortunately, it is not up to the high standards that Grisham has set with his earlier books. I wasn' t sure whether to love or hate the main character, Clay Carter. It was hard to believe that after having such high work standards and low need requirements, that Carter would be so stupid as to get roped into such questionable schemes. I thought the ending was especially weak. Still, it was an eye opener into the world of sleaze-ball tort lawyers and I now understand why tort reform is such a hot topic with politicians."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"We've read every Grisham offering, including his two non-legal thrillers, and find most of his novels to be good or great, a couple just so-so. For the first time, we'd rate this one at the bottom of the barrel. It has virtually no plot: a down-trodden public defender falls for a get-rich-quick scheme involving settling a few cases with some murder victims (due to bad drugs), for which our hero, Clay Carter earns like $15 million. Getting the hang of mass tort class action suits, Carter scores a second time, nabbing some $100M in fees! Soon he's living at a $1-2 million per month {!!} pace, complete with Porsche, hired model-bimbo, villa in the Caribbean, private jet, etc. His efforts to land a third big score suddenly fail, then his second case starts to backfire, and by the end of the book, which just goes away with little fanfare, he's declaring bankruptcy and going away to hide.Grisham does manage to generate a little suspense with the two or three big middle cases, but when the last big one fails, he doesn't even share with us readers a shard of logic to explain it, leaving us not merely feeling hollow, but feeling cheated by all the time we spent reading this junque. The point of the whole book eludes us, unless it's really just an attack against tort lawyers -- a group easy to hate based on the goings-on herein.Speaking of money, we probably don't want to know what Grisham earned for this outing, but in some minds, he seems as guilty of cheating as his hero inside the covers. Don't \\"Skip Christmas\\" -- SKIP THIS!!!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've heard a lot of people refer to Grisham's latest as \\"formulaic\\" or \\"not good story telling.\\" I must respectfully disagree, as I found it an immensely satisfying piece of story telling. What it is, is a good old-fashioned morality play dressed up in modern raiment.We meet young Clay Carter when he is an over-worked and quickly burning out Public Defender, poor and going nowhere fast. Enter a mysterious figure named Max Pace who gives Clay confidential information not only relevant to Tequila Watson's murder case but guaranteed to make Clay a lot of money in the private sector. The information has to do with a giant drug company and a bad drug and, from there, the race is on to sign up injured clients and rake in the dollars. Young Clay takes the money and runs, sacrificing Tequila Watson to the system. Once he resigns from the Public Defender's Office, he opens his own lavish firm and hires a crack staff at fantastic salaries. And why not, since the money seems to be coming from bottomless coffers?But remember, what goes up must come down, and Clay's downward spiral is a painful spectacle. Still, Clay's redemption is a beautiful thing to see. There is a life lesson here for us all, not just for young lawyers."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I started reading Mr. Grisham's books when they first came out and enjoyed them. I was happy that a new author had arrived. Gradually, however, I noticed the plots getting slimmer and slimmer and even skipped a few of his books. I went back to reading him with A Painted House and enjoyed it very much. The King of Torts was my next choice and I feel taken advantage of by this trite, cynical novel. I did not like his derogatory references to fat people and &quot;bimbos&quot;. I realize he was trying to speak for the main character but when it isn't dialogue it frequently is taken for the author's views."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book does nothing to engage the reader.

I did find it interesting that this protagonist is a victim of the wealth that he hasn't really earned -- Does Grisham feel the same way? Does he feel guilty making so much money for a story that is so poorly told? None of the characters are engaging, interesting or complex. Please give me some ambiguity! And some description of what the character looks like! Minor tags attached to characters do not make them less cartoonish. Such a disappointment. It devolves into a catalogue of rich men's toys.

When things go wrong I always buy the next one anyway because I know how good he CAN be.King of the Torts might break this spell. Grisham commits the cardinal sin of utter, unbelievable predictability (What???!!! He loses it all??? his accountant was right all along???? But his girl comes back to him anyway??? And he realises the folly of greed???? Wow!!!!)plus a final third of the book that seems to indicate that the author's wife insisted that he finished it NOW because she wanted to go out with him to buy a new Gulfstream, Porsche or something similar. Seldom has there been a weaker trail-off to an initially powerful and convincing base.I started this book carrying it around the house to grab every second I could to read it.....in the end only a long ferry trip from France to England with no alternative persuaded me to bother with the last section. I had promised to lend it to my French-based daughter but have emailed her to say it's not worth the postage.I used to read John Grisham (along with Ken Follet and Frederick Forsythe) as I still listen to Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road, Born to Run and The Rising...as if my life depended on it.

Then he loses all of his money. That is pretty much the entire story line. Sprinkeled into this is Clay's desire to rekindle his old relationship with his now ex Rebecca and his hatred for her parents. She shows up about 30 pages from the end of the book and they are back together. This does nothing to add to the plot.I found myself hoping that Clay would get tied up in a court battle for his insider trading which would have set up a good courtroom drama for Grisham to write to.I don't know if Grisham has lost it, or his editors tore his original apart and ended up with this sorry novel. Regardless, I will hesitate with Grisham's next effort appears on the bookstore shelf."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts is one of the better Grisham books, a classic tale of a young lawyer torn between money, love, and ethics, with a rich supporting cast. One of the characters, Patton French, was pre-viewed in The Summons, but he was great there and even better here.Clay Carter is a poorly paid, unappreciated OPD attorney with a fugitive-lawyer father turned fishing captain-drunk and a fiancee with meddling parents that he can't stand. One day, a fireman appears and offers him a chance to convert stolen documents and insider information into a small fortune. Clay accepts this assignment, and then builds a mass tort empire and a fortune, based on other assignments brought to him by this very shadowy character.Ultimately, Clay both wins and loses some big cases, involving hundreds of millions in class action settlements. Like a dot-commer, Clay does not know when to take his chips off the table, and keeps on betting all or nothing. In this high stakes game, a lawsuit to which Clay is not a party, decided while he is in the hospital, ultimately is the event which determines who will win and who will be bankrupt. He also realizes very late in the game, that he is only a pawn in a larger game being played by some of the pharmaceutical companies that he has been suing.Clay has also chosen to move on from his long-time girlfriend, trading her in for a Georgian model. This does not seem to be a decision Clay or Rebecca can live with, even though the long-time girlfriend suddenly marries another. Clay and the model make a cameo appearance at the wedding, and we know that this marriage will not be long-standing."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I'll say this for \\"The King of Torts\\" - it isn't as bad as \\"The Brethren.\\" That being said, John Grisham's latest legal thriller still feels like he left it unfinished and put his name on it to get an automatic best-seller.Clay Carter, the hero (?) of our story, is an overworked and underpaid drone in the District of Columbia public defender's office. His girlfriend's snooty parents can't stand him and he is happy but broke in his job, with his latest client a man who for no apparent reason walked up to a junkie and shot him. But then a mysterious man walks into his life and waves money in his face to leave his job and become a tort lawyer. Taken under the wing of tort lawyer extraordinare Patton French, a bit player remaindered from Grisham's earlier book, \\"The Summons,\\" Clay is introduced into a world where money is everything, the clients be damned.The book's ad copy reads: \\"As he digs into the background of his client, Clay stumbles on a conspiracy too horrible to believe. He suddenly finds himself in the middle of a complex case against one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, looking at the kind of enormous settlement that would totally change his life - that would make him, almost overnight, the legal profession's newest king of torts.\\" Sounds exciting, no? Unfortunately, once the conspiracy is over and done with - only about halfway through the book - Grisham abruptly moves on to the moral high-horse section in which we see how Clay's newfound wealth ruins his life.\\"The King of Torts\\" is marred by Grisham's palpable loathing for his subject, as well as an awkward romantic subplot between Clay and his ex-girlfriend. As with more than one of his recent books, including \\"The Brethren\\" and \\"The Testament,\\" the book has an unsettlingly incomplete feel to it, as we never learn what happens to one of the major characters. As such, the book offers gleeful voyeurism into the old adage as to how the love of money is the root of all evil, while leaving this reader ultimately disappointed.It's time for John Grisham to take a sabbatical. If nothing else, he needs to re-learn how to end his novels."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The same book by any other author's name might have never made it to the bookstores. It is implausible, lacks depth both in terms of characters and plot and is, above all, sloppy. It gives the impression of a job half-done to meet a deadline. Although it reads easily there is an empty aftertaste and a question &quot;what was that about&quot;. I think Grisham should choose another nom de plume and start over again as his name is slowly becoming a liability."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Not since The Firm had I torn through a Grisham book like I did with KOT and yet I finished feeling unsatisfied. There is no doubt that J.G. is the King of page turning action; however, one small plot twist at the end does not keep this book from being predictable.Would I have been excited about King of Torts as I was about The Firm, Pelican Brief or A Time to Kill if I had read this first, I think I would have. We have been spoiled by the freshness of his earlier books and let's be honest, his latest works have been of the same quality yet are no longer fresh. It's tough for Grisham to surprise us anymore because of the number of books he has written and how he has trained his readers to truly expect the \\"unbelievable,\\" the \\"unexpected,\\" and the customary trip to the Caribbean-do you think he has to travel there for background information all the time, must be nice!Is it just me or is Grisham just a little more didactic in this tome than in his previous works? I think he did an excellent job with the main character and you could see the greed and ethical conflict boiling below the surface (like father, like son) as J. Clay Carter II decided to plunge into the depths of mass tort law. Grisham does paint a vivid picture of the slide from \\"doing good\\" to \\"doing well\\" and character development has always been this author's strength.In the end, this book is worth 4 or 5 hours of your time and even though you know where the book is going, you don't mind it when you know it is Grisham taking you there."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Seems as if people either loved or hated this one. I'm one of those who liked it a lot. It's not his best work, but i think it's in the top 4. It's great to see him focus on a law novel again, as opposed to a novel about a man who happens to be a lawyer (&quot;Summons&quot;). It hooked me from the beginning, and he does a good job of making Clay the hero, then the conflicted hero, then the villain, then the somewhat redeemed villain. &lt;SPOILER&gt;......It's also nice to see Grisham actually have some positive romantic results for the protagonist."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I love John Grisham and am very loyal to him. I did find this book to be not his best, however. It seems he &quot;rushed it&quot;, and the theme is not deeply moving, the characters are not easy to identify with.I always re-read John's books, and I will with this one too. I just felt he wasn't brilliant."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Having read all of Grisham's books, and saying I am a fan, I will say that this is definitely not his best work, but also not his worst (The Summons comes close to that!) However, I will say that Grisham writes in such a way that you cannot put the book down until you are finished (I finished this one in one day.)In regards to this particular book, I would not call it a legal thriller. Clay is never in danger of losing his life, only his license. I must say that there are very few characters in this book that I liked, only some of the peripheral ones. Clay starts off as a likable character, but once greed gets ahold of him he becomes another slimy lawyer, one who doesn't care about anything or anyone except how much money he can make, or how many toys or people he can buy. He doesn't even redeem himself in the end, only runs off with a married woman and declares bankruptcy so that all the people that he legitimatly owes money to can't collect.One thing this book does do (and I'm not sure if it's intentional) is that it very clearly shows how (most) lawyers are quite adept at breaking (or bending) the law to fit their own morals, and how they really don't give a hoot about their clients, only about how much money they can squeeze from them. In this story this is best demonstrated by how Clay and his cronies handle the Dyloft and the Cement Company cases. Ultimately what matters to the lawyers is not how much money the plaintiffs' get, or whether it is sufficient to cover their damages, but how large the lawyers' fees turn out to be.What did I like about the book? It's well written, and gave me an idea how these class action lawsuits work. The characters, while not particularly likable, are interesting. And it gives you a peek into a lifestyle which includes private jets and vacation homes in the Caribbean. So would I recommend this book to a friend? Maybe if their expectations weren't too high."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a good read, but this book had me pulling my hair out. I realize this is the kind of book one reads for pleasure, not education, but nonetheless it should have come with a warning label: \\"This book grossly misrepresents how class action law suits work -- in fact, it bears no resemblance whatsoever to anything that actually happens in class action litigation.\\" Even putting aside the glaring legal flaws (which is not an easy task), the characters were thin and forgettable, and the plot was non-existent. Is Grisham so creatively spent that he can't come up with a credible story line anymore? Has he become so disinterested in what his readers think that he doesn't even have to try to write something that rings true? Does he think we're all a bunch of morons? This wasn't a legal thriller. It was an illegal bore, and it's the last Grishman book I'm going to waste my time on. I thought Patricia Cornwell had taken the prize for Fastest Decline in Fiction Writing Skills, but it seems we have a new winner. Peee-yew. What a stinker."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Sometimes you read a non-fiction book that's so good that you're tempted to say it reads like a novel. This, unfortunately, is a novel that reads like a non-fiction book: One of the ones you had to plow through in your freshman year and promptly forgot after final exams.The putative protagonist in this book is Clay Carter; unfortunately Clay is not particularly likeable or even memorable. Clay is a lawyer stuck in a dead-end job when he meets a mysterious stranger who offers him riches beyond his wildest dreams. Carter goes from being a public defender to a flashy mass-tort lawyer in a matter of months, making an enormous fortune and spending it like he can't get rid of it fast enough. This is the part of the book that reads more like a textbook on how to become a successful tort lawyer; I was about two-thirds of the way through the book when I realized that I had not yet encountered a discernible plot.If the plot line was thin to non-existent, the characters were worse. Most Grisham novels glisten with quirky, sinister, or vibrantly memorable secondary characters. This one had none. There was not one character in King of Torts that was memorable in any way, with the possible exception of the loathsome tort attorney Patton French who takes Clay under his wing.Ultimately, the inevitable crash comes and Clay's tort empire collapses even faster than it erupted. The book becomes a morality play warning against the dangers of greed and excess.Grisham has written some memorable books in the past. The Testament is one of my favorite books, period, and such tomes as The Firm and The Rainmaker are well worth the price of purchase. But The King of Torts is definitely a book to take a pass on, at least until it shows up in the used bookstores as a half-price paperback."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"A few other reviewers here have made mention that they read Grisham because he is not too deep. Of course, this isn't exactly the nicest thing to say about a writer (I might not be too happy if someone said that about me) but it does hold some truth. Grisham's books, most of them at least, can be called light reading. Still, they are entertaining and no one really 'out-Grishams' Grisham.Unfortunately, this book is really not Grisham at his best. The premise of a public defender wanting to make the leap to a prestigious firm holds promise. I wanted to sympathize with this character, but couldn't. Something was missing here and it took me a bit of time to figure out what it was: character development. Grisham has done that well in his previous books.Listen, this book isn't bad, it just at times feels like a glossing over. There is plenty of opportunity for development, but it just never comes. Not the way I would like it, at least. The action is there, and it is obvious this book could be made into a decent movie, but aside from that, it just feels as though Grisham really doesn't want to do this stuff any more. He is done running through hoops.Buy this book if you are a fan. It will most likely fall in the low-middle of his books. Consider it a bit like The Rainmaker, or perahps The Summons, two books that I thought were decent but not particularly Grisham's strongest. If you have never read Grisham before, start with The Firm or The Client."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After making a brief foray into a new genre in \`Skipping Christmas' and \`The Painted House', Grisham returns to his home turf with the \`King of Torts' Yes, he is back to zillion dollar lawsuits and the men who file and fight them. Only here, there's a slight departure from his standard formula. There is no clear demarcation between the good and the bad guy. They blur into one. But having said that, it is only fair to say that the minor variation notwithstanding, the book remains a quintessential Grisham. In his disdain for money-making, mega law firms, legal malpractice, he retains his original flavor.The story takes an unexpected turn when the poorly-paid, savior-of-the-downtrodden, public prosecutor at the OPD, Clay Carter, falls prey to avarice and ambition. He abandons his rather hapless client, the victim of an experimental anti-addiction drug, resigns and sets up his own law firm. A relentless craving for power, money and recognition pushes him to take on the life on a mass tort litigator. He digs around for dirty laundry on big corporations, jumps at the first opportunity to sue them, arm-twists them into out-of-court settlements worth millions of dollars. But just when the champagne-caviar life is hits the zenith, a bunch of disgruntled clients, who feel they have received a raw deal, decide to go after the \`King of Torts' himself."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you like the classic Grisham thrillers - fast moving D.C. lawyers, mysterious wheeler-dealers, evil corporations, big buck settlements, plus a touch of romance and private jet trips to semi-exotic settings, this is the book for you. But unlike with \\"The Summons\\" a practiced reader can see the plot's conclusion coming from a distance. Grisham bogs down a bit while clipping his character's wings, preventing an all out bolt to the conclusion, and a violent event on the streets of D.C. leaves readers contemplating how conspiracy can be disguised as random violence, the theme with which the novel begins. Still, the violence touching central characters is less than in \\"Painted House;\\" although, Clay Carter's (the hero/anti hero lawyer)adversaries in their greed and self serving machinations are just as deadly as the knife wielding, head bashing characters of \\"Painted House.\\"The author creates a sympathetic lawyer, not surprising as Carter's colleagues embody the traits of popular lawyer jokes, but as I closed the book I had the feeling that not all of this club of high rolling tort lawyers could be such rogues, or if they are some of the corporate actions portrayed just might merit such behavior. All in all, a book worth the time, but heavy on poetic justice; Carter deserved to keep a bit more of the swag."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use. Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook. With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble. Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality. What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point. They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories.The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances. Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read many of John Grisham's novels and they all have two things in common: very weak character development and the fact the ending is always the same [to escape to a far away land!]. This novel is no different. It is a rather simplistic story of a young guy who gets corrupted by money and then crashes. That's it, that's your story... This is no &quot;thriller.&quot; There is no &quot;hidden conspiracy&quot; [what the back of the book suggests]. There is no &quot;suspense.&quot; There is also no real depth to any of the characters, or the story itself. It's all very typical Grisham simplistic stuff. Don't waste your time with Grisham. If you want a courtroom thriller read Reed's The Choice, Steve Martini's Compelling Evidence, or Irving's Trial. If you want to read a good author at creating suspense read Michael Crichton."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"In his latest novel, \\"The King of Torts,\\" John Grisham explores a topic that he has dealt with many times in the past. Can an individual be a successful lawyer and a moral individual? Or are the words \\"honest lawyer\\" paradoxical?Clay Carter is a bright young public defender in Washington, D. C., where he has worked for five years. He is thirty-one, burned out, underpaid and frustrated. Clay's girlfriend, Rebecca, loves him but her snooty parents loathe both Clay and the career path that he has chosen. They want Rebecca to dump Clay and find a better matrimonial prospect.Suddenly, Clay's career takes a weird turn. A murder case falls into his lap, and there are aspects of this investigation that simply do not add up. Soon, a mysterious stranger appears and convinces Clay that it would be in his best interests to quit the Public Defender's office and become a mass tort lawyer. His main job would be to collect the names of individuals who were harmed by pharmaceutical companies, sign these people up, and file class action suits on their behalf. Clay is seduced by the promise of fame and fortune, and he soon becomes \\"The King of Torts.\\" Can Clay keep his wits about him after he tastes the high life of private planes, yachts, beautiful women, and fancy real estate? Or is he selling his soul in the process of becoming wealthy and successful?Grisham's breezy writing style is pleasant and easy to take. The book moves forward at a fast pace and its theme about the downside of greed is certainly a timely one. However, the plot is a bit far-out and the ending is both heavy-handed and predictable. Unfortunately, \\"The King of Torts\\" is more a morality tale than it is a novel."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book was really very boring. I had read some Grisham books in the past and enjoyed them, but this time was different. I admit I was trying to read it in a foreign language. A fast-paced legal thriller would be the perfect book to try out in another language--exciting and not too difficult, while helping me review. However the book was not what I thought it would be; for one thing, it seemed to be at least 100 pages too long. It involves a lawyer, Clay Carter, who works to defend poor criminals in Washington, D.C. When a man kills for seemingly no reason and Clay takes his case the book is set up for something quite exciting...which never happens. In fact the whole rest of the book has almost nothing to do with the beginning. Clay has problems with his girlfriend and her snobby parents, and he hates his job. It seemed to go on and on about his so-called miserable life and even when things began to change for Clay the book still resembled a soap opera in some respects. I felt sorry for Clay, but he was not all that likeable--less so the further the book went on. If I hadn't been trying to accomplish reading this book for foreign language studies there's a good chance I wouldn't have finished it. Clay starts getting involved in the lives of very rich lawyers whose lifestyles (explained in great detail) are strangley not all that interesting. Part of the problem with the book was there was no great problem to be solved or at least fought against, as in most books. Clay, a number of times, easily acheives everything he wants (attending conferences and and vistiting rich lawyers on a yacht in the meantime), which makes for a boring book. It's more like a long parable about money and arrogance than it is a novel. The end is not really satisfying either. What ever happens to certain characters, and why is no one doing anything about them? Also, is the reader supposed to feel glad that one of the charcters is finally with their love, commiting adultery with someone who doesn't bother to dump their significant other (this person prefers to dump people in person the book tells us)? Furthermore, I couldn't figure out who the author wanted me to like and who I was supposed to dislike (and I'm still not sure). In the end, everyone has different opinions on what makes a good book, but in my opinion, even though this wasn't the worst thing I've ever read, it's just not worth the money. Grisham has better books more worth someone's time."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"In most surveys, lawyers are ranked right down there with used car salesmen, professional wrestlers and catfish. However, we all agree that sometimes companies, doctors, teachers, etc., should be sued. This book uses a fast-moving story (after the first 50 or so pages) to illustrate how a few unscrupulous lawyers skim money off the top of an otherwise reasonable system, with the primary beneficiaries only themselves. You won't be able to put it down.This is John Edwards in a book (it's where he made his money).Read it! You will thank John Grisham for bringing these practices into the light. Now, go do something about serious tort reform."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this audio book on CD. The reader has a wonderful voice and kept the story very interesting. I liked the story, couldn't wait to hear what happened next although it got pretty predictable. You won't go wrong with this CD.

Like most, this was not my first Grisham thriller and I remain a fan of his novels.I was pleasantly surprised by the King of Torts. The protagonist, Clay Carter, defies the easy to embrace and formulaic characters we were starting to see too often. His complex motivations and behaviors make for a interesting read that challenges the reader to consider their own ethical dilemmas.I'm not certain if it was by writing more in-depth character studies like A Painted House that caused this change but hopefully we can expect more of the same."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was intrigued by the book. Always good characters and lots of story-lines. Morals are laid out, people changed, money rules all. Even some flaky romance. Mr. Grisham doesn't let you down in this one.

Look forward to his next one."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I only regret having to give this book one star. It was awful. I've read all of Grisham's books, my favorite being A Time to Kill, and they're all fairly readable, nothing too taxing on the brain, you know, light stuff and that's ok sometimes. ...

If I read another Grisham, and I've read them all so far, it will definitely be the paper back version."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book was extremely disappointing.

There are also too many improbabilities and questiones left unanswered."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It's an interesting notion: follow a young lawyer's climb up the ladder of civil litigation and his subsequent fall. Too bad Grisham's Clay Carter merely coasts along.There are no stirring courtroom scenes: all the action takes place on cell phones between lawyers. There's no mystery during investigation. There's simply no investigation; a mysterious source provides everything he needs. Clay never questions the man's motives. He never questions the origin of his information. To be honest, he doesn't do much of anything. His career is handed to him, his demise mostly the result of unforseeable events. People come into his life, and most leave with barely a blip.Grisham scratches the potential of civil suits, but doesn't dig deep enough to shed much light on the topic. He implies dark secrets, but nobody bothers to search them out. This book isn't bad, just bland."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I think a lot of readers are missing what Grisham is up to. He is no longer interested in merely contriving a mystery, but in delving into the ambiguous nature of contemporary law and morality. In \\"King Of Torts\\" we find ourselves watching--and knowing it's coming--a human traffic accident. And it's never clear which side we're on, even at the end. Do we applaud the hero or condemn him? Would we want to sue a big corporation if we were injured by a faulty product? How much is it worth? Are greedy lawyers the enemy? Well, if they are, who else would represent us? It's not always easy to figure out American justice, but this is a fun way to learn about torts and [waste] a weekend at the same time."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I started reading this book and liked it very much.

Made Sense, 2. Was Believable 3. Made Your Heart Pound to the end (hint hint The Firm , A Time to Kill), and 4. Made you want to see a movie about it. Grisham's latest novels have followed a narrow path downward to mediocre writing. I bought King of Torts as soon as it hit shelves, i even had it signed by him because i am still a huge fan, but its honestly like he doesnt care about his writing anymore. His books will always hit #1, and there is nothing he has to do. Torts is a story about a average every day lawyer who just one day meets this guy who we never find much about and one thing leads to another and well all the sudden our everyday lawyer gets in the big time. Then the grisham effect happens and well you'll have to read to find out. The ONLY COOL THING about this book is the return of Tort lawyer Patton French from the last book The Summons. Im not sure, but i think this is the first time that he has ever brought back a character to a novel. All in all, its a good read, a long ways from his glory days, but still good. There is not intrigue, so you wont want to read it again, i promise you that. This book lacks any mystery, and the payoff..is..well..rather 11th hour type writing.

In addition, he provides an interesting tutorial on current tort law and all its inherent issues.In summary, if you are looking for a mindless piece of escapist entertainment, you probably can't go wrong reading this book.

I usually enjoy Grisham thoroughly for his fast-paced, interesting storylines, and I was excited to get this new release so quickly from the library. However, after the first 30 pages (which were quite good, namely because I was interested to learn more about Tequila), the book became a diatribe on mass tort. Grisham used the entire book to explain the technicalities of this type of law, and in an attempt to entertain his readers, he threw in a weak, utterly predictable storyline. The only characters who were slightly likeable barely make a dent in the story, and the annoying ones get too much attention. I kept hoping something interesting would happen, that a slight twist would make all the mass tort babble worth it, but the book ends just as you think it would.

Soon other cases and inside information follow and our young hero, now crowned \\"the king of torts\\", who is at first repulsed by the conspicuious consomption of other mass tort lawyers begins to wonder if he should by a jet or just lease one.Bottom line, dangle enough money in front of someone and watch their moral compass go completely off kilter.I kept waiting for something unexpected to happen but to no avail.In the end our young lawyer finally regains most of his senses just in time to loose almost everything while crashing and burning in spectacular fashion. Moral, too much money and power corrupt. Big Surprise!As I listened to this book, the only thought going through my mind was, these are hours of my life I am not getting back! What a waste!I have been a loyal Grisham fan since his first book A Time To Kill. I have even liked his non-legal books, but lately he has been slipping BADLY. To think I was so excited when I ordered this I could not wait for it to come, I should have waited.The next book Grisham puts out I am going to to borrow from the library."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As with his last several novels, this book reveals a John Grisham struggling to reinvent himself rather than simply retreading the legal thrillers that made him famous. My hat is off to him for the attempt. But literary novels require subtlety, and this one packs all the subtlety of a pie in the face, aimed at an easy target: the enormous legal fees attainable by the upper echelon of lucky litigators.It's the story of Clay Carver, a burned-out public defender who finds a not-completely-ethical means of striking it rich. Very rich. Clay shoves his qualms aside and suddenly finds himself ogling private jets and other upper-crust trappings he supposedly despises. Suspense derives from the question of whether Clay's fortunes will continue to rise or whether the entire thing will crash-and if so, how badly.The seduction of a young lawyer by riches is a common theme in Grisham's novels, and still a good one. Unfortunately, the author's fondness for the clockwork machinations of the law and lawyers, which serves him well in his thrillers, induces him to distance himself too much from his characters. Here, that's a fatal mistake. Clay could be interesting, but Grisham never allowed me to care about him, especially because the book is full of &quot;cringe&quot; moments in which Clay does something so terribly wrong-headed I had to close the book and think about something else before reading another chapter.And yet, somehow, Grisham kept me coming back. I can't quite figure out how, but that's why the book gets two stars rather than one. (I'd give it 2 1/2 if that were an option.) Also, as I watched Grisham decry the lure of lucre, I couldn't help but think about how much he himself has made on books and movies. Could Clay be a stand-in for an author who really wants to make better use of his massive bully pulpit? THAT would be in interesting story. Especially if Grisham ever learns subtlety. Because the man really does have something to say."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Can I give this book less than 1 star?I've been losing faith in John Grisham as an author for awhile, but have continued to buy his books because some of them (Runaway Jury) are great reads. The King of Torts, however, has convinced me not to waste my money anymore. The book has no character development, a plot that is 20 years past its prime, and no conclusion of any interest. The whole time I was reading the book, I kept waiting for something - anything! - of interest to happen. I was sorely disappointed.Grisham also lets his readers down by failing to do any research into the Washington, D.C. public defenders office (or any other public defenders office). As Grisham admits in his author's note, the &quot;OPD&quot; portrayed in the book is wholly fictionalized because Grisham was too lazy to do any real research or fact checking. If Grisham can't waste his time finding out what a real public defenders office is like, then why should we waste our time on his book?"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was excited to read this book because I have enjoyed all of John Grisham's previous novels. However, the novel disappointed me after the first couple of chapters.The story starts off in one direction (Clay Carter assigned to defend an apparently random murder case), but immediately changes tracks when a new character is plopped in without explanation or justification.Grisham begins a tangent with the new character (Max Pace) which ends up being the rest of the book. Storylines that were presented in the first few pages do not get wrapped up until the end, and even then, unsatisfactorily.Frequently throughout the novel, Grisham throws in random events or developments that do not fit well with the story and are not credible.I plugged through the novel, hoping for a reversal back to the original story (the one Grisham had started in the first 10 pages), but it never came. A big disappointment, if you're keen to read a novel by John Grisham, try one of his earlier ones."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I'm a John Grisham fan, but his latest legal thrillers have tended to be formulaic-you could pretty much figure the outcome. The King of Torts departs from his usual, small-guy-takes-on-the-system-and-flees-the-country story.In this, he sheds light on the dark side of the legal profession, with money-grubbing lawyers combing the marketplace for mass tort legislation. And they don't do it out of a sense of justice, they do it because the money is there.I had always had this beef with the tobacco legislation. Nobody wants kids to smoke, but the real truth is that in the end, the money goes to the lawyers. The same is with the attacks on the pharmaceutical companies and so forth. Watch, out Big Food!!Anyway, Grisham doesn't let lawyers or big companies off the hook and he further educates the common man on the inner workings of the legal system. I have learned more about the law reading Grisham than anything else.This is a great book and it doesn't have the usual ending or twist that he likes to include in his legal plots. It's original, witty, humorous, and drives home a poignant message.You'll enjoy this at the top of your stack of books, resting on your nightstand."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read ALL of Grisham's works -- even before he was well known. I usually like his storylines, but according to a National Public Radio interview, Grisham's wife is encouraging him to move his basic storyline away from the concept of \\"redemption.\\" I hope he doesn't (I need some redemption in my life). Since I heard the interview prior to completing his book, I sensed the ending - and I was correct. Yet, I don't think that people continue to read Grisham to get a surprise. People continue to read Grisham because he is a master of the written word. His words flow like a film and create pictures in one's mind. Thus, the interview didn't damage my reading of his novel.Without regard to the lack of a surprise ending, I immediately saw something extremely valuable in this novel. As a college professor, I teach a policy course. Policy courses are generally hated by students. One policy concept I try teach is: \\"letter of the law versus the spirit of the intent.\\" The central theme in the KING OF TORTS embraces this complex concept for which many of my students have difficulty in understanding. In an effort to have students understand, I offered a brief outline of the KINGS OF TORTS (without destroying the story) and recommended they read it. Here, tort lawyers comply with the letter of the law (perhaps some push the envelop a bit much), but it is clear that these lawyers do not embrace the spirit for which laws were designed to protect citizens against unscrupulous manufacturers. Now, students understand what is meant by \\"letter of the law versus the spirit of the intent\\" without having to be punished by a lecture from me or the extremely dry writing from our textbook.In the end, I like Grisham's writing and look forward to his next novel."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As in several Grisham book, there is a lawyer who really gets going on a case, then finds out there are is a big problem which forces the lawyer to reorganize his life and priorities, then sort of sulk away from law in dismay.I can't help but psychoanalyze Grisham after having read so many similar stories and I wonder if that was somehow his own law experiences finding their way into his work.As to this work specifically, it's good, movie-of-the-week Grisham style. You want to finish it and you'll get the next one, but you never want to read this one again.Give us something better next time. I wish there would be just one Grisham book that I would like to read again."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"While 'The Summons' holds the distinction of being John Grisham's worst book 'The King of Torts' seems to be quite a contender for the title. From its beginning until its final word, 'The Broker' is a disappointment for even a Grisham wannabe.The preposterous story begins in the traditional Grisham manner: a young lawyer is presented with an unbelieveable opportunity. From that point onward the book is predictable and bland. The solution to the poorly executed mystery is not only nonsensical, it is ridiculously far-fetched.It is difficult to select the specific parts of the book which are a disappointment as there are so many of them. Suffice it to say this book is disappointing and will be a difficult thing to read for even the most dedicated fan of Grisham. If you don't like this book, do yourself a favor and don't even think about reading 'The Summons'."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book chronicles a public defender who takes a leap to make a few more bucks. His moral compass is lost after the loss of his girlfriend (who I am not sure really deserved him anyways). The other characters in the story create the moral guide for the protagonist. However, due to his serious character flaws, he's is a little hard to root for. But then again, I think we all face some temptation in life. Do we let this one little rule slip so that we can gain? Do we take the job for more money, but that requires less ethics? Clay's struggle is one that we all face at some point although not nearly on his scale.This was overall a pretty good book with an ending which will make you think about what is important. It ends like most all of Grisham's books do. If you have read any of his other books, you know what I mean."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read many of Grisham's books, but this one was so bad. This could have been the most predictable books I have ever read. The main character starts off poor, gets rich, and then loses everything; however, the problem with the story is, you don't even care what happens to him. If I had access to any other books when I read this, I would have put it down so fast. Grisham hasn't written a good book since 'The Partner'."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"To be honest, I felt the need to purchase King of Torts after overhearing a co-worker boast of a excellent read. To say I was sadly mistaken is an understatement. Perhaps I have read one too many lawyer novels (or perhaps I am just bored with someone feeding me jargon and pretending its a book)lately but it seems like this book lost any meaning after the first chapter. Honestly, in the beginning I thought there would be a bigger investment in the whole drug mess. To be frank, the only reason I finished this book was a slim hope that the main character would actually redeem his morals. I mean the beginning of the book goes on about his detest of his girlfriend's parents lifestyle and his lack of care for it. By the end he is a bigger sell out with a plane to boot. Honestly, he shows no character nor character development... truely this is a waste of my time as I prefer books that actually challenge the reader.."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this Grisham novel. I have read most of his and usually expect a lot of suspense and tension towards the end. You could see this ending a mile away, so although it's not a bad story in itself, it certainly has a lot lacking."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"When John Grisham wrote The King of Torts, he explored an aspect of the American legal profession known as mass torts. The novel revolves around an overworked Public Defender named Jarrett Clay Carter II in the City of Washington, D.C. A strange turn in a case plunges Carter in the world of mass torts. Complications in his personal life arise as Carter makes wholesale changes in both his personal and professional life.Carter stumbled into the world of mass torts as he investigated his case from the OPD. Everyone has heard the advertisements on television, on the radio, or in the subway that are used to drum up litigants in mass-tort cases. This novel explores the business behind those advertisements.If you have read \\"The Summons\\" by John Grisham, you have already met the mass tort lawyer Patton French based near Biloxi, on the gulf coast of Mississippi. French, called the King of Torts in \\"The Summons,\\" finds a new challenger who entered the game because of the case that Carter did not want.At first, the new king of torts denounces the profligacy behind the moguls of mass torts. Vacation homes in the Caribbean, pleasure yachts, and luxury airplanes are trappings that he originally abhorred, and later owned, one by one. It was all easy money to the new king of torts, but there was a catch. One by one, those catches add up, until the money doesn't seem so easy.One rather nagging part of the plot is that the king of torts sues a pharmaceutical company, and sells the stock of that company short. Based on another inside tip, he not only covers the short at a tidy profit, but takes a position in the company. The SEC would have noticed these large transactions almost immediately. These illegal trades are subject to treble damages, with both the tipper and the person giving the tip liable for damages. One is subject to punishment even if they are only informants who did not personally trade on the information.Early on, you may be rooting for the king of torts, but as the novel progresses, you hope that he gets his comeuppance. Yet, this is a much different case from George Amberson, who the reader actually feels empathy towards, as he gets his comeuppance in Booth Tarkington's classic novel,The Magnificent Ambersons. In the end, the story seems to say that it is the mass-tort business that creates the greed."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"A very well-realized novel about greed and corruption in the legal profession, particularly in the class-action litigation. The central character is a well-meaning Public Defence attorney, tired of defending criminals and murderers. He desperately wants the life of a corporate power-lawyer, and although he is disgusted by the trappings of the life in the fast lane, once his career gets an unexpected shot in the arm from a highly dubious source, he jumps into it head first, completely forgetting his sense of morality and caution. He begins to earn obscene amounts of money in class action fees and in the process, losed sight of everything else, including running his own business.It's a novel about how money and power can corrupt anyone, and the results that unbriddled greed often brings. You end up hating the guy, but he learns his lessons the hard way by the end of the novel, somewhat salvaging his character, and earning a bit of the reader's sympathy.A well-written and researched novel, giving rich details on mass tort litigation and the unreal life of lawyers who practice it. Makes you wonder how these guys are able to face the world and themselves without any conscience or sense of responsibility. Great read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I collect John Grisham books. Have just about all of them. Come from a family of readers and have instilled reading in my grandchildren."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Very average read. Predictable somewhat fun, but if you are going to write an I hate lawyers book you may want to have your hero be a non lawyer once in a while."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I wrote this review originally for at leebrii.com a social network for book lovers: This book goes against my general mantra of: if it is a fiction book its best enjoyed as a movie. This book kept my attention and turned out to be very enjoyable. Clay is certainly a skilled litigator, and his work through the conspiracy kept me reading. If they make it a move I would see it. See the review: [...]"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I read this book quickly and enjoyed it like I enjoy an occasional candy bar. The lowly lawyer has success thrown at him and it goes straight to his head. Where a normal person would have been satisfied with a 15 million dollar fee for one case and happily retire, he wants more and more and more. Everything goes his way much too easily and in the end it all falls apart too quickly. A lawyer who is surprised when he is accused of insider trading? Not very credible. But I thought it was fun to read.For those who've read the book, one question: did he at least write to poor Tequila who is in prison (strictly speaking) for no fault of his own?"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have planned to read all of Grisham's books, but I don't think I'll read one after another ever again. There's just too much greed! Though here the protagonist still had some conscience and remorse left. That's what matters I believe, even if it's just fiction."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The book started out a little slowly. Wasn't sure I'd like it. But it was wonderful. The slow start began to build the plot. Excellent."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Loved this book. Thought about gettin this when I heard Keith Moreland tell John that this was in his opinion that this was his best work."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Not Clay, Grisham. I'm tired of him turning all his characters into jerks and idiots. i.e. this book, The Summons, The Partner, and probably more I don't plan to read. In fact, this is the last Grisham for me. What a waste."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am a huge John Grisham fan. I believe the first Grisham book I ever read was \\"The Pelican Brief\\". After that, I was hooked. I admit that through the years Mr. Grisham's work has become less \\"Grishamisc\\" and not as entertaining as earlier works. But, you'll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does.I first started this book by listening to it on CD. I soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it. I was right! The book starts out with action and pulls you in. The action barely lets up through the entire book. This is a different kind of action. More mental than physical. There seems to always be something going on and Grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter.One thing that is very different about this book than most of his works, is that there isn't really a catch at the end or a mystery to solve. Generally, we find Grisham leading us to a thriller ending. However, in this book, it is more of a life lesson about greed. There is no bad guy, nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character, etc. The book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life.The characters are likeable and easy to follow. There are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is irrelevant to the story. I found the book very easy to read and follow. I always wanted more.Although the book has a different theme than most Grisham books, I still really enjoyed it. It reminded me why I like to read his books so much. It proves he write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending.If you like this one, try the eariler works as well. If you have seen the movies, it doesn't matter because the books are always better and usually different in some way. This book would make a good movie, but we'll see if anyone in Hollywood agrees with me on that point.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Here is the disclaimer: I was already a proponent of tort reform before I read this book. However, after reading this novel, I am a stronger proponent of it than ever. Enter Clay Carter - unknown defender in D.C. of the poorest of the poor. Then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap, one he can't refuse, partly because the parent's of his long-time girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money.Give Carter a taste of money, then the greed sets in. For the middle half of the book, we get to see unadulterated greed come to run his life! Especially infuriating is how he lets that greed come before the well-being of his clients. This is what will be his undoing. One of his clients who was already ticked off at a settlement he made gets a terminal illness and decides to go after his lawyer. This is the rags to riches to almost rags in the course of about eighteen months.Grisham actually makes you feel sympathetic with the main charater (Clay Carter) through his rise, and especially his fall. That shows to the quality of his storytelling. In fact, while Carter is in some ways a sympathetic character, he mostly is not! Mass torts and greed is the theme of this story. The fact that he came back to haunt him was only justice. Too bad such justice doesn't often happen in the real world of mass torts."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you thought you didn't like lawyers before....wait to you read about the world of mass torts. The lawyers find a large corporation that has put out a faulty product and they sign up all the clients they can find that used that product and had an adverse affect. Then they file a class action suite. Their goal is to pressure/blackmail the company into a quick settlement that really only makes money for the lawyers.This Grisham book is a very fast paced and I could not put it down. Read it in one evening. Our protagonist is a lawyer that gets easily pulled into the world of class action suites. And then goes on a crazy ride as greed controls his every move.So pick it up for a quick ride through the world of class action suites...It will open your eyes and give you a couple evenings of entertaining reading."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham is one of my favorite writers and i was very surprised by how this book was. I was really bored half the time and didn't enjoy it like his other novels. I give it three stars because i loved the ending and it was good in some parts."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I picked up KING OF TORTS in an airport bookstore, looking for something to read on the flight. It is one of the few of his over the years I haven't read.By the time my flight landed, I was halfway through the book and when I got home, finished it.It is yet another addicting Grisham book, only this time, more in the technical world of the legal profession. Not really about a big case, but about a lawyer, trying to find ways to rack up fees through class action settlements.The only problems come in the last fifty pages where it essentially falls apart, trying to wrap up too quickly. Not very believable.Still, it is an entertaining, fast paced read. If you are a fan of Grisham, worth picking up. If you've never read him before, maybe not the best one to begin with."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"King of Torts is classic Grisham. I had to struggle with myself to continue reading initially. However, the persistence paid off when I reached a point where I could not keep it down.A case of random killing lands on J. Clay Carter, an attorney with the Office of Public Defenders(OPD) for a meagre pay - very less than what he used to get when he used to work for his father before he got caught in an accounting scandal and the firm had to be closed down. His father now is off the coast after losing his license to practice law. Clay falls in love with Rebecca VanHorn. Rebecca's father despises Clay and so does Clay. He tries to convice Clay to take up a job with his recommendation. He refuses it and Rebecca breaks up with Clay soon after. She gets married to another guy. Meanwhile, Clay comes in contact with a \\"man\\" who offers him a lucrative deal - a deal which would make him the \\"King of Torts\\". The story goes on to how he tumbles from the throne.Grisham establishes the characters very well.\\"King of Torts\\" - a wonderful book. I normally prefer books and movies ending on a happy note. This one doesnt (Or may be it does - depends on whom you look at - the system or the hero?). Still I would regard this one as a good read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"\\"King of Torts\\" gives in fiction form a primer on the difference between tort law practice and mass tort boiler room scam practice. In the former, a victim of corporate wrongdoing is compensated, either through a verdict after a trial or an out-of-court settlement. In the latter, fast buck operators who've passed the bar exam contact thousands of victims promising a settlement to them if they will join their plaintiff class. They then come to a settlement with the offending company, take out a huge cut for themselves, and split up the paltry remains among their thousands of \\"clients\\". The focus is not justice or law or compassion, but fast profit, almost as if the class of victims were a block of stock options to be exercised at the most opportune moment.Clay Carter, Grisham's protagonist, never takes a case to trial, seldom even sees the inside of a courtroom. Instead, his resources are poured into advertising for victims to enlarge his plaintiff classes, and into the trappings of wealth to show his prospective clients that he has pulled off big scores in the past. After they sign with him, his client/victims get a couple of phone calls, a perfunctory medical exam, and a few months later, a check that is woefully low in light of what they have suffered.The companies that are the targets of Carter's assaults are crippled financially, sometimes driven into backruptcy, throwing thousands out of work. In one case this results in some painful retaliation on Carter, which is satisfying enough to the casual reader. But to those who read this to gain a greater understanding of the diseased tort law system, the ray of hope seems to be personified in the lawyer who steps in toward the end of the story to form a plaintiff class of Carter's dead or dying former clients. A plan is formed to sue him for a crime that seems to be all too rarely prosecuted: legal malpractice.Not being a lawyer, I can't tell how realistic the circumstances underpinning this tale are. The dollar amounts seem high, but then the normal fee for a normal lawyer seems high to me. If Grisham's hyperbole in \\"King of Torts\\" is only minor, then he has done the public a service in illuminating a serious public problem."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As a fan of most of Grisham's books, I was dissappointed in King of Torts. The first half was alright, you think something shocking will happen, but it doesnt. Its basically the story of a mass tort lawyer who gets greedy. Big deal..."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Upshot: I needed something to read while I endured a several hour airport delay. This book filled the bill, but just barely.The book starts off well, with interesting characters and laying of groundwork. How, I wondered, will these various characters develop? Is that minor character going to turn up much later in a more prominent role? Did such and such happen for the reasons Clay thinks it happened, or will we see later that something more complex was going on? Lots of characters and links (well, possible links, it turned out), making me think that the climax of the book will be very interesting and nuanced.Not quite.I forgot what happened when I read The Firm in 1991: stayed up all night reading the darned thing and then couldn't believe the &quot;and then everything was OK&quot; ending. Seem to recall something similar with The Client. Well, not to give anything away, so let's just say you don't really need to pay very close attention to events or characters. The morality issues are interesting, but if you really think about it, Clay is a big-time cheeseball who should face Bar charges. Not a sympathetic or particularly interesting character.So, to sum up, buy the paperback. Or borrow it."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The best thing I can say about this book is that it was a quick read, so I didn't waste too much time on it. Lazily plotted; characters popping up cconveniently to bridge plot points and then disappearing; ridiculous, sloppy &quot;resolution&quot;; utterly unbelievable, even by Grisham standards. Just to show how quickly and slipshod this book was cranked out, the author picture is one of JG scowling at a book signing for his next book. Save your money."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have them all,...1st editions which are probably worth nothing, because his publisher knows he can write too. In my house, for mainstream writing, there are only a few authors worthy of buying EVERY book... Grisham is the only one my wife (she of more like Oprah's club fandom) and I agree on. We fight to see who gets to read Grisham's book 1st.Read them all...outside of Brett Favre and Steve McNair, this has to be Mississipi's best statesmen.Keep it up John"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I really enjoyed this legal thriller, especially compared to some of Grisham's other works, because there was no large evil all-consuming law firm or corporation which put hits out on people. Those trying to \\"get\\" the protagonist Clay were the SEC and individual citizens--all through legal and established channels.Clay was an excellent protagonist because he was everyman, a man with good ideals and a good heart. He set out thinking that he wouldn't get consumed in the greed of tort law, and then the reader was right along for the ride as he went down the slipperly slope of becoming more talented and powerful.One great quote from p. 183: Mass tort litigation was not practicing law. It was a roguish form of entrepreneurship."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham explores many aspects of the legal system in the United States. In this case, it is the system of mass torts, with the protaganist telling an unlikely story of how he stumbled upon a fairly small tort case, which led to an even bigger one, and his subsequent fall into massive ligitation cases... and the pitfalls.Almost all aspects of mass torts and the fallout are explored. Certainly Clay (the proteganist) is seduced into a system of greed and money. The victims are also shown - the victims of mass ligigation and the ultimate problems with that as well. Even doctors and drug companies have their say, with prescriptions of drugs which have great benefit, but often have side-effects as well.Ultimately, I have to side with the drug companies, who, despite the drawbacks of drug, are ultimately trying to do great benefit to society in their attempts to fight disease or extend life. For a good alternative, read Strong Medicine by Arthur Hailey. Nobody benefits with good drugs with lethal side effects. Nobody benefits with no new drug developments that don't have some side effects.In the end, the best result is lost in the legal battle. All drugs have side effects. However, the cost of single cases verses class actions also have a side effect. I don't know the right way to go forward - and nobody else does either. Both sides have powerful lobbiest groups."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I realize that John Grisham's roots come from working in a Southaven Mississippi law firm, so one would expect his firm grasp on the lingo of lawyerspeak. Of the other Grisham books I have read, I felt okay with what I was reading as the technical terms were not necessarily dumbed down, but downgraded to layman's terms. The King of Torts, however, was laden with many terms that I had never encountered. And just to help out others, this was taken from the Merriam Webster Online Dictionary, a tort is \\"a wrongful act other than a breach of contract for which relief may be obtained in the form of damages or an injunction\\"The positive about this book? It isn't the fairy tale that we all dream of. The negative? This book was very slow. There, of course, were parts that screamed across the pages, keeping me reading, but towards the end I found myself saying \\"just say what happens already!\\" This is one of the few Grisham books I have read that I didn't want to know more of what happened to the characters, as opposed to the others where I truly wanted to know more.Maybe its just because I've been on a Grisham binge the past few days, but The King of Torts was definitely not one of the better books. Had I the knowledge that my cousins, a tax lawyer, and a soon to be public defender, have and speak legalese, maybe I would have enjoyed this book more."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter is a lawyer who gives up his job as a public defender to make scads of money winning class-action lawsuits. He makes money hand over fist, still isn't really all that happy, and in the end it all falls apart. There is a lot of interesting information here about how lawyers go about fleecing innocent people and companies to make their millions of dollars and it moves along at a fast pace. It's an easy read and was interesting enough to keep my attention even though it was predictable. You can decide for yourself what comes next and in 100 pages it will have happened."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I listened to this one on my commute to work every day, and must admit that I looked forward to getting into my car and didn't want to get out when I reached the office. I would've given this book 5 stars, but a few areas of the book tend to drag a little. Overall, an interesting page turner."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great read for those of us unfamiliar with tort law and tort reform. Easy to read and definitely a page turner."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book is about a small time lawyer (Clay) who hits the big time when he gets involved in Mass tort litigation vis a vis a character named Max Pace. Clay vows not to be changed by the money (millions) he makes but this is not to be. Most of the book centers around Clay making lots of money with relative ease and then spending it in an obscene fashion. Slightly thrilling although I felt Grisham belabored the moral lesson of greed (preach, preach preach)...There's a bit of romance in the book though Grisham could have left that out and you'd still get the point. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book -- just take it out of the library. This is not one of his better novels but it'll pass the time at least."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This has been my first John Grisham novel and I must say I did very much enjoy the plot. It was a unique plot that consisted of a public defender lawyer making it big through illegal means. The book contained subtle bits of humor that made it much more enjoyable. The character of Clay was very likeable and relatable. At times I felt the book was too dragged out and could have been shortened. Also the ending was a bit too predictable and uneventful when compared to the rest of the novel. I had kind of hoped that Clay would have returned to his old job and tried to protect those he had wrongly accused of murder. Overall though, an enjoyable read"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"What would you do if you were offered a chance to make $15 million dollars in less than 6 months? Even if it meant doing something that made you feel uncomfortable. This is what John Grisham addresses in his tort filled dissertation on the idea of the American Dream.The main character is surprisingly sympathetic. I had compassion for him and I could see how I could be him. Through the course of the novel he changes as greed and a lack of love take over. What can save him?I also found this entertaining to read given my experience with the world of torts. Grisham again is on key, even not somewhat over the top (just a little though) about what large tort involves.If you enjoy John Grisham you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Order was received in a timely manner and was well packaged.

Grisham is one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"King Of Torts was fairly good.It is a good review of greed and ambition.The character doesnt exactly apeal to me, as he , for an attorney, certainly didnt research his decisions, with regard to cases. The book will hold your interest and at times leave you shaking your head with disbelief.A good insight into choices and consequences."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This laughably superficial portrait of the legal world lacks any and all of the creativity of Grisham's early work. The paint by numbers protagonist is a one dimensional bore and the supporting cast is populated by the cliched hard edged mass tort king who is secretly a coward with little trial experience, the slacker buddy who cashes out his first reward and makes for Margaritaville, the shady mephostophilian \\"Max Pace\\" who entices our \\"hero\\" into the deal with the devil Tarvan drug case, and of course the gorgeous lingerie model with little interest in anything other than spending money.BOOOORING. It's a shame that Grisham has taken such a lax attitude toward his faithful fans, but clearly the man's best writing is behind him and he's now just making it hand over fist with this drivel.As for the story itself, it is laughably unbelievable that an attorney with 5 years experience as a public defender would within 6 weeks (?) of resigning his office become a highly successful tort lawyer without *at a minimum* drawing all kinds of red flags within the legal and/or ethics committees of the state he practiced in. The oversimplification of how litigation ensues and settlements are reached further strains the credulity of the tissue thin plot line.If you must read this book (unlikely as that is), I recommend a check out from your local neighborhood library (which is what I did) instead of forking over any of your hard earned money."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I think I've read all of John Grisham's novels and this one is definitely my least favorite. Like all of his books it's eminently readable - the pages keep turning, almost by themselves! But it's a pretty obvious conclusion that you see building up, the motivations of the characters were not convincing and the final pages were mostly a &quot;so what&quot;?"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham is back to his legal thrillers, and I was SO involved in this one that addresses pharmaceutical companies and mass tort litigation. Justice becomes an oxymoron as the main character is led astray from his values, from the girl he loves and greed takes over. An expose on the big business of advertising, pharamaceuticals, mass torts, environmentalism and sprawl, corporate and personal greed, with a bit of product liability and temptation tossed in for seasoning. Grisham has a way of painting a picture, and being a moralist, and having a clever twist at the end and his sarcastic comments are always (to me) quite wonderful. The author also seems to be a man I can respect when it comes to affairs of the heart. His view point of the failings of our justice system, and the greed of the men in suits may result in the reader having a different perspective on the pharmaceutical industry and class action lawsuits."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am a big fan of John. But with the last two new books he pushed out, maybe for the money, he is disappointing. Is his star fading, or just the cloud of money overshadowing his talent?This book has no real plot and everything was too predictable. The facts were not believable and the characters lacked depth.But it has all the easy ready trademark of John. Not a bad book to burn through for summer reading, but nothing memorable."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I loved reading The King of Torts, by John Grishman. I enjoyed matching witts with him while reading this book. The excitment of trying to figure out the plot and the ending intreges me the most. I could not put the book down until I had finished it. While reading his books I'm always looking for his hidden clues to how the story will end. The King of Torts, unlike John Grishman's other books, the plot and ending was easy to figure out. I kept waiting for a surpise twist. This book was well written and I enjoyed it very much and will continue to read his books.John Grisham's (goodboy) Clay Carter's distaste for greedy Lawyers and Businessmen is suddenly changed when he also becomes the (badboy). Greedy and power hungry Clay becomes the very thing he hated. Becoming the King of Torts in less than a year, Clay was so busy spending his money, that he did not see his downfall coming, just as fast. Clay was lucky that his first love was there, when the King fell to help him start over.Morals vs. money and power become the issue in this story and it makes you want to slap Clay across the face as you see him change rapidly into our worst fear, a greedy Lawyer."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This starts off well, in classic Grisham style, and that's a good thing. It's fast-paced, interesting, a real page-turner. At some point though, about half of the way through, it starts becoming a little too predictable. You know the hero is going to stumble, and he does, but not badly; there is too little conflict here. There needs to be a lot more drama here. The hero is never in any danger, except financially, and who really cares about that? The pharmaceutical industry is also too easy a target to demonize; we already know that it's not exactly the most moral of industries, and Grisham never presents the good about the industry to balance the bad. There is too little character development, and the girlfriend/fianc&eacute; character is cookie-cutter at best. Maybe a good beach read, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham returns to fine form in The King Of Torts. Unlike his previous novel, The Summons,The King of Torts remains consistent and captivating from start to finish.The story depicts the sudden rise and even greater fall of lawyer, Clay Carter as he dabbles in Tort Law. Its interesting to view the different changes in Carter's lifestyle and personality as his firm rakes in settlement fees as well as when Carter turns from hunter to hunted. Many characters are introduced and depicted quite accurately at an appropriate level of detail.Maybe not on the level of The Firm or The Chamber but certainly a return to form for Grisham."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I keep hoping that Grisham will find that spark, that certain something that kept me riveted to his books. But perhaps he's just run out of ideas. His last few attempts (The Brethren, The Summons, A Painted House) have been nothing short of total disappoint. In this attempt, Grisham gives us Clay Cart, a discontented attorney in DC's Public Defender Office who's life has rutted into the dull routine we all dread.But enter Max Pace, a mysterious visitor with information for Clay that could make him millions. And Clay goes for it, learning quickly the greasy ways of class action lawsuits where the only winners are the attorneys whose only goals are to make millions, buy Lear jets, yachts, tropical island getaways, while avoiding actually going to court. Clay follows this script to a letter, including a model/bimbo girlfriend.I quickly became disgusted with Clay and Grisham's attempt to give his a conscious toward the end of the book rings extremely hollow, as Clay is more dispondent about everything falling apart, rather than the more important moral issues that a person with a soul would have demonstrated. Grisham left much undone at the end of the book, leaving me wondering if a sequel is in his mind...a sequel I can definitely wait for.If you don't have anything else to read, then a few days going through the King of Torts isn't a total waste of time. But if you're eagerly anticipating the Grisham that gave us The Partner, A Time to Kill, The Firm, The Client, Runaway Jury, The Testament, etc., I'm afraid you'll be as disappointed as I was."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It has been some time since I've read a Grisham book, partly because they have consistently declined in writing style and plot. So I decided to try him again. My mistake. Like the books protaginist, Grisham ripped us off by making this a best seller based on his past success. Not based on this book with its poorly developed main characters. Each was a stereotype with no demension. The plot disappeared quickly and became predictable. This book is not worth reading on the beach. Skip it."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is a standard Grisham book, where the reader gets some insight into what (according to Grisham) drives lawyers and how the rich and famous lives, interesting characters, and greedy villains (not just lawyers). There are as such no surprises, but if you like Grisham, this will definately not disappoint you."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book grabbed me the minute I opened it. This is Grisham at his best. The King of Torts is not only a mezmerizing read, but a learning tool. Can't wait for the next Grisham book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books and have never been disappointed. He is a great writer a simple and elegant style. I enjoyed this one tremendously and think it's probably his finest. You won't go wrong with this one and I'm recommending it all the way. And if you're looking for a few other great titles, look no further than these, Buckland's Hot List: most creative, The Butterfly: A Fable (Singh); most engaging, The Alchemist (Coelho); most interesting, Life of Pi (Martel); most enlightening, 9-11 (Chomsky); most thrilling, The Lovely Bones: A Novel (Sebold); and finally, the most creative, engaging, interesting, enlightening and thrilling book of all, The Little Prince (Saint-Exupery). These are the books I'd recommend to my family, friends, students, and wife. There are many more, trust me, but these are the first that come to mind (for having left an impact slight or proud as it may be). If you have any questions, queries, or comments, or maybe even a title you think I should add to my list, please feel free to e-mail me. I'm always open to a good recommendation. Thanks for reading my brief but hopefully helpful review. Happy reading. Donald S.

His loves, his excesses and his fate make a facinating read. Rarely do I read a book cover to cover in one day, but this one just couldn't be put down."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I found this to be one of my favorite Grisham books. He takes us on a rapid-fire ride in the life of a mega-buck tort lawyer, who starts with zero and, through a quirk of fate, has the chance of a lifetime. All it requires is a bit of a slide in ethical behavior.The main character, Clay Carter, finds himself in a different world than the standard practice of law, or the standard life style. It's an interesting ride.I won't give anything away, but Grisham is back with another lesson in legal ethics and greed, and a character that struggles with both as he tries to remember who, at heart, he really is."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"WoW! This book is amazing. And Grisham wrote because he wanted to, not just because of his contract. READ THIS BOOK. I recommend this book to everyone, especially people who like John Grisham's other works."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've read every book written by John Grisham and this one is in the top four. It's a stunning portrait of mass tort litigators and what happens to the clients that they are supposedly &quot;representing&quot;. No documentary or editoral has ever captured the true effects of mass tort on the little guy. This is a true account of the actual ramifications of such mass litigation. I read it in one sitting, because I just couldn't put it down. It's great to see that Grisham can still write great fiction. After The Brethern I was beginning to wonder if my favorite author had run out of steam. With The King of Torts, Grisham has shown me once again why I starting reading his books in the first place. Thanks."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have always been a fan of Grisham, and his new book hasn't let me down. I was a little disapointed with his last book, and thus was apprehensive while picking up this one. I shouldn't have been, as Grisham has come back with one of his best, and I would say that it is up there with The Client, The Jury, and A Time to Kill (all favorites of mine). If I had one complaint, it would be that I read it two days."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am a huge fan of John Grisham, but I've been dissapointed by his last few books. His last legal book, The Summons just didn't have the spark that I come to expect from Grisham novels, so I didn't have very high hopes for this book. I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised!This book is about a layer named Clay Carter, who is a public defender in Washington DC. He makes little money by lawyer standards, his girlfriend is getting sick of waiting for him to do something better and he's not all that happy with his life. Then he gets a client accused of murdering someone for no apparent reason and he uncovers a secret that has the opportunity to change his life. Suddenly he finds himself suing pharmaceutical companies and making millions of dollars. But when his money takes over his common sense it becomes a very bumpy ride. I don't want to give up too much of the plot, but it gets very interesting! This is a great study of greed and what too much money can do to a person. I loved this book. It was shocking to me at times. The only thing I didn't love about this book is that I think it needed an epilogue. When I finished the last page I had a \\"well THEN what happened??\\" feeling. I guess I just didn't want it to end!I would definately reccomend this book to anyone that loves John Grisham, or anyone that wants a good, fairly quick but exciting read. This was a fun book to read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The book is typical Grisham and an easy read...It appears that Mr. Grisham has abandoned his roots as the Plaintiff's attorney for the &quot;average Joe&quot; in small southern town, &quot;Oxford, Miss,&quot; and that he is now more comfortable being in bed with big business and the insurance industry. The book pure fiction."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I wouldnt really vcall this a bad book.. but it is in line with Grisham's recent books. It certainly does not live up to the greatness of his previous novels. The characters were all a little undeveloped and the story line was a little blah at time. Overall I would reccomend this book, but Grisham is fading...."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I always enjoy reading one of John Grisham's books and King of Torts was no different. I like how John exposes the behind the scenes world of 'class action' law suits; the frantic pace to run scare ads getting consumers to call the lawyers 800 number, rushing thru medical testing, posturing with other tort lawyers to win mega-million paychecks while their clients get a paltry settlement.I especially enjoyed the bit of romance thrown into the story, although it's obvious Grisham loves to write about the law not love! An unexpected twist at the end . . . couldn't put this book down until I finished it all. Well Done!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I read this book on holiday. The ending was completely predictable by about page 50. I was bored and struggled to finish this low grade book. NOT one of his better books!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The other reviews can give you the necessary information about the plot. As another commentary on the plot, however, I was greatly disappointed. My husband and I both read the book and both kept hoping that there would be some redeeming plot twist. I thought, &quot;Surely it can't just be a tiresome repetition about the main character's increasing lust for power and money?&quot; But alas, it was just that. And then suddenly it just seems to end with a quick, neat, wrap-up."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As I approached the end of the book I wondered how on earth Grisham was going to tie together all those threads - and when I reached the end I wondered why he didn't. I found myself inspecting the spine, wondering whether a chapter or two could have fallen out. What I'd liked about other Grisham books was the detective work of putting together a case: here, the main character, Clay Carter, gets given his cases fully-formed. The jacket description that Clay \\"stumbles on a conspiracy too horrible to believe\\" suggests he pieced it together: he was in the dark when a cardboard crook fed it to him. Was this a story with a meaning or a \\"tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\\"? I disagree that it is really a moral tale: Carter never seems to show any real remorse for his victims, and it's hard for us to, because we never really got to know them. It isn't really an indictment of mass tort, because the lawyer who takes his product liability suit to court, Mooneyham, puts together a cast-iron case and loses it, thereby denying his client the $10m he could have had in a proffered out-of-court settlement. Is it about the corrupting influence of money? Not really: he is lead astray at the start, but there is no progressive decline in his morality through the book - far from being repelled by changes in him, his friends and lovers remain loyal to him throughout his journey from rags to rags. The main characters neither taste the fine wines nor soak up the sunshine, so it wasn't even about the joys of money. The \`evils of Big Pharmaceuticals' theme wasn't really explored either. Sadly, every character was two-dimensional too. All Grisham seems to want to say in this book is that Mass Tort lawyers are dim and dull, which may be true, but it is neither entertaining nor stimulating. I want my afternoon back!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The first John Grisham book I have read in several years, The King of Torts both reminds me of what I liked about Grisham and why I stopped reading his work. Once again, Grisham has put together a book that is reasonably entertaining and fast-moving while not being all that well-written. The story is the essentially Faustian story of a struggling lawyer who sells his soul for prosperity, rising to great heights by compromising his integrity. He has it all - wealth, fame, a beautiful model for a girlfriend - but like all deals with the devil, it eventually all goes sour in a big way.In Clay Carter, Grisham reworks many of the protagonists from his previous novels. Clay is morally and ethically challenged (not unlike the \\"heroes\\" of The Firm, The Runaway Jury and The Brethren). He thinks he's an okay guy, but in the end, he gives in to greed and is willing to sell out almost anyone in his climb to the top. Unfortunately, Clay is the only well-defined character in the book; many characters, such as his long-time girlfriend, are not all that interesting (it's hard to understand why Clay is so obsessed with her), and other characters (such as her parents) are little more than cookie-cutter stereotypes.This is an okay book and a page-turner, but hardly more than three-star quality. For Grisham veterans, this will be not a disappointment or a pleasure, but merely par for the course for a writer is just slightly above par, and as strong an indication as any that being a best-selling author is not the same as being a great one."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After making a brief foray into a new genre in \`Skipping Christmas' and \`The Painted House', Grisham returns to his home turf with the \`King of Torts' Yes, he is back to zillion dollar lawsuits and the men who file and fight them. Only here, there's a slight departure from his standard formula. There is no clear demarcation between the good and the bad guy. They blur into one. But having said that, it is only fair to say that the minor variation notwithstanding, the book remains a quintessential Grisham. In his disdain for money-making, mega law firms, legal malpractice, he retains his original flavor.The story takes an unexpected turn when the poorly-paid, savior-of-the-downtrodden, public prosecutor at the OPD, Clay Carter, falls prey to avarice and ambition. He abandons his rather hapless client, the victim of an experimental anti-addiction drug, resigns and sets up his own law firm. A relentless craving for power, money and recognition pushes him to take on the life on a mass tort litigator. He digs around for dirty laundry on big corporations, jumps at the first opportunity to sue them, arm-twists them into out-of-court settlements worth millions of dollars. But just when the champagne-caviar life is hits the zenith, a bunch of disgruntled clients, who feel they have received a raw deal, decide to go after the \`King of Torts' himself."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am a long time fan of John Grisham, I read all of his legal thrillers and this one might be the one I least enjoyed. The story line and characters in the book is so unreal.There were so many money making opportunities for Clay Carter at the beginning and so many bad things happened to him at the end at the same time is just not real.I enjoyed Grisham's early writings, lately has been a little disappointing."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I suppose Grisham tried to reach back to his green days as an author by dragging out his old formula: a young, naive, yet hard working lawyer gets in over his head but wiggles out using his fresh-faced ingenuity and a little beginner's luck; in the end he not only gets the girl but also escapes to paradise, turning his back on the stink of the legal world forever. Only this time it doesn't work.First of all, while this formula worked well for Grisham a decade ago, we have read and watched hundreds of variations of this formula since then and it is long past being worn thin. Secondly, the strength of this particular type of story rests upon the protagonist - if the reader sympathizes with the main character then the reader has someone to root for (and a reason to keep reading). So Rudy Baylor in the The Rainmaker not only fights for his client, he also fights to avenge the frustrations we all have felt in dealing with insurance companies. In The King of Torts, however, the main character is stupid, shallow, and greedy, thus evoking no sympathy and understanding from the reader.Grisham also seems to be setting up a classic tragedy but fails to follow through, allowing this miserable larcener to essentially get away with it all in the end. I also have a hard time believing that someone who graduated from law school (any law school) could be as blatantly stupid as the main character in this novel. On top of all this Grisham's style, which was only adequate to begin with, seems to have actually gotten worse over the years. I give this book a D."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am pretty sure there is an argument for tort reform embedded in John Grisham's \\"The King of Torts,\\" but coming up with specifics for an inherent solution is going to be pretty much impossible when you are done reading the novel. The story starts with Clay Carter, a lawyer in the Office of the Public Defender in Washington, D.C., who is suddenly saddled with the case of Tequila Watson. For no apparent reason, Tequila, who has no history of violence, blows away another young man. However, there is an explanation for this seemingly incomprehensible murder that changes Clay's life.The obvious assumption is that once Clay knows the truth, he will right this horrible wrong. But Grisham goes off in a different direction as Clay is sucked into the wonderful world of torts. Like the character we are given a crash course in how to make big bucks quick. It becomes clear that the goal is to make money and things like just compensation for victims and the economic viability of companies are secondary considerations. The result is a crash course on how the game is played and an introduction to the greedy royalty of this lucrative arena of the law.Grisham's main character might be able to find a small area of redemption by the end of \\"The King of Torts,\\" but the subject of tort reform offers no similar semi-happy ending. Perhaps the most depressing part of this novel is not what happens as Clay sells his soul to the dark side, but that even an ethnical lawyer with a strong case is no more capable of guaranteeing justice. Grisham does cover the concerns of all the parties involved--companies and clients as well as lawyers--which at least implies that any solution is going to have to address those three areas to avoid given any one party an advantage.Of course, the obvious conclusion is that we will no more be able to deal with tort reform than we have been able to deal with the the problems of the Social Security system, providing national health care, or anything else where everybody pretty much agrees that something has to be done but no two people can agree on what should be done. \\"The King of Torts,\\" like all of Grisham's novels, is a quick read and there is enough moral ambiguity to Clay's character that you cannot totally hate him as he begins his descent into hell. But exposing a problem in such detail without any hint of a viable solution, is rather disheartening."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"3 Stars, I rated it. Why, because in spite of it all, I enjoyed the process of reading the book. It's the book as a whole that I hated.I was travelling with a colleague on a business trip when she was reading this, and she told me not to bother. Not to be daunted, I picked it up.She was right. I wanted to shoot myself at the end of the book. But that's the point - at the END of the book.The book is gripping... very gripping. The first few pages fail to grab, but eventually you're hooked.I found myself getting progressively euphoric, as Carter made his millions... and progressively depressed as things started falling apart. That's a power Grisham has - of involving the reader intimately.But this book proved something I've suspected for a while. Occassionally, and more and more of late, John Grisham has a serious writer's block when it comes to ending.His endings are like what some people have said to me about Pearl Jam's music (Which I didn't like hearing - I love Pearl Jam).They never really end... just kind of stop being.And this ending was a prime example of that... at some point, the Author's Note begins, and you're left thinking &quot;HUH!?!??!&quot;&quot;HUH?????!!!? I wanna burn this book&quot; is not a good way for a book to leave you.. and hence, only 3 Stars for a book that, till about 75% of the book was a 5-Star.Because the book left me with &quot;HUH!??!?!?!&quot;"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"In *King of Torts,* Grisham presents three different ways in which the victims of mass torts are (or could theoretically be) compensated. (A mass tort is a wrong committed against a very large group of people, such as the marketing of a defective product that injures a lot of its users.) He describes first a fantasy system in which the wrongdoer uses a compliant plaintiffs' attorney to persuade victims to skip the courts and take temptingly large sums of money in exchange for signing releases and confidentiality agreements. Next Grisham describes something more along the lines of what actually happens today, with the plaintiffs' attorneys uncovering defective (or possibly defective) products, gathering together large classes of plaintiffs (the victims), commencing class-action lawsuits against the wrongdoer, and then negotiating a settlement in which each of the plaintiffs receives a moderate amount while their attorneys take an unseemly, large cut. Finally, Grisham describes &quot;the old-fashioned way,&quot; with the plaintiff's attorney bringing to trial a lawsuit on behalf of one victim of the mass tort.Each of the approaches is shown to have its downside, and not one is presented as clearly the best. Grisham's sympathies appear to lie with the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; approach, although the fantasy approach is the one that, in the novel, results in the largest payout to the largest group of victims.Grisham's presentation of the three hypothetical mass-tort systems is framed in a perfunctory story employing typical Grisham elements. The protagonist is a young, cocky, underdog lawyer with a taste for leggy blondes and fast cars (a sort of cross between Atticus Finch and your basic frat boy); he has run-ins with stuffed shirts, slick big-firm lawyers, and bureaucrats; he struggles to find love with a &quot;good&quot; girl while alley-catting with a &quot;bad&quot; girl; he is alienated from his somewhat embarrassing father; etc., etc. The conclusion is mercifully swift, with no effort to tie up the numerous loose ends that the reader doesn't care about anyway.As fiction, this is poor stuff. As journalism, it may be of interest, giving a painless but spotty introduction to certain aspects of the legal system.

the murder case he was currently handling with our friend \\"tequila.\\" clay sells him down a river in a heartbeat... apparently max pace represents a pharmaceutical company that made a drug called tarvan that cured tequilas crack addiction but for some reason that was never thought out by grisham made tequila kill another human being as a side effect.this may sound far fetched but this is one of the many questions surrounded the validity of this plot written by one of the greatest legal thriller writers of the last generation... it doesn't end theremax pace entices clay to essentially sign his soul away for a lump sum of 15 million dollars. this money, along with alot more was used to silence the families affected by the drug, thus avoiding costly litigation. clay without any moral hesitation decides that if he signs his soul away and makes millions of dollars it will bring his shallow gold digging girlfriend back with her annoying parents attached at the umbilical cord.clays success in settling the tarvan cases quickly turns into a spending frenzy as pace directs him to set up his own law firm and steal all of the hardworking employees from the office of the public defender. max pace seemingly pops out of the woodwork again, dropping some more Martha Stewart esque insider information about another possible drug scare. this drug known by the name of dyloft brings clay and his newly established law firm thousands of cases which he settles out of court and makes close to 100 million. an overnight millionaire.clays newfound riches seemingly don't make him happy. grisham predicates the notion that clays true happiness lies with his grubby gold digging ex girlfriend Rebecca who eventually winds up marrying someone purely out of convenience. this makes clay none too happy.clay expands his lawfirm and hires lawyers, paralegals and many other professionals and exploits them like a true mass tort litigator. max pace comes and goes dropping more hints to clay to perpetuate the seemingly predictable plot of the novel. pace drops one more hint at a drug known as maxatail, and clay quickly begins assembling another class action lawsuit, this time the stakes are even higher.clays emptiness has him spending money like crazy and soon his resources run dry. his newest mass tort endeavor's success is imperative if clay is to continue his lifestyle. a clint eastwood esque lawyer takes the makers of maxatil to trial and looses, this effectively ends any settlement in a class action lawsuit against the drug maker. clay is hopeless as his money runs dry and his clients begin to sue him for malpractice.much like his father in the beginnigg of the novel clay humiliates himself after becoming very successful. perhaps a circle of life esque scene clay becomes the thing he hated most. a money hoarding greedy attorney who lost everything much like his father.his ex girlfriend eventually comes running back to him even though he's penny less. clay looses his firm and they both escape to London without prosecution of any kind for his scummy mal practice and apparently they live and love happily ever after without remorse of any kind.this book was interesting for the first 100 pages or so but i clearly do not like the message this book sends. the plot was watered down and i thought using max pace as a catalyst to move the plot was something short of a cop out. i hated how clay chased after rebecca even though she was as shallow as they come. this book helped me understand more clearly how mass tort litigation works but i understand the underlying message of life and its ensuing endeavors of happiness and greed alot less. i feel in fact less of a nice guy just for reading this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"A very good book.

I would recommend this book for all John Grisham fans."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read several other Grisham novels, so on the advice of my wife, I decided to read this one also. I thought the plot would be somewhat predictable, but I was mistaken. Similar to other Grisham novels, his characters are well delineated, very realistic. Another element of his novels is their educational value. Inevitably, I always learn something about our legal/court system, usually something which is very unimaginable. And this novel was no exception. I highly recommend it if you enjoy these types of novels. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I read first Grisham novel in 1993, The Firm and I remember it was definitely thrilling and fast. Then work, family and I skipped Grisham for largely 20 years. Now I started to listen to him in Audible while walking/working out. This novel is gripping and introduced to the tort litigation and people surrounding it. I think the author immerses himself into the system and observes lot of what is going on and portrays with fiction. I certainly enjoyed the storyline, though I got spoilt reading the plot in wikipedia. Wikipedia releases too much of information. So I started not to read anything about novels.

The only way to pay for hisever increasing greed is to find more torts but could the thing that made him rich also be his downfall?I found \\"the King of Torts' to be different to John Grisham's other books as there is no sudden twists in the story.

Hard to put down....did not want it to end so soon."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Whether by design or contrived coincidence, Grisham mentioned the King of Torts in his previous book, The Summons (Chapter 13) which introduced as to the wonderful kingdom of Torts -- where civil wrongs can be rectified by civil remedies commonly known to the rest of us as money for damages.With little resemblance to the real-life King of Torts Melvin Belli, Grisham's Clay Carter started as a sympathetic figure, a Georgetown law graduate, struggling to make it big in the big city. Clay and the other characters are juxtaposed against the now familiar Grisham theme of a David-like lawyer against the Goliath of corporate behemoths, represented in this case by the pharmaceutical firms. The twist is when the ethical distinction between David and Goliath becomes transparent and indistinguishable.This is a lawyer's fantasy ride -- a rag-to-riches yarn of greed and vindictive excess -- complete with private jets, blond bimbos, million dollars high stake machinations.Tight, riveting and intelligent with language nearly devoid of profanities and clich&eacute;s, this book is Grisham's 'imprimatur' as the King (no pun intended) of legal thrillers."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Fans of John Grisham's earlier legal works should be pleased with this thriller set in the complex, greedy world of tort lawyers. You can't help but like and hate the main character, lawyer J. Clay Carter II as he changes from a low paid but dedicated attorney in the D.C. Public Defender's office to a high powered, freewheeling and greedy corporate lawyer. When the chance to cash in on 6 settlements for a new drug gone wrong lands in Carter's lap, he is lured into the jet-setting life of other wealthy attorneys looking for quick settlements. Even though you may not approve of their motives, the tort world is fascinating and a great story. As Carter buys into the lifestyle with a personal jet and home in the Carribbean yet seems unconcerned about settlements for his clients, you want to shake him. But those who rise quickly can fall the same way and the novel ends in a satisfying way.Lots of subplots, interesting characters and fast paced action keeps you on pins and needles until the end of the story. I think this is a four star book, not quite at the level of his earlier works (The Firm and Pelican Brief), but a huge improvement over later works such as The Summons and The Brethren."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book gets 2 stars because it does present one side of the tort reform debate in an easily digested manner. However, it loses 3 stars because the beginning contains two legal errors so egregious, it's hard to believe that Grisham is a lawyer, or had this book vetted by lawyers. These errors are annoying because the public understands the law mainly through the popular media, so some effort should be made to get it right. In this book, the public defender (Carter) is told by the drug company's sleazy rep (Max Pace) that Carter's indigent drug-addict client killed an acquaintance because the client had an adverse reaction to an experimental drug he had been given in a treatment center. (The experimental drug cures addiction, but in 8% of cases, gives the patient an uncontrollable urge to kill). Max Pace tells Carter that there is nothing he can do for the client anyway, because intoxication or drug use is not a defense to murder. Therefore, he might as well quit the Public Defender's Office and take Max Pace's lucrative offer, in essence working for the drug company. Max (a disbarred attorney himself) assures Carter that there is no ethical violation. This is wrong on all counts. It is true that VOLUNTARY intoxication/drug use is not a defense to a crime. (If you voluntarily drink or get high, you are responsible for the consequences). However, involuntary intoxication is another story - in this case, the young client in good faith took a pill for addiction, given to him by the treatment center. He could not possibly have foreseen the consequences. Thus, he did nothing wrong and cannot be blamed for the death. He had a good defense to the homicide charge, either involuntary intoxication or temporary insanity. An ethical lawyer would have presented the defense, thus implicating the drug company. When Carter abandoned the client, protected the company from involvement in the crime, and took the drug company's money, he had a glaring conflict of interest. Since Carter is portrayed in the book as greedy, Grisham could have explained the law and the ethics violation correctly, and just have had weak, greedy Carter decide to do it anyway. Instead, he misstated the law."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As I began to read the King of Torts, I was under the impression that Clay Carter of the Public Defenders Office was going to sue a drug company and make billions. I thought this would be just like the Rainmaker or the Street Lawyer with Grisham taking on evil, corporate America.Clay Carter does get this chance and he makes a quick fortune through dubious methods and then takes on a case that could make him millions of dollars. At this point, the King of Torts switches gears and becomes something totally unexpected and also pretty boring and dissappointing.Clay Carter started out as an underdog with a chance to change his life. But then Clay turns into the person we all hate, the evil tort lawyer. Grisham shows his obvious distaste for the evil greed of the bigtime tort lawyers, and that redeems this book in some fashion. Yet the story it is trying to tell takes on more of a biographical tone of Clay Carters life. There are no twists or turns or good guys or bad guys. Things just happen to Clay Carter, good and bad, and we are along for the ride.I didn't totally hate this book because its message is against tort lawyers and their greed, but the King of Torts is a big disappointment. There is no depth to the characters. All characters are just an accessory to Clay's life from the bimbo girlfriend to the jilted fiance to the other lawyers who work with him.Grisham has definitely been in a slump lately, with the Painted House being his best work. Grisham is still obviously a great writer, I just hope he soon decides to write a thriller type novel instead of a biography of a greedy tort lawyer."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've read all John Grisham's works, but after being disappointed by The Testament, The Brethren, and The Summons, I promised myself that I'd wait for his next book to hit the bargain racks. However, I'd heard good things about The King of Torts, so I picked it up the day it was released. I was pleased to find that it was more simlar to his earlier work. Now, this book is in no way as good as The Firm or A Time to Kill, but it certainly is worth the read.My biggest complaint with Grisham's recent work is twofold. His latest books have been neither entertaining enough to sustain interest and forgettable enough so that it's tough to remember reading them. The King of Torts addresses both of these complaints nicely. The main character, Clay Carter, is interesting and developed enough so that the reader looks forward to seeing what happens to him. The surrounding cast, though less developed, is still a decent compilation. The other tort lawyers, especially Patton French, are great. Max Pace (anyone remember The Simpson's episode where Homer renamed himself Max Powers) is an interesting guy, though he seems a bit contrived.The plot moves along incredibly well. I began the novel at 10pm with the intention of reading 100 pages or so. I finished it in one sitting. It's really entertaing when Carter, a poor PD, gets the opportunity to earn a quick couple of million and show up his girlfriend's stodgy parents.The only negative that I found in the novel was the lack of a satisfying ending. I would have liked to have had more information on what happened with the individuals who were harmed, the other tort lawyers, and even Clay himself. I really wanted to know more detail on what happened in the Arizona case. I almost felt like Grisham figured that he needed to wrap up the book to meet a deadline or cut the page count short.Despite the fact that I could have used a little more detail at the end, I liked this book. Grisham is one of our best known authors and the expectations readers have of him are high. It was nice to read one of his books that held my attention from start to finish, and I'll now look forward to his next offering.Also recommended: David Ellis's Line of Vision, an excellent courtroom thriller."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"THE KING OF TORTS is John Grisham doing what John Grisham does best (and what he used to do more regularly) - present a compelling legal thriller which reads quickly and delivers a solid message. Granted, Grisham rarely rises to the level of \\"literature\\" (maybe once, in A TIME TO KILL) and he does not go so in depth with his characters or plot lines as, say, Scott Turow, but he is the undisputed master of the quick-hit legal thriller. Yet some of his recent offerings - THE TESTAMENT, THE STREET LAWYER, THE SUMMONS - have been devoid of the power punch that his mid-90s works had (I left out THE BRETHREN from that critique as I thought it was excellent). Well, THE KING OF TORTS returns to the level of, say, THE RUNAWAY JURY or THE CHAMBER in delivering both a quick and thrilling story and a message about something wrong with the American legal system. Without ruining too much of the plot (there are some excellent twists along the way), THE KING OF TORTS follows the rise of a lawyer who had been toiling as a Washington D.C. Public Defender before stumbling into a multi-million dollar venture as a mass tort lawyer suing companies for faulty drugs. Grisham allows the reader to share the thrill of all the new money that lands on the main character - before slowly pulling open the curtain on some serious institutional and ethical problems with this type of lawyering. There are some very memorable characters in this book - most notably a colorful expert mass tort lawyer who befriends and partners with the main character - but the tone of the book follows Grisham's usual depth (nothing too involved) and at time, Grisham (as he has always done) paints characters in black or white - this is a guy you hate; this other person is a saint. Still, that is a formula that always worked well for him, and most happily, THE KING OF TORTS is a return to the \\"social consciousness\\" aspect of his writing (taking on the death penalty in THE CHAMBER; the tobacco lobby in THE RUNAWAY JURY) - notably absent in THE SUMMONS - he forces the reader to ask, does all the litigation against big business really HELP the citizens injured by those businesses? Does it just help the lawyers? Both? Are legal reforms which cap jury award a good thing? A hurtful thing? And on THAT topic, Grisham paints in grays, leaving the reader to ponder the right answer. (Other lawyers may read this book as a blueprint on how to make $100 million in one year without working to hard... though I think that boat has sailed). THis book is an excellent commentary on a recent/current legal fad, as well as a return to what is my favorite aspect of Grisham's writing. Grisham fans will be happy that the author is back to peak form."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is my favorite Grisham novel so far. I was riveted by the plot, the characters, the culture, and the theme. Others have already written what the story is about, so there is no need to repeat it here. I just wanted to cast my vote highly in favor of reading this unforgettable book.Thank you, Mr. Grisham, for writing a stories that take us away into a new and different world from our own. Thank you for the hours of enjoyment in reading your fine novels."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've waited a long time to finally pick this one up because of the negative comments and only a 3 star rating. I finally picked it up and it happened to be a great read. It's a story about an attorney going from rags-to-riches, but this story really sucks you in. I must have finished this book in one sitting because I couldn't put it away. This goes out to all the John Grisham newbies -- READ HIS BOOKS REGARDLESS OF THE RATINGS. This book deserves 4 stars and nothing less. Enjoyable story that flows nicely with well developed characters, and a fine ending."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I'm a big fan of Grisham's, but this book left me disappointed.I did not like the protagonist, even in the beginning. He didn't give us enough time with Clay working at the public defender's office to convince us that he really cared about his clients. He tried, but then gave up. Either show us he absolutely hates his job and his clients (which would help explain him dumping it all to pursue the first lawsuit) or spend more time developing the character to make his chasing the lawsuit more of a \\"best intentions\\" mistake that leads to Clay losing his soul in the end.Max Pace was a totally unbelievable character. He drops out of nowhere, offers no believable explanation for why he is helping Clay, and promptly disappears. Grisham could have tied Pace to Clay's father, or otherwise used him as an agent of one of the companies Clay was suing to blackmail him or otherwise make the lawsuit back-fire, anything! I was waiting the whole book to see what was really going on with Max Pace, and nothing happened.The book should have been a real morality tale, where Clay ends up with NOTHING -- no girl, in jail for fraud or insider trading, or worse. Instead he gets away with the girl and probably goes to live with his dad in the Caribbean with the boat he bought him with dirty money.Not his best effort, but then Grisham's yearly offerings of late have not been stellar.As a side note, it's a shame Grisham has gotten away from strong female protagonists. Females in his books lately seem to serve mostly as \\"eye-candy\\" instead of integral to the plot. McDeere's wife in \\"The Firm\\" comes to mind as a great female character. Would love to see more of that in the future from him."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am new to Grisham novels, so I can't compare this with his other works. I will say that I found this to be a real page-turner though. It's interesting to imagine what it must be like to become so rich overnight, and not too hard to see that the main character is in for some trouble. Grisham does a really good job of developing characters, and while you may not always identify with them or condone their behavior, it's not too hard to empathize once in a while. Anyway, I found this to be very enjoyable and worthwhile, and based on my opinion of this book I will certainly read some others by Grisham in the future."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Loved the book. It kept my attention the whole time. Had a lot of sub-plots that kept the \\"middle\\" of the book great!!!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This story definitely kept me entertained during a 2 day road trip. I couldn't wait to get back in the car!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I really liked this book. It introduces you to the world of the tort lawyer. I always wondered how this system worked; well, this book details it.I like the protagonist. He starts out by hating the greed and conspicuous consumption of the lawyers he is forced to be socialize with. Slowly, insidiously, he becomes one of them, without realizing it.One mild criticism, Grisham is taking it easy and not being as careful and circumspect in writing his books as he should be. There is not as much attention to detail as before, some parts feel 'rushed', and it shows in various parts of the book.Still, a very different book, and very entertaining."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I think Grisham has lost his edge. If this was supposed to be a thriller,comparable to his early work, it fell short. I kept thinking that any moment there would be a surprise twist or something to make it a Grisham worthy read. There is no depth to the characters, the plot was predictable and kind of boring. As others have mentioned, greedy lawyers are kind of a given in tort law, no? I am glad I borrowed this from a friend instead of purchasing it. I have really enjoyed The Firm, The Pelican Brief, Backstreet Lawyer, even the Summons and the Testament. This one - not so much."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This was a great, classic Grisham novel. But what I liked most is the insight into the class action law suits that now seem to be so prevelant in today's society, whether its the tobacco suits or the suits against drug companies. Grisham does a fantasic job of getting you into the mind of the character and feeling his struggle between making a buck and the ethical delimmas that go along with it."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"PLOT: The young litigator Clay Carter works in the office of Public Defenders in Washington D.C. One day he has to take the case of a random street killing. As he scrutinizes the background of his client he stumbles upon a horrible conspiracy and finds himself in the middle of a complex case against one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. A case that might offer a huge settlement that could change his life and make him the king of torts almost overnight...Indeed the short description from the book's reverse sounds really good and promises a thrilling page turner. Unfortunately the description is completely misleading! Just like with \\"The Street Lawyer\\" the reader has to have completely different expectations when he starts this book. The unbelievable incident or secret is mentioned and fully covered in the first quarter of the book! After that the story heads in a completely different direction. A direction which has nothing to do with its initial plot and one that offers nothing remotely thrilling anymore.This book is about the (quick) rise and fall of a tort lawyer. That's it, plain and simple. There is nothing more to it.Therefore this book will not keep you up for long hours and is nowhere near such thrilling novels as \\"The Firm\\", \\"A Time to Kill\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\", has no clever stories as in \\"The Runaway Jury\\" and \\"The Rainmaker\\" or even like the unusual and surprising \\"The Partner\\".\\"King of Torts\\" falls in line with \\"The Street Lawyer\\", \\"The Testament\\" and \\"The Summons\\". You expect rising tension or at least some kind of big bang in the end but it's just not happening.Overall the story is not too bad, the book is well written, easy to understand even for non-native English speakers and can be read on a train or during a longer flight. Therefore you can read \\"King of Torts\\" but you won't miss anything at all if you don't!2 stars only because John Grisham proved he can do a lot better!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I think I was expecting something different when I first read this novel. However, in the vain of \\"The Firm,\\" this book is way above average. It has similar elements: the young atty who has nothing, wo is immediately tempted by all the riches in the world. It even has the fun element of \\"revenge\\" against the arrogant girlfriend who dumped him and snide competitors. Also a huge education on our country's broken tort class-action system. Highly recommended; educational and fun."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I loved it. I read book after book on the train to work and I can't stop thinking about this one. It was a really fun read. A total roller coaster. Three people I work with read the book as well and thought it was great. Surprised to find that it is reviewed so low here. I've not read a Grisham novel since the Client many years ago, but I want to read more now!!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book as a whole was written excellenty. John Grisham did an excellent job keeping you on the edge of your seat. You never knew what was going to happen next. It was a good novel with an excellent plotline that the author kept up with very well. The book starts out with a great opening with tons of details and backround information. This helps keep you going and helps you understand the story and why everythingthat happens. There is a great morale in this story, and John Grishams very helpfull foreshadowing helps along the flow of the novel."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter has been a public defender for too long now, and wants to move ahead fast. When he gets offered an inside tip concerning a big and easy tort case, Clay does not hesitate for long and jumps on the opportunity. The case is about a young man charged with a random street killing, but seems to reach much farther than this when connected to the fact that D.C. is suddenly flooded by many cases of senseless murders. Without much effort Clay succeeds in settling with a big pharmaceutical company that sold a faulty medicine to help drug addicts. With a taste of the big money in his mouth, he finds it increasingly easy to neglect his principles. And why shouldn't he? He now has the best car, a beautiful girlfriend and most importantly some highly influential friends that can tell him where the money is to be found. But all this comes with a price.With King of Torts John Grisham returns to the genre that made him famous: the legal thriller. Indeed, the story of Clay resembles in more that one respect Grisham's mega success of The Firm. The ultra quick rise to fame and fortune of a young lawyer is an obvious link to both books. Nevertheless the undercurrent in King of Torts makes it less of a pure thriller and more a social manifest. It is clear that Grisham has grown a lot since his second novel. More and more he wants to share important messages and criticize the American legal system. Although the subject is indeed very relevant, it remains doubtful if the format of a legal thriller is the best way to share his concerns with the broader audience. Indeed, the initial setting already reveals a lot on how the story will end. Not a lot of effort has been invested in supplying a strong twist towards the end, with the result that the story keeps repeating itself until all pages seem to be filled. Without much ado the final chapter arrives and leaves the reader with an ending that is less than mediocre."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"My husband and I have been long time fans of John Grisham, so much so that we have bought the hardbacks the day they came out. I'm sad to say that this books ending felt like Mr Grisham just got borred with the whole thing or had to hurry to make a deadline. We are very disappointed, so much so we may wait for the paperback next time."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This novel is a successful reworking of many of the themes explored in the author's previous and rather disappointing effort, The Summons: addiction to alcohol and drugs; the rushing to market of prescription medications that turn out to have lethal side effects; ownership of expensive cars, private jets, and yachts; and upward as well as downward economic and social mobility. The geographical descriptions are more vivid, the characters (both major and minor) more memorable and completely drawn, their motivations more plausible, and their interrelationships more nuanced. Like A Painted House, this work is focused and carefully constructed, and it has been pruned of the excesses that mar some of the author's earlier novels. Its tragicomic resolution (or \\"unraveling,\\" as the author calls it), in which love triumphs over lust, and greed is balanced by conscience -- there is even a surprisingly moving case history illustrating the need for tort reform -- is both satisfying and convincing. This book's main flaw, however, lies in the writing. While one does not expect the supple prose of Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge, which developed similar themes of hubris and overreaching, one does wish that Mr. Grisham's editor had reminded him of the difference between amount and quantity, less and fewer, especially in regard to the very first sentence of Chapter One: \\"The shots that fired the bullets that entered Pumpkin's head were heard by no less than eight people.\\" Even my favorite sentence -- \\"The women gave each other looks that would terrify cobras.\\" -- could be improved: \\"The women exchanged glares that would have terrified cobras.\\""},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"From the previews, I was expecting something along the lines of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;. Little man fighting a huge corporation. It turned out differently. The plot is pretty simple, the main character starts out with an almost minimum wage salary, makes millions, then loses it. Everything else is just filler. THis book had the potential for a WHOLE lot more."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am sick of this very ordinary lawyer making millions by posing as a writer. I've read most of Grisham's books, but he lost my respect long ago. My wife brought &quot;Kink&quot; of Torts home from the library, so I'm not out the money. Because Grisham is one of the ten most influential people in the publishing industry, his money talks, and his publishers continue to create small mountains of his books at B&amp;N entrances. This idiocy continues because enough readers are suckers for inane plots with shallow characterization and absolutely horrible endings. If you have any self-respect, you'll pass on John Grisham entirely and read a book by a writer with real talent and story-telling ability."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I wonder why so many one liner reviews for this topnotch thriller opine (in a suspiciously similar juvenile language I may add) that this is not Grisham's best work. Well, may be. But this novel, quite like any other from him, is crispy, fast-paced and very very morally charged.The setting is familiar: a hard-driving grunt lawyer from nowhere, who ever so unknowingly stumbles upon the case of his life, and gets all tangled up in a mess he couldn't have imagined. Several self-same characters line the plot: a rich-man's daughter as a love interest (who's also a model), the girlfriend's insufferably affluent and thus uptight parents, a tried and trusted friend/coworker who'll be right by our lawyer's side, and even an African-American culprit who fell prey to his circumstances (drugs and mafia, of course).There's jetliners (&quot;a kitchen, a bar and restroom in the rear; the latest avionics up front for the pilots&quot;) and high society, suspenseful chases and delectable sleuthing. But this is the ONLY novel I've read from Grisham which had me in a twist over identities. I never quite knew who the good guys, or the protagonists, or both, were. Without divulging any spoilers, I'll say it is something you'll be surprised with. Avarice has no friends.Don't mind the other reviews. This is vintage classy Grisham, with his punchy writing style, and quite a refreshing break from semi-clunkers like The Bleachers or Skipping Christmas.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read all Grisham's book's and this is by far the worst. What a let-down. Unlike his other legal thrillers there is no character to root for, unless you pick Tequila Watson! Whom I hoped Clay Carter would go back and try to rescue somehow. If any author could have swung a 'save' for Tequila I thought Grisham would have been the man. Sorry I wasted my money."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"John Grisham should stop trying to meet his publisher's demands and take some time to write a good book; I'm sure he is capable of writing something other than a &quot;Hollywood-type&quot; book (like hoping to get a screenplay bid - worse he may already have it?) I think it's time that Grisham, Patterson, et al. stop cranking out lousy books. In defense of the book, it was interesting to see how class action suits are put together. Sorry John, please go back and write a great book - I'm sure you are capable of it!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Thought the book was great! Could not put it down....Always a new surprise at the next corner. Highly Recommend! ..."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is the last Grisham I am going to read. It is bad. It is poorly written. It is dull. It has no character you care about. I feel that Grisham started as a writer who had some depth and made it fun to read thrillers while learning a bit about law. However, this book dedicated to greed by both the protagonist and the author is the end. Sorry guys. This is the last one for this kid."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I like to listen to books in the car, and I usually pick something trashy yet entertaining. Grisham almost always fits the bill. Unfortunately, while building this new by-the-numbers courtroom-lawyerdrama, he left out the numbers. Like it was a tumor, anything resembling a plot has been sliced out of the book. It just rambles along, resembling nothing so much as a drunk, stumbling down the street, mutterng incoherently about how things used to be. It's a book without a story, and the mindless entertainment Grisham used to be so dependable on producing has been reduced to simply mindless. I had more fun tossing the CDs to the dog like frisbees than I did listening to them. Yuck."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book has 72 pages left to get good. My wife gave me this book for Valentine's day, and I'm laboring to finish it. I have all of JG's books since the very beginning because I'm a fellow Mississippian. I even have an autographed copy of &quot;The Client.&quot; &quot;The King of Torts&quot; - no mystery, no redeeming qualities in characters, no intrigue - the most boring book I've read in years. Why do I keep buying his books? In the hopes that I'll be pleasantly surprised which hasn't happened in years (with the lone exception being &quot;A Painted House&quot;)!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is what John Grisham does best - what I call a \\"lawyer book!\\" The story moves along quickly and he builds tension well. Clay Carter's rise to wealth and fame is too quick and a bit unbelievable but his fall is justified and necessary.I had to laugh, though. The name Clay makes me think of American Idol finalist Clay Aiken and in my mind that is what Clay Carter looked like! If you haven't heard of Clay Aiken yet, you will. But Grisham couldn't have known this when he named his character.Otherwise I enjoyed this book and read it in two days. I learned a bit about tort law too. Ironically, I am part of a class action suit right now but the stakes are very low, probably with a settlement under $100.00 per person. So it was interesting to me at this point in time.I always look forward to the latest Grisham book and was not disappointed by this one."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"My husband and I very much enjoyed listening to the CD version of The King of Torts. It made the desert miles between Los Angeles and Phoenix go by in a flash. One error did, however, break into the fictional &quot;reality&quot; of the story. The error, which will be obvious to anyone who has ever lived in Arizona, was to report that in Flagstaff in September, the temperature was &quot;105 degrees.&quot; Any editor worth his six figure salary could have checked in a moment and ascertained that Flagstaff is in the mountains at an altitude of roughly a mile and a half. If the temperature in Flagstaff EVER reached 105, even in July, those of us who live in Phoenix would be roasting at somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 degrees. Please! To the rest of the world we already seem enough of a cactus encrusted sandpile!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book is not only an example of the depths to which an attorney will sink to make money, it is an example of what a one time good author will do just to pump out one more book for his money-making machine. I won't be buying anymore of Mr. Grisham's books. Too bad, some of his work is excellent."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"We are the kings.We are the [fools]. The automated buyers of Grisham. ... This book is so predictable, so uncreative and so dull, that I wish I had spent the 4 hours on the golf course instead."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Many of the reviews of John Grisham's I read in the newspapers did not care for The King of Torts, his 15th novel. I, however, enjoyed the book but not as much as his other legal thrillersThe King of Torts is Clay Carter, a 31 year old lawyer who has worked in the public defender's office in Washington, D.C. His newest client is Tequila Watson a young black man who kills another man after leaving a drug rehab center. The next day Clay is approached by Max Pace who says he represents a drug company that produced a drug that caused Tequila and others to kill. The company is willing to pay Clay $15 million to bring a $5 million dollar settlement with the murder victims' families.This case propels Carter into his own law firm, creating a very large venture with many lawyers, paralegals and staff. The firm continues to grow as other mass tort suits are filed. Greed is the key and this will eventually bring down the protagonist.The King of Torts is a good read although some Grisham fans might find it a little disappointing."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Although John Grisham's The King of Torts is a well written novel with an interesting plot and equally entertaining subplots, some readers may not have a 'satisfied' feeling once finished with it, owing to the fact that the story does not have any significant twist, as Grisham best books traditionally do.If you are a long time Grisham fan, then you will not be entirely disappointed with Torts, but if this is your first Grisham novel, go for something older."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter has been a public defender much longer than he cares to admit, and while he dreams of a better life he does not do much to change it, until his girlfriend leaves him and he gets the case of a lifetime.Tequila Watson is a boy of the streets. At twenty years-old with no family to speak of and a criminal and drug history, Tequila lives his life day to day, looking for a score and willing to do anything to get it, so it comes as no surprise when he is accused of killing another street kid by the name of Pumpkin.Clay gets the case and as far as he can see it's open and shut, until he starts investigating and finds shocking evidence that is linked to a huge pharmaceutical company. Clay knows this case could make him an overnight sensation, a king of torts, if he is to win, but everything is not as it seems and Clay may be the pawn in a game larger than he ever imagined.\`The King Of Torts' starts off solid, but then starts falling apart as the plot veers off into different directions. The first hundred pages are very entertaining as the story of Tequila is being developed, but then the plot takes a turn and goes from a legal drama to a financial drama with some thrills thrown in for good measure. As always the writing is first rate, but the changing of plot lines is a big distraction and the financial aspects of the book are not very interesting. \`The King Of Torts' does have a good ending but by that time it's too lateJohn Grisham has been one of my favorite authors, but over the years he has been branching out with his novels and they are just not as good as his earlier work. Mr. Grisham should go back to the formula he is famous for, the formula that was found his best novels...'The Firm', \`A Time To Kill', \`Runaway Jury', \`The Street Lawyer' and \`The Client'.A guaranteed best-seller, \`The King Of Torts' will fly up the best-seller lists, but be warned \\"it's not one of the better Grisham novels\\".Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham's book is fast and entertaining, BUT please remember one thing -- this is entertainment, a FANTASY of how lawyers behave, NOT REALITY. I know people -- ordinary people -- who've been badly hurt and relied on a tort lawyer to seek justice. And the lawyers delivered. In America today, I'm concerned this book will serve as the basis for public debate over the legal system -- and that would be silly. So please, enjoy the twists and turns, but look elsewhere for analysis of what's wrong and RIGHT about our legal system."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I really enjoyed King of Torts, even if half-way through the audio version of this novel, I realized the ending. My main problem, is I felt a tad preached to. I mean, sure mass tort is bad if handled improperly. But would half of these people get ANY money if it weren't for the attorneys? Also, the message \\"Crime Doesn't Pay\\" I mean, seriously, it MUST pay occasionally, otherwise there wouldn't be big wigs like Mr. French hanging around. I don't need to watch the character get deconstructed and brought low to get this message across. I got it loud and clear once Clay started making millions, and his friends started deserting him like rats off a rooster.Personally, I think this would've been much more exciting novel if Clay had spent his time trying to prove that the drug which had been used on Tequila actually existed, rather than becoming the next Joe Millionaire. Also, I felt Clay acted exceedingly out of character by ignoring Tequila's plight, and allowing himself to be swayed by a huckster like Max.Overall, I liked King of Torts. But the message was delivered with the subtlety of a sledge hammer. Alright, I get it: Small town = good, big city = bad, rich people = bad. Tort lawyers = evil. If you can deal with the preachiness, you might like this book. I did."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It's too good to be true. The King of Torts is being set up from the beginning. He has an escapist ride to the top of the heap, but crashes and burns one set of values and has another set ready for the inevitable end. Too much like &quot;The Firm.&quot; To Grisham's credit it is quickly paced so you can finish this dog and find something with more substance."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"&quot;The King of Torts&quot; is a fast paced, enjoyable read of the meteoric career rise of Jarrett Clay Carter II, Attorney-at Law. Trained in criminal defense law at Washington DC's Office of the Public Defender, Carter stumbles into the world of high priced mass tort lawyers when a defendant's random street crime is attributed to a wonder drug's hidden side effects. Having had enough of low pay and indigent clients, Clay signs on for the ride with the &quot;big boys&quot;, deposits the contingent fees and never looks back.Grisham paints a good picture of the excesses associated with successful plaintiffs lawyers, but he does a disservice to the system whereby contingent fee services allow playing field equality for injured victims of corporate shenanigans. The system isn't perfect as Grisham shows us, but no one would ever believe for an instant that Clay Carter, ex-public defender would become the King of Torts in just six months.In any event, Grisham can write. He moves you through the story with deftness and good characters. Of course, Carter's dad is a disbarred attorney living on a sail boat in the Bahamas; of course, Carter's love interests are the daughter of a wealthy DC scion and a Russian model; of course, Carter takes his staff to Paris for a celebration; of course, Carter buys a Gulfstream jet to visit his plaintiff lawyer pals for dinner; and of course, Carter gets himself into a heap of trouble."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book has no plot (except lawyer bashing), no believable charaters and an ending that reminds one of the Lone Ranger riding off into the sunset. One of the worst books I've read in years. Boring, not objective and not realistic. I only finished it because I was SURE that Grisham (whose other books I've liked) must have - at a minimum - included some interesting twist at the end. What did I get? NOTHING! Waste of time, waste of money, waste of paper. The entire book could (and should) have been condensed to one paragraph about the greed of lawyers.
