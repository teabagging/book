It was discovered that the building was not built to specifications because the builders skimped on earthquake prevention fortifications by bribing building officials and inspectors to sign off that it met the code.The prosecution says that known criminal Nicholas Balagula was the mastermind behind the tragedy that led to the calamity. The Feds brought him to trial twice and failed to get a conviction. Now they are trying again and true crime writer Frank Corso is the only journalist allowed to witness the proceedings. Corso wants to see justice served but the case abruptly becomes personal when his ex-girlfriend is almost killed by two goons in the pay of Balagula.G.M. Ford is an excellent writer who tells quite a story. His enigmatic protagonist is a likable chap content with being alone.

The interesting plot is filled with unexpected yet reasonable twists and turns that compels the audience to drive this vehicle in a one sitting pleasurable ride.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"I have read all of Ford's books and liked them, without exception. Fury was a wonderful introduction to a new series. In this second outing featuring Frank Corso, the writing is as tight and lean as ever; the characters are well-developed, and there are plot nuances that elevate this to an above-average book.There are a number of issues that come into play, both primariy and secondary, but not all of them are equally addressed. The ones that are introduced but not adequately addressed have to do with the behavior of some of the secondary characters--in particular, the drinking of prosecutor Renee Rogers. This woman consumes so much booze in the course of the book that Corso's failure even to consider her possible alcoholism is notable, because most definitely the reader cannot help but be aware of it and wonder. The other issue deals with the matter of using children for sexual purposes. In this instance, the author as narrator makes no serious statement on the matter beyond the unvoiced disgust of one of the villains who subsequently makes minced-meat out of the vendor of the child's services. This, too, I found somewhat troubling. It's one thing to introduce this sort of thing in order to indicate just how foul the ultimate bad guy is; but the way it's handled is less than satisfying because this other villain, when given the opportunity, never expresses his personal repugnance. One is left to assume what could and should have been stated--if only to lend additional dimension to the character of Ivanov.That said, Corso is an intriguing man with some laudable sentiments about celebrity, among other things. And there is great pacing to the narrative, as well as some nicely convoluted plotting. I will very definitely be waiting with anticipation for the next Corso adventure.Recommended."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"Frank Corsi, reclusive investigative reporter, is the only spectator permitted in the trial of a West Coast crime boss (an unwelcome import from the Russian Mafia) who bribery and intimidation permitted a huge profit on building a hospital.

Ford's Frank Corso series. He is so much better than James Patterson has become. Other reviewers have discussed the plot which is well drawn. The real mystery is why this author doesn't make the bestseller lists. He should."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"While better known for his Leo Waterman series, G. M. Ford has begun an interesting new series featuring the reclusive Frank Corso. First seen in Fury, Frank Corso is back and as dark as ever. Since this novel picks up approximately seven months after events depicted in Fury and refers to those events repeatedly throughout this novel, I would strongly urge prospective readers to read Fury first before reading this novel. It simply isn't possible to review this novel without giving away a few details, which would be better covered in their entirety in Fury. Having said that, I am simplifying greatly the plot and storyline to keep out as much as possible for those unfamiliar with the previous novel.For years, the government has chased the Russian mobster Nicholas Balagula through one trial after another with no success. Balagula sees United States justice as a game-a game where he has always won by jury tampering, violent intimidation and the murder of witnesses. Now, he is on trial once again. This time, he is being tried for the deaths of 63 people who lost their lives in a hospital building collapse. The trail has been moved from California up to Seattle and extraordinary measures are being taken to protect the safety and integrity of the jury and the case.Frank Corso is the only non-participant allowed to attend the murder trial of Balagula. His well-publicized notoriety and connections gets him unlimited access and he hopes to turn the project into another one of his true crime books. While he wants another success on his hands, he also wants the government to win. At the same time, with a grandstanding golden boy of the United States Attorney's Office in charge, Warren Klein, he has his doubts whether they can do the job. It looks like his suspicions are correct as from the beginning the trial things begin to go wrong and like most golden boys of one stripe or another, Klein blames everyone else for his mistakes.While his suspicions concerning the case have been initially confirmed, Corso isn't really paying attention. His old flame and very special friend, Meg Dougherty, is in intensive care in the hospital. Apparently in her occupation as a photojournalist, she witnessed something so horrendous that she drove her car under a parked semi in a desperate attempt to get away that nearly resulted in her death. Corso wants to find out what she saw as well as clearing himself from the suspect list as the police seemed convinced that he had some hand in her near death.Frank Corso is an interesting and hard to define character. This novel reveals a little more about his personality and what drives him while at the same time managing to hide a tremendous amount behind his darkly complex personae. As in his other books, a certain sense of darkness and moral decay pervades the work. Full of interesting complex characters, tight writing and multiple themes make this another good read. Once again, he provides a journey where justice is not an absolute black and white stereotype, but shades of gray. G. M. Ford's books are never simplistic stories with two-dimensional characters but complicated stories featuring multidimensional characters and shades of moral nuance. As always, this is another one of his books well worth reading."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"I read a lot of books. I wish there were more writers like G. M. Ford, who take real people and put them into ambiguous situations and let them struggle with the consequences of their decisions and behavior.Frank Corso is one of those flawed characters who finds himself in the middle of a huge jigsaw puzzle involving corrupt contractors, inspectors, jurors and more than enough bad guys to fill out the mix.Corso's a Seattle-based writer with some mistakes in his past, a huge financial settlement in his bank account, and a reclusive lifestyle.Corso is the only invited guest to the murder trial of Nicholas Balagula, a bad-to-the-bone mobster who is responsible for the deaths of 63 people when the hospital he built collapses. This is Balagula's third trial and the prosecution is looking pretty secure. Corso is taking notes and gathering material for his new book when his world is rocked by the savage attack on his former girlfriend, a photojournalist who believes there's a link between the seemingly insignificant death of a school district's maintenance man and the Balagula trial.After the assault, Corso's thrown into a whirlwind of plot twists, bad guys, and paper trails. There's even some Cambodian culture thrown in for good measure (maybe the beginnings of a new book?).I like Frank Corso and found myself drawn into the plot lines, even though the tidy Hollywood-like ending was a bit too predictable.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"One of the pleasures of reading Ford's books is the sheer strength of his writing. This is true whether he is being deadly serious or wryly humorous, as he was in his previous series. While he is a 'no frills' writer, he accomplishes his goal by having an unerring sense of the proper word or construct.In this story, the sequel to Fury, we again meet up with Frank Corso, a journalist who lost his cachet when he wrote a story based on falsified evidence. Since that time he has moved to Seattle where his determination has found him a new job and let him reestablish himself as a newsman and a writer. He has been allowed to sit in on the trial of Nicholas Balagula, a ruthless crime boss who has never been brought to justice. But when photojournalist Meg Dougherty, Corso's closest friend is suddenly attacked and very nearly killed a different kind of trial emerges, with Corso sitting in the judge's seat.A tangled web of loose connections sends Corso down the dark side of the city, tracking down hired killers, builders, and janitors to find what Meg saw that put her in a hospital. Corso isn't a genius, but a determined seeker who can eventually work his was through the toughest knot. Although this time what he doesn't know very nearly kills him.As always, Ford's characters a gem-like. While the bad guys are 'bad,' the good guys aren't angels, and individual idiosyncrasies bring them all to life. The main characters do develop, but slowly. It has taken Corso two novels to move from his initial bitterness to a dark cynicism. For all that Meg is unconscious for most of the book, she has changed the most, which brings out the best and the worst of Corso's character.Like a typical shallow fan, I wasn't all that comfortable when Ford switched from Leo Waterman. I had gotten used to the humorous antics of the alcoholic bums who made up Waterman's investigatory team. But Corso is a compelling character, and this new series may very well be closer to what Ford really wanted to accomplish. In any case, I think you will find Black River great entertainment."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"The protagonist in G.M.

Possible jury tampering, intimidation, and the fortuitous deaths of witnesses have kept Balagula from spending the rest of his notoriously immoral life in prison. But federal prosecutors may have a turned a witness, someone who can testify to Balagula's direct involvement in the disaster. Granted status as the only nonparticipant allowed at the trial, Frank Corso, reclusive author of popular true-crime novels is forced back into the public eye amid media speculation that he is consulting for the prosecution. Then Corso's insulated life is thrown into chaos when his ex-lover Meg Dougherty, while pursuing an investigation of her own, is involved in a car accident that leaves her battered and bloody body hanging to life by a thread. Pursuing justice for his one, best friend while following the course of the trial Corso is pulled into the muck of a black river of deceit, corruption, and murder.Ford's latest bad guy isn't as reprehensible as Corso's previous foe, the Trashman, but perhaps he just seems less disgusting because we're exposed to reports of unethical business practices in the news so often. Hospitals and homes are lined up along the San Andreas Fault as we read. Balagula's method to find the members of an anonymous, sequestered jury would make a market researcher proud. And even the most competent of employees will have bad days: finding the guy you're to hit already dead, buried bodies floating to the river's surface, taking out the wrong people. I almost felt sorry for these two killers. The flow of the Black River of the title is disrupted by progress, but \\"it's a river's nature to remain a river.\\" As Balagula proclaims his innocence the progress of his criminal empire continues to flow.

Murrow to W olfman Jack and Howard Stern","review":"Please take note that Susan J. Douglas' &lt;Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination&gt; (Times Books, 1999) is no mere history of radio. It was triggered by a request from the Sloan Foundation that was preparing a series of books on technology and American culture; and the emphasis is not on the details but on the general effect radio has on us from its beginnings. And take another note. This is too enjoyable a read to be considered a textbook.My favorite chapter was the one called &quot;Radio Comedy and Linguistic Slapstick.&quot; Here only a few comics are used as examples to support her several theses, one of which is the emasculation of the American male by the use of such high-pitched speakers as Jack Benny and Joe Penner. Of course there is lots of room for argument, but she does let the facts speak for themselves (pun intended).The other chapters are &quot;The Zen of Listening,&quot; &quot;The Ethereal World,&quot; &quot;Exploratory Listening in the 1920s,&quot; &quot;Tuning In to Jazz&quot; &quot;The Invention of the Audience,&quot; &quot;World War II and the Invention of Broadcast Journalism,&quot; &quot;Playing Fields of the Mind,&quot; &quot;The Kids Take Over: Transistors, DJs, and Rock 'n' Roll,&quot; &quot;The FM Revolution,&quot; &quot;Talk Talk,&quot; &quot;Why Ham Radio Matters,&quot; and &quot;Conclusion: Is Listening Dead?&quot;Which of us has not been affected in many of the ways Ms. Douglas points out in this book?

And I do hope she produces a similar book about television."},{"Title":"Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination, from Amos 'n' Andy and Edward R. Murrow to W olfman Jack and Howard Stern","review":"Radio has become such a background part of our lives, we forget just how astounding an impact it has had on our culture and psyche. Susan Douglas brings it all back to the foreground in her book &quot;Listening In.&quot; This is not just a chronicle of the development of the media, this book takes us deep into the social impacts of radio, and how it changed how we react and interact with each other. Douglas has perfectly captured the feel and &quot;tone&quot; of different periods of radio listening, and explores a lot of the psychological aspects of how radio let us sample and explore different parts of our American cultue in a safe and nonthreatening way.As a present-day radio fanatic, the book gave me hope: hope that the medium hasn't been corporatized into complete blandness. Radio will continue to evolve, just like our American culture.Whether your're a radio technology type, an old time radio fan, or just a student of American history, you'll find something to love in this book."},{"Title":"Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination, from Amos 'n' Andy and Edward R.

Though I wrinkled my nose at the over-emphasis on the gender conflict in radio, Listening In reminded me of a time when people participate in a common culture instead of idly sitting by listening to the umpteenth Top 40 hit made by over-commercialized &quot;plastic&quot; bands.The ham radio chapter was simply great and I give Dr. Douglas her due for mentioning the American Radio Relay League as the national association for hams. From this chapter, I can see why hams have a nurturing touch in their approach to life! The section on radio comedy is well done (the comedy bits are good for a chuckle or two).

Murrow to W olfman Jack and Howard Stern","review":"I'm a long-time, Philadelphia record collector, collecting 1950s rhythm 'n' blues music - vocal groups and single artists. While knowledgeable about radio disc jockeys, my knowledge is weak regarding radio history. Traipsing through Amazon.com, I stumbled upon and bought Listening In: Radio and the Imagination (University of Minnesota Press, 2004 edition). My specific interests were Chapter Nine \\"The Kids Take Over: Transistors, DJs and Rock 'n' Roll\\" and Chapter 4 \\"Tuning in to Jazz.\\" As of this review, I have not read the remaining 10 chapters nor the text's conclusions.Dr. Douglas, in one complete, 16 word sentence, provided the reader with 6 unique pieces of factually wrong information. Let us forensically dissect the following sentence. Dr. Douglas wrote, \\"Chicago's WVON - \\"Voice of the Negro\\" - became, in 1947, the nation's first black owned radio station...\\" (page 234).Factual Error #1. The year was wrong. The first black owned radio station came into existence in 1956. Not 1947.Factual Error #2. The state was wrong. The first black owned radio station was located in Michigan. Not Illinois.Factual Error #3. The city was wrong. The city was Romulus. Not Chicago. It was licensed to broadcast in Inkster, Michigan.Factual Error #4. The radio call letters were wrong. The first black owned radio station's call letters were WCHB-AM. Not WVON.Factual Error #5 Radio station call letters WVON did not exist anywhere in 1947. WVON debuted April 1, 1963Factual Error #6 WVON was never black owned. The original owners of WVON were Leonard and Phil Chess, owners of Chess Records. The Chess brothers were white. WVON began as WHFC in 1926. WHFC became WVON when the Chess brothers bought WHFC and changed the call letters.Who and what were Dr. Douglas' sources for this amazing, treasure trove of mis-information? Publishers Weekly favorably wrote, \\"...Douglas delivers a carefully researched and well-documented look at the medium and the people who listened...\\" I think not."},{"Title":"Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination, from Amos 'n' Andy and Edward R. Murrow to W olfman Jack and Howard Stern","review":"I love radios and radio. I have always loved radio, so much so, in fact, that I have taken it upon myself to learn how to repair and restore old tube radios for the unique sound that they posses. I bought Susan J. Douglas's book \\"Listening In . . . \\" because of the preponderance of good reviews. I'll admit to only having gotten as far as page 9, when I came accross a startlingly inaccurate statement. She writes \\"The press and most cultural observers ignore radio, except when Stern pushes his own rather relaxed limits of tastefulness too far,or when conservative talk show hosts instruct their listeners on the best method for gunning down federal officials.\\" This is just 2 sentences after mentioning Rush Limbaugh specifically. Now regardless of your political bent, this is just flat out inaccurate. I have listened to Rush Limbaugh for over 3 years on an almost daily basis and he has never, not even hinted at gunning down anyone, government or otherwise. Rush Limbaugh has the largest radio audience at present and possibly ever. He has more listeners on a daily basis than almost any national news show, including the televised news shows on ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN. So she has her facts wrong on arguably the most popular radio show in history. Now we're talking about facts here, not politics. Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Jeff Beck and Mark Levin, the 4 most listened to shows on talk radio, probably in radio history, never talk about gunning down anyone, period. It's not about politics. It's about facts. You don't have to like these people. You just have to be able to admit to the facts. The Rush Limbaugh Show has something like 10+ times the average daily listeners when compared to any news show on CNN, NBC or CBS. She is apparently writing a tomme about the psychology of radio listening without ever having listened to the most popular radio shows ever and is ignorant of the published ratings. I have to question that. Where did she get that notion from, I wonder? Let's hope it was Amy Goodman on Pacifica, at least that's the radio. What other facts does she get wrong in this book? Well, on to page 10. Let's hope she can pull this one out. I'll give her the 2nd star for hope and the book was only about $13."},{"Title":"Estonian Textbook: Grammar Exercises Conversation (Indiana University Uralic and Altaic, Vol 159)","review":"Juhan Tuldava did a excellent job when compiling this Estonian Grammar Textbook. Many textbooks fail to have the methodical and logical methods that this textbook possesses. This book is good for both beginners and American-Estonian readers, as well as being a useful grammatical and educational tool for those who immigrated to the states as children and need some grammatical structure to their oral competence. Containing both colloquial expressions and language, pronunciation guides, Estonian-english dictionary, as well as guide to idiomatic and more formal language, this will give the reader a very firm understanding of the Estonian language. In every chapter this textbook includes grammatical concepts, a text to sharpen reading abilities, vocabulary lists of and average length of 50-100 words, expressions, and excercises to increase competence. The texts are often written in humorous terms and are enjoyable to read. Even for those with no interest in a thorough study of Estonian grammar will find they can expand their repertoire of conversational phrases and common sayings conveniently indexed.

Due to both a personal interest in languages and a work that include language coverage, I've gone through well over 300 language courses in my days. Even though it's a though race, I would say this is best language course ever written. The amount of vocabulary introduced to the learner exceeds most other course; after finishing this course you will know about twice as many words as after finishing the average Colloquial course and three times as many as after an average Teach Yourself course. The Estonian language, being one of the few languages in Europe not belonging to the Indo-European language family, has got a grammatical system that might seem daunting for English speakers - and for most other Europeans. Tuldava succesfully manages to introduce all of the Estonian grammar in this course, and he has split it up into the right portions of new grammar in each lesson. You constantly feel that you are progressing while never feeling overwhelmed. The lay-out is clear and userfriendly, the vocabulary lists of each lesson are put into two nice tables. And finally, there are many exercises AND answers to all the exercises (surprisingly enough, many authors of language courses ignore giving the answers to the exercises).If there was a Nobel Prize for writing language courses, I believe it should go to Tuldava. Prospective authors of a language course would do well to use this course as their model."},{"Title":"Estonian Textbook: Grammar Exercises Conversation (Indiana University Uralic and Altaic, Vol 159)","review":"After hearing good reviews from friends while studying in Tallinn, I finally found a copy of 'Estonian Textbook' on Amazon - it was sold out in all the bookstores I checked, including Raava Raamat (equivalent of Borders).I'm impressed by the 'bite sized' lessons which don't take a lot of time or energy to complete, but contain a very detailed outline of grammar and a decent amount of vocabulary. The satisfaction of being able to understand the short reading passage at the end of a lesson without looking at the vocabulary alone is well worth the book's price tag.V&auml;ga hea!"},{"Title":"Estonian Textbook: Grammar Exercises Conversation (Indiana University Uralic and Altaic, Vol 159)","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this is the best and most approachable grammar of the Estonian language available for English speakers.BUT... beware that some of the phrases, vocabularly and grammatical constructions are a bit old-fashioned. Furthermore, the book could be a bit better organized. Namely, some chapters in this book cover relatively trite grammatical concepts (e.g. the nominative plural), while others are more involved (the passive perfect and passive voice). Also, Tuldava introduces the singular and plural partitives fairly late and hence, doesn't include them in the earlier vocab lists (which I think is fairly inefficient).Regarding those lists, each chapter presents the reader with very long vocabularly sections so that, in my opinion, if this is used as an exclusive text then it would quite easily overwhelm the learner with vocabularly.So, this is a must-have for any English-speaking learner of Estonian, but mostly as a grammar reference to be used in conjunction with a more up-to-date text."},{"Title":"Estonian Textbook: Grammar Exercises Conversation (Indiana University Uralic and Altaic, Vol 159)","review":"This is the best textbook I have seen for learning any language.There are very few english books available for learning Estonian, and for good reason, this is the bible, you don't need any others.Very well structured, breaks the language intricacies down into small pieces, and very easy to pickup a short lesson and finish it before work, or on a quick lunch break."},{"Title":"Estonian Textbook: Grammar Exercises Conversation (Indiana University Uralic and Altaic, Vol 159)","review":"Unlike most of the previous reviews, I don't see the reason for the extremely positive ratings assigned to this course.PROS:- Grammar is presented in relatively small installments (40 chapters) and the presentation usually does not make a user feeling overwhelmed- Vocabulary lists are extensive and each word includes all pertinent grammatical information (e.g. genitive and partitive endings for nouns; conjugation patterns for verbs). Under ideal conditions, one's command of Estonian vocabulary is definitely better after using this course when compared to the results obtained after completing \\"Colloquial Estonian\\" or \\"Teach Yourself Estonian\\"- Answer key for almost all exercises- Each chapter also includes a small list of idioms or phrases that would be used in specific situations (e.g. greetings, expressions of surprise, expressions used when discussing your views)CONS:- No audio included- Inadequate amount of exercises to help with retention of material- Vocabulary list at the end of the book is Estonian to English only.Because of these cons, I cannot rate this course as 5 out of 5 and could not consider it as the best language course ever. However I agree that as a base, Tuldava's approach is sound. Self-instructional textbooks for other languages (e.g. \\"Colloquial Estonian\\", \\"Teach Yourself Slovene\\", \\"Colloquial Finnish\\") would have done well to have emulated the format of Tuldava's course. In addition, this book can also act as a serviceable reference manual on Estonian grammar (the only one that I know of is an old reference grammar of about 180 pages written by Robert T. Harms.

When she is confronted with magic, her world-view falls apart. Fortunately she has friends she can trust and learns more about how to navigate the sometimes dangerous magical world.The hero of this story, Reason, is a smart, idiosyncratic and sympathetic young person. The story unfolds quickly and is filled with suspense. Reason must find her place in a magical world, rather than continually try to explain things that happen in terms of. . . reason!It is clear that the author is among those who believe that one of the pitfalls of modernity is the over-reliance on reason. This adherence to a doctrine of rationality despite the evidence of the senses leaves its acolytes at the mercy of forces they cannot understand. But these ideas are in the background--the story and the spunky personalities of the characters are vital and undimmed by any ideology. A fun read!"},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"I think this author has a great imagination with a lot of fantastic ideas, but she was a little lukewarm on the whole magic front. She never explained any of anything, by the end of the book I still had no idea what was going on, so that is to say that throughout the whole book I never knew what was happening.As you can see, this book drove me crazy. I couldn't believe how the author refused to let any single plot line be, instead she had to jump from one thing to the other like she couldn't decide. I would much have prefered Reason stay in Sydney, Australia the whole time just so some of the questions all the readers had could have been answered. This book is possibly the most frustrating book I have ever read.I think the author wanted to wait until the second book of the trilogy to explain everything so she explained absolutely nothing to us in this book. I say skip this, and wait for the second book, that's what I wish I'd done. As I said, great potential, but no followthrough on, really, any front."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"I have alluded (or more like outright stated) in my previous reviews my love of anything to do with witches and magic. Even thinking about anything remotely to do with magic instantly brings me back to a much more innocent place in my life. Ever since this, okay I'll say it, obsession with this type of world started, I've been searching for books about magic that would take me back to the wonderment I first felt by watching something about it (Charmed) and reading something about it (Harry Potter). Some of the books have been good, but most of them have been a tad on the mediocre side. Magic or Madness, unfortunately, falls under the latter.First of all, the main character, Reason was completely inconsistent. No 15 year old is that nave. It just doesn't happen. After a while, it did start to grate a little. In fact, every time Jay-Tee was getting annoyed at the same thing and wanting to punch Reason, I kept thinking that she should totally go for it. And as the story progressed, I was wishing for navet&eacute; to come back because Reason was starting to turn into a damn idiot. But going back to the inconsistent part, she was taught to be on guard and a bit on the paranoid side. However, she just stands by and swallows all the fake crap that people tell her. It was like everyone else was saying \\"Dance, puppet, dance!\\" and Reason was all, \\"I shouldn't...but OKAY!!!!\\" And then there are moments when she starts being wise (after like 24 hours which also makes it inconsistent) and then goes back to being an idiot. In fact, I found reason and Tom (her maybe love interest in the future) both idiots. Tom was all \\"I have to SAVE Reason\\", yet all he does for most of the book is stop by a caf&eacute; or a restaurant to eat something. He was equally as useless as Reason.The only characters I even remotely liked were Jay-Tee and Esmeralda. I found Jay-Tee to be refreshing and I've always been drawn to \\"troubled\\" characters. Mostly because they tend to be less annoying than the actual goody-goodies in YA books (and this is coming from someone who was a complete goody-goody in high school). I was also extremely intrigued by Esmeralda. So much that I was hoping that she would narrate some chapters of the book (yes I know it's a YA book so I should've known she wouldn't). Again, it could be my love of \\"troubled\\" characters shining through. The magic in the Magic or Madness was also intriguing. It's too bad that it was only lightly touched upon in this book.So, Magic or Madness was a bit of a bust for me. I just didn't find Reason's portrayal realistic. Neither was Tom, come to think of it. Will I read the second book? Probably. But only because of that interesting storyline involving Esmeralda that I think may come up. But it sure as hell won't be anytime soon."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"Reason Cansino has been brought up to believe that magic is not real, and that her grandmother, a believer of magic and practitioner of dark rituals, is evil. So in order to evade her, Reason and her mother Sarafina have lived on the run all over Australia. All that changes when Sarafina goes mad when Reason is fifteen years old and Reason is sent to live with the wicked witch herself.But Reason didn't spend a lifetime with her mother without learning anything--she's got a plan of escape. But that plan involves walking out of the back door of her grandmother's house--out of a door she doesn't know will take her to a completely different world far different from Sydney, Australia--New York City.Magic or Madness is a completely unique take on magic and urban fantasy from a very talented author. Reason's background and her abhorrence of magic are thoroughly explained, and her loyalty and spunk are to be admired. Throughout the course of the novel, the exact workings of magic aren't explained, which may cause some impatience for readers, and the plot does drag slightly towards the middle of the book, but picks up again after the introduction of a new character, and after Reason and her new friend Jay-Tee realize the danger of another. Larbalestier exposes readers to a tantalizing and dangerous version of magic that comes with hard truths and some deadly consequences, but is engaging and appealing nevertheless. The book leaves off with an open ending and some slightly under developed characters that will inspire excitement for the next book in the trilogy, Magic Lessons."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"Really a fun, fun book.

I Put Justine Larbalestier right up there with Charles de Lint, Emma Bull, and Neil Gaiman.Magic or Madness has Interesting and fresh story line (instead of the usual set in \\"Fairyland\\" Urban Fantasy's). No monsters from another world just \\"magical people of this world\\" living real lives with magic.Open this book and you will open up a door to a magical world you didn't know possible, but the characters are so real you almost feel the experience yourself.I am almost done with the second book of the trilogy and will start the third immediately following.

Reason's mother, Sarafina, has taken them all over Australia, mostly to remote Aboriginal settlements. Reason has only been to a real school once, but Sarafina has taught her lots of things, mostly math and some science.Reason has been happy with her life, but when Sarafina goes crazy--really crazy, as in trying to kill herself instead of her usual craziness consisting of things like making them walk in straight lines for days--all of that comes to an end. Reason is sent to live with Esmeralda in Sydney. She's expecting the dark, scary house of her mother's stories. The one where Sarafina's cat was murdered. The house where dark magic takes place--imaginary magic, of course, as Sarafina has always said that magic isn't real. It's too illogical.What Reason finds, however, is a spacious, light house, not at all witchy. There are no animal sacrifices in the living room, no bubbling cauldrons in the kitchen. That can't undo the belief that years of Sarafina's stories have created, though. Reason is sure that something is going on underneath the surface, and she's got to run away and get out of Sydney as soon as possible. She's got to rescue Sarafina from the loony bin where she's been locked up.Sydney's not all bad, though. Reason meets Esmeralda's neighbor, a boy about her age named Tom. She'll be sorry to leave him behind, but it looks like he's working with Esmeralda, and she's got to get away from the witch.Reason's escape from Sydney doesn't exactly go as planned. Instead of escaping with her mother and all of her supplies, Reason finds herself on a winter street in New York City, barefoot and with nothing, after stepping through Esmeralda's back door.She doesn't know how she ended up there, but she's grateful to Jay-Tee, the teenage girl who rescued her from the freezing, alien streets. She thinks that Jay-Tee is just a friendly passerby...But could there be more to it than that? What is going on? How did Reason step through a door from Sydney to New York? That's just not possible. What secrets are being hidden from her?MAGIC OR MADNESS is a wonderful novel from Justine Larbalestier, who's married to one of my favorite authors of all time, Scott Westerfeld. It's a fascinating story, and the way it's told is a little unconventional: some chapters are told in a first person point of view, in Reason's voice, and others are told in a third person limited point of view, from inside either Jay-Tee's or Tom's mind. These three different points of view could be confusing, but Justine Larbalestier pulls it off wonderfully.The story itself is quite a page-turner. I read this book when it first came out, and reread it after getting my own copy in paperback, and I loved it both times. The characters are all wonderfully realistic and interesting. Each answer Reason finds only leads to more questions, keeping suspense throughout the story. The writing is fantastic, and I'm really looking forward to the third book in the trilogy,Magic's Child (Magic Or Madness), coming in 2007!Reviewed by: Jocelyn Pearce"},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The first two are worth the ride."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"This book, like many others I've recently read, was difficult to get into, but once the reader familiarizes themselves with the tone, reads wonderfully. There is heavy description in places, and that got extremely distracting, but the story itself is a good one. There is suspense, although one could easily argue that there is far too much suspense, leaving the reader to want answers more than the main character herself! The sometimes-alternating POV is confusing and probably not entirely necessary, as the story moves along great when Reason is the one telling it. Some things still make very little sense, and I'm hoping they are explained in the later books. I feel like Reason's mom should have gotten more time on the page, and again, there's something I hope is remedied in Magic Lessons. The end leaves the reader still not entirely sure who to trust and desperately hoping to see what happens next. There is heavy foreshadowing, and I really do hope, as suggested, that Reason does have more options than just the very bleak ones she is currently being offered. Looking forward to Magic Lessons and hopefully more intriguing revelations!Rating: 4/5"},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"What I loved about this story most was the twist it offered regarding magic. In most fantasy books, you either have magic or you don't. In Magic or Madness, however, magic was a burden that caused the bearer to choose his/her sacrifice. Either you use the magic and die young or you don't use it and go mad. Oh and there's one other option. You can suck the magic out of innocent victims.I liked the characters. The main character was cool and reacted in a way expected of a young girl finding out about magic for the first time. Jay Tee reminded me of a teenage prostitute being held captive by her pimp. When she wasn't victimized by it, though, she was cool. I wasn't crazy about Tom, because I thought he was a little weird hanging out with an old lady all the time. That was another reason the book did not get a 5. In the beginning, we are led to believe that Reason's grandmother was a villain. But when finally introduced to her, we find her to be young and beautiful and glamorous. She never actually did anything wrong. She never said anything cruel. We only had Reason's word for it. I would have liked it better if the author villain-ized the grandmother more in the beginning so the reader could relate to Reason's estrangement. Even in the end (of this book and the series), I wasn't sure what to think of her. That left me unsatisfied.Overall, I loved the trilogy and look forward to more books by Justine Larbalestier."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"This had all the elements that had me excited: magic as a disease, a gateway to two modern cities, and cool non-white characters. An aboriginal heroine! Please let it be good!Then I read the book. It's not difficult to get into, as the writing's smooth enough (rather too simple) but there's not much of it, as if you've added only one spoon of the chocolate mix when you need to add five to have something delicious. Events, scenes, plot, were all stretched out, probably to fit three books instead of one. And that's where it got boring, and rather weak. Not a dense, beautiful world that's brimming over with fantasy.Rather than magic, or the premise (which is exciting at first, then you wonder WHY does it take the character 250 pages to find out what the reader picked up at page 20), the book seemed more interested in fooling around with the minor differences between American and Australian English."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"I loved this book so much.

What if you knew that using magic could kill you, and not using magic would drive you to the brink of insanity? Which would you choose?In Justine Larbalestier's first novel for teens, Magic or Madness, a teenage girl learns the truth about magic: not only does it exist, but it runs through the veins of all of the women in her family. They choose to either use their magic and die young, or repress it and go mad. Her mother, who raised her alone, went the latter route and can no longer take care of her only daughter.Without her mother, Reason is lost in more than one way. Her grandmother, who is depicted as a villain in all of her mother's stories, takes Reason in when she has no other place to go. Reason then meets her gran's neighbor, a boy her own age, and Jay-Tee, a girl who lives in New York - which magically appears outside of her grandmother's door. As Reason travels back and forth between the two continents, her innate magic begins to unfold like the wings of a butterfly. It is just as fragile as those wings, and just as likely to carry her away.Make sure that you read Justine Larbalestier's inventive trilogy in order. Magic or Madness is only the first chapter of Reason's story. She then takes Magic Lessons, and, finally, delivers Magic's Child."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"This novel has a lot of good ideas, but gets distracted and goes off into several different directions at once. First we meet Reason, a surprisingly sophisticated 15 year old for someone who's never been to school and has lived in the bush with a crazy mother her entire life. She's going to live with her grandmother who is a horrible, evil witch--at least according to Sarafina, the aforementioned mad maternal figure. Grandma seems quite normal. at least on the surface, and writes 3 letters to explain things (which Reason never reads--extremely frustrating). Reason explores the house and finds a collection of human teeth the remains of a dead cat that was killed in some sort of bizarre ceremony. (Neither of these incidents is brought to a conclusion within the book.)Reason leaves all these loose ends behind to frolic with the teenage warlock-in-training/clothes designer next door who is then put aside before his story can get too interesting.So the heroine runs off to New York City through grandma's magic door to hang out with Jay-Tee, a homeless kid working for an evil magician. Something terrible happened to Jay Tee to drive her away from her family but the author doesn't bother to go into details on this either beyond a few tantilizing clues.Then Reason meets her evil grandfather and... you guessed it. Everyone flees back to Sydney, Austrailia lest any loose ends get tied up which might satisfy the reader's curiousity.\\"Magic or madness\\" is part of a trilogy, the author is clearly going to make you buy all three books before she answers any of the many questions she has posed.Shame on the editor and publisher for allowing an unfinished story like this to go into print."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"It was a good book but not great.

The 3 teens often contradict each other which makes the different points of view all the more real.Reason has spent her whole life hiding from her grandmother who is a witch. R's mother doesn't believe in magic and raises her believe only in the rational. When her mother goes insane, R is taken by the authorities and placed with her grandmother. R quickly finds out that magic is real when she steps through a door in her grandmother's house and finds herself in New York City. The book is fast paced and mysterious. It is difficult to figure out who is on Reason's side and who is plotting against her, even to the end of the book.

Justine Larbalestier is a wonderful talented new author. You won't be disappointed starting this series."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"Magic or Madness does a nice job of plunking us down in mid-story, giving us a sense of early momentum that seldom pauses the rest of the way. Reason Cansino has been kept on the move in the Australian bush for most of her 15 years, in order, her mother says, to keep her safe from Esmeralda, Reason's dangerous grandmother. Serafina, Reason's mother, has filled Reason's mind with stories of Serafina being held captive as a young child in Esmeralda's cellar, of Esmeralda's animal sacrifices and dark rites all in the name magic, which she impresses upon Reason, doesn't exist. But now, having seemingly gone from simply strange to truly crazy, Serafina is Institutionalized in a Sydney mental hospital and can no longer protect Reason, who as the book opens is being taken to Esmeralda's house by the \\"witch\\" herself.This sense of coming into the story mid-stream does a good job of adding a sense of history to the ensuing story, as well as a feeling of suspenseful urgency. Her mother's tales weren't completely true, Reason finds out early enough (the house for instance is bright and airy rather than gothically dark), but neither are they completely false (something is buried in the corner of the cellar).In an attempt to run away, Reason walks through a door and somehow ends up in New York City. Magic, therefore, does exist, and its existence, its effects on her family and herself, its temptations and dangers, all play a major role from then on. Along the way to trying to learn some answers, Reason meets several youths of her same age who may or may not practice magic and may or may not be her allies. The adults she comes into contact with do practice magic, but once again, their motivations and trustworthiness are unclear.The strengths of the book are many. It is tautly constructed with a quick, urgent pace. Shifts in narration among the youthful characters and a third-person narrator add suspense and lend some variety to the voices telling the story. The young people are quickly but sharply characterized and mostly have a sense of authenticity in their actions and language. The magic is low-level through most of the story, acting mostly as an underlying sense of menace and mystery until the very end, where it makes a more pronounced entrance. The main storyline is pretty straightforward, but the unclear agendas of the adults, and their use of the children to achieve those agendas, makes for a nice complexity. Not only is one unsure as to who exactly is \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\", by the end those terms have been shown to be gross over-simplifications. Life is seldom so simple and neither is what is going on this book (the first of a projected trilogy).Most of the flaws are relatively minor. The adult characters are so far more shallowly depicted, but Esmeralda deepens toward the end and one assumes/hopes that will continue in book two. Some of the plot events are a bit contrived or make use of hard-to-believe coincidence. But these are easily overlooked.The largest and most annoying flaw, and the one that is consistently noticeable throughout (thus dropping the book from a four to a three) is the inconsistency with regard to just how sophisticated Reason is. At times she speaks like a never-been-out-of-the-bush-knows-almost-nothing fifteen-year-old; at other times she displays a jarringly normal response to events. For instance, she might compare something to an Escher painting on one page and then two pages later not recognize snow for what it is for several long minutes. There are many examples of this and they unfortunately did mar the reading experience pretty regularly for me, though some might find it less annoying, and maybe especially the younger audience the book is aimed at.Overall, the series (and one will have to continue the series for the story to hold together) is off to a good start and despite its flaws, I recommend it fairly strongly."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"Magic or Madness is the first book in a new trilogy by this Australian author. The book starts with Reason Cansino, a 15-year-old girl on her way to live with her hated and feared grandmother, Esmerelda. Reason and her mother, Sarafina, have spent years on the run, hiding in the Australian outback, moving from small town to small town, so that Esmerelda won't get her hands on Reason. However, Sarafina has had a mental breakdown. While she is in the hospital, Reason is forced to live with Esmerelda.This is a difficult adjustment for Reason because Sarafina has spent the past 15 years telling her terrible things about Esmerelda, who is supposedly a witch who eats insects, and performs hideous animal sacrifices. Reason finds herself conflicted because Esmerelda appears normal, and turns out to have a beautiful home, and to act as a mentor and teacher for Tom, the teenager next door. Meanwhile Sarafina, in the mental hospital, is clearly NOT normal. Reason doesn't know what to believe.Reason's mother has assured her that there is no such thing as magic. Sarafina has raised Reason to believe in the strength of numbers and logic and reason. And yet, Reason starts to notice strange things about herself, her grandmother, and about her family history.Eventually, Reason finds conclusive proof of the existence of magic, as she steps through a doorway and finds herself in New York City. There she finds a friend, Jay-Tee, who wants to help Reason. Or does she? Nothing is as it seems, and Reason, Jay-Tee, and Tom must each struggle to figure out who to trust, and what to do.The viewpoint in this book shifts between Reason, Tom, and Jay-Tee, in alternating chapters. Their voices are easy to tell apart because Reason and Tom use various Australian colloquialisms, while Jay-Tee speaks like a teen from the U.S. I think that the Australian vs. English terminology issue does add interest to the book (the kids repeatedly argue over which is the right word for something), but I found it a bit distracting, too. I kept having to look at the glossary in the back of the book to see what something was. I think that some kids will like this ability to learn Australian lingo, while others will find it an annoying distraction from the plot.I enjoyed Reason's viewpoint the most of the three. Reason's magical ability is centered around numbers and patterns, and she centers herself by counting up Fibonacci numbers in her head (a kindred spirit for Gregory K. and his poetic Fibs). She is so gifted with numbers that she has merely to scan a crowded room to know how many people are there. I like the idea of a magic that comprehends and uses numbers and rational patterns. The magic in this book is also subject to real laws of supply and demand and energy usage, which I find refreshing.Overall, I thought that it was an entertaining read, and an unusual look at magic. The characterization is strong. Although I am generally getting burned out on trilogies, I do look forward to reading the other two books in this series. I want to know what happens next to Reason, Tom, and Jay-Tee.Magic or Madness was recently nominated for the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards Ethel Turner Prize.This review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on April 18th, 2006."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"As the father of a twelve year old girl who is just starting High School, I found this book an absolute delight to share with her. The teenage characters come across as strong and believable; positively drawn without resorting to any of the pop-psychology-laden 'you go girl!' stereotypes that plagues so much young adult fiction these days. The Newtown/East Village environs in Sydney and New York are gorgeously and accurately evoked, and the story is fast paced and imaginatively constructed."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"My daughter is now old enough that she enjoys reading some of the classics of my youth -- the Judy Blumes and the Roald Dahls and the Susan Coopers -- which we read together and she also reads by herself. I'm happy to share these books with her, but I also hope that she'll have books and authors she'll claim for her own. After reading Magic & Madness, I have a good feeling that Justine Larbalestier is one of the authors who she will adopt -- the book combines the reality of being young and in trouble with a world of magic one would love to explore (even as a grown up!); it's true fantasy that works because it doesn't skimp on being real. I've put the book in my daughter's room; I'm looking forward to having her tell me she wants to read it to me."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"A mother that drags her child from village to village running from an evil witch may not seem quite sane. That would be because she's not. Her child, Reason, the main character, seems to think her mother is perfectly ok even though she tried to kill herself twice. It really leads you to think that the evil witch grandmother can't be that bad. So when Reason is shipped off to live with the crazy witch, we assume the grandmother will turn out normal. Not quite. There is the cat with it's throat cut in the basement, and the numerous teeth in random places to be considered. I was enjoying the first half of the book where Reason explores the witch's house and befriends the next door neighbor, but everything changed when Reason goes through the back door into New York. The pace changed, and my interest waned. Reason is taken in by another 15 year old and they go around the town exploring for a few hundred pages. Then, evil grandfather enters the picture. Every adult in the book seems crazy and dangerous, and I don't see why the children made the choices that they did in the end. Finding out that the 15 year old gets pregnant in the next book doesn't seem to bother anyone, but it bothers me. In any other YA book parents would be going off the deep end at the barest hint of sex, but not with these books for some reason. Even without knowing that, this book disappointed me. It's not a fun tale of magic and evil grandmothers, it's a creepy tale of abductions, magic pimps, and crazy people. I'm not even remotely interested in what the lost letters have in them and I don't want to go further into this series and read about teenage angst and pregnancy."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"Reason is an Australian child whose mother, Sarafina, has gone mad. Sarafina has been shut in an asylum, and the daughter placed with her grandmother, Esmeralda, in Sydney, Australia.

Instead she has kept her daughter with her while she trekked through the Australian outback, keeping Reason away from large communities for years, and almost entirely without communication with other people, including other children. Sarafina has also \\"home schooled\\" Reason, mostly teaching her math and other sciences. Sarafina has always told her that magic is not real, that her mother Esmeralda lied to her and drove her daughter away with her cruelty.Believing her mother, distrusting her grandmother, Reason hides in Esmeralda's house.

She finds a key and uses it on the only locked door in the home, opening it and stepping through. Outside she is in New York city in the middle of winter. Magic IS real. And she is capable of wielding it.But I won't spoil the story for you. It is a wonderful story, and Reason a delightful teenager, full of strengths and normal insecurities. I will tell you, however, that this novel doesn't flinch away from the issues of power and corruption, as many other young adult novels do. Instead it portrays the way the pursuit of power affects relationships. The novel's \\"good' characters are strong and honest, yet still flawed, and the \\"bad\\" characters are deceptively charming, just as they are in the real world. And much too close for Reason to protect herself without help.I do think this is a novel that is worth reading more than once, and I also look forward to the two sequels. From their reviews, it's clear they don't disappoint, either."},{"Title":"Magic or Madness (Magic or Madness Trilogy)","review":"MAGIC OR MADNESS by Justine Larbalestier is book one of a trilogy. Reason Cansino lived the past fifteen years of her life with her mother Sarafina in the Australian outback, away from her witch grandmother Esmeralda. But when her mother suffers a nervous breakdown, she is sent to the very house she's feared the most--Esmeralda's. Reason's mother has told her horror stories about her grandmother and that magic doesn't exist.Esmeralda is nothing what Reason has expected. But one day she opens a door and finds herself in New York City. And realizes that magic is real. But not only that, but she's magic as well.I loved this book! I especially loved how the author shows that using and abusing magic comes with a price. A very heavy price at that. Reason meets others in New York City who seem to know more about her ability than she does. Jay-Tee, another girl who befriends Reason with ultimate motives of her own. And a strange man who reveals a secret that changes everything.MAGIC LESSONS is book two. This story continues with Esmeralda helping Reason, Jay-Tee, and Tom, a boy next door with his own gift of magic. Reason once more finds herself in New York City but with a presence after her. Is this presence evil or good? Reason finds help from the brother of Jay-Tee, while she struggles to not fall prey to the curse of her family.I enjoyed this book too but not as much as book one. What happens to Reason toward the end of the book I found hard to believe but hope the author will tie up the loose ends in book three MAGIC'S CHILD that comes out next year."},{"Title":"The Choephoroe (\\"the Libation Bearers')","review":"Who says that sequels never live up to the original? Part 2 of this phenomenal trilogy does just that! All seems well for the detestable Clytemnestra and her lover. Agamemnon's son Orestes IMMEDIATELY grabs our attention when he makes his plans to avenge the death of his father Agamemnon. What makes this such a masterpiece is that Aeschylus grabs us in phases that get more and more intense. First Orestes kills Clytemnestra's lover. Then he grabs us with a dramatic confrontation between Orestes and his wicked mother. Orestes kills her, but Aeschylus DOES NOT stop here! Orestes is then tormented by the Furies! (Furies to Greek Mythology would be like Demons to the Church.) When I finished part 2, I NEEDED some cigarettes to calm down, before I DARED TO open part 3!"},{"Title":"The Choephoroe (\\"the Libation Bearers')","review":"Who says that sequels never live up to the original? Part 2 of Aeschylus's masterpiece does just that! For those of you who don't know this, \\"The Libation Bearers\\" (Part 2) picks up a few years after \\"Agamemnon\\" (Part 1) left off. Clytemnestra killed her husband Agamemnon, and she is now with her lover Aegisthus. All seems well for them, but it will not remain so.Orestes (Agamemnon's son) comes out of exile with plans to avenge his father's death (under the orders of Apollo). An interesting side note is that the great and glorious King Edward III had a similar experience. His father (Edward II) was killed by his mother, so she could be with her lover Mortimer. And at the age of 17, Edward III flipped the tables. He was to reign for 47 more years. But I am digressing.In this 2nd chapter, the chorus is some Trojan women who don't have a problem with Orestes plotting against his mother and her lover. Well, Orestes goes to his mother's house, and Clytemnestra does not recognize him. The nurse gives Orestes up for dead and has abandoned all hope that Agamemnon will be avenged. In a comical moment, the chorus tells the nurse that she need not abandon hope. Aegisthus suspects that Orestes may still be alive, and it isn't long before Orestes accomplishes the 1st part of his task and kills Aegisthus. (The lover was the easy part.)Orestes does not find phase 2 of his revenge so easy. He does hesitate to kill his mother, and it is only with his friend Pylades's prompting that he can do so: \\"Better men should hate you than the gods.\\" But of course, this makes for better writing. Rather than portraying Orestes as a simple killer, the next phase of his revenge is difficult. After killing his mother, all is not so well. he is tormented by the furies. Only he can see them. The chorus can not. The furies bear a striking resemblance to the ghost of Banquo in \\"Macbeth.\\" Banquo's ghost puts Macbeth into a psychological turmoil, and the fact that only he can see the ghost makes it worse. (The other characters in \\"Macbeth\\" can not understand why Macbeth falls into a psychological frenzy.)It is even possible to wonder if this 2nd chapter of Aeschylus's masterpiece inspired that scene Shakespeare wrote in \\"Macbeth.\\" Why not? Shortly before Shakespeare wrote his plays, there was a reactivation of Greek and Roman classics. So, what of Orestes now? Well, that will be answered in Part 3. (\\"The Eumenides\\") And worry not! Part 3 maintains the power of parts 1 and 2!"},{"Title":"The Choephoroe (\\"the Libation Bearers')","review":"\\"The Choephoroe\\" (\\"The Libation Bearers\\") is the second play in the Orestia trilogy of Aeschylus. It takes place a few years after the events covered in \\"Agamemnon,\\" which tells of how Agamemnon returned victoriously from the Trojan War only to be slain by his wife Clytemnestra, who never forgave her husband for having their daughter Iphigenia sacrificed so the Achean fleet could sail for Troy ten years earlier. \\"The Choephoroe\\" finds Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, living in exile in the nearby kingdom of Phocis. However, in obedience to a command given him by the god Apollo, Orestes returns to Argos to avenge his father. Seeking out his sister Electra, Orestes disguises himself to enter the palace where he kills Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus. Orestes attempts to justify his act of matricide but in the final scene of the play becomes consumed by madness and flees from the Furies, the punishing spirits of the gods who will hound him for his hideous crime. The Orestia concludes in \\"The Eumenides,\\" where Orestes is expiated of his crime and Aeschylus completes his dramatic argument for the civilized notion of justice.The story of the murder of Clytemnestra by Orestes is a unique tale from ancient mythology because it is the one story which serves as the subject for plays by all three of the great Greek tragic poets; both Sophocles and Euripides called their versions of the tale \\"Electra.\\" All three have their own perspectives on the tale and what makes the Aeschylus version stand out, besides being the middle part of the only extant trilogy from these ancient dramatic competition, is the confrontation between mother and son. After hearing that Aegisthus has been slain, Clytemnestra knows that Orestes has returned and sends her servants to get the ax with which she slew his father. But when they confront each other she reminds him that she gave him birth and nursed him through infancy. Then she argues that she was justified in killing Agamemnon. Finally she threatens him, saying Orestes will be tormented forever if he kills his mother. Orestes replied he would be tormented by his father's curse if he spares her.This scene in the play's fourth episode is arguably the most powerful ever written by Aeschylus. Notice that neither Sophocles nor Euripides try to compete with this scene and pretty much avoid the fatal confrontation in their \\"Electra\\"s. But ironically \\"The Choephoroe\\" is the one play in the Orestia that gets the least attention (for example, it is reduced to a synopsis in Moses Hadas's \\"Greek Drama\\" collection while the other two plays are presented complete). There might be a tendency to seeing the play as the flip side of \\"Agamemnon,\\" setting up the stage for the climax of \\"The Eumenides.\\" Obviously I want to make an argument that this play stands on its own, even when separated from the Orestia. Note: Several years ago the Guthrie Theater did a fascinating version of the curse on the house of Atreus by doing Euripides's \\"Iphigenia at Aulis,\\" Aeschylus's \\"Agamemnon,\\" and Sophocles's \\"Electra.\\""},{"Title":"Deep in the Shade of Paradise","review":"The book started out interestingly enough, informing the readers about the last surviving member of a New Orleanian clan, before continuing to the meat of the story, which is an upcoming family wedding. The author explores the thoughts and experiences of many characters, which can be confusing. The book even has an supplemental information section at the end of the book that contains materials that might aid in the understanding of what's going on.When reading the book, I got the sense that if I had read Dufresne's previous work about the same clan of characters, that I would've followed the story better. It's not too bad a book if there's nothing else to read."},{"Title":"Deep in the Shade of Paradise","review":"I can honestly say that I have never read anything quite like Deep in The Shade of Paradise! It's the story of a large quirky Southern family as they gather together for a wedding, that and so much more. There is so much going on in this tale that it's almost impossible to describe it in few words. The characters are beyond unique, each one a treasure, and with names like you've never heard. The author keeps jumping into the narrative with his running commentary which you would think would become annoying after awhile, but only adds to the charm and hilarity of the story.

(\\"Well, it's about a whale but it's not about a whale, it's really about everything.\\") DEEP IN THE SHADE OF PARADISE is simply a great book.I forced myself to limit reading to one chapter a day to make the book last. It was hard because you become so involved with the characters you are compelled to fly through the pages. At the same time you know if you read too quickly you'll miss some great sentences that deserved to be carefully and thoughtfully read.Dufresne has guaranteed that whenever I hear the word \\"plot\\" I will always think of the blissful Pythias.

Dufresne's cast of characters includes a staggering assortment of adulterers, artists, country-and-western singers, hairstylists, preachers and no-count distant cousins. And so begins another truth telling on the bonds of family, the accidents of romances and the almost cheerful inevitability of death. Ultimately, Earlene Fontana -- one of the first book's heroes, if a Fontana can be called that -- takes her 11-year-old Boudou and (finally!) leaves that philandering second husband. \\"Sadness,\\" she says at one point, \\"is everyone's secret.\\"But don't get the idea that this book is all dark.

This book is much in the same vein.Rowan lives in a land called Rin, but his life is turned upside down when it turns out that his mother is to be called upon to act as the chooser of the next Keeper of The Crystal - a magical crystal that embues knowledge, wisdom and power upon the keeper and keeps the lands safe from dangerous enemies.The choosing is a dangerous time, for it is known that a failure to choose a new keeper will cause the lands of Maris to fall prey to invaders. The chooser is in great peril and should anything happen to his mother, Rowan is next in line.Unlike the Deltora Quest books that I have read, this book is not laced with puzzles that the reader can hope to solve - although there is one key puzzle that Rowan must solve, and a nice plot twist at the end.Children of about 7+ should love this book, but it is not a young adult read.

For reasons too complex to summarize, the Maris clans require an outsider to choose their Keeper, who helps protect them from the savage Zebak warriors. Jiller is the latest in a long line of Choosers, and Rowan will be her successor.But upon arriving at the Cavern, Jiller is mysteriously poisoned. But after Rowan is appointed the new Chooser, he refuses to choose any of the three candidates until they help him find the ingredients for the antidote. The three set off on their quest -- but Rowan begins to wonder which of the three poisoned Jiller, and what motives are behind it.As in the previous two books, Emily Rodda creates a believable world without the usual fantasy trappings like elves and wizards. The mystery surrounding Jiller's poisoning and the question of who would be chosen to be Keeper -- and why -- remains a question until the penultimate chapter, and events near them hint at the fourth book. The writing is beautifully descriptive without being too much so, and the dialogue is growing more realistic with every new book.Rowan shows some personal growth since the first book, where he was outstandingly timid; here he is more self-assertive and confident, even when surrounded by strangers, and even defies the Keeper in an effort to save his mother. Jiller and Jonn (now formally engaged) are fairly nebulous. The three candidates are sufficiently defined that they don't blend together, especially Doss, who has a secret; Seaborn, who inexplicably doesn't like being a candidate; and Asha, who adheres viciously to how she thinks the world should work.\\"Keeper of the Crystal\\" is an excellent young kids' fantasy, something for them either to read themselves or be read to at bedtime.

The author begins with the earliest origins of piecing bits of cloth together from the Bible to ancient Egypt and provides fascinating information on how the Egyptian revolutionized dyeing of fabrics. This e-book version does not contain the color plates that were part of the original publication but it is still an amazing resource for those interested in the evolution of quilt-making.Marie Webster must have spent countless hours doing research in order to record the wealth of information contained in this volume. She discusses quilting in Persia and Turkey then moves through Europe and then into the British Isles providing endless anecdotes and comments on the stories recorded throughout history of gods and goddesses, royals and clergy, saints and artists who used needles, thread and fabric to create everything from home decor to the vestments worn by Popes.Immigrants brought the art of quilting to America and some of her most interesting chapters recount stories of quilting int his country. She tells one story I particularly loved about a quilting bee held in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania during the time of the Civil War. Since I grew up not all that far from there and remember \\"quiltings\\" at my grandmother's house, I certainly loved this and was surprised that there was little difference in the quiltings despite the difference of a century. She even gave the rather amazing menu for the lunch served at that event. She concludes her history of quilting parties in America with the re-telling of a lovely little story about a quilting bee written by Harriet Beecher Stowe.

Then it starts its journey into the history of quilt making. The roots of quilting and weaving are dated back by their appearance in ancient art work. For example, the images of a loom appear in 2650 B.C. The old piece of patchwork can be found in a Museum of cairo and dates to 960 B.C.The book traces the appearance of patchwork during Trojan War, Middle Ages, Renaissance. Appliqu&eacute; makes it appearance in Florence (described as cut work). There a very lengthy chapter on history of quilts in America, which I found very interesting. There is an interesting chapter on quilt block names.

The title gives one the impression that this is a book of recipes from Czech and Slovak immigrants who brought over mushroom recipes from the old country. This is in fact a collection of recipes from Americans of Czech descent (predominantly from the Midwest - 72 of the 97 recipes are from contributors living in Iowa, and only 9 from contributors living in East- or West-Coast states), probably several generations removed from the old country, and having seemingly no knowledge of Czech cuisine - certainly almost none of the recipes here show any basis in the cuisines of Eastern or Central Europe at all, beyond the occasional use of sour cream!As for \\"quality\\", most of these recipes remind me of the kind of the kind of things you'd find in a 1950's \\"Better Homes and Gardens\\" cookbook - numerous recipes for casseroles and meatloaf, stuffed mushrooms, pallid versions of Asian and French dishes, etc. Many recipes call specifically very low-quality ingredients, for example, a quiche recipe that calls for Velveeta cheese! The recipes here seem to have been compiled in 1959, not 1999. The vast improvements and innovations that have taken place in American cooking over the last 30 years seem to have largely passed by the contributors to this collection. Even the better recipes here (such as Pork Loin with Three-Mushroom Sauce) are recipes any knowledgeable cook could adapt out of \\"The Joy of Cooking\\".My recommendation if one is looking for Czech mushroom recipes is to pick up Jack Czarnecki's \\"Joe's Book of Mushroom Cookery\\" and try some of the Czech-inspired recipes found there, or pick up a good Czech/Slovak cookbook and adapt recipes found there to dishes featuring various kinds of mushrooms."},{"Title":"Quality Czech Mushroom Recipes","review":"Mushroom hunting in the old countries is a popular activity.

The activities, programs, and other educational opportunities offered by the Museum &amp; Library are consistent with the mission of protecting an Old World heritage.Cedar Rapids area Guild Members Barbara Edmunds, Fern Fackler and Marilyn Tucker along with Cynthia Tucker Shaffer of Burke, Virginia were essential in the book's development. Melinda Bradnan, editor, used recipes from her mother-in-law Marion of Cleveland, Ohio, reflecting her Slovak heritage. Roger Mather of Iowa City contributed a poem about mushrooms."},{"Title":"Unconventions: Attempting the Art of Craft and the Craft of Art","review":"Best Audience: The best audience for this book is a writer seeking guidance for writing and publishing fiction in unconventional ways, or a teacher of undergraduate, graduate or a community continuing education program looking for unconventional aspects of fiction to present to a class. A teacher of either undergraduate or graduate writing (fiction or nonfiction) courses may find this book interesting and at times inspiring, however it seems more the sort of book that would best be utilized by a teacher for reference rather than required classroom reading.Summary: Michael Martone grew up in Indiana and is currently the director of the Creative Writing Program at the University of Alabama. He is a writer who has been dubbed as having a \\"problem with authority,\\" and thrives at being unconventional. In the opening essay of this book, I Love a Parade, Martone describes the experience he had of marching banner-less in his community's parade. He marched alone between parade floats (much to the confusion of the folks lining the streets) in a testament to the solitary life of a writer and the fact that there is nothing concrete for a writer to belong to, or march with.This book consists of articles based class lectures, public addresses, essays, an interview and a eulogy. The subject that Martone covers in the most detail and seems most passionate about is the different ways in which works of fiction can be framed as well as new ways to frame stories. He (repeatedly) references his book, The Blue Guide to Indiana, which he published portions of in a local newspaper camouflaged as nonfiction. He encourages writers to explore the ordinary in their stories and not overlook the importance of the frame in which their stories appear.The chapter entitled: The History of Corn is based on a craft lecture he gave which considers the 1938 painting by Lowell Houser by that name. The painting hangs in the post office in Ames, Iowa, and Martone explores the multi-dimensional story telling contained within not only this painting but the 1,000 post office murals in the country and how they are more like narratives than just pictures. He encourages thinking of the \\"nonfiction in the fiction.\\"Other especially interesting chapters in this book include the interview, Adventure on the Cultural Landscape, which addresses regionalist writers (he considers himself an Indiana writer and writes about Indiana even though he hasn't lived there since he was a child); Appliances: Domestic Details and Describing Rituals of the Ordinary, which speaks to creating an authentic setting out of the every day details in your life; and The Tyranny of Praise, which is the result of a conversation had with a colleague. While on campus Martone and his colleague were both looking at a new sculpture that had been displayed and his colleague expressed his distaste for the sculpture. Martone then speaks about his colleagues (almost uncontrollable) necessity to assert judgment over the piece and speaks to recognizing the artistic merit of something (a piece of writing or a sculpture) without asserting your own power of judgment over it - understanding that it may be imperfect or not in your taste, but that it is the result of someone's creative vision.Sample Paragraph:From the chapter entitled: The History of Corn\\"Let me try to picture some examples of post office murals. I sort them into three rough categories in order to talk about them. But what should be noticed about all of these pictures, the next time you look, is how crammed they are with things, how busy they are. These murals seem to be telling two types of stories simultaneously. Any one of those stories is embedded in the larger story of the whole painting. This tension, one of the polarities Park and Markowitz discuss, gives these murals, in my mind, their charm and power. And it is this very tension I puzzle over when writing my own stories or reading the stories of others. How to engage both spheres of the character's lives and locales-the private and public, the microcosmic and the cosmic (Pg 103).\\"From the chapter entitled: Ruining a Story\\"Novels murder and create. Stories are the scenes of crimes. I find when I talk about stories, I often use the metaphors of detection, archaeology, pathology, forensics of all kinds. Collecting the evidence often is enough in a story. As a reader I am satisfied in the periphery of my nerves. Instead of its solution, the vibrations of the crime itself, its harmonic, are encoded in the air (Pg 119).\\"Main Strength: There are moments of brilliance in this collection, specifically Martone's constant urging for writers to bring the non-fiction aspects of their life into their fiction writing in order to \\"risk a more public display of private emotion.\\" Martone urges writers to bring the every day appliances and objects of their lives into their fiction as a way to bring both author and reader closer to the larger community. There are beautifully written sentences and thoughtful commentary on writing, teaching writing and what is means to be a writer scattered throughout the book. When you stumble upon one of these moments in the book it is satisfying and enlightening - however he can rarely hit one of these points only once.Main Weakness: It's repetitive. Martone refers to the Blue Guide to Indiana so much that as a reader I began to resent it and lose interest quickly. It almost seemed as if Martone did not have enough to draw from and as a result much of the book hit upon similar points over and over again. I understand that this is a book that explores several unconventional writing practices (and an unconventional structure), but in general it lacked any real purpose and failed to hold my interest."},{"Title":"AIDS and Ethics","review":"For those interested in this topic this book is an excellent jumping off point. It has a good philosophical and theoretical introduction, yet very understandable. Choices of issues are very good. Many excellent voices from different professions. The only problem now is that the book was written in 1991 so some of the ethical issues are dated and some the views may have changed. Can also apply the ethics and issues to other situations and conditions. Not quite done with the whole book but have enjoyed it so far."},{"Title":"An introductory logic,","review":"We have plenty of books that give a fair enough account of logical manipulations, and a few books that give an excellent treatment of the theory of logic. But books of the former class are generally too mechanical, those of the latter class too abstruse for profitable use in an introductory course. A careful examination of the book now before us leads to the belief that at last we have just what we have been looking for. The point of view taken by the author can best be expressed in his own words: \\"In spite of the obvious deficiencies of formal Logic as a theory of the nature of thought, I am convinced that it is one of the most valuable instruments in modern education for promoting clear thinking, and for developing critical habits of mind.\\" And yet \\"although in treating the syllogistic Logic I have followed to a large extent the ordinary mode of presentation, I have both here, and when dealing with the Inductive Methods, endeavored to interpret the traditional doctrines in a philosophical way, and to prepare for the theoretical discussions of the third part of the book.\\" The volume, therefore, \\"aims at being both practical and theoretical\\" (p. v). The table of contents shows an Introduction, in two chapters, preceding the main body of the work which is in three parts: \\"The Syllogism,\\" in ten chapters; \\"Inductive Methods,\\" in seven chapters; and \\"The Nature of Thought,\\" in six chapters; while Questions, Exercises, and an Index bring up the rear.The Introduction discusses \\"The Standpoint and Problem of Logic,\\" and gives \\"An Historical Sketch of Logic.\\" \\"Logic may be defined as the science of thought, or as the science which investigates the process of thinking;\\" and thinking \\"is the intellectual act by means of which knowledge is obtained. We do not really know any fact until we think it; that is, until the mind sets it in its proper relation to the other parts of its experience, and thus comes to understand its meaning\\" (p. i). Logic is to be distinguished from psychology which also deals with our thinking activity, in that logic \\"does no regard the way in which ideas exist, and is not interested in them for what they are, but rather in the purpose which they subserve in affording us knowledge of something beyond themselves\\" (p. 5). The material of logic is to be found wherever there is thinking, \\"both in everyday knowledge and in the sciences.\\" Especially does \\"the history of the various sciences furnish a record of the steps by means of which thought has built up knowledge. And, in this record, we have also a revelation of the nature of the thinking process itself' (p. 14). Yet \\"one's own consciousness must after all furnish the key which makes intelligible the account of the various steps\\" (p. 16). The history of logic is briefly sketched in sixteen pages, with due emphasis on the critical points in the development of the science.The fact that, in Part I, the chapter which deals with \\"The Syllogism and its Parts\\" is followed, not preceded, by the chapter on \\"The Various Kinds of Terms,\\" is indicative of Creighton's attitude on the question whether we have three different and separate functions of thought to deal with in logic. \\"The syllogism may be said to express a single comprehensive act of thought\\" (p. 39). In this act, however, it is possible to distinguish \\"different subordinate steps, various stages which serve as resting places, in the course of its passage to the complete and comprehensive form represented by the syllogism. But it is usual, in dealing with the syllogism, to take a more external view of its nature, and to regard it as primarily made up of words and propositions. In this sense, a syllogism can, of course, be divided into parts\\" (p. 40). \\"These divisions, however, are made only for the sake of convenience in treatment. It must not be forgotten that a term is a part of a proposition\\" (p. 42), or that a proposition's \\"independence and completeness are only partial and relative. A single proposition cannot stand alone. Taken strictly by itself, a proposition is only a fragment. In order to make it intelligible, it must be brought into relation with the other propositions which state the grounds or reasons upon which it rests, or the conclusion which it helps to support\\" (p. 43). \\"Thinking is not a process of externally joining on part to part, but consists in a development or expansion of knowledge from within . . .Intelligence or thought must not be regarded as at first merely receptive. It does not begin with laying hold of separate ideas or terms, and afterwards call in judgment as a new kind of process to bring the former into relation. But it is from the first a systematizing and relating activity which proceeds from the less perfect to the more perfect form of judgment\\" (p. 45). Therefore \\"in dealing separately with terms, as we propose to do in the next chapter, we shall be occupied to a large extent with the form of words in which certain kinds of ideas are usually expressed. But . . . it will be necessary, in order to understand the meaning of terms, to refer frequently to the various ways in which they are used in a proposition\\" (pp. 42, 43) .Then follows the matter usually contained in formal logic, and the presentation is clear and precise; and, what is distinctive, there is a re-interpretation of the old doctrines in terms of the new theory; only, there are occasional lapses into the traditional one-sidedness in some of the interpretations, as will soon appear.Some of the old familiar friends are missing, such as accident, property, and epicheirema. The omission of the definition of accident leaves unexplained the name 'fallacy of accident,' still kept in the treatment of fallacies. Comprehension is given ' as synonymous with extension' (p. 56), whereas, so far at least as I know, it is used exclusively as synonymous with intension, as, e. g., by Watts, Hamilton, McCosh, and Veitch. Definition is used in the wider sense as including division, and in a narrower sense as equal to statement of connotation. The former use is against the current tradition, and is apt to produce confusion. Opposite is used as synonymous with contrary (p. 56), and also as synonymous with contradictory (pp. 74, I, 8). Both convenience and convention prescribe the use of it as a generic term, including contrary and contradictory as species, when applied to concepts as well as when applied to judgments. The distinction between natural and artificial classification is, as usual, based upon the difference between essential and accidental marks. But as essentiality is relative, it is hard to see how any classification can be conceived as based on \\"merely an external and accidental\\" mark (p. 74). As against the author, it must be maintained that the classification of \\"the persons in any company according to the pattern of their shoes\\" (p. 75) may have ' real and scientific value,' and any detective will tell you so. It has no scientific value, only if science is narrowly identified with the knowledge of things in their genetic or evolutionary relationship. This relationship, however, is only one of an indefinite number of relationships, each as real as any other; and any systematic knowledge of things, based on any of these relationships, is science, even though that knowledge be that of a Pinkerton. The view advocated in the text is a survival of an exaggerated evolutionism still found in almost all idealistic writers, as, for instance, in Bosanquet.The student is told that \\"every division must be based on a single principle or ground\\" (p. 76), without being told what a principle of division is. A more organic treatment of the rules of division (p. 76) would be desirable, a treatment which should show that they are not different rules, but at bottom different aspects of the same principle involved in the very nature of division. The definition of conditional propositions (p. 79) seems to violate the second rule given for definition (p. 70). A definition based, say, upon Bosanquet's discussion of the subject would avoid the fault, and would, at the same time, give a truer idea of what the real import of such a judgment is; and I think that it could be made suitably simple. We are informed that \\"when the premises are given without the conclusion, there is no way of determining, except from the order, which is the major and which is the minor,\\" and that \\"it is therefore necessary to assume that they are already arranged in proper logical order\\" (p. 127). But how about O and A premises, given in this order, in the second figure, or A and O premises, given in this order, in the third? To make the assumption we are bidden to make, would be equivalent to saying that no conclusions could be drawn from these premises; and yet conclusions can be drawn legitimately in Baroco and Bocardo. The chapter on \\"The Interpretation of Propositions,\\" the so-called 'immediate inferences,' is especially fine.Creighton sides with Bradley in refusing to recognize the syllogistic character of \\"arguments which deal with the relations of things in time and space, or with their quantitative determinations\\" (p. 132), e. g., \\"A is greater than B, B is greater than C, therefore A is still greater than C\\" (p. 133). Bradley's refusal, however, is only a part of a more sweeping refusal to recognize any value in the syllogism at all. Creighton is not so drastic in his measures, but just for that very reason his treatment of this class of arguments is not consistent with his general treatment of the syllogism, when that treatment is based upon his re-interpretation of the one-sided tradition. On this matter of quantitative determination, he says: \\"The truth seems to be that in reasoning about quantities we do not proceed upon the syllogistic principle of the inclusion and exclusion of terms. But knowing the continuous nature of quantity, we take as our principle that, ' what is greater than that which is greater than another is a fortiori greater than that other.' It would not, however, make the matter clearer to write this as our major premise\\" (p. 133). Against this it may be said, first, that after the principle expressed in any major premise is already recognized as the principle of an argument, it never makes the matter clearer to write that major premise down. The writing of it down simply gives complete expression to the organic unity of principle in application to content, or the syllogism. And, secondly, it must be urged that in no syllogism is the major premise anything but the expression, often interpreted too exclusively in extensional terms, of the principle that operates in the inference. Either the major is the expression of such a principle, or it is the statement of what results from simple enumeration. In the latter case, it must go in toto, and by its departure rejoice Bradley; in the former case, it must be recognized as everywhere present wherever a principle is present that pervades an argument. In the kind of arguments we are now discussing, the principle is confessedly present.This leads to a general criticism of Creighton's treatment of the traditional interpretation of judgment as being merely a process in extension (p. 85), an interpretation which logically results in a similar treatment of the syllogism as a matter of \\"the inclusion and exclusion of terms\\" (p. 133). It is true that the traditional way of dealing with judgment and syllogism emphasizes the denotative aspect of these processes, perhaps to the suppression of the connotative aspect. But when this is done, the living process of thought is degraded into a galvanized mechanism. What saves the syllogism from being a pelltio, is the fact that ' distribution ' is not mere numerical totality. As Bosanquet puts it \\"the purest extensional meaning is only a minimum of intentional meaning\\" (Logic, I, p. i66) and no one has expressed this truth better than Creighton himself (pp. 58, 59). It has before now been claimed, as for instance by Hamilton, that the scholastic syllogism is in mere extension, and that over against this another in mere intension must be recognized. Hamilton went so far as to say that we can reason either in the one or in the other. The fact is that we cannot. We always reason in both, although generally with accentuation of one or the other aspect. There seems to be no half-way ground, then, between cutting syllogism, as being merely extensional, root and branch out of logic, and, on the other hand, recognizing it as everywhere present in thought, as one indispensable aspect of thought. Elsewhere, Creighton states the matter excellently: \\"When we go behind the external connection of the terms, however, we see that the middle term represents the universal principle, by means of which the conclusion is reached\\" (p. 107).The division of fallacies is not satisfactory. ' Fallacies of Equivocation,' e. g., ambiguous middle and composition, are put in the class of ' Material Mistakes in Reasoning,' while ' Four Terms' appears under ' Formal Mistakes in Reasoning' (p. 154). Is not the quaternion the generic fallacy of which the others are species, more or less rhetorically disguised ? Again the fallacy of accent is classed as an ' Error of Interpretation,' whereas the fallacy of accident is put under the rubric of ' Mistakes in Reasoning.' Are they fundamentally different ? A thorough review of the chapter would carry us too far afield; but it may be remarked in general that a satisfactory treatment of fallacies is a thing still to seek. Aristotle does not seem to have been greatly distanced by any of his successors in this part of his work.The highest praise must be given to the way in which the problem of induction is worked out. For combination of luminousness of exposition and grasp of principle, the equal of this part of the work would be hard to find. I have no space for quotation of the numerous happy statements, and can only point out one infelicity and one defect. Is the term ' actual chance ' (p. 195) a good one to express the ratio found to exist, in a complete series of definite length, between the actual number of instances, say, of A, and the number of instances other than A ? The ratio seems to be a fact' and not a chance. The subject of chance is so delicate that in a text-book for beginners the greatest precision in the use of words is needed. The defect to which I made reference is the failure to mention Hobhouse's Theory of Knowledge in the bibliographies attached to Chapters XV-XVIII inclusive, and to Chapter XXI, which treat of subjects where Hobhouse has done some of his very best work, although he is mentioned in the chapter that treats of Chances, where his work is perhaps questionable.Part III, on \\"The Nature of Thought, \\"will have to come in for the same praise given to Part II. Clearness carrying conviction -- let us hope, to those that are not already convinced -- marks the whole discussion. I will quote two characteristic sentences. The rationalists \\"saw clearly enough that mere perception without general principles can never give us knowledge, but they did not understand that it is impossible to separate the latter from the former, and to regard principles as existing in the mind prior to experience\\" (p. 337). On the other hand, \\"what one misses chiefly in empiricism is the insistence upon the fact that it is only in virtue of some identical link, or common element, which is present in all the individual cases, that one is able to pass from one to another\\" (p. 340). The standpoint of Creighton is thus what might be called that of rational empiricism. Experienced facts, organized by intelligible principles, as within the unity of consciousness, are the data -- if you will have the word -- for philosophy. The business of logic is to ferret out these principles, and to exhibit them in their organic totality, and the business of the teacher of logic is to bring home to his pupils the explicit recognition of these principles in their systematic necessity. The exercises for drill, being carefully selected, and, for the most part, modern, make the book eminently usable in a class-room as a means to help the teacher in this his task."},{"Title":"Hildegarde E Peplau: Interpersonal Nursing Theory (Notes on Nursing Theories)","review":"This is the definitive text on the interpersonal nursing theory of Hildegarde Paplau.

I first heard about this book from a review in Seventeen magazine and it sounded interesting so I got it out from the library. It's a touching story about two sisters, Gillian and Sally, who grow up shunned by the village children because the aunts that they live with are witches. Gillian elopes, and Sally stays until her husband dies, leaving her with two daughters who she feels are being uncannily influenced by the aunts. And then Gillian comes home with a problem. A big problem. And it's the aunts' magic that saves them in the end. A very good book that doesn't want to be put down"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book is the story of Sally and her sister Gillian. Sally and Gillian were orphaned when they were younger and raised by their aunts who were the town witches. The girls' childhood was hard and both looked forward to a time when they could leave the staring and name calling and mean spiritedness behind.The writing in this book has a magical quality to it, although there isn't that much magic mentioned in the book. I would have liked more 'magic' sort of like in the movie. Another thing that bothered me about the book was that they spent a majority of the book setting up the big problem and it all got resolved within a few pages and tied up nicely with a little bow. That part just seemed rushed.I did like reading more about Sally and more about her daughters. I liked the charm that Hoffman brought to the novel and I would be interested in reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I, too, watched the movie first.

The relationships between the characters alone made me not want to put this book down ever. Alice Hoffman does an incredible job with this story , which ends up being less about witchy magic and more about the magic that exists in all of us.

The characters are similar to the ones in the movie but there are a great number of differences in the story line. The Hollywood version of the story makes it faster paced and better for the 'big screen' with more magic and fantasy. The book is different enough from the movie that you will not feel as though you already know the entire story. There were times when I found myself hoping for a certain event to occur in the storyline or was plesently surprised when something else was not present in the book as seen in the movie.The Owen women are powerful individuals in their own right - all searching for true love (regardless if they admit it or not.) I found it to be a powerful story that was a well blended mixture of emotions and expereinces. The magic she weaves through the story is not overwhelming or too fictionalized to not be believable. Practical, coincidences, with just a hint of magic power often taking the mundance and making it sparkle.If you love the movie-read the book.

I couldn't believe the poor quality of the writing, when compared with &quot;Turtle Moon,&quot; say. Use of the f--- word was gratuitous, and the plot was strained to say the least. The witchy aunts (up there in Salem, I presume,) were interesting, once Hoffman got around to coloring in their sketches, in the last few pages. Lust, not true love, seemed to be the driving force.

This book bears very little relation to the movie. The only similarities are that the main characters exist as they do in the movie, but they don't live with the aunts and magic is not quite the focus as it was in the movie.Now, that said ...This is one of the best books I've had the opportunity to read. Written in the beautiful prose Alice Hoffman is so well known for, it follows the life of Gillian and Sally as they go on their diverse paths. Sally is the stable widow with two girls in tow. She leaves the aunts in New England, leaving her sad life behind, and moves to a Long Island suburb with her two girls where tries to live a normal life. Meanwhile, Gillian is a bad girl who is in and out of relationships and in and out of trouble. She finds the awful, abusive Jimmy and eventually kills him accidentally while enroute to visit her sister. Unsure of what to do, she brings him to her sister's house dead in the passenger seat of the car - she thinks stable Sally would know what to do to keep her out of jail. Sally meets the situation with borderline hysteria at first, then the two decide to bury him in Sally's backyard. Gillian moves in with Sally and her girls and tries to forget the body in the back yard. Sally's boring, stable life changes dramatically while Gillian's naughty life changes to a more stable one. Meanwhile they are haunted by the evil spirit of Jimmy, threatening to destroy the tenuous stability they try to build.This book is not written in standard chapters - instead it is written in four large sections. Fortunately there are enough scene breaks in each section that you can put it down and read it in separate sittings. The thing is, once you're drawn into the story, you won't want to put it down. You'll want to read this one in a day, in one sitting if you can read fast enough. It is so beautifully written with an edge of suspense and just a tiny touch of magic. It will become a treasure on your bookshelf and one you'll only loan to your most reliable friends. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"That is an admonishment at the end of this wonderful book by Alice Hoffman. I'll preface my mini-review here with the following statement: Had anyone told me a year ago that I would read --in one day-- a romance about lives and loves of successive generations of women blessed or cursed with witchy powers, I would have laughed at them. A few years back, I tried to watch the movie &quot;Practical Magic&quot; and found myself thoroughly bored by what I considered a talky &quot;chick flick.&quot; Since then, I've become a fan of Sandra Bullock and recently saw the film again, and found myself liking it for the most part. I particularly loved the sad, wistful character played by Bullock, that of Sally Owens.So I checked the book out from the library, not knowing what to expect, and like a man in the story who becomes enchanted by a letter Sally writes that comes into his possession, &quot;Practical Magic&quot; hooked me. Hoffman writes with such easy, beautiful prose and the characters really spring to life and find a place in your heart and imagination.I won't regurgitate the plot here. But I will say that Hoffman writes so well about perhaps the most exquisite and maybe the rarest kind of love, the type that hits both a man and a woman like a thunderbolt, overpowering and sweeping them both away. Hoffman's descriptions of this happening to Sally and her sister and the two men that they are destined to be with packs a tremendous and very satisfying emotional punch for any romantic, which I guess I am. Oh, how I found myself envying the lucky men who won the hearts of Sally and Gillian! To feel love as strong as that and be loved as fiercely in return must be the best thing in the world.So read the book and like Sally Owens would say, fall in love whenever you can."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"My first taste of Alice Hoffman was Here on Earth. While the prose was beautiful, I was disappointed in the characters and plot. However, deep in my gut, I had a feeling there was more to Alice Hoffman than what she was displaying in that book. I couldn't write her off with all of the books she had written, and I felt there was more to her than I was shown. So, I did a little research and took some of her books out of the library. The second book I read was, Practical Magic, and I'm glad to see my instincts were right.This bewitching, captivating novel is full of spellbounding characters, which is the main thing that was missing from Here on Earth.Sally and Gillian are sisters who, because of the passing of their parents, end up getting raised by their two aunts, who are witches. Because of this, the sisters are ostrasized a bit from their peers, and long to be free from the house and the Aunts on Magnolia Street.Raven-haired Sally is the older of the two sisters. She's practical, hard-working, good, responsible, and afraid to love. Golden-haired Gillian is wild, lazy, coniving, airy, and also afraid to love.Gillian is the first to escape, by running off with a boy. She moves from town to town, from guy to guy, with three failing marriages behind her, before she shows up on her sister's doorstep with the dead body of her recent boyfriend, Jimmy, in the car.Sally, who continued to stay with the Aunts, fell in love and got married to a wonderful man named Michael, finding a happy life of her own. She had a man she loved, and two daughters, Antonia and Kylie. Her world came crumbling down on her when Michael got killed by a drunk driver. She went into a deep depression, and when she finally snapped out of it, she packed up her two daughters and moved out into the Aunts' house and into one of her own.There, she tried to provide a normal life for her daughters, wanting them to go to school without being called a witch. She was trying her best to build her life again when her sister appeared at her doorstep.The book then focuses on Sally's two daughters, the red-headed, spunky, spoiled Antonia, and the more sensative, introverted Kylie, who seemed to develop powers to &quot;see&quot; things on her own.To add depth to the story, Gillian and Sally are both challenged to love again when Ben comes into Gillian's life, and, towards the end of the story, Gary comes into Sally's.The Aunts, who were always background characters, finally have dialogue towards the end of the story when their &quot;help&quot; is needed. Not only do the Aunts have something to say, but they have names: Aunt Frances and Aunt Jet. We also have the pleasure of getting to know them a little bit, too.This is a book that's absolutely rich in characterization. There's three generations of Owens women in this book, and each one of them has a depth and personality all her own. The men that come into these womens' lives only add more depth and richness to the book.What a wonderfully enchanting, imaginative story. I have a feeling this book will end up being one of my favorite books by Ms. Hoffman."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you liked the movie and then decided to check out the book like me, you were probably, dissapointed. This isn't that good of a book. And it is depressing in some parts, especially the parts about Antonia and Kylie. I did like the parts with the Aunts and I wish they had been in there more. The movie was beautiful and magical, and the book was pretty much ho hum. Don't buy it if you are searching for the prettiness of the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic by Alice Hoffman is an enticing and exciting book to read. It was one of those books where once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I read the book in one night, as I was in anticipation of what would happen next. I even read it a second time, since it was so interesting and to see if I could catch anything I missed the first time around. The thing I enjoyed most about this book is its look at love. I am a total romantic at heart and I loved how the book dealt with love that was destined to be and just took over people so strongly, concerning Sally and Gillian and the two men they are destined to spend their lives with. This emotional and spiritual aspect just drew me in and kept my attention throughout the entire book. I have seen the movie version, years ago when it first came out, and I really liked the movie as well. Now that I have the book, I prefer the book to the movie, because the books gives the reader a more in-depth look into their lives and just gives overall more details. Also, the book is very different than the movie in the way they play out, so drawing a conclusion about the two is somewhat difficult. I have also read Turtle Moon by Hoffman and I enjoyed that book as well. She has a very distinct writing style, so if you enjoyed one of her other books the odds are that you will enjoy giving this book a chance and reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone to read; this book has relevance and would be enjoyable to both genders, any race, and people from all walks of life as everyone can relate to some part of the book and take that to heart. This is now one of my favorite books I have ever read and I give it my full approval and highly urge everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Most people complain that this book didn't rely as heavily on the steretypical magic as the movie did but so what? There is more than one type of magic, and one of the strongest, most natural ones is love and this book proved that. This book had a more romantic and passionate element than the movie did which I enjoyed very much, especially when Gillian finds the love of her life at long last which I don't understand why they wouldn't put in the film because that's one of the best parts of the novel. Yet regardless of love being the strongest magic in this book there is magic as well in the witch sense, including the aunts with their love spells for those poor lovedrunk women. But people need to understand the reason why it is called Practical in the first place is because the girls Sally and Gillian are trying to be practical all their lives. That's the main point of the story. Gillian runs off and Sally lives her life as best as she can normally and makes sure her daughters, as best she can, live that way too.I did really love this story. It was endlessly fascinating and yes very romantic. I usually am not too deep into romance stories but this novel is a guilty reading pleasure for me I read every now and then. The way Alice writes is very beautiful, and the characters are very realistic- not just some dingy witches who stand over a black pot but actual women who want and need just what every other woman wants. This book proved that although the Owens may have a little more witch in them than other women, they still were women with desires, and share bonds with people they would sacrifice themselves to save.One thing I particularly enjoyed was how Sally's two daughters were centered on a lot more than they were in the film. I liked reading on them and how they grew up, and how different they were- just like Gillian and Sally- they were as different as the sun and the moon, and how much tension grows because of it. I also enjoyed of course meeting Gillian's and Sally's eventual loves at the end and the pages literally steam with passion at these parts.So I loved the whole novel basically. What can I say it is one of the best stories I have read. It has more than one type of magic that keeps this story constantly fresh and loveable. The book is better than the movie, mainly because of all they cut out of the novel that made it the great story it was. But the movie nonetheless is still good to watch- yet I highly recommend the book as well if you love the movie for it gives you a more deeper look on espeically Sally's daughters that's worth reading- and as well as just has a lot more to the story that makes the story even better.Overall it is about two sisters that even though they part their ways to avoid their ancestor's history come back together under rather unpleasant circumstances and despite their differences share an amazingly deep love and bond to help each other with their difficult lives. Gillian, with a man who just won't leave, and Sally, with her fear of love."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Let me say first off that I went to see the movie first, and loved it. I read the book expecting the movie, and there's the rub. Quite simply, they are two different works of art, with varying flaws and merits to each. Alice Hoffman's writing is amazingly stylized, swinging between being a fairy tale to an urban drama and back again, with a few shakes of witches and hedge magic thrown in just for fun. Some reviewers complain about the lack of plot or characterization, but this is just not true. Sally and Gillian are both painstakingly realized throughout, their different viewpoints meeting and overlapping as their lives are twisted and casually tossed about. What makes the book is seeing these characters grow and change, evolving into powerful, complete women. The men are somewhat undeveloped, but their role was less as co-stars in this drama then as events, or forces of nature. Which comes down to what I got out of the book, and the movie, which was less about people then it was about love, or desire, take your pick, and the incredible knots we tie ourselves into over it, or the pits we dig when we lose it. Slow and dreamy, this is not a book about solid lines and &quot;This Is What Happened In This Chapter.&quot; Read it as you would the Brothers Grimm, and the whole thing will make much more sense. Truly."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If I ever expect it to be as hocus-pocus as the one in movie, I was TOTALLY wrong! Well, sure, the aunts are able to make love potion but Sally and Gillian... They know something about magic but they don't do it like jumping from the roof ala Wicked Witch of The West.At the core, it is from, for and about women. It's about 3 generations of Owens women who are all very beautiful and have big grey eyes just like their first known ancestor, Maria Owens. I said known because there's no story about how and where Maria came from. She just came with her baby daughter, built a house and became a legend, superstitious legend that is.This is my first book by Hoffman and I enjoyed it very much. It's so brilliant of how she wrapped deep emotional issues with fairytale-like plot. And the weird coincidences are the practical magic that sometimes does happen in real life."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Being the odd one out in a community is not a new problem but when you've got a family history like the Owens' it's the most likely outcome. For Sally and Gillian the family secret- the power of the super-natural/ witchcraft has lead to a lonely life, but they overcome all problems. The story of Practical Magic follows the lives of two sisters on their paths of life but always in the background their aunts keep a watchful eye. The story follows their love for eachother and for the men in their lives but in the back of the story is the idea of a family cursed throughout the generations. I would give this book top marks; it is the type of book that you could read over and over again and never tire of it. &quot;Keep rosemary by your garden gate; Plant lavender for luck; And fall in love whenever you can.&quot;"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of my most favorite books in my collection, and some day I hope to have it in hardcover.If you've seen the movie, forget it, go grab yourself a copy of this book, and sit down and read one of the most stirring and wonderful tales you are going to read in a contemporary setting.Sally and Gillian Owens have a gift, a touch of magic that they wield in their lives with different philosophies. For Gillian, the world is a place to meet, enjoy, and move on. For Sally, the notion of a &quot;regular&quot; life is the prize, to be married, to have children, and to be a regular woman. Neither of them get what they're expecting, and the result is, well, magic.The evocative prose of this book left me breathless: Hoffman has a way to work with present and past tense narrative that will work wonders on most readers. Her past tense writing gives you a sense of a fairy tale unfolding, and her present tense writing sucks you in with its sharp immediacy. Most of all, her generational writing, dealing with the Aunts, to the Sisters, to the daughters of Sally, is a wonderful perspective and a truly moving piece of narrative.The blend of folklore with life, and the sharp clarity of Hoffman's eye toward the emotional made this one of my favorites, and I have given copies of this book to many people in my time. I recently mailed a copy to the Netherlands, for a friend there who couldn't find the book.This book will move you, and make you believe."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have to say I was slightly disappointed by this novel. I've heard such good things, and I loved The Dovekeepers, Hoffman's most recent novel. I haven't read anything else by her yet, but I will.From the PublisherPractical Magic is a tale of two sisters, Gillian and Sally Owens, brought up by their two elderly guardian aunts in a world of spells and exotica from which they eventually escape - one by running away, the other by marrying - but which never escapes from them. Many years go by before strange circumstances thrust them together again, and again they are in a world that blends the mundane and the mysterious, the familiar and the fantastic, the normal and the numinous. Three generations of Owens women are then united in an experience of unexpected insight and revelation, teaching all of them that the perceptions provided by what is called the magical are rare and wonderful endowments.This book was good. Please, don't get me wrong. But...I guess it was the POV that threw me off. It was a strange POV. Third person, very distanced from the characters. Sometimes, it was present tense, and sometimes, Hoffman would go into the future. She's say something like, \\"The winds would later become so strong that in the morning, not a single trash can would be left standing.\\"That's not a direct quote, but it's close. Then, after a paragraph of describing what the strong winds would do, Hoffman would come back to the present.Though it was odd to me, it did work with the overall tone for the novel in a way I can't really explain. I guess, the aura of mystery surrounding the main characters. The fear of the unknown and the gravity of the sisters' positions in life, being gifted with this magic that can reveal so much about other people, both the good and the evil.I enjoyed it. But compared to other books I've read, I have to rate it only 2 stars."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Watching the movie Practical Magic is a Halloween tradition of mine, so I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it was a novel first. I can't believe I had never heard of Alice Hoffman, since after looking her up online, all of her books look absolutely wonderful!In Practical Magic, the Owens' women of Massachusetts have always been known to have strange powers and are therefore mainly ostracized (unless someone is in need of a spell!). Sisters Gillian and Sally Owens both desire to live normal lives where no one knows their background, so both leave their aunts and the town where they were raised. Sally becomes a widower and takes her two girls to New York State, while Gillian drifts getting into various degrees of trouble with the wrong type of men. They rarely have contact with each other, until Gillian gets into serious trouble and comes to Sally for help.I can't say enough good things about this book. The women are all delightful (in their own ways) and the various mother-daughter-sister relationship aspects are touching and real. Even more than the characters, Alice Hoffman's writing style makes this book! She makes even onions seem magical with her excellent sentences and when describing the scents of lemons, lilacs, or a summer evening transports the reader to her scene. Now, off to find some more of her books to read!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I suppose I'll make this quick: this book is really nothing like the movie. Or I guess I should say the movies is not much like the book. They share similar characters and a few key events but for the most part, very different. So if you are a fan of the movie, like myself, you may not enjoy the book. It took me a while to get into it, but once I put away my preconceived notions brought about by the movie, I found that I really, really liked it! In short, give it a chance. It's not the movie, but it's just as good if not better."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"We will not go into the details of this book...dear lovers of magic,... those can be read in other reviews, other than to say it is about a family of eccentric witches, death and a haunting. More importantly, Alice Hoffman is a wonderful writer and this is a marvelous book, different, although not completely, from the moviePractical Magic (Snap Case), which we also loved and is one of the few movies we don't mind watching again and again. If you love good books and good writing, plus a bit of magic swirling amidst the normal world, then Alice Hoffman's books are a great place to spend some time.kyela,the silver elves"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The Owens sisters come from a long line of witches. Gillian is blonde and naughty, while Sally is black haired and practical. Sally has two teenage daughters. Gillian has an abusive, drug-dealing boyfriend. They haven't seen each other for years. When Gillian shows up on Sally's doorstep with a life or death problem, the two sisters and Sally's two daughters have to work together to get through the problem. They also have a ton of baggage and female issues to work through. It brews into a story that waxes and wanes through the various issues.I read it in one night until 3 AM in the morning. Not good when you need to work in the morning."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Like Alice Hoffman's other books, this novel is written in the lyrical style of magicalrealism. However, the plot is sacrificed to the language. It does not come up toHoffman's earlier works.The plot revolves around two sisters who seek to escape their legacy of witchcraft.I suggest reading 'Illumination Night' or 'Second Nature', both much better books byHoffman."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is my first novel that I have read by Alice Hoffman, and I thought it was fantastic. The story is an easy read, with beautiful scene descriptions and very believable characters that I can relate too. The author drew me into the story of Sally and Gillian and I was sad when I finished the last page. So I read it again. One of my favorite books. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I picked this book up expecting to get lost in a magical world (maybe something like Harry Potter!) but this book failed to deliver on that front. The magic was underhanded and unorganized. However, with that said, this was still a good read. Examining the dynamics between two generations of sisters was interesting, and the writing moved along comfortably. Overall, it's worth reading, but don't expect to be mesmerized!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I absolutely loved this book. As many others have said, it is as different as night and day from the movie. Even the basic plot and character development are completely different. I, however, LOVED both versions.WARNING: There is a short scene, just past the middle of the book, that is highly sexual. It really took me by suprise. This wasn't a problem for me, but I thought it should be mentioned in case anyone is considering buying this book for a child or someone else who could be offended by sexual material."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read and I really loved it.

Did a bad thing and saw the movie first, but I was a kid when it came out so I have a decent excuse. (Loved the movie by the way.) But I'm still not 100% sure if I liked Practical Magic.The story is wonderful. Adult fairy tale with beautifully written characters and some pretty bad ass imagery. Buuuttt (there's always a but), I felt really disconnected. I didn't feel like part of the story, and as a major book-lover, that's a big no-no. I just wasn't sure what the hell was going on.

I plan to read more from this author."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic is my first Alice Hoffman book. It's a fairly quick read, with just the right dynamic of magic and reality. Hoffman's writing is at times sensual and moody; others it is light and subtle. It's a stirring contrast.

I read it in two sittings."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I enjoyed how this book didn't make a big deal about being fantasy, or about witches and all that. It kind of took the stereotypes about old school New England witches and applied it to a situation in normal modern life. It was fast and fun, and I will read more Alice Hoffman when it comes my way."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you are looking for a fantasy that will keep you engrossed, you will find it here. Practical Magic is a fairy tale for adults. Like all of Ms. Hoffman's books, it is a sheer reading delight.The characters in the book are endearing. The elderly aunts in the story are like eccentric good witches of the north. The story is absolutely engaging. This is as good a book as any of Ms. Hoffman's with which to begin.Ms. Hoffman has a gift for exploring human relationships in such a way that is uplifting to the soul. From that standpoint, this book is a deeply spiritual one. As the author of a series of books with a spiritual theme, I especially appreciated that.

I have now read three of her books where people &quot;spoil cats with cream&quot; -- and once caught the reference twice in the SAME book assigned to two different characters! But that aside, I'll just say that I read her books for the way they make me feel. They make me think my life has more possibility. They make me think magic (meaning, to me, you can get what you want, things have a way or turning out, or that sometimes you can believe that life is good) is possible. And that's pretty rare! Sure, it's true, every woman in her book is THE most beautiful woman in the world, so beautiful the teenage boys line up and go all moony-eyed. But who hasn't imagined herself to be exactly that way?

Walker's writing is absolutely beautiful, and she really can create a mood and an image through her use of words. There is none of the hokey, aww-how-cute stuff that marred the movie so badly, and I found the characters much more believable and human. I also liked that Sally's children were older and had a bigger part in the story. There is magic in the store, but it's much more subtle and the aunts actually do resemble an old-time \\"cunning woman\\" or village witch. I highly recommend this book.

The descriptions of the setting and the placement of characters throughout the narrative is excellent, and the way in which Hoffman drawn you into the narrative, so gently and naturally, that you barely notice when you become so interested in the lives of the characters. Even the movie based on this book was good, so as far as that goes I think it's a good thing. I have read other of Hoffman's novels, but this one is the one that touched me the most, with the manifold personalities of the two sisters and their relationships and lives, pretty much perfect!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic by Alice Hoffman was made into a movie. Kind of. The movie takes great liberties from the book and is much better in my opinion. Although I really did not care for the book, I am giving it three stars because I know I am biased in my review. If you are looking for the book to be like the movie, move on! If you haven't seen the movie or you are looking for a women's fiction type book with some romance, look no further. The main themes of the book seem to be love, human desire and self responsibility/growing up. There is a lot of love. Everyone is falling in and out of love. Love is very, very important in this novel and you must have it. It was too much love for me. At the same time, I felt there was overkill with the \\"f\\" word. I've never thought that before, but it seemed to really stick out here - almost as if it was out of place.Some of the characters were likeable and some were annoying. For instance, Gary really needed to stop crying! And I don't know why all the women had to be so beautiful. I'm not sure what the message was there but apparently it's very important to be stunning and have men swoon all over you all the time.The writing is well done. Ms. Hoffman is a master at the craft and an accomplished writer, but all in all I did not enjoy the story. I'm giving it three stars (would have given it two) because I feel like my disappointment is more my problem than Ms. Hoffmans."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Three generations of a family form the core of this novel. Sisters, Gillian and Sally, are raised by their aunts Frances and Jet, also sisters. Sally's two daughters, Antonia and Kylie, create the third generation. Magical realism is woven into the storyline which focuses on the issues of fate, trust, love, sibling rivalry, and family ties. I highly recommended Practical Magic for readers of multigenerational tales, magical realism, and stories where love, both romantic and between family members, can conquer all."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Like so many others have written, if you are buying this to read the movie you will be disappointed. That being said it is a beautiful story of family and love. It's well written, full of increditable detail. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Okay, so years ago I watched Practical Magic the movie and it quickly became one of my long time favorites. Then I realized there was a book! The book and movie are slightly different from each other but both are so amazing. I LOVED this book. I just couldn't put it down. Alice Hoffman knows what she is doing that's for sure!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you saw the film that this book inspired in 1998 and think you know all about the Owens women who \\"for more than two hundred years...have been blamed for everything that went wrong in their Massachusetts town,\\" then think again. Like most books that make the jump to the silver screen certain changes were made that affected the story as a whole. Some subplots were abandoned while others were expanded.After the untimely death of their parents in a fire, two sisters Sally and Gillian are taken in by their eccentric Aunts. Due to their family's reputation for being witches, Sally and Gillian are harassed and ostracized by their peers and so have no one to turn to but each other. The two sisters couldn't be more unlike one another. Sally, the eldest sibling, copes by being the perfect child. She cooks nutritional dinners, washes and hangs the laundry and always goes to bed on time. Gillian, however, dreams of being free from the house, the Aunts, the taunting and teasing of the boys who fear her.However, the sisters have one thing in common. They spend many nights in the shadows of the landing above the stairs in their house listening to their Aunts ply their trade as witches who specialize in affairs of the heart. They listen to the women who come to their Aunts desperate to gain love. The sisters see the toll that unrequited love takes on a woman and are disgusted at the lengths these desperate women will go to in order to obtain the one they desire. Consequently, both of the girls are afraid to love.In an expanded subplot from the movie, as the story unfolds we actually get to see the long-term results of the love spell performed on behalf of one of the Aunts clients and the consequences of the magic invoked one night with little forethought and much desperation.Gillian escapes the house on Magnolia Street by running off with a boy in the middle of the night after having spiked their Aunts soup so she wouldn't be caught. She finds herself unable to settle on any one guy, not for very long. However that doesn't stop her from getting married three times. Sally, on the other hand, stays with the Aunts and fills her days working in the garden, doing household chores, and shopping at the hardware store for cleaning supplies.Sally finally meets a man named Michael at the hardware store. They fall in love, get married and have two daughters Antonia and Kylie. For a time, she is happy. Nonetheless, the death-watch beetle begins to mark off Michael's time on earth and he is doomed to die. At first Sally doesn't believe her Aunts when they tell her, until she slowly begins to believe their warnings and Sally goes to the Aunts for help. Having already secretly done everything they were able, the Aunts could offer no advice but to accept the inevitable.After Michael's death, Sally goes into a deep depression which last for exactly one year. During that time the Aunts become Antonia and Kyle's main caregivers. When Sally comes out of her depression, she witnesses that her daughters are now being subjected to the same harassment that she and her sisters suffered through so many years ago. She then decides to do just as her sister had done years before. She uses Michael's insurance money and some of her own savings to move away from the Aunts and start a new life in New York. There she attempts to give her daughters something that she herself felt that she never had...a normal life.Rather than opening her own business as in the movie, Sally takes a job as a school secretary so that she can be home when her daughters come home from school and the job has the added bonus of allowing her to have summers off. Just when it seems that Sally has achieved her goal of a normal life, Gillian shows up on her doorstep one hot summer night with Jimmy Hawkins, her dead boyfriend, in her car.Gillian fears that she has murdered Jimmy because she had been slipping him nightshade every night to prevent him from getting drunk and consequently hurting her. It seems that though Jimmy has a long history of hurting, even murdering, the ones around him Gillian is compelled to love him and like many abused women, can't seem to leave her abuser. Not even her magic seems strong enough to take away her love for him. This is in direct contrast with all her previous experiences with men, in that since the time she was a teenager men and boys fell in love with her at first sight. She often had them wrapped around her little finger and just when they thought their love was secure---she left the relationship. The sisters ultimately decide to bury Jimmy in the backyard and forget about the entire incident.The book then begins to focus on the relationship between Sally's daughters Antonia and Kylie. Being teenagers, the girls have a strained relationship. Like Sally and Gillian, they appear to be more unlike that alike in their outlook and attitudes. Antonia is more like her Aunt Gillian--beautiful, spoiled, wild, and carefree; whereas Kylie is more like her mother--responsible, introverted, and sensitive. It is only when Kylie's beauty threatens to outshine her own that Antonia begins to contemplate her future and what she has to offer the world, rather than what the world has to offer her. As Kylie develops physically, she becomes surer of herself and more aware of her own beauty. It is only after she is almost sexually assaulted that Antonia and Kylie renew their sisterly bond.Throughout these events, Gillian has formed a relationship with Kylie who looks to her Aunt as a role model for what she believes a woman should be. Thus further strains the relationship between Sally and Gillian as Sally feels that her daughters are still babies, and is not eager to see them grow up just yet. Jimmy's ghostly influence uses their resentment for one another to further destroy Sally and Gillian's sisterly bond and drive them apart forever. Jimmy's spirit seems to take over the back yard where he is buried. The lilacs grow great lengths overnight and their scent draws the attention of the neighborhood women who come to the garden gate to look at them. It seems that the scent of the lilacs stir painful memories in these women, who uncontrollably weep when these memories resurface. Jimmy's influence reaches into the house as well, as food begins to spoil overnight and dead creatures are found in the toilet and sink.On Kylie's 13th birthday, she develops the ability to see auras and other mystical phenomena. It is her that eventually causes Sally and Gillian to realize that Jimmy's spirit is attacking not only the house, but Sally and Gillian themselves. After Sally cuts down the lilacs, things seem to improve. Antonia's biology teacher, Ben Frye, falls in love with Gillian and begins to peruse a relationship with her, although she is adamant that she will be \\"single forever.\\" Sally too is challenged by love when Gary Hallet, an investigator from Arizona looking into Jimmy's disappearance, arrives at her doorstep drawn by a letter Sally sent to Gillian some months prior. With no where else to turn, Sally and Gillian call the Aunts for help in ridding themselves of Jimmy's ghostly influence.On the whole, the beginning and ending of the book is somewhat similar to the movie. Although Jimmy's spiritual death is not as dramatic as it was in the movie and no one becomes possessed, however, this is in keeping with the magical realism genre. The middle part of the book focuses more on Sally's daughters as they grow from teenagers to young adults and draws a parallel between them and the generations of Owens women who have come before.Thankfully the absolutely absurd scene from the movie where the witches jump off their roof with umbrellas is absent from the book. I loved the inclusion of actual spells that are so descriptive of the Aunt's old-world flavor of witchcraft. Although we do get some background information on the Aunts, I think it would be wonderful for Hoffman to write a prequel featuring these wonderful characters.Practical Magic is a book that I will return to again and again. The author's descriptive prose and attention to detail brings a greater depth to the story. It is rich in imagination, ripe with characterization, and possessed of a wisdom that will not be lost on the attentive reader."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"As with many, I saw the movie first. This is where there is a rift as to whether the book or movie is better. I will leave that to you. (See my review of the movie)This is the story of a family that on the surface that seems different from most families. Later we see it is anything but. The lives of several generations of the Owens family are covered from major events to those things that seem minor at the time. This book has a dark undertone and makes you think the cat is going to jump off the refrigerator at any moment. Yet if you quit trying to anticipate the story, you find it rich in beautiful pose and people interaction. Contrarily, this story is interspersed with vulgar language and repugnant images (probably necessary to portray bad guys and bad times.)I personally do not like to read what I call \\"broke neck\\" books. The ones with some girl on the cover that has a neck bent back so she can look up the nostrils of the guy. If it weren't for the promise of magic, I would say they caught me. And I enjoyed reading it. I suppose now I will have to read something else by Alice Hoffman to see if this is her style or a radical departure.Throughout the story, you are not sure if it is luck, logic, or just practical magic.Conjure Wife"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book is really good. Better than the movie. It came quickly and I read it even quicker. I recommend this to anyone that loved the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I had to think about this book for awhile after finishing it to clarify what I thought about it. I'd seen the movie several times and the last time saw that it was based on a book. Since I usually love the book way more than the movie I picked this up. Hollywood really romanticized and simplified much of what was in the book, still while reading the book I enjoyed comparing the two stories and various plot points, enjoying different aspects, like the fact that the girls were given a more substantial role in the book and the fact that Sally left home rather than subject her girls to the same ostracizing that she received as a child. So if you saw the movie and you're interested in seeing the author's original intent for the characters, buy this book. To be honest, I don't think I would have enjoyed this book if not for the opportunity to compare it to the film version and then get some plot and character questions answered."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this, got done and said 'Huh? Did I miss the point?' I'm sure someone else would say 'Oh it's a character study.' Me - I like a plot. There didn't seem to be much of one here."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I chose to give it only three stars because its just okay compared to the movie.

I have read a couple of times, just to remember the magic!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"First, the condition of the book was better than the description - very close to &#34;new.&#34; Reading the book itself was a very entertaining experience - Alice Hoffman is now one of the authors whose work I will be looking for in the future."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Simple, funny, all together great read if you have spare time.

The writing style is simple but profound in its truth and wisdom, the characters are robust and relatable in many ways, truly a gem."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I started reading Practical Magic, because I wanted to see how different it was from the movie. I have been pleasantly surprised. I recommend to anyone who loves the movie Practical Magic to read the book Practical Magic. I didn't even know there was a book. I will be looking for other great reads now from Alice Hoffman."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read the book first, and was disappointed in the movie. The end of the movie underwent a drastic change which turned this magical fantasy work into a so-so comedy. It spoiled the spirit of the book, which was at times disturbing. Sometimes Hoffman &quot;overdoes it&quot; making her women so beautiful people swoon, etc. Still, she has a unique style which blends myth and reality that makes her unlike any other writer. My advice: read the book, skip the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this book way before the movie ever came out and even though I heard great reviews about the movie I was leary about watching it. I was so afraid that it would take away from this fabulous book. Well, I finally watched the movie to discover that it could never take anything away from the book, since they couldn't be more different. It was like the movie producers were borrowing the title and the names of the characters and didn't even bother reading the book any further."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Alice Hoffman has really worked her magic well in this book. Her book is a stunning work, beautiful and alive. I have seen no author with her talent. She is a master at making the reader feel as if they experience what happens, especially with regard to often undeveloped literary senses of taste and smell. Read this book, it's absolutely magical."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have read Practical Magic a few times now, and each time I become more enchanted by the story. Alice Hoffman has a magical way of telling a story and I eagerly await her next book. I hope that she includes Perth, Australia in her itinerary if she goes on tour to promote any of her books because I would love to hear her speak."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Alice Hoffman has a unique way of turning life inside out by revealing mystical glimmers of unspoken truth in everything she writes. &quot;Practical Magic&quot; overflows with Hoffman's quirky, offbeat wisdom.Don't expect &quot;Practical Magic&quot; to be much like the movie. You'll find that the screenwriters for the film version of this tale took some amazing liberties with the characters and the plot. Even so, you'll want to read the book. Some things just don't translate to the screen, and you won't want to miss them in print.Hoffman creates a bevy of strong, wonderfully flawed women in &quot;Practical Magic.&quot; I would be tempted to say there's a little too much narrative and not enough action in this novel, particularly in the beginning, but Hoffman writes narrative so beautifully it's hard to complain."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you have seen the movie Practical Magic, then you will love the book. It is full of suspence, and magic. If you like to read to escape into another world, than this is the book for you. It has love, family, and relationship drama. It is a comedy and love story all put into one. I love this book, and I don't like to read. So if you are a big reader, than you will love this book."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Well, I guess I can't really pontificate much about this novel. All that needs saying is that this book is great. It combines fantasy and reality into a seamless world of its own. It's full of definitions and descriptions and prose on love from different viewpoints from sarcasm through cynicism to a vision of love that one surrenders to. There I go again...I'm such a pontificating a*#hole...just read the darn book!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I love this book. It is like the smoothest liquid, like wonderful silk and summer evenings. I mean it. That's what I envision when I read it. It's also very real to me. It seems to capture the feeling of something real. I can almost feel the same moods, the same places. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was okay. It had a new look on desire, love, and obsession that was fairly interesting, and it had a good perspective on being young and beautiful. However, I thought that the narrative seemed to wander a bit, and I often wondered when it would actually get to the real story, which it never seemed to do. Despite these faults, I found the book Practical Magic to be somewhat entertaining, and a nice way to pass an afternoon."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I seem to be one of the few people who had read the book before seeing the movie. I enjoyed the book so much I have read it about five times already. The relationships between Gillian and Sally compare to the sister relationship between their two magically inclined aunts. The movie leaves a lot of this sisterly relationship to the imagination where the book gives a broad prospective into the details that make Gillian and Sally so close. I highly recommend this book, but recommend you read the book before seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I enjoy fairy tale and thought this book would provide that-but for me it didn't. However, it was a wonderful book. The relationships between the characters were well developed and I found Alice HOffman's writing engaging and inspiring. I did not find this book whimsical, though. I noticed a strong underlying theme of anxiety, abuse, and co-dependence which was just a little too close to real life for me to find the whole book a fun time."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is my first Alice Hoffman book, and I was pleasantly surprised. This book is a fairy tale that explores the magical occurrences in the lives of sisters (2 main pairs). It reminds of the magic realism style of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and other Latin American writers.Ms. Hoffman weaves a beautiful, interesting world where good and bad things happen. Add a layer of magic and you end up with a fun book to read.Some people may find the book to be slow and plotless. It certainly is not the fastest book ever, but its slowness adds a silkiness that envelops you as you read and enter this world.As to it being plotless, I disagree. It's not your average genre plot. It's a character study showing you how the main characters react to new obstacles and themselves.All in all, I highly recommend it.If you liked this book, I also recommend Laura Esquivel's &quot;Like Water For Chocolate.&quot;Enjoy"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Alice Hoffman uses a splendid narrative style to reveal how extraordinary life is. Her talent has captured me from the beginning till the end. This novel starts with telling us the Owens women had been blamed for everything that had gone wrong in their Massachusetts town. Gillian and Sally were two of them, one was beautiful and lazy whereas another one was very responsible. Their aunts encouraged them to practise witchery but what Gillian and Sally only wanted was to escape. Though they were seperated, but finally they're back together. Practical Magic not only describes withcery, but also the &quot;magical&quot; relationship between the Owen sisters.The novel is charming, funny and written in great rhythm. Once you start reading Practical Magic, it's hard to put it down because of the great narrative flow. The novel is as enchanting as the movie. Practical Magic is one of her best novels and you can't miss it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I will confess I picked up the book because I liked the movie. While I found that they were very different, I think that its those differences that make both the movie and the book so good.I found this slightly slow to start with but by about page 75 I was having trouble putting it down and finally finished it a 1am in the morning.I am now looking forward to reading another of her novels and hope that I find the same depth of feeling in those."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it before it was made into a movie, and few books have touched me heart, soul and mind so completely.Hoffman has a great gift for weaving magic into her storytelling, quite literally. If you like kindness, empathy, and humanity in your supernatural tales, this is the book for you. The realism and everyday sincerity of this book is well represented by the term &quot;Practical Magic&quot;.If your child loves Harry Potter and you've developed a taste for witchcraft and magic, you MUST read this book. You'll fall in love."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I love Alice Hoffman. So does the rest of the literature world, it would seem. Her books capture me, make me emotional and I can't (usually) put them down. Practical Magic was no exception. But i've realized I can only take Alice in small doses before I start rolling my eyes. She lays on the 'beautiful descriptions' a bit, and lately, i've been picking &quot;Local Girls&quot; up and snorting at the ridiculousness of it all. I couldn't finish it.I *know* Alice has broken the 'literature fiction/women's genre with her mystical writing, but I think she could still manage to write in that way without making some of the characters and relationships so darn unrealistic.I find offense that a man would just cry at the sight of a beautiful woman and ask her to marry him, without knowing if she was a total lunatic--men aren't *that* dumb. So, ugly simpletonoes with wonderful personalities aren't exotic enough to write about?Alice's view of beauty is narrow-minded: what about beauty on the inside? Her heroines seem to grace an incredible beauty, but no brains and they're usually not very likeable or funny, (except for Gretel in Local Girls) yet men still fall at their feet. And all the sobbing they do when they 'glance at a violet bush' and the 'moon is so silvery it...' etc etc. I love most of her writing, but I do wish she wouldn't make it so ludicrously unrealistic. It feels like i'm reading a Mills and Boon sometimes with all the fawning over pretty girls."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"...I enjoyed reading the book, so I guess that's good enough for 2 1/2 stars. I'll round up to be generous.There were a few things that bothered me about this book. It sort of bothered me that all the women in this book were SO beautiful that men lost control of themselves just by looking at them. The main characters were either overly practical domestics (Sally)or irrational out of control wild women (Gillian). The whole book sort of danced around that sort of feminist kind of sexism that states pretty much the same things about women's roles that traditional sexism does, but tries to get away with it by talking about how important those roles are. This book hints that it is of utmost importance for women to be beautiful, but escapes veiwing them as objects by acting like somehow beauty is the *power* that women have. I can't see this as much more comforting then traditional sexism; if you aren't beautiful enough, then tough noodles for you, you're a failure as a woman. At the same time it sort of glorifies women's role as caretaker and domestics, without really giving them much of another option.This is probably a bit overstated, the book sort of borders on these ideas without crossing the line enough to clearly take a position.The men in the book were pretty flat, and mostly just there to give the women something to do (with one exception that I can't talk about without ruining things).I thought it was odd how Antonia seemed like she was going to be important, and then she just kind of faded away from the plot.Some people were bothered by the way the point of view would jump from one character to another, but I thought it was a pretty effective literary device.The plot was kind of wandering and directionless, but the prose was pretty fun to read so that made up for it somewhat, as did the unexpected occurances of magical realism. The ending was a classical example of Deus Ex Machina if I've ever seen one."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The author of this book personally told me that the book differed quite a bit from the movie, and she wasn't exaggerating. That is the reason I read it. The movie is one of my favorites. In the novel, the story focuses a lot more on the third generation, Sally's daughters. They really only appear as children in the movie. Although, I love Alice's books, in some ways, I liked the movie version better. It is so well done. However, it was great to read the book, because for me it expanded and deepened the story. I recommend it for everyone, whether or not you are a fan of the popular movie.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"When I read Garden Spells by Sarah Addison Allen, a number of the reviews compared it to Practical Magic, complaining about how similar the two books are, so I eagerly put this on my to-read list. While I certainly see the similarities--sisters raised by witches trying to find their place in a modern world, one the stay-at-home and the other the wayward spirit, etc.--the tone is very different. This is the darker twin, edging into horror at times. While there is romance, it tends toward the sudden and overwhelming, rather than sweet. The narrative passes smoothly between past and present, history and current events, and the writing is lyrical and moody, but the ending comes almost too suddenly. A good book for a hot night, waiting for the storm."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The author writes with an omnipresent/fairy tale voice that sometimes works in short stories, but becomes grating in novels. The characters are bizarre, not charming, with the aunts being creepy hags, Gillian a self-centered jerk, and Sally a sad sack who raises two brats. Worst of all? No real magic is presented (at least in the parts I manged to read).I got through 28% of the book on my Kindle before I got tired of waiting for the plot to show up"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I'm a second year student of english and therefore I'm forced to read all the classics available, maybe that it is why it was such a delight reading this novel.

Not one bit. I study the occult and the occult references in the book were hazy at best, but that is acceptable since it is meant for mainstream consumption. What got to me most about this book is that there is almost no dialog, there are periods where there are three pages without dialog, without vaugely meaninful description (like say Moby Dick), but just pure nariation. The book is written from an omni-scentiant point of view, so it is hard to care very much about any one of the characters as a main character. Now perhaps it is acceptable for Clancy to have five main characters, when he writes a 900 page book, but this book being around 250, can't support the lack of focus."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"After being drawn in by the magical possibilities of a Rossetti painting on the dustjacket (of the hardcover) and an epigraph from Mother Goose, I was disappointed that what followed was sheer hokum. Most disappointing: the characters are based on cliched ideas. For example, the author reinforces the tired dichotomy that women are either rational and practical or wild and irresponsible. And the author's primary characterization of all the prominent females in the book is that they are stunningly beautiful, as if she has nothing else in her bag of tricks to make them likable. This is a world where a woman must use her beauty to secure the love of a handsome man before she can like herself, and that is very unfortunate given the possibilities for strong feminine characters in such a storyline. The ending is likewise predictable and cloying, which seems to be a prerequisite for authors who eventually end up in the &quot;Oprah Bookclub.&quot;"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I first saw the film when I was 17 and fell in love with the story. So after years of being a fan of the film I decided to try out the book. The book is nothing like the movie. I set that detail aside and decided to continue reading even though it was not the story I was hoping for. The book was dull with what I feel is poor character development. So 2 months after my purchase I still have several chapters to go and no real interest continue reading. Her style of writing is annoying at times when she tries to add poetic sequences in places where you just want information. Its likely I wont buy another book from this author."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read one of Hoffman's other books, Illumination Night, and liked it well enough, though it seemed at time as if she were trying to imitate Anne Tyler with soem magical realism thrown in. Practical Magic started with some potential, but after about a third of the way into the book I had to stop reading. Her characers, and the way she staged their interactions, did not ring true and come to life. Rather, the book seemed mired in the emotional and imaginative level of a second-rate TV movie. All of which was especially disappointing, since Hoffman's original setup had some real potential- she just never realized it by pulling out all the stops and letting her tale set its own internal logic. Instead, she settled for cheap melodrama."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is the first time in my reading life that I can say that the movie is better than the book. I honestly wish that I'd read the book first, because the monumental let down of reading the book after the movie has been something I cannot reconcile. The movie is beautiful, the storyline is engaging and witty, and the characters draw you in and make you laugh and cry. Yet the book is so far removed from the movie, they are hardly relatable at all, with such flimsy linkages, you could actually see them as two completely different stories.The book is slow, very American, with a somewhat annoying narration. I did not love any of the main characters, and for a book that makes a vague attempt at being supernatural, many of the 'magical' things that happened in the book were less believable because it did not step strongly enough into the supernatural theme. It was like any other suburban novel, with a few sparkly tweaks.I've never been so disappointed in a novel. I was looking forward to really knowing the Aunts, to feel myself in that old house, but it wasn't too be. I felt like I was reading just some book, not the original premise of my favourite movie.I'm completely bummed."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"About once a month I get this movie out and watch it. My daughters and my 2 best friends are equally hooked on it. We've just about worn out the soundtrack too.The appeal isn't just the relationships, it's the house, the herbs, the setting, the humor, the wardrobe,the spells, the life style.... I could go on forever.....I keep trying to win new fans for this movie. A MUST SEE, MUST OWN!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was made into the recent movie with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. Rarely have I ever said that the movie was better than the book, but I think I'm going to have to make that statement in this case. The events in the movie and book were markedly different and I just liked the way they played out in the movie a bit better. Plus I felt that the book left out the theme that I felt was most important in the movie - the community of women coming together, united in a common goal, even though they had shunned the Owens women before. This part just isn't in the book at all. The Owenses take care of their problems all by themselves. But the book was good for itself, as long as you don't have the movie to compare it with."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"i had to read a book for school and i just randomnly picjed &quot;Practical Magic&quot; b/c it was a movie also and i figured if i didn't get the book then i could just rent the movie. it turns out that i loved this book. it's such a captivating story line and although i haven't seen the movie yet, i know i'll love it. plus sandra bullock is one of my fave actresses also. now i just need to get some info on alice hoffman for my report. she is a great writer. i love how she mixes suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Read this book on a cross-country road trip and it was really enjoyable. Couldn't wait to read the next segment when I switched off from driving. Great characters, great story, very engaging. Almost nothing like the film, but if you go into the book knowing that, you can enjoy both the film and the book based on their separate merits. Both have things to offer."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I watched the movie first never knowing that there was a book that this movie was based on. I loved the movie, I really believe that this was the first time I was glad &#34;hollywood&#34; changed things in the book to make this book stand apart from the rest. Made it more believable and realistic. I was not so enamored of the book. My mother always said that to get through a few chapters you'll find something to catch your interest, nothing in this book captured my interest. It was boring and uneventful, like everyday life. Sometimes we like to take a trip through the writers eyes and enjoy the scenery and the drama for something outside our lives and this for me just was not it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is not my sort of book. Having said that, I loved it. Fortunately someone recommended it to me, and I didn't read that it really was about \\"magic\\". I'm so glad, since I wouldn't have read it otherwise. I'm working at convincing others who say that it isn't their type of book to give it a try. Again, loved it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Anyone that loved the movie, will not like this book. I have seen the movie more times than I can count, so I was excited to get this book. I was very disappointed. The aunts really do not have a place except here and there. The closeness of all the women was just lacking to me. One of my favorite parts of the movie is what led up to Jimmy's death and the solution. So not in the book. The magic is just lacking. Sorry."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Why read: Loved the movie.What impressed me: I loved the characters, the magic and the obviously deeper meaning that family is more powerful than any magical ability. This was an extremely well-written book.What disappointed me: I really, really loved the movie adaptation and the book just didn't give off the same vibe. It was sort of stuffier, less light-hearted at times and just not all that easy to get through. It was just way more serious than I was expecting or wanting.Recommended: Yes, but only for those who didn't see and absolutely love the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Over the years, I have heard a wide range of reviews of Hoffman's books, and I have always been curious. This marks the third of her books that I have read, and maybe it was the low-bar of expectations that I had, but it is definitely the one that I have enjoyed the most. It was a fun read - and surprisingly fast considering the lengthiness of the chapters. And though the plot was mostly predictable, the likable characters made it still an enjoyable read.The only main drawback with the novel was one of my own preference. I do not like third-person omniscient narrators in general - particularly not when the perspective flits about erratically \\"zooming\\" in and out in focus. It gives the entire story a very heavy-handed \\"storyteller\\"-vibe that does work for the magic of the story overall, but would probably be less abrasive to me personally in an audiobook version.All in all, it is a quaint story and a lot more charming than I expected it to be. I have yet to see the film version, but I am looking forward to comparing the two - I definitely can see why this was made into a movie. It will be interesting to see how Hollywood tackles this!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"And, I liked this better for having seen the movie. The book doesn't have the same humor or sweetness, unfortunately, nor does it treat witches with the same semi-flip fun magical attitude. It does portray a somewhat similar plot, though, and all the depth of the relationship between the sisters. I probably won't read another Hoffman, but I'm glad I read this one."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic is an amazing book and way better than the film adaptation. Like many, I discovered the film first and thought it was adorable but the book is on a whole different level. I've recommended this book to many of my friends and I haven't had any negative feedback yet. However, having an interest and/ or acceptance of the world of natural magick may possibly be the key to fully enjoying and even relating to the book. I just wish they would make another movie that follows the book version more closely."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The book Practical Magic was the inspiration for the movie Practical Magic, which happens to be one of my favourite movies! There are a number of changes from the book to the movie, but both have that special charm for which Ms. Hoffman is known.I did find some of the changes interesting though. I have to admit, I missed the presence of the aunt's in the novel. The charm of their characters was still in the novel, but I would have liked that they played a larger role. I also found it a bit unusual that Sally moved away from her family.Regardless, the basic plot still remains, whereby Gillian accidentally kills her boyfriend, and the resulting cover-up creates a magical intrusion in her and Sally's lives. This intrusion takes a slightly different form in the novel however. This is in part due to the fact that Sally's children are teenagers in the novel, not children. This certainly doesn't take away from either the written or movie version of the story, it's just a little difference I noticed!So, if you have ever seen the movie, I highly suggest reading the book as well! Books are always better than the movies after all."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Enjoyed the beautiful writing and magical story. I had seen the movie years ago and I liked the movie. However, the book in all of its elements is much better. The characters and places are much more real in the book. Great read!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"For once, in the history of time, I've found that I like the MOVIE better than the book.Such a shock.This is still a good read, but having seen the movie first, I was disappointed that the characters weren't the same as the movie, and that there wasn't a fuller version of the story in the book, more on their witchy side, their lives filled in...Well, their lives were filled in, but not as you'd expect the Sally and Jilly that you know from the big screen.Alice Hoffman still pulls you in with her writing, she knows how to make it all real, sexy, and even dark.A very good read - I'm just prejudiced by the movie!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"When their parents died, Sally stepped up to bad, calming the sitter down long enough to have her riffle through her mother's address book and called the aunts. If the aunts didn't step up to the plate, Sally and Gillian would become wards of the state.The aunts took them in. While growing up, Sally and Gillian are teased and tormented while growing up, asll all Owens daughters are. Gillian, the youngest, rude and selfish, runs away at 18. Sally, ever so smart, calm and responsible, has done nothing but take care of them all, cleaning, laundry, healthy meals. She meets a man, falls in love and has two beautiful girls, Antonia and Kylie.When her husband dies, remained in bed for year before she finally awakens and begins fresh. She's tired of the life she lives while in the aunts' house; Kylie, the youngest, is much like Sally, while Antonia is growing up just as spoiled, rude and selfish as her aunt Gillian. Desperate for a change, she buys a house on Long Island and moves the girls away.And just when the monotony of life feels comfortable to Sally, Gillian shows up at her door in the middle of the night, her mean and abusive boyfriend, Jimmy, stone cold dead in the passenger seat of his car. In the heat of the moment, it's decided they'd bury Jimmy in the back yard.And that's when their lives completely change...While I thought the story was good, I had a hard time with it. Yes, the characters were interesting, watching them grow, and change from who they were to someone better, learning about themselves as they go along. When Hoffman wanted her character to be rude, the character was; happy, sad, determined... You could feel everything with the characters.But I had such a difficult time reading this one. There were no chapters, only four parts - which made it a long story with no breathing room. It was getting to the point where my attention was wandering and I wanted to skim the pages, which I barely refrained from doing. There was no separation between scenes from the past, present, and future; it's reading memories as each of the characters are in focus, or what's to come later. And no differentiation between characters, either. And for me, that's a huge fault, and it took away from the book. I hate to say it, but if I'd read the book first, I may have never had the urge to watch the movie. And I own the movie on VHS and DVD.However, I thought the feelings and lessons learned were beautiful. How each learned to love, forgive, forget, changing themselves into a better person, is the best part of the story. I'm rating this one 3.5 stars - I say read it and come to your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The book was delivered in excellent condition:) I was concerned when it did not arrive by the estimated date. Truckee has had some mail dilvery issues. I e-mailed the vendor and they responded very quickly:):) This put my mind as ease, and I received the book within a few days. Thank you so much. This vendor is absolutely wonderful to deal with :):):)P.S. I am really enjoying this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you've only seen the movie then you need to read the book. You're missing so much and that is such a shame. The movie is only a wildly adapted slice of what the book contains. Gillian is even more flawed than Nicole Kidman could have handled and Sally is as rigid as rebar. These are older, wiser, more complex characters than the film portrays. Although the aunts, delightfully fleshed out by Stockard Channing and Diane Weist, are only background characters here, Sally's daughers are given front and center attention as girls becoming women. It is, I think, an even trade. Hoffman tells the story of the Owens' sisters simply and beautifully. The tone is almost matter-of-fact, not unlike wisdom shared, sage advice given by the older and the wiser."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This isn't Haffman's best, but was still a desent read. I would reccomend it to someone who wasn't expecting anytihng like the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"It took me a little bit to get through this book. I lost interest a couple of times. It had a lot of potential, but I have not been able to read another Hoffman book since."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I enjoyed watching the movie that was based on the book. I wanted to see what the differnce between the two."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I liked the movie better. And this is something I never say. The book focuses less on Sally and more on her daughters and her sister,Gillian. The aunts, so colorful in the movie, have little to do until the very end of the book. Gary is not a very well developed character either. In the book, Sally's daughters are teenagers, going through all those things teenagers go through. I guess I just like the emphasis on Sally that the movie presented. There were many scenes in the movie which were not in the book. I really liked the scene where the women of the town overcame their fears and went to the aunts' house to help the Owens women get rid of Jimmy for good. This is not in the book. This is the first Alice Hoffman book I have read. I'm not sure I would invest in another one. I'll probably just borrow one from a friend or the library."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"When two young girls, Sally and Gillian, are orphaned it is Sally (who is wise beyond her years) that calls her aunts (white witches) and says that she and her sister are coming to live with them. The girls spend their childhood as targets for taunts and pranks of the other townschildren simply because no one understands them and associates them with the Owens women who have been rumored to be witches. Indeed they are witches, of the benevolent kind. The girls get a view of hypocrasy when every evening the women of the town come to the back door of the aunts' house and beg and plead for a spell to bring them true love. But as Aunt Bridget cautions, \\"Be careful what you wish for\\". In an effort to save herself from heartbreak young Sally vows never to fall in love; Gillian, however, \\"can't wait to fall in love\\".As they grow both girls can't wait to be free from the aunts. Gillian runs off with a young man and works her way through three husbands. Sally finds herself deeply in love with a local man. They marry and have two lovely daughters but alas, Sally's husband meets with an untimely death. She moves herself and her daughters back to the aunts house and suffers a year-long bout of depression. She vows yet again to take keep her daughters from harm and herself from love. To that end she moves her small family to Long Island, a place where she feels they can be normal.One night Gillian arrives at the Long Island house with the body of her dead boyfriend in the car. In an effort to cover up the deed (an overdose of a potent natural drug), Sally helps Gillian bury the body in her yard. That's when strange and potentially evil things start to happen. It takes a visit by the aunts along with some strong magic to dispell the strange happenings and bring true love to both Gillian and Sally.I enjoyed this book immensely. Tightly woven story, lyrical prose, a bit of humor, lots of magic, and charismatic characters. Like other reviewers I wanted to finish this book in one sitting. It is definitely a page-turner. Hoffman has a definite winner in this book.Also recommended: The Probable Future by Alice Hoffman"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Nothing at all like the movie, with a few exceptions. But all in all, a beautifully written novel about love, luck, and pain.I loved the fact that the book had what the movie did not, a love story for Sally and Gillian as well as Sally's daughters. So interesting.It took me a bit to get into it, but by the time I made it to the 2nd of 3rd section I was really interested.Hoffman's use of superstitions and folklore are a nice addition and I really loved characters like Ben who were excluded from the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Much like the other reviewers, I only came to this book after falling in love with the film adaptation. It is entirely impossible for me to discern which of the two is better- I'll leave that distinction up to you! My preference seems to really depend on the mood I am in.For those of you who are unacquainted with the film, I can tell you that this is a highly enjoyable, but at times heart-wrenching story. This is especially so in the novel. It tackles heavy subject matter, including death, lust, the pains of adolescence, alcohol abuse, and domestic violence. This story follows the lives of several characters as they move through life, always trying to run from their past and their upbringing, but never quite winning the battle, no matter how hard they try. What makes this gritty story so special though, is the magic that weaves in and out of the lives of these characters. The author presents this magic as completely matter of fact. It is just a part of the lives and world of these character, whether they buy into it or not, making it more a fascinating part of the setting than a spotlight in the story. Those who have viewed the film know that magic is essential to the plot in many ways, and is one of the main focuses of the film, but in the novel, we can see that it plays second fiddle to the intimate details of these characters' lives.Overall, I was impressed with the scope of this story and the messages that rang true over and over as I flew through the pages. This story is intense, dark, tense, and sensual - a very enjoyable combination. If you like a good dollop of witchiness with your tea and often find a little bit of magic interspersed into your own life, you will certainly be in good company here.The only reason the book gets four stars is because I was at times a bit distracted by the author's writing style. It takes an imaginative reader to make it through this story. The way the author writes is very blunt. She spells the plot out for you, but seems to struggle with spreading descriptive information seamlessly into the work. Sometimes there is beautiful prose describing a scene or a sensation a character is feeling, but other times, the words simply guide the reader through a progression of events. If the author had been able to integrate more detailed description into the overall plot, this novel could have been improved.Still, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book, especially to anyone who likes emotional stories with a solid plot and a basis in magical realism."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have enjoyed more than one of Alice Hoffman's books, but this may be my favorite.I was swept up in the story immediately and finished the book in three nights. The story is about family life, and how love can drive people to extremes.The author's style really shines in this book. Her descriptions of flowers, trees, smell, the weather are utterly poetic. There is a magical quality to Hoffman's writing that I absolutely love.I highly recommend this book whether or not you have read any of Alice Hoffmans other novels."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I had seen a movie on TV of the book and I liked it so well I wanted to read the whole book to see what I was missing.The book was as enjoyable as the movie and more.Pat Rose"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I found TURTLE MOON and SECOND NATURE at a used book store and have been an Alice Hoffman fan ever since.PRACTICAL MAGIC is one my favorite Hoffman stories because of the quirky characters and off-beat plot.The movie, however, did the book no justice, except in the casting of Stockard Channing and Dianne Weist as the 'aunts.' They were dead on. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman just didn't do it for me.If you want a good read for the beach or a stormy summer night, this book is for you. Hoffman continues to turn out quality work...she's one of the best.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book and I absolutely loved the movie. I decided to try the book. It was one of the most fascinating reading experiences I have ever embarked upon. There are only two other authors who bring me that depth of involvement-- Madeleine L'Engle and Lucy Maud Montgomery. But Hoffman has a narrative style that makes me think that this is a story that one should read aloud or hear from someone. She captures you from beginning to end with the weave of narrative. I read each section of the book without stopping within a section. To have stopped in a section would have taken away from the narrative flow.It is best to look at the book and the movie as two separate stories. They must be told differently because they are different media. The movie medium is sound and pictures, so the narrative cannot be the same as the book, a medium which relies on words. You could not have translated Hoffman's story as it was into a movie. This is why I'm glad that the movie is so much different than the book. Each is a good story on its own and could have only been told the way it was in the medium it was produced in."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Don't expect this book to be anything like the movie. The movie took the characters' names, some of their personality traits, and a couple of plot lines and mixed them up into an unrecognizable parody of this amazing book. That's not to say the movie was all bad. I might have liked it more if I hadn't read this book first and loved it so much.Practical Magic tells the story of the Owens' women whose bad luck with men is notorious. It would be difficult to give a short summary of the plot since it is interjected with little anecdotes from the lives of ancestors, the girls who grow up(Sally and Gillian) under their aunts' (more or less) care, and Sally's daughters.As usual, Hoffman paints the tale with beautiful descriptions and a wonderful narrative. One of my favorite parts is the the description of the lilacs and the effect they have on other people in the town.I highly recommend this book. Not all of Hoffman's books are as good, but this is one of her best. See my review of &quot;Turtle Moon&quot; as well."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I thoroughly enjoy all of Alice Hoffman's work. She has a way of turning phrases into works of magic. Her 11th novel, PRACTICAL MAGIC, may be her best work to date. In this novel she explores the lives of two sisters who share one powerful secret, the gift of magic. They bring their powers together not just to ease their own unhappiness and cover up a deadly mistake, but also to bind them together after life has torn them apart. The movie version is extremely entertaining and one of my favorite movies, but if you have only seen the movie don't miss out on the reading experience. Hoffman's power with the English language is a remarkable achievement, maybe even magical!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"As a faithful reader of Alice Hoffman for years, this is her most fantastic book ever. I've read all her books, and are currently half-way through her newest release &quot;River King&quot;, I must say that it seems hard to outstand &quot;Practical Magic&quot;. The film was entertaining, but the script was changed in too many ways, I guess we all make up the settings in books differently. For new Alice Hoffman readers, I would recommend to start with &quot;Practical Magic&quot; and then read her earlier and later books. She has something in her books that really appeal to me, making the magic seem so ordinary, and the ordinary seem so magic. Alice Hoffman really knows how to drag you into her world and make you stay - the books are just too exiting to put away. Try them - enjoy!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I experienced something with Practical Magic that I've absolutely never experienced before--I liked the movie better than the book. Truthfully, I didn't know the movie was based on a book until many years after my first--and numerous subsequent--viewings of the film later. I'm not even sure it's fair to judge one agaisnt the other; we could be talking about two entirely different stories here that just happen to have the same title. But not judgeing one against the other is a very hard thing to do, especially since I found one far superior to the other.I had to give the book at least three stars, though, because if there's one thing Alice Hoffman knows how to do it's turn a sentence. Her stories all have a unique, lyrical, unbroken flow to them from beginning to end, and Practical Magic is no different. But she also has a trademark style that, in a story like this which covers three generations of Owens women, you wish she would break away from a bit. Most of the nearly three hundred pages is told in narrative form that's pretty, but doesn't give the characters much of a voice. At times I found myself thinking \\"Enough peotry alreay, let the girls speak!\\" However, whenever I got my way I'd regret it: the diologue only made the women seem mean and selfish, which they absolutely were niney percent of the time. Only Sally ever came across as likable, and even then it was because she was the only one who didn't act senseless at best, and downwright spiteful at worse.I really thought I was going to like this book tremendously, because it starts out like the film: Sally and Gillian are orphaned, move in with the aunts, and are alienated by the townsfolk, who think of the Owens as witches and shun them except when they're desperate for a \\"love potion\\". Soon after, though, is when the movie veered off course with the book, and rightly so, in my opinion. After Sally loses her husband, she packs the girls up and moves to New York, and THAT is where the rest of the novel takes place. Not the aunts beautiful, magical house by the sea, but a boring, unoriginal suburb off the Turnpike. That's when I started to fall out of the story. For me, setting was a huge part of what made Practical Magic the movie so charming. I kept hoping Sally and Gillian would pack it up and go back to the aunts, but it never happened. And as for Sally's daughters, they didn't stay sweet, cute little girls with hair identical to their mommy and aunt Gillian, but instead quickly became bratty teenagers that I could have gone all book long without.I guess what I found most dissapointing about Practical Magic the book is that it didn't have the innocent, whimsical quailty I was expecting. I should have known early on in the story when the girls were still young, and Gillian, after she and Sally are teased by some town kids, says [...] them all.\\" AFter that, the F word is dropped a little too regularly, and sex and lust become practically interchangeable. The R rated aspects of the novel were completely unnecessary, and in fact clashed with the overall feel of the story. In the end I'm glad I read it, if for no other reason than to see what Practical Magic was intended to be, but I wish I had done what I always do and read the book before I saw the movie. Maybe then the movie version would be foremost on my mind, and I wouldn't have this bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"You've read the summary, so I'll just cut to the chase. First of all, loved, loved, loved Hoffman's 'voice' and use of language: Gillian's passion for her new biology teacher lover melts all the butter in the house, a woman pounds on her lover's door until she literally breaks her hand -- Hoffman is very good at powerful, evocative images, at gliding on the surface and gazing at the tempestuous emotions below her.However, everything else about this novel began to irritate me before long. Hoffman was obsessed with pairing everyone up, down to the last obnoxious teenager, and the only romance that held any appeal for me was the one between Gillian and Ben. Gary (Sally's love interest) was boring and entered the story much too late for me. (He doesn't seem to be a very good investigator, either.) Also, the swearing seemed unnecessary, as if it came out of a different book. I might try Hoffman again, but I won't be re-reading this one."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I've read nearly all of Hoffman's work, and &quot;Practical Magic&quot; simply aces them all. The characters are well shaped, the story lovingly crafted and the writing style is evocative and lush. Those who snipe at the &quot;mistakes&quot; she makes in occult lore are missing the point. She's not out to write a textbook in witchcraft. Hoffman writes about the unseen and mystical events that hide beneath the mundane goings on of everyday life--and she does so with vivid imagination and unrestrained verve."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I heard about this book when the movie came out and I thought I might go see it but I didn't. Well while I was at an airport getting ready to go on my vacation I spotted this book and I decided &quot;Sure why not? I need something to read during the flight and boring times on the cruise.&quot; so I did. I started reading on the plane and I couldn't put it down. I kept on reading and reading and it just captured me. I was stuck to the book! I didn't even realize when we were about to land but I was already half way through the book! I couldn't wait to read the rest of it! So I finished the book within 2 days. The book was good, really good, it quite possibly could be my all time favorite book so far. The tale about 2 sisters and how they had to live in a town where they were ridiculed and made fun of because they were part of the Owens family, the most rumored and gossiped family in the town. How Alice Hoffman described scenes also captured me. The use of words she used were absolutley beautiful. I could picture the old Owens house, I could picture the lilacs growing in front of Sally's house. Even the characters stood out in my mind. And what interesting characters they were. It was like they were real and you were watching them live. This book was written with a wonderful rythm that just kept me going and going. A charming book, I extremley suggest people to get a hold of this book."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This was the first book I had ever read by Alice Hoffman, and I can honestly say this is turely my favorite book of all time. This book touched my soul from the beginning. Sally and Gillian's characters are so real that by the end of the book your ready to call them on the phone. If you want to read a book about unconditional love and hope, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"A helluva lot better than the movie"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I don't know why all the other reviews are so horrible! I read this book a long time ago, and have read it tons of times since! It's sad, but yet heartwarming. I can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was more about sisters and the power of females than it was about magic. If they wernt all so self absorbed the plot might have gone somewhere but they spent most of the time bickering over clothes and who was prettier. It was ok but I wouldnt read it again."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The people who've been giving this book a negative review must never have had fairytales told to them during scary thunderstorm nights. It has that sort of quiet, thoughtful quality. The &quot;frightening&quot; part was how much the sisters lives are like my own family's life. I read it twice in as many days, finding something new in it both times. It's meant only to make you stop and think for a moment."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this book in a span of 5 days, a big feat with school and homework. The book was very fun to read. I saw the movie first, and when I realized it was based on a book, I went out and bought it. The movie wasn't the best, but the characters were intriguing and the plot line was interesting. The book was, to my surprise, much better than the movie. I didn't want to put it down. It's a great story for &quot;realistic fantasy&quot; lovers."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I usually read true crime novels, but since my husband was going out of town for business (&amp; I'm a chicken) I decided to try this book. I had really wanted to see the movie. The book was so great. I fell in love with the characters. When I finished the book I was actually kind of sad, yet at the same time grateful for such a pageturner. I ran out and saw the movie right away. My advice, read the book! The movie was good, but the book was excellent!!!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I liked Practical Magic. It was a good book with great characters. I know it isn't a favorite of other people, but this book was a great window to the world of the Owens girls. Sally was amazing--as was Gillian. The great thing about this book was that the characters shifted so seamlessly and the plot was weaved so well into the book. I didn't want this book to end, but when it did, I realized reading it made me a better person"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Growing up is difficult for everyone- even when you're normal but for Gillian and Sally life is almost impossible for they have a gift, a gift of MAGIC.This book follows the girls as they grow up with their strange aunts, in a own that just can't accept them. Sally is the quiet, down to earth type that cares more for others and is always willing to lend a helping hand where as Gillian is the opposite she is a wild child that has only one thing on her mind - MEN. When Sally is called unexpectantly one evening her life is changed forever. This book has to be give 5 stars because where would you find such realism in one place. Alice Hoffman is a true writer that has the power to pull you into a story and make you want to read it over and over again!!!!Pick this book and you will never put it down."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I admit that I saw the movie before I read the book and to be honest was a little disappointed in the book. I felt that it just lacked the drama to keep the reader interested. I kind of felt that the Aunts were just a side part of the book and they should not have been. I also felt that it wasn't clearly portrayed that both Sally and Gillian were &quot;witches&quot; and why Sally was so determined to not bring her girls up that way. I also felt the appearance of Gary didn't make any sense since he was only in the last three chapters and his character was never developed beyond a side character to whom Sally falls in love with. We don't know why she falls in love she just does. To her credit Ms. Hoffman is a remarkable writer and I would purchase books by her again."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"You never know what to expect from an Alice Hoffman book, except for an incredibly light touch that belies her sharp contol of plot. She has such finesse as she writes, and she writes in such a unique style, it is hard to put one of her books down for a second. This author loves writing, and it shows. You will love the results. I do not think there is another living writer who is able to entwine such magic and realism into a story the way she does, all the time focusing on daily life and never losing sight of the mysteries that cause us to act in the ways that we do, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad reasons.When there is a double ragged ring around the moon, when the smell of lilacs is strong and it is well past the time they should have finished blooming...when you have a family whose odd heritage goes back hundreds of years and they draw people to them unexpectedly...there you will find Alice Hoffman, weaving happy endings out of strange happenings, and lovely images out of eerie events. Don't ever try to outthink her. Part of the fun is just enjoying the way she pulls it all together in the end. Truly special."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I am a real fan of magic realism. But most of the genre is from South America or Mexico. So it is delightful to find one that is American. I read this book years before the movie came out. I've seen the book a couple of times. I just recently re-read the book.The movie retains the major events from the book, but the timespan is greater in the book. The book revolves around the theme of love. The damage that love can do, the transformative nature of love, and the beauty of love.In both the book and the movie, there is a minor character who comes to the aunts because she is obsessed with a married man. She begs them to do anything to get his love and attention. In the movie, that's the end of it. In the book, however, the man becomes obsessed with her and won't give her a moment of peace and she ends up regretting it.If you haven't read the book, please do. It is wonderful, lyrical, thoughful, and moving. There is a lot to think about, and I really enjoyed re-reading it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Once again, Alice Hoffman has given us a delightfully charming story that starts out as a fairy tale and becomes true life extraordinary. Her books are so magical,that once you begin, you are caught in a spell that doesn't allow you to put down the book until the last page has been turned."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I saw the movie for the first time back in April 1999. I fell in love with the Owens sisters. I just finished the book about 1 week ago and am longing for more Owens."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Good, good book. The writing was so beautiful and I loved the fact that Ms. Hoffman didn't have to anything dealing with magic to make the plot interesting. It was wonderful the way it was. And the almost absense of dialouge just showed what a maginificent writer Alice Hoffman is. This book will show you your heart. I loved it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you are a factual person and prefer drama and law movies/books, you will despise this novel. Luckily, I'm not one of them.I admit, there ARE other novels out there by Hoffman that are better (including *Turtle Moon*) that give more rational explanations for the outcomes. However, *Practical Magic* delievers a feeling I've never gotten from a novel before. The way her words weave the characters in and out of trouble; the way her descriptions intice you and give you an aching feeling in your heart; the way mystical things happen to an everday tale when you least expect it.I realize that I am female and that the lead characters are all females so I would relate to them easier than males, but that does not mean that men should not read this novel. Everyone, including males and three-year olds and eighty-one -year olds, have always fantasized and dreamed about the day that they will be riding that white horse off into the sunset, and in this novel, that is as close as you will get.Because it is only . . . magic."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The Magic in this book lies in the exquisite ability Alice Hoffman has of seeing the mystical aspect of everyday living and loving. Her characters are richly developed, explored, and endearing. From beginning to end I was enchanted--I'm a sucker for vivid detail and flawless imagery. Please read it before seeing the movie (though the film will disappoint, I think)"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Yes, it seems to me that a male person really misses something essential about this book. I've just read a load of praising reviews by female readers, and it's all very confusing: I didn't find any special magic in this book, though it's well written and not boring in any sense. I think the endless and ever-so-deadly love affairs make this a comedy. The emotions are so overwhelmingly powerful that they aren't simply realistic. Well, that goes for entertainment, but this is not a masterpiece, believe me."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I've read several of Alice Hoffman's books and this has all of the elements I love. It's lush, sexy, funny, and sad. People don't just fall in love in Alice Hoffman's novels. They stop eating. Their hair changes color. This magic fills Practical Magic. Saw the movie? Terrible. Don't base your decision on whether or not to read this book on that movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Being descendants of a family of witches that has been blamed for everything that has gone wrong in their neighbourhood for the past two hundred years, it is not surprising that sisters Sally and Gillian call on each other in times of trouble.When trouble finds Gillian she flees to Sally's only to discover that the trouble has followed and won't stay buried. That's where &quot;family&quot; comes in.Quirky little fairytale, and oddly enough, I almost enjoyed the movie as much as the book - it made me wish that l'd had a sister!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Never before have I read a book been so beautiful as to bring tears to my eyes for no particular reason. All it takes it the turn of a perfect, poetic phrase and I'm gone, sniffling into an abyss of warm summers replete with Lemon Verbana and heat lightening. I can not recomend this story, a tender fairy tale constructed of true love and old fashioned folklore, enough."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read Alice Hoffman's &quot;Turtle Moon&quot; and thoroughly enjoyed it. A good, sturdy plot. Real characters, for whom one could care. Description of Florida's atmospherics that were right on.So imagine my chagrin when I waded through THIS piece of fluff. This book stinks. Someone has to refute the lava flow of gush here. This is for former girl scouts, waxing nostalgic about telling sanatized horror stories around sanatized camp fires, pounding smores.Stephen King Lite.

None has any redeeming qualities (granted Sally DOES keep a neat house), and, by the way, one IS a murderess.The occultism (upon which, supposedly, the &quot;charm&quot; of this book hangs) is a turgid mishmash of new age touchy feely, dimestore Halloween spooky, and drag queen camp.

This baby deserves one."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I adore this book. Yet it irks me greatly how commercialized the film version was. The book is always better than the movie, but I was still disappointed. Hoffman's tale of these two sisters reads like a dark fairy tale. It falls into place with much of the &quot;witchy&quot; awareness that lately has engulfed literature, television and movies. With great power comes great responsibility and this is doubly so of witchcraft. What I do enjoy is how Hoffman presents the other side: these women are people with pasts and choices, none of which flow easily. That fact alone is much trickier than a game of Quidditch (Harry Potter), a nasty demon (Charmed), or any predictable black cat (hey, even I have one of those). For those with occult knowledge, the hints of the past that Hoffman writes about is more true than any CGI special effect. Houses might have ghosts, but then so do people. It's a respect and knowledge of your elders and the old ways that make up the basis of any solid spiritual work. The judgment and fear that erupts from the other people are the basis of her loveable characters. Who wouldn't want to whip up a spell or read minds? Sadly, in real life, it's not that simple. Hoffman's characters always struggle with that and that seems to be glossed over and forgotten with the flick of Nicole Kidman's red tresses and the tightness of Sandra Bullock's jeans. Take the movie and enjoy it, but take the book a bit more seriously. It's a great jumping point to exploring other areas of the Craft (fiction and non-fiction) without the fluffy-bunny-cupcake nonsense of what passes for a witch in the media these days. Spiritual work is serious stuff. We are lucky to see Hoffman hint at the darkness of such things, which is the joy and beauty of her work as much as the Craft itself."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Hmmm - I'm not sure what to say about this book because my feelings towards it are so mixed. On one hand, I love Alice Hoffman's unique style of writing and lyrical use of language. I also enjoy stories about love that are non-romances, such as this one concerning sisterly love and the love between mother and daughters. On the other hand, I was rather put off by paranormal aspects of the story, which made the story unrealistic. If I were Sally, I never would have allowed Gillian to move in, and I was quite frustrated through that part of the story and wanted to throw Gillian out myself.I hadn't seen the movie so I had no prior experience with this story. I expect unusual and dark books from Alice Hoffman, and this one was very well-crafted, however it was also too weird and over-the-top for me, and would be my least favorite of her books, even below Turtle Moon. Still, I'm glad I read it because when I admire an author, especially one of Alice Hoffman's calibre, I like to read her entire collection of stories, not just the best or most appealing ones."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Before I begin I would like to say that I am a fan of Alice Hoffman's work, having read over ten of her novels. With that said, Alice Hoffman disapointed me with her lack of \\"magical imagination\\" in this novel, where as the movie version captured a deeper feel for the world of witches and magic (without seeming corny or unrealistic). The charcaters in this novel all share a common desire to be wanted and loved. Sally and Ginny are two sisters who couldn't be more oppisite but Hoffman left me disapointed once again with their realtionship. All throughout the novel I waited for Sally and Gilly to united with an unbrakable bond (much like the movie) however, the two sisters looked towards men instead of eachother for love and companionship. I was hoping for a story more identical to the movie where the owens women are the glue to their family. Instead of Sally and Gilly turning to their family for support they ran away from the aunts and eachother. I especially hated the part where Hoffman tries to show Gilly's loyalty to her sister by calling once a week for a year, as if that would be enough of an insentive to get a deprested widow out of bed, at least in the movie Gilly went to visit her sister and gave her the physical and emotional comfort she needed. Another factored that seemed water down is the description of the aunts and Maria Owens. They were sadly neglected, without enough reading time, and therefor the reader is teased with the idea of who these amazing characters are. I guess my conclusion is that if you are a fan of the movie, as I am and have seen the movie first, brace yourself before picking up this book for it pales in comparison and is nothing more than practical."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I am a man who reads a wide variety of literature. I like Jane Austin and Dickens... loved Jane Eyre. Also love fantasy, Harry Potter, young adult adventures involving magic... I thought this might be a good match for my interests. It read fine- I can't say that I didn't enjoy it at all- I would just say that it was a little too much of a woman's book for me. The magic aspects are merely the gimmick to get you interested- the bulk of the book is about the romantic attachments of the four women involved in the story. Lots of female angst and self doubt, and lusting after the various flavors of studs in the story. If you are a woman, you might love it- if you are a man, it might test your empathy skills. It bears some resemblance to the movie but does not match it closely."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I don't usually complain about the prices of Kindle books, but -- paperback $7, Kindle version $13? Not buying it. Not even the dead-tree version."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I got this because I like stories about witches, good stories. This one never made it. Badly written. No one in this book grabbed me. It had wonderful potential with moments of magic and then poof gone. What a shame. Other books of hers were much better. This one was a bummer."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have no idea how they got the movie from this awful book. It had such potential, such a unique and interesting setting, but went nowhere, did nothing! Every time it seemed like the author was moving towards something interesting, some plot point or twist, she'd just let it DROP! None of her build-ups went anywhere, leaving the plot empty and pointless. She just let everything hang in the air with nowhere to fall. And then she tried to cover up her lack of writing ability by putting an f-bomb about every other page or so. I always thought the movie had a couple of little plot holes in it, but now I know what they were working from, and the movie totally SAVED this shallow story.This is one of the ONLY times I have ever liked the MOVIE more than the BOOK! Ordinarily, I would recommend a book over its film counterpart, but in this case, I would tell anybody to watch the movie and stay far away from the book! What a staggeringly disappointing novel."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have seen the movie and love it. I also have the soundtrack to the movie and love that. I got about half way thru the book and just stopped. I did not like the authors writing style, from a third person point of view. I could not get inside the characters because the book was not told from one of their view- points. Also, it did not flow smoothly for me. The story jumped around and did not unfold evenly. I was very disappointed. This is one case where the movie was much better than the book."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I never have looked at the color orange the same way again."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Some women will do anything to get what they want, and this story of a mermaid who wants to date a man will capture your heart."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The book was in great condition, with a little bit of marking.

I'm sorry I'm one of them people who usually read the book first and will usually like the book better than the movie. However in this overall situation it's vice versa. When I first saw the movie it was fun and interesting. Highly entertaining and witty. The book was a dreadful bore. Okay first of all the movie added more to the whole overall \\"Magic\\" theme. Here it's pretty much just implied. So okay I can deal with that, Hollywood changes a lot of things. The second thing was the story itself. These woman, interesting but really there just plain boring. Sally and Gillian were only just okay the story itself the situations seem plain and farfetched. As if she was trying to keep it realistic but failed miserably. The worst thing overall I must say it's the writing itself. It was dull. I mean she poured us in detail that could of simply been put across by the actions of the characters, even dialogue . I don't need to know a five sentence paragraph to figure out why Gillian did such a thing because of her personality is different than Sally's which has been described earlier in the book before countless times. I hated the writing of it too much droning details not enough action, I'm sorry but Hollywood saved this story overall. I mean by the time something did seem to happen it was too late I've waited long enough and merely lost interest. Overall it's not worth buying, hardly worth checking out in your public library."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"i like books and this was a bad one. the end"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I would have to place Practical Magic on my top FIVE list of favorite films (The Goonies, Harry Potter, The Secret Garden & Titanic...are also on that list).

Not to say that I didn't like the book, but it was missing everything I loved about \\"Practical Magic.\\" In the film it was real magic...in the book it seemed more like silly little love 'spells' that aunts liked to do in their spare time.

The character of Sally Owens is just too drab and dry in the book. Also, the aunts are barely characters."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I bought this book about two years ago and couldn't get into it. After I saw the movie, I decided to give it another shot because I loved the movie. I could not believe how poorly written the book really was. The author goes back and forth between present and past tenses. She abruptly changes character viewpoints without a transition so you think you're reading about one character only to find she had changed to a different one. Very confusing. To make matters worse, she stops action right in the middle with long narrative flashbacks. The movie was a huge improvement over the book, and I actually liked it a lot. Now if I could only learn to fly off the roof..."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book covers a lot of ground in a very short time. Within the first 50 pages, Sally and Gillian, the two protagonist sisters of this tome, grow through adolescence and into young adulthood. Sally falls in love with a hardware store clerk, gets married, has two children who also grow into their teen years and then lose their, by now hardware store manager, father in a tragic automobile accident, and then they all move to another state. Meanwhile, Gillian rebels and leaves the roost, marrying three times, divorcing twice, committing apparent homicide against the third, and returning to Sally with a corpse in the back of her car.To say that Hoffman is in a hurry to get somewhere is to say everything. Unfortunately, where she is going is anyone's guess, but dinner would be a good bet. If Magic were indexed, one could probably find over two hundred and fifty references to food (more than one for every page) including twenty references for coke, eighteen for ice cream, and three for butter. Sadly, there would be only three references to witchcraft or magic. Why Hoffman decided to write about four generations of witches without including more than an occasional episode of witchcraft is the real mystery here. The answer may be that she wanted to ration the spells lest she really need them for conjuring something serious, like finding a plot. This practical side of Hoffman belies the unlikely title of Magic.There are conflicts, of course, but every problem along the way is solved with equal dispatch and economy: stuck in a bad marriage? Get a divorce. Stuck in a really bad marriage? Poison your husband. The house is haunted? Cut down the lilac bush. The kids are at each other's throats? Have the youngest confide to no one but the eldest a truly traumatic event and poof, best of friends. Feeling lonely? Meet a private investigator who just happens to intercept a letter meant for your sister. Need an ending for a book? Break out that ration card and cast a spell. The only significant problem in the book that doesn't get resolved is Hoffman's apparent obsession with food.Hoffman has difficulty describing anything without relating it, in some way, to eating. Gillian's emotional attachment to her suitor is so intense, that the butter in Sally's house kept melting, &quot;the way it does whenever love is under a roof. Even the sticks of butter in the refrigerator would melt, and anyone who wanted some would have to pour it on a piece of toast or measure it out with a tablespoon.&quot; Sally is so nice and kind that &quot;she'll pick your kids up at the high school or lend you sugar or eggs.&quot; When Kylie turns thirteen, instead of eating the special breakfast of pancakes that Sally makes for her, Kylie &quot;scoops two measly spoonfuls of fruit into a bowl and takes teeny, tiny bites, even though she's nearly six feet tall and weighs only a hundred and eighteen pounds.&quot;It is entirely possible that the five pounds that I gained while reading this book came as a direct result of reading this book. With all this emphasis on food, every page makes you hungry for something, anything. Anything, that is, except for the next page. Or anything else written by Hoffman."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I am an 8th grader, and I read this book after hearing about the film Practical Magic. Everyone probably thinks this story is mostly about witchcraft, but it doesnt really emphasize on it considering Hoffmann doesnt know that much about it. But overall, it is a fairly good story, about the bonds betweenm these very different sisters and their lives. But the characters were rather undeveloped, and you hardly find any information about who the hell these people are. And the characters personalities were rather bland, because first, there was Gillian, wild, sexy, Sally, plain, Antonia, beautiful, and Kylie, awkward. Women are no simple creatures, and are made of all different elements. If Hoffmann really does understand the feelings of her female readers (which i believe are all of the readers) this should show in her writing. A great story, but these are not very realistic characters. Women want someone they can relate to. If the author followed this form, I believe the book would've had much more praise than it recently has."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The characters are one dimensional. I don't want to be yet another \\"broken record\\" repeating what's already been said but I have to say this: the movie captures the title \\"practical magic\\" better than the book does. I never thought I'd see the day when a movie would out-do the book!The movie captures the essence of magic, whereas the novel tries to give \\"magical advice,\\" but still comes across as bland. The movie is a lot more whimsically inclined and loyal to the title.*possible spoilers as I compare it to the movie*The book is a lot more vulgar and crass. Simplistic in its narration and lacking in the depth of the characters and plot.Jimmy is never even alive in the book (save for his ghost, of course) he was a woman-beater and never really in love with Gillian. Just as insecure and simplistic as she was but just more aggressive about it.Gillian was a blonde (not a redhead) and ditzy to boot! Her self esteem and confidence were non-existent. The movie showed her in a more dignified manner -- and that's pretty bad.Sally was supposed to be the rational and structured one (according to the book AND movie), and she was for the first few chapters, then she deteriorates to an insecure mother who behaves like childishly at times.Antonia is a complete simpleton brat throughout the majority of the book.There's a scene with Kylie almost getting raped.The men are all the same. With only one thing in their mind. Unlike the movie which gives them some form of character.The aunts actually age... etcI could go on, but my point is... the book is a lot less like magic and more like real life drama with simplistic narration to it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have always liked the movie with Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock and I was expecting a very satisfying read. Unfortunately, Practical Magic proved to be a disappointment with its bland characters, loose plot and childish, simplistic tone. Gillian and Sally are one dimensional and mostly just pathetic. Although Sally's daughters are better portrayed than the grown up characters, teenage depression is simply not enough to save a lagging story. Jimmy and his angry ghost, the aunts, the conservative little town the girls grew up and Sally's love interest have very little place in the book and this does not help either.The only real success of the novel is Alice Hoffman's ability to \\"feed\\" magical realism into an impossible place such as the lower middle class American suburbia. Still, this does not compensate for a story that has no charm within itself."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"For someone with AH's writing style, this is how I feel about this book. It really could've been better, although it was not painfully difficult to read. I will agree with the reviews that said that they \\"don't understand how the movie ever came from this book apart from Gillian, and Sally, and the two aunts.\\" I think that seeing the movie frist gave me unfair expectations for how the plot should've been in the book. Not only was the plot out of order, but most parts were so unreccognizable that this book should really be set completely apart from the movie altogether.Now After I got over the fact that the book is different from the movie, even character-wise, I couldn't get over the writing style. It is just not something I'm used to. AH is excellent for her comparative descriptions, and painting a pretty \\"still\\" picture, but she is not good with following through in this story. I have never read another one of her books so I do not know if this is common for her. Also her writing style is described by others as light and easy to read. For me her pen was so light within this story that at some points it barely touched the paper. This is essentially a love story with many twists and turns. I am definately NOT a fan of romance novels, although I guess this one is alright. The fact that it is a romance novel is cleverly almost hidden.If there are those of you who haven't seen the movie as of yet and wish to get this book, I say read the book first and then see the movie. Although I can bet that whichever one is examined first will leave you hating the other. Either the book or the movie since the plot-lines are barely reccognizable. Still, I'm not sorry to have purchased this book as I am a sort of collector of these things."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was a fast page turner and written with alot of satire and humor. The story focuses on two sisters that grew up in a small Massachusetts community under the care of two aunts that everyone knows are witches. One sister, has no desire to live anything but a normal life, to the point of rigid conformity and the other is a free spirit that runs away and wants nothing to do with her family or her history and certainly does not want to be caught dead within a hundred miles of her hometown.But, as adults, one a PTA soccer type mom and the other barely on the run from the law, they find balance together and have to accept the magic with the mundane.The book is very nicely written (I have never seen the movie)and it is heartwarming. It sort of shows how pleasure is to be found in the simple things and that there is nothing wrong with opening your heart to another.When I was done reading the book, I closed it with a smile on my face. A modern day fairy tale, where the characters are flawed and human.The gift of the simple things in life is apparent on every page."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is a great book and it is a real shame that the book got turned into some Hollywood poltergeist movie. The book is well written and a page turner."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"i read this book a month ago.I couldn't put it down, and i didn't want it to end. I was really sad when it did. This is the best book I've ever read! It's so light in it's ways, so easy to understand, it is practicly Magic!! Hoffmann has given her readers a true gift in form of these characters. They are so wonderful. And you come to know and love them. And after Reading the book I started to read it again...That's how wonderful it was. I would recomend this at my strongest!!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I cannot believe that some reviewers did not like this book. I read it for the first time when I was 13, and stayed up all night reading. I couldn't finifh it in time, so I ran home after school the next day and immediately finished the book. I can reread it over and over again. Read the book before seeing the movie- it is a million times better (except without the great soundtrack). I cannot stress how much I love this book. Teenagers especially can relate to this book, and the struggles of teenagers in the book are perfect even coming from an adult. The fantasy aspect of the book, with the witchcraft, may seem on the outside to be slightly kooky and unrealistic, but Hoffman's writing is so lyrical you can taste everything she describes, you can feel what they feel. I have read and reread this book. All teenage girls should read it, and all mothers of teenage girls should read it to relate... Practical Magic makes you believe in love fairy tales, even after you've been hurt again and agian."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I loved &quot;Practical Magic&quot; the movie when it came out. Mostly due to the fact that it took a different twist towards what &quot;witches&quot; are and kind of stuck to the modern definition that they are more peaceful people -- of course, there's a bit of Hollywood thrown in, but it's forgiveable since &quot;Witches of Eastwick&quot; was so much fun as well. The book, however, is much more fun. If you've seen the movie, you should know that it's based on about 3/8 of the book. It is lengthy, but enjoyable as well. If they were to make a movie out of the whole book, it probably would end up a mini-series on TV. Not only to we get to see what happened to Sally and Gillian, but we get a more indepth look and relationship with Sally's daughters as well. We see the torment they went through school in details, we see their problems with men and boys, growing up, falling in love and searching for happiness. It's more realistic than the movie and it's relatable, which always gets me to keep the books I read in the end. The usage of magic is mostly limited to &quot;thought&quot; and small vocal incantations. Remember the woman who wanted the man to leave his wife and become her lover? We get to see what happens to her -- and remember &quot;be careful what you wish for...&quot; Other than that, I will not reveal any spoilers. It's not just about witches -- it's about women. It's a good book and it's fun. Unfortunately, the two aunts are more developed in the movie than the book, but you'll see why Sally, Gillian and the daughters are more focused upon than they are. Highly recommended reading for those who love a really good book."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book! It is such a wonderful read. I was SO disappionted with the film. It could have been wonderful. The casting was terrific, but it doesn't touch on the magical realism, well, except for the Aunts never aging, and there was no silly exorcism scene in the book.I love how Ms. Hoffman weaves her magiacal realism through her plots. Also, how she developes these amazingly honest and rteal relationships between her characters. I think that is one of her strongest themes, family.Anyway, do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK! It was lovely, charming and yes, MAGICAL!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this book before it was made into a movie and found it to be an interesting combination of fantasy and real life situations. The Owens' sisters witchcraft allowed them to do what many of us wished we could do when faced with various situations in our life."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I began *Practical Magic* without expectations -- what a fantastic surprise to stumble upon an author with a true talent for creating complex female characters. Hoffman has made me look at the world around me differently -- now the clouds, grass, and flowers seem to positively glow with life. Best advice: read this book when your in love, finished with love, or waiting for that extraordinary someone (i.e. this is a great book for everyone)!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"A wonderful little ragdoll of a novel - brilliant, but undisciplined, and who cares? It follows something like thirty years in the lives of Gillian and Sally Owens, who are orphaned at the ages of three and four, respectively, and grow up with their aunts (who are neither named nor described until the last fifty pages, as if Ms. Hoffman simply forgot to until that point). Their aunts just happen to be the last in a long line of honest-to-goodness wise woman, herbalist, spell-casting New England witches.I put off reading this for a long time, because, strangely, I don't like to read the sort of fiction I myself write. I finally did because my girlfriend, all of whose friends must summarily read it, would've had my head if I didn't. Well, actually, she probably would've frowned, tapped her foot, and said, &quot;grr,&quot; but you know what I mean. I liked it. It shoots off in weird directions, threads get lost and refound, or not, Antonia (one of Sally's daughters) is tragically neglected, and it's still one of very few books I read in less than two days."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I resented rewatched this movie and noticed it was based on a book so i eagerly got it for my kindle. I'm about a quarter of the way through and I'm not sure I'm going to bother to finish reading it. I'm finding the writing style a bit slow and where the movie was charming and characters were lovable, even with their flaws I'm not finding myself unsympathetic to any of the characters in the book. I'm not compelled to learn what happens to any of them because i just don't care about them. Each character is described as being totally selfish in their own way so i haven't bonded with any of the characters enough to want to read about them."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you like fairy tales, and I'm not talking the watered-down cartoon versions that we grew up on, but classic fairy tales, then you're going to love Hoffman. I'm a fan of all of her work, but Practical Magic and Turtle Moon are my absolute favorites. Although I liked the movie, it does not even begin to compare to this amazing novel. It will transport you into a magical place, scare you a little, and make you appreciate love and family a lot. I would suggest buying this book now, that way you'll have it for the next rainy day. On that day, lock yourself in your house, light some candles, put a Danny Elfman soundtrack and an Anna Madorsky CD on random in your CD player, pour a glass of your favorite beverage, and wrap yourself up thick in a blanket. If you do so, I promise you a little slice of Heaven on Earth."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The first thing to know about the book is that it isn't really at all like the movie with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. So it's almost like false advertisement to have the movie's pictures on the bookcover. Don't get me wrong, both the book and movie are great in their own right. The problem I had with Hoffman's writing was that it was mainly in the narrative. This almost always keeps a reader from connecting with the characters so you're not as involved or moved, so the book never reaches its full potential. It also makes reading it more stilted, awkward although writing in the narrative--without any offense to Hoffman--is cake.The plot on the other hand is great. Superb. This is one of those books that you struggle to get through--not because it's hard to get but because it starts to drag (another sign of too much narrative)--and then love it in hindsight. If you read this, there will be things that you won't forget for a long time. Mostly the little things. One of the Owens' ancestors dancing on broken glass in the moonlight, the story of Maria, cats following Sally home. The detail is amazing and I don't say that lightly, the connection that Sally and Gilly have are described excellantly and overall, if Ms. Hoffman had just written it more from the view of a participant rather than an observer I would have loved it that much more.I actually wish the movie had been more like the book in details. Like Sally's girls are older and there was a lot more character development in the book of all the persons. I do suggest that you read this though because I think I'm the only person picky enough to mind how the book was actually written. My only valid warning though is to not expect it to be like the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Though the time periods and character viewpoints jump around too much, this novel about a NE family of psuedo- witches is full of lush, evocative description. I enjoyed the many descriptions of food, plants and weather, and agree it is similar to Like Water For Chocolate.However, I also agree the plot is somewhat weak, the women too obviously beautiful and somewhat lacking in real personality. This I would blame on the disappointing lack of dialogue in Practical Magic. The men are basically flat. Lust seems to be more important than love--the author seems to want to drive the point home that you cannot escape lust/love no matter how hard you try. I didn't really learn anything from this novel, especially not anything to do with Wicca, witchcraft, or New Age philosophy.Overall it's a pretty good read if you're not too fussy."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I tracked down this book because I loved the movie. And, as hollywood usually does, the movie is generally poorer than the book it is based on. Boy, was I disappointed! The movie is far far far superior to the book. Interesting plots are dangled before you, but lead nowhere. Character development and growth is hoped for in the story, but never achieved. Gillian and Sally in the movie? Fabulous and fascinating. Gillian and Sally (and their daughters) in the book? Unremarkable and annoying. Allegory and symbolism in the movie? Ok, I'll admit, dumbed down a bit. But in the book? Terrible, and stuffed down your throat in the most condesending way. And the overall writing style? Atrocious! Seems like a draft of a book, rather than the finished product. I love modern fiction, but I am very sorry I spent money on this book. Also note that, on purpose, I didn't watch the movie again right before reading the book, just to take a clearer perspective of the author's words - and I still thought it was terrible!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"and after mulling it over I think that the book was OK, but not great. I admit I did see the movie several times before I bought the book, and they are VERY different from one another. The movie was much more dramatic, whereas the book(for me) moved very slowly. the aunts were not very promiant. There was barely any magic in the book and it didn't seem like much of a love story, Gary only shows up near the end. I didn't care about the characters, unlike the movie where it made me ache to have a sister! So, I went and bought the movie! I'm quite happy now."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read the book before I saw the movie. I loved it. I found it an easy, relaxing read. It was scary without being a horror story. What I found unique about this book is that it is a modern day fantasy story that almost seemed as if it could happen. It was out there, but not in the same way as the TV show, Charmed. I did not predict the ending. I liked it and I will read it again."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this book because I wanted to see the movie. I went into it with no expectations. I was surprise to find out what a delight it was. I was so engrossed in the book, I finished it within a few hours. It's clearly a piece of wonderful work. I have started to read Alice Hoffman's other novels and I am enjoying each one, but not as much as I enjoyed Practical Magic."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is the first time that I have read a Alice Hoffman book. I did not know she existed before the promo for the movie. I am now one of her biggest fans. Her style of writing is so refreshing. She spins a tale of adventure,hope, and everlasting love like no one has in a long time. There was never a dull moment in the book and the reader felt that they were a part of the story the whole time. Can't wait to see how they portrayed the charecters in the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Gripping, can't put the book down, detailed, exciting. I like how the book keeps adding new adventures, and held my interest to the very end.

What ended up happening was within the next twenty four hours i had finished the book, to my dissapointment. What's a girl to do? I read it again. And again. And again. Hoffamn is at her best with this book, her voice light and compelling as she draws you into the story of Sally and Gillian. This book is absolutely one of my favourites, ever. People who say otherwise watch too much TV and play too much golf, and have had their imaginations long since rotted away."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is the first novel by Alice Hoffman that I have read, and let me tell you, I have put an order for the rest of her books. The novel is an easy read, fast paced, enchanting, with beautiful descriptive powers and very believable characters-unlike others who characters are far from a real person's reality. The only regret I have is the book ended too soon-I wanted to stay with the Owens LONGER! Looking forward to the movie to see if it's possible to come close to the beauty of the book. If the star rating went higher than five stars, she would definitely deserve at least ten!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Alice Hoffman has a way with words that is truly unique. I've read all of her books and each one is better than the last. I went out and planted lilac bushes after reading this one. Fabulous! Don't believe any negative reviews of her writing. Her words are enchanted and she seductively draws you into her world and her stories."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I really felt like I was back in high school or junior high.

I'll be first in line!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I am in ninth grade english, and I have read this book in less than three days.

This book is magnificent except for some bad words. GOOD BOOK!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This purchase was well worth the effort.

I love everything about it, from the sweeping views to the gorgeous home that was built just for the set!

This book is enthralling, it pulls you in and holds you captive with it's rich descriptions and full bodied characters. No wonder they made it a movie.I'm so impressed with this author I've ordered two more of her books. I would highly recommend this book to anyone! It's wonderfully written, and not too \\"witchy\\" for those who aren't into witches.Happy Reading =}"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This story is the perfect blend of the real and the magical. Starting with two orphaned girls being raised by their \\"unconventional\\" aunts...the book then blossoms into an examination of family relationships, true love, and what hope and belief really mean.The relationships between the Aunts (Frances and Bridget-known as Jet), the girls (Sally and Gillian), and Sally's children (Antonia and Kylie) develop and change over the 30 year or so timespan of the book in a way that is absolutely something beautiful. The growth of all of these characters, the hard lessons learned, the joy and wonder embraced...make it a treasure even aside from it's magic.But this book does indeed also have a very magical side. There is magic woven through the Owens family dating back hundreds of years. The Aunts actively practice love magic for the town's women, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Sally and Gillian struggle though out their lives wavering between embracing what they are and rejecting it in the attempt to live a more normal life. By the conclusion, after one particularly hard lesson is learned, they seem to have found that balance...Note: I would have given this a full 5 stars if not for the element of animal sacrifice involved in the Aunts love magic.NOTE: Honest Review of a book from my personal library - purchased from another retailer."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I mostly read HORROR. However, I'd seen the movie several years earlier & liked it, so I went ahead and tried the book. I was AMAZED at How Well Written the Novel is. It's Up-Beat & Bewitching. The momentum that Hoffman had for this book never faltered. As for the \\"Witches\\" it's only a minor part of the tale.Honestly, I'm not a big fan of female writers.

It makes me feel like I'm there in the story, and it's so fun and mystical and romantic all in one.

They're the ones people cross the street to avoid...the Owens women are witches. Raised by their two aunts, Sally and Gillian Owens grow up to be polar opposites. Sally is always practical and straight-laced; most concerned with keeping the lives of her two daughters as normal as possible. Gillian, on the other hand, is a free spirit...perhaps a little too free at times.This story follows Sally and Gillian through their trials and tribulations with life, love, and death, and Hoffman's wonderful storytelling makes it, simply, magical! Wonderful twists and turns lurk around every corner of this funny, touching, and at times, dark story...brimming over with themes of compassion, redemption, and inner strength. Playing on every human emotion, Hoffman has struck absolute gold.If you've ever seen the movie,forget it, and pick up this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Hoffman is one of my favorite authors, so I was not going to pass this one up!

Angelina Mouseling is a small white mouse--perhaps somewhere between six and ten years old in people years--who has the complete attention of her parents and grandparents no matter what. Then one day, her mother has a baby! The new baby sister, Polly, is adorable and Angelina tries very, very hard to be interested and attentive and loving. But it's tough. No one is much paying attention to Angelina now that Polly's here, and that's especially upsetting to Angelina because she's recently been given an award at dance class.Angelina finally gives in to her anger and throws off steam in the privacy of her bedroom. The problem is that in doing so, she accidentally breaks the award statuette she's recently earned. The adults--parents and grandparents alike--are surprised by Angelina's mood and soon figure out the connection to the new baby, Polly.All ends well, however, and Angelina is able to look at Polly as a possible new audience member for Angelina's impromptu dance recitals at home. This is a dear, sweet book that examines honestly the difficulties involved in dealing with a new sibling. The illustrations by Helen Craig are, as always, just precious--softly colored, beautifully detailed, and always in step with the text."},{"Title":"Angelina's Baby Sister","review":"My niece, who LOVES Angelina, was expecting a baby sister, so I was excited to find this book. I ordered it based on the other reviews. It started well, but when I reached the page where \\"At that moment she [Angelina] hated Polly [the new baby] and wished Polly would just disappear!\\" I was taken aback. Hated? My 3-year old niece does not yet know that concept, and I sure didn't want to be the one to introduce it! On the next page Angelina has a tantrum and completely trashes her room. I decided I didn't want to give my niece ideas like this - and didn't give her book. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Angelina's Baby Sister","review":"My daughter just turned 3, and we have a new baby in the house. Angelina is new to my daughter, but I knew that my niece liked her when she was younger. We picked a couple of Angelina books out at the library. I had a problem with Angelina's behavior in both books, and my daughter emulated the bad behavior from this book!When Angelina isn't getting the attention she wants, she throws a tantrum. She tosses books and toys around the room. As a result, she then gets the attention she desires from her parents and grandparents. After reading this, my daughter threw books at the door of her room one day, then told me \\"I just got so angry,\\" which is what Angela says in the book. And I had actually toned down Angelina's tantrum when I got to that part.I also didn't like the fact that Angelina says she \\"hates\\" her baby sister (I skipped that line when reading it). I suppose this is a lesson to me, to read books before reading them to my daughter.While the other book we checked out, \\"Angela's Birthday,\\" was okay, there was still a point where Angela crashes her bike and says \\"Why did you make me race?\\" to her friend Alice. I didn't see how placing the blame on someone else held any value in the story. Again, I edited this when reading to \\"Why did we have to race?\\"If you're looking for a book for a new or soon-to-be older sibling, my daughter enjoyed \\"ZaZa's Baby Brother\\" and \\"The Berenstain Bears' New Baby.\\""},{"Title":"Angelina's Baby Sister","review":"The moral of this book is awful! Throw enormous tantrums to get your way and if you ruin anything in the process it will be fixed. Hate your baby!

Anyone reading to a child hopefully reads through the book a couple of times prior to reading to the child. Reading can be balanced showing what is expected and what actually happens. This books adds balance and depth to Angelina's character. Her behavior is typical of children who may not understand sharing, that things change, but that they are no less appreciated. Angelina's family reacts through understanding, encouragement and allowing it to be a learning experience. There is nothing permissive or coddling from the parents. Angelina comes to the realization that being a big sister is a challenge. She ends the book reading (sharing) her favorite book and whispering,she is going to teach her sister to dance, sharing her first love. There is nothing inappropriate in the book.

I felt this was the weakest of all the books in the Angelina series due to a number of reasons: the adults seem to ignore Angelina without reassuring her from the beginning, Angelina says some very harsh words about her baby sister and uses the word \\"hate\\" which I deem too harsh for my preschooler to hear [she has no real concept of what the word means as she hardly ever hears it used], and in the end Angelina throws a full-scale temper tantrum, destroying her room in order to vent her anger which also seems a bit extreme.My 4-year-old and I love the books in the Angelina series and it's too bad that this particular book was written without too much thought put into it. The others in the series are much better, but if you're new to the series, you may want to skip this."},{"Title":"Angelina's Baby Sister","review":"This story is about a mouse named Angelina and her mom has just ahad a baby.

Davis was a combat cameraman who is often and (wrongly as the book points out) credited with some of the wars most memorable footage. The book was to be co-written by Bowden and Davis but sadly Davis was killed in a shoot-out in Thailand before the book was complete. The Bowden as the credited sole author does little research on his subject other then transcribe tapes Davis made on his life.Davis life is interesting, but the book is not good research material for those wanting to find out what really happened in the Vietnam war. The book is mostly about singing Davis's praises as a great Aussie who drank lots and didn't really care too much. Davis seems to take little interest in the politics or personalties shaping the war. Instead he spent his time \`drinking with his mates and chasing Asian Sheilas.'Davis declines to give any insight into or information about on Australian soldier's behaviour. Sticking to &quot;I saw nothing bad, I heard nothing bad&quot; routine when talking about his fellow countrymen. Most of the book deals with the thrills of going into combat, cheating on his Asian wife and how he felt it was just one big thrill after another to be free from the western idea of right and wrong. Furthermore Davis's journalistic credibility goes completely out the window when we learn that part of the attraction of going into combat with the Asian soldiers was eating the enemy corpses.Cannibalism was a fact that Davis said he intentionally hid and much indulged in at the time. In the end Davis was addicted to the thrill of war and the Asian women whom he saw as part of a big amusement park that he had fun with but little commitment too."},{"Title":"One Crowded Hour (Oe): Neil Davis, Combat Cameraman","review":"This is a belated review of a biography of Neil Davis, the legendary Australian journalist who made his name as a video photographer in Southeast Asia and Africa.The book, ONE CROWDED HOUR, NEIL DAVIS, COMBAT CAMERAMAN, 1934-1985, was published in Australia in 1987, two years after Davis's untimely death, and it has not, I believe, been published in America. It should have been, because the life story of Neil Davis describes a fabulous career that saw Davis cover major news events in the latter half of the 20th century, as both a TV cameraman and a journalist/writer.The author of this review worked with Davis in Cambodia from 1973-75, and he holds the Australian in the highest esteem. He was not only a savvy journalist; he was truly a gentleman - a rarity amongst the foreign correspondent corps in Southeast Asia.Davis died, tragically, on a Bangkok street in 1985 when he got caught in crossfire during one of the many coup attempts in Thailand. His death was a waste, in that it cut down the career of a journalist who was, perhaps, more plugged into the key players in the war in Vietnam and Cambodia - and later, briefly, in Africa. The book will also give some keen insights into the wars in Vietnam and Cambodia.Even though he faced a tragic death, we are fortunate that prior to Davis' death Tim Bowden had been planning to write Davis' biography, and he had met several times with the Australian cameraman in order to gather the material he needed to write ONE CROWDED HOUR. If you want to know what being a combat correspondent is like, then this book will more than fill the bill."},{"Title":"One Crowded Hour (Oe): Neil Davis, Combat Cameraman","review":"The first reviewer obviously has a bee in his bonnet about Western men and Asian women, and this appears to adversely color his or her review of a very fine book. Much of Bowden's exceptional work derives from his collecting data from Bowden's diaries and letters to his aunt, which Bowden arranges in thematically interesting chapters. There are gems, such as the description of the VC double agent on page 212 of my paperback edition (I know the agent). Overall, brilliant, insightful work by Bowden, on a remarkable character."},{"Title":"One Crowded Hour (Oe): Neil Davis, Combat Cameraman","review":"I was surprised at the lack of balance in the reviews of &quot;One Crowd Hour&quot;. Neil Davis might have been a &quot;typical Aussie bloke&quot; but he was a typical Aussie bloke with lots of differences. Firstly, Davis did not share the racism of his &quot;typical&quot; fellow Australians: he only covered the Vietnamese troops and he said the Vietnam war was &quot;their&quot; war. Davis may have little to say about the Australian troops because he didn't cover the Australian troops. He only filmed the Vietnamese troops, and then the Cambodian troops, who did most of the fighting. Secondly, Davis worked for an international news agency so he was not in Vietnam to cover the Australian troops. Thirdly, to accuse Davis of not identifing with the Vietnamese and Cambodian people is plainly untrue and a smear on Davis's name. Davis refused to leave Vietnam and Cambodia when his employers wanted him out. He loved Cambodia and made that country his home. He only left Cambodia when the Khmar Rouge took over. Davis was recognized by his journalistic peers as an expert on the Vietnamese and Cambodian wars. How many cameramen write articles for magazines like the Far Eastern Economc review. After the war end, Davis remained in South East Asia. Davis greatest weakness in eyes of people like Ash Long is not his drinking with his mates or womenizing but his failure to endorse the left-wing position on the Vietnam War that meant supporting North Vietnam and the Khmar Rouge. Davis know enough about the war to be sceptical about the champions of the left. &quot;One Crowd Hour&quot; has become a classic of Australian biography. I recommend it because Davis was not a typical Australian: he did not show any of the racism that was SO typical of Australians in the sixties."},{"Title":"One Crowded Hour (Oe): Neil Davis, Combat Cameraman","review":"A curious life, a curious career for a most unusual Tasmanian and every page deeply interesting.

It tells the story of an ordinary Australian bloke in extraordinary circumstances. For some 20 years Neil Davis covered the conflicts in South-East Asia.

Provides a good overview of the people, culture, history, and city itself. Good maps, especially of subte. Somewhat dated but still contained all information I needed to know. Was especially grateful for warnings about exorbitant phone prices and inability to use Discover Card in Argentina. Good recommendations and phone numbers, especially for Teatro Colon and other cultural sites. A great deal for the price."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Buenos Aires (Lonely Planet City Guide)","review":"Lonely Planet is usually relatively weak in city guides, while they are much stronger in country and regional guidebooks. But this guide to Buenos Aires is surely an exception. It is an indispensable tool for all visitors, useful to the budget traveller and the business person alike, filled with tips, information and data. The only bad point is perhaps that, the way things are quickly changing in Argentina, its advice won't always be up-to-date. And - one should stress - Buenos Aires is not just a paradise, as this book may let one think. Yet, overall, a very good book worth taking with you."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Buenos Aires (Lonely Planet City Guide)","review":"I was happy to see the second edition with updated prices and info. Unfortunately, like the first it is long on facts, but short on opinion. This is okay if you're looking for a list of things to do, but is of little help where there are real choices -- whether hotels, restaurants or tango shows. They're listed, but there's not really much to tell you which to pick, unless all you care about is location and cost.I know the author has opinions (they occasionally slip through), and hope in the 3rd ed. he'll let them out!Still, it's the best guidebook I've seen on what to do in and around the city.There's a warning about extra phone charges which is a bit understated. The hotels I've stayed in charge between 0.20 and 0.40 per minute for local calls, not per call. In North America, I'll often stay on-line while I compose replies to my e-mails to save the per call charge. Doing that in BsAs hit me with enormous, unexpected phone charges on my hotel bill!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Buenos Aires (Lonely Planet City Guide)","review":"I visited Buenos Aires in May 1999. I found Bernhardson's review to be almost perfect in pointing out places to eat, sightsee, shop, and how to get there (or rather, how to obtain information on how to get there from the locals). Even his club recommendations were perfect for me - I was 19, and his description of one club's crowd as &quot;young and unpretentious&quot; proved to be true and exactly what I was looking for.

It's not uncommon for mediocre writers to go far because they know how to entertain. What's striking about Ishle Park's work is that she's both a writer and a performer. She does both equally well which is why she's received so much deserved acclaim.As a professor of Asian Pacific Islander literature, I've taught Park's work in both undergraduate and graduate seminars. Park writes about her subject matter with truth and sincerity in words so lyrical it's not uncommon to respond to her pieces simply for their sound. But there's so much more than that. She doesn't self-consciously display the requisite ethnic identity struggles, and what my students note in particular is the way she simply tells her stories--the issues, though present, unfold naturally as a part of her poetry. What she writes feels real and is real, which is why I suspect she is the Poet Laureate of Queens.If you get the chance to see her perform, please go. She delivers her work in a way that makes you feel you really are talking with her aunt, or that you really are on the receiving end of a love poem. I've seen her leave an entire audience completely spellbound. The beauty of her personality is apparent when she performs because she's not \\"performing.\\" She's telling you everything she feels. Reading her work, listening to it, seeing it live will all be more than worth your time."},{"Title":"The Temperature of This Water","review":"I have not had the opportunity to see Ms. Park perform so I can only review the work in her book. I was actually first drawn to her writing when I saw her poem \\"Zola Kai Mabel Hisae Chiati Cindy Feliz\\" in a small literary journal. That poem was so lyrical and moving that I sought out more of her writing. I was not disappointed. The Temperature of This Water is simply excellent. The poems and short stories focus on love, heartbreak, & growing up Korean American in NYC-- they are written with raw honesty and sincere emotion. I also really appreciate that anyone can relate to the themes in this book. I find a lot of contemporary poetry to be so obtuse or pretentious that half the time you don't even know what it's about. Yet the accessibility of her writing doesn't diminish its intensity. I look forward to her next book."},{"Title":"The Temperature of This Water","review":"Perhaps the hype surrounding her (especially after her Def Poetry gig) created an unreal unexpectation on her work for me. While I believe her voice is a solid addition to both the poetry scene and in Asian American (and American) literature generally, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed in this work.There are moments of brilliance in her poetry when her words amplify often-muted voices of struggle, pain, and survival. However they are peppered through a sometimes stale landscape of ideas that are disguised in overwrought emotion and overthetop delivery.This is not to say I didn't enjoy it on whole nor to deter you from reading it. However, at times, some of the heavy-handed strokes made me cringe a bit. And although I don't agree to the extent the first reviewer, I do feel some of hype and the \\"five star\\" reviews here ignore some of the fallacies of this particular work.That being all said, I do look forward to Ms. Park's future works as her voice and form continues to more fully develop."},{"Title":"The Temperature of This Water","review":"mixing and clashing Korean and Korean American with Latinate forces to delineate, emote, and detonate the makings of a localized and globalized New York City on the edge of chaos and redemption. \\"The Temperature of This Water\\" registers the temperature of a city inside and outside America, and a poetry brave and caustic enough to cut into the mongrel ethos as worked out on the body and forms of this newness. Fine first book, Kaya Press keeping it urban-real beyond the multicultural frames of expectation and the fireside poetry of formal piety and pastoral bliss."},{"Title":"The Temperature of This Water","review":"After reading this book I felt as if I could relate to Ishle. My teacher lent me this book to read and It inspired me so much that I wrote an essay on how Ishle Yi Park's writing influenced me.I also went to one of her book readings in Berkeley. That is one day I will never forget. As soon as Ishle began to read her poem Uma, I began to cry. She read with so much emotion. I will never forget this book. I bought a copy for myself and it is very special to me. I love this book."},{"Title":"The Temperature of This Water","review":"Many \\"spoken word performers\\" put the performance before their words, think poetry equates to rhythmic screaming, and personally repulse me with their egoes. Ishle Yi Park is NOT of this ilk: Ishle's poetry, exquisitely and carefully crafted, reflects truth and beauty; the confusing complexity (call it contemporary negative capability) of family dynamics and racial relations for our generation. This book has so profoundly touched me I have given away several copies to my students, including one of my 11th graders who struggled because she never identified with herself in literature, much less understood poetry, until she read Ishle. I sent Ishle a copy of the essay this student wrote about \\"The Temperature of This Water;\\" not only did Ishle write back a beautiful and tearful letter of appreciation, she took time to meet with the girl when she was in San Francisco. Hence, my respect goes to Ms. Park for the lyrical sincerity she practices in her poetry and life."},{"Title":"The Temperature of This Water","review":"Ms. Park's poems and stories reveal her penetrating insight into the Asian-American experience, and into New York City's ever-changing melting pot. Her work is alive with empathy and honesty. In \\"Anatomy of a Fish Store\\" she shows a multi-dimensional understanding of the spectrum from her own background to her surroundings, and the interplay of many different ethnicities.As a teacher, I find her work very promising for use with high school or college-level students. Her authenticity, hipness and street-smarts are a natural for hard-to-reach teens to connect with. Her humanity and intelligence should make her work appealing to readers of all backgrounds."},{"Title":"The Temperature of This Water","review":"What the hell was that previous review??? \\"Yo-Momma\\"? Is this a joke, or somebody with a thorn in a bad place? \\"Yo-Momma\\" only has one review of ANYTHING on Amazon? Somehow I suspect the authenticity of the previous review.My first joyful experience with Miss Park's work was via an audio CD of her reading from her best work (and WOW what an experience. This beautiful young woman is a PERFORMANCE artist - she reminds you what a TRUE artist is. Honestly, it is f'ing scary how talented she is) and I was genuinely moved. Not only did I immediately get a copy of this book after hearing her CD, but I had the rare honor of witnessing a poetry reading by Park. On one hand, the experience was so stunning it made me feel like less of a person because I felt she was so much more talented than I (I am a visual artist who once dated a writer/poet, then a dancer, then a visual artist, and so on, so I feel I relate to all of the arts)... on the other hand, I found her work so awe-inspiring that it left me feeling better about the world, and even more optimistic about life, in general (let's just say these past 4-5 years had really gotten me down). Her work actually affected me for a long time after reading it. This book is not quickly forgotten.Oh, and yeah, yeah, yeah... I may not be an Asian-American, but you know what? I want - hell, I NEED - other perspectives in my life. Whatever it is you (\\"Yo-Momma\\") claim to see that is hackneyed in this book, I certainly don't see it. Your review does nothing more than make me question your authenticity - I mean, \\"Yo-Momma\\"? Somehow I doubt that is your real name or that you are even the Asian-American you claim to be in your review (\\"brothers and sisters\\"). I can't fathom why someone would devote time to denying this book to anyone. You have inspired me want to buy dozens of copies of this book so I can hand them out to special people in my life. I certainly prefer to share this amazing work than turn people away from it - I can't even grasp why anyone would try and turn others off to such a work, but then again, I don't understand censorship, either. I wouldn't be surprised if she starts winning tons of awards, soon, or probably already has. Mark my words.If I could find more writers and performers out there that exist on the same level that Ishle Park occupies, I would devour their work. I encourage others to devour Ishle Park's work. We need more Parks on this planet (and, no, smartypants, that is not an environmental comment or desire). We could certainly use fewer \\"Yo-Momma\\"s, if indeed that is your real name."},{"Title":"The Temperature of This Water","review":"while there were lyrical twists that led me to anticipate much more, i kept finding myself wholly unsatisfied at every turn and much disappointed in the end.part of me is very sorry to write this; particularly because she and her asian american poet contemporaries are important to enhancing, diversifying, and complicating the literary scene (and canon). i am also saddened because she had been celebrated in so many spaces, from the classroom to the stage... i cringe at thinking she is forced to be one of the representative creative voices for my generation.i found this work to be tepid at best. her work in general is hackneyed and trite. like her live performance, she tries too hard to be down, desperately trying to follow a spoken word/ urban poetry track rather than redefining it through her voice. even if she is wedded to that tradition, she may follow the cadence but not it's soul.those that find her compelling don't realize what they enjoy is the kitsch of her poorly done act. a rehash of old asian american literary voices in a form that is ill-fitted. this is not because she is an asian woman doing this (because there are tight, on point api women who are stellar poets and spoken word artists!)... this is because ms. park's work and ability are lacking flavor and depth of thought.i know people may disagree with this review. however, when there are so few voices that allow my community to be heard, i want these groundbreaking folks to really break ground... not merely slap on an \\"asian sensibility\\" on an overdone product.we need to redefine the landscape of poetry, my brothers and sisters. unfortunately, it will not be done through her work."},{"Title":"The Temperature of This Water","review":"This book was okay. I too was taken into the hype by her appearance on Def Poetry Jam, her status as Poet Laureate, and just the general excitement over supporting an Asian American female poet.I must honestly say that I was a bit disappointed. While I'm happy that she is achieving acclaim for her work, I agree with another reviewer that she seems to be trying hard to be \\"down,\\" and quite often the poems do not feel authentic. At other times she seems to go for the shock value--for example, she keeps emphasizing cultural differences when describing an interracial relationship that she had--and the end result is a sophomoric lack of depth.I don't think this is a bad book, but overall I'd probably say there are better poets out there. I hate to pit one Asian American poet against another, but one who impressed me a lot is Suji Kwock Kim, author ofNotes from the Divided Country: Poems. Definitely check out Ms. Kim's book."},{"Title":"No Spark Of Malice -","review":"This is the story of a crime in the last century in a rural part of Louisiana. But it is also much more.

In a short set of chapters the author gives us both the history and the interest.

The Prince's tutor took him to a land where mercenaries reigned, but these soldiers for hire were different. The prince grew up in this land and became one of the mercenaries. He was called upon to go with his fellow soldiers to fight in a war in which the very queen who had destroyed his family was the opponent. The prince saves a baby princess and her aunt from the queen and takes them to the land of mercenaries. Throughout their journey, the prince must face the hostility of the aunt (who was also the captain of the gaurd for the kingdom). It isn't until later that the aunt is set straight -- these mercenaries only fight for truth, honor, and justice. Needless to say, her attitude changes toward the mercenaries, and even more so toward the prince.... The rest is for me to know and you to find out.This was a wonderful book, I enjoyed the unusual mercenaries and the aunt's attitude and the happy ending. Also the nomadic people in the book are neat.

All everyone understood was death and mutation. The extraterrestrial Kasaran had sent their friendly hello in a microscopic genetic package throughout the universe in search of intelligent life. When the probe reached earth, it took a wicked twist that its creators could not have envisioned: it had murdered billions without rhyme or reason.When the plague finally ended its devastating run, two humanoid geneses contend for planetary superiority. One group consisted of those former home sapiens that the virus transformed into an alien populace clamoring for contact with the mother species. The other group is the surviving members of Homo Sapiens who somehow contained a natural immunity to the virus and remain human. After the debacle of the first contact, they prefer nothing to with the Kasaran killing machine.The Bridge is an excellent science fiction thriller that centers on complex actions and reactions. The story line is crisp, fast-paced, and thought provoking as the reader realizes that even in the innocence of knowledge-seeking and friendships, death even holocausts, can occur. Anyone who enjoys classic Star Trek will fully relish Janine Ellen Young's awesome first contact tale and seek her debut novel, Cinderblock.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"The Bridge is a strangely powerful and moving literary journey; and, one that may be dificult to accept -- at first. Unlike some other reviewers, I was captivated by this book that doesn't fit the 'normal' mold for science fiction. The author takes a fascinating idea -- a race that communicates through viral means -- and successfully provides multiple viewpoints on a tragic but ultimately moving story.This novel clearly fits into the 'hopeful' view of alien contact -- whithout minimizing the trauma and upheaval that would be created by such an encounter. And, while I don't know how accurately it was done, the author successfully creates a sense of place for India and its culture, while also capturing a feel for New York.The book successfully deals with tragedy, anger, hatred, loss and grief while maintaining a positive, life affirming tone. While this book does spend more time dealing with emotion than technology, this choice is consistent with plot and in no way detracts from the reader's experience.Finally, the book has a strong conlusion that left me with a feeling of proper closure -- something that seems increasingly rare these days. Unlike a lot of other books, the last page did not leave me feeling like the author ran out of ideas and brought the story to an ungainly and untimely end.If you are looking for a though provoking, enjoyable read -- that will leave thoughts resonating in your head for some time after you are done -- you should read this book."},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"I was startled to see the bad reviews for this book. I read it six months ago, and the ideas are still with me. Maybe it's because I read a much wider variety of books than sci-fi, but I didn't find the book slow at all. It does focus more on relationships and spiritual matters, but in a very interesting and haunting way. I believe the concept is well explored and the book well written. This is the kind of book I love to pass on to friends."},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"This is a beautifully written book, well-thought out and developed characters, and beautifully described surroundings - you'll think you actually are in India in a couple of the scenes. The plot is nicely developed, from a pandemnic that wipes out most of the world population, to the rebuilt society. I particularly enjoyed the character development throughout the novel, where the people started, where they were after the pandemic, and where they ended up. Fascinating from a psychological point of view! A nice, satisfying read, and not one that's so complicated you'll need a degree in astronomy or computer sciences to figure out."},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"Full of rich analogies, metaphors, and deep congruences... a great story, almost-real characters, and a poetic yet unpretentious prose style. Good science fiction, and good literature."},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"While I found the basic concept of Young's &quot;The Bridge&quot; to be quite interesting, a distant alien race attempting to communicate by sending a message encoded in a virus, I found the story of this attempt to be slow and emotionally unmoving.The characters are generally unsympathetic and didn't evoke any feelings in me other than the hope that they'd just get on with it. They related as badly to each other as they did to me.The destruction of most of humanity, and the residual longing generated within the minds of the survivors of the virus for contact with the senders of the virus message, felt like a shakey foundation for a story that meandered to an equally shakey conclusion.I was not informed, I was not involved, I was not surprised, and I was not particularly happy to have spent the time that I devoted to this book.Not a keeper."},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"This is a fine read, a deftly plotted story, and a fresh look at first contact. Young's science is convincing and her hand with technology is sure, but mostly, this is a story about people who matter. A fine novel for anyone who enjoys hard sf and character-based fiction."},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"Shades of the Wild Card virus here, and of Octavia Butler'sXenogenesis. A nasty alien bug divides humanity, by altering the mindsand consciouness of those infected. This leaves the normal humans andthe alien-humans at odds, and they have to work out how to deal withthe new society, after the immense upheaval this causes."},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"While I found the idea of the book interesting, the execution was boring in the extreme. I'd be reading along and then find myself thinking about something else altogether (like, say housework). I think if the author had stuck to fewer, better developed characters, it would have been much more satisfying. As it is, it reads more like an outline than a book."},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"I rarely flame a book, because I know what it takes to put one together. However, The Bridge doesn't make sense for so many reasons. The characters are not real. I cannot imagine a mother committing suicide right after giving birth. It is not realistic to believe food would start flowing back to the cities after a pandemic virus wipes out 4 billion people. And who kept the power grid running during this disaster?Yes, there is a sci-fi premise regarding first contact (sort of), but humanity tends to react a bit differently in the light of megadeath than what was depicted here."},{"Title":"The Bridge","review":"This is more of a popular fiction novel with a science fiction theme than a true science fiction novel. It is hard to explain the difference, but it has to do with the way that the novel sets up the characters and progresses through the plot, and the writing style itself. The idea is a good one, but the presentation left me cold. Maybe I'm just a &quot;literary SF&quot; snob, but if you are too, you'll be disappointed in this novel."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"This purported economist cherry picks his stats (a common historical comparison of his hodgepodge of stats would provide greater credence) in order to substantiate his position that Americans are infected with a consumption fever. Although his overall contention about the increased consumption of \\"luxury goods\\" is true, his patent moralizing discredits what should otherwise be his nonbiased academic standing and casts doubts about his recommendations. What is even more offensive is his implicit assumption that Americans are weak & stupid because of things such as the proliferation of credit cards \\"causes\\" them to spend beyond their means. This assumption is akin to overweight Americans blaming McDonald's for their obesity.This book is for you if you believe that government officials (i.e. Big Brother) should be the arbiters of your behavior and that the individual is never to blame or to take the consequences of his/her actions.I recommend reading \\"Living It Up\\" by Twitchell instead."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Professor Frank looks at our world through a fresh lens, revealing the underlying similarities in diverse examples of consumerism run amok. He argues, convincingly, that the behavior that most people would prefer to avoid is an inevitable, if perverse, consequence of individually rational behavior. With a breadth of research that is rare among today's narrowly-focussed social scientists, he supports his argument with empirical studies from a variety of literature. His ideas offer added support for simplifying our inefficient tax system to place greater reliance on taxing consumption and less on taxing income. He's a skillful writer who makes his ideas accessible to all, and he is sure to affect the national debate over taxes and the quality of life."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"This book provides some great ideas for policy proposals to counter current conservative trickle-down policy trends. It is a very readable explaination of current economic research presented with hardly a graph or an equation.

I recommend both and I recommend reading them in this order. Kingsolver points out the callous and self-serving nature of middle and upper-class America in a very emotional way. Frank points out the same in a much more dispassionate way and then offers viable solutions. I found this book to be well-written, even-handed, thorough, and absorbing. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"The premise of this book is simple: (1) People spend too much money on luxury goods, (2) less wealthy people spend more on luxury goods because super rich people spend a great deal, and (3) we'd all be better off if people spent less on luxury goods and more on helping others. Everything of value in this book might make a short article in a magazine - expanding it into a book makes it mind numbing. Unless you have an extremely high tolerance for reading the same thing over and over, pass on this book."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Frank's book is a must read for all of us who have bought more and enjoyed it less. It is about time we had a map out of our consumerist wilderness."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"This is one best cases for a more equitable society that I've ever read. The author can't be tagged as a liberal or conservative, though elements of both parties have attacked him as such. He writes, \\"By scaling back on the rate at which luxury consumption has been growing, we could drink safer water, breath cleaner air, and eat food that is less likely to make us seriously ill. We could have more autonomy, variety, and safety in the workplace. We could fill the potholes in our streets, fix our crumbling bridges, and provide more help for people with serious drug problems. We could save enough to retire with complete financial security.\\" What I like best about Frank's argument is the change a consumption tax would have on wealthy people: it would restore them to the role of people to be admired for their contributions and not just their wealth and their ability to avoid taxes. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Mr. Frank has written many interesting articles, but this is not one of them. There are simply too many assertions and what evidence is provided is incomplete. For example, Frank argues that people really don't value additional wealth once they get past a certain level. As evidence he points to surveys that claim to show that Americans rate their happiness at the same level on a 1 to 10 scale as people who live in poorer countries. Does this really mean that if you took an American who rated their happiness at 8 and moved them to Turkey and lowered their income so that their rank remained the same relative to the rest of the population they would remain as happy? I find this hard to believe.People may accumulate wealth because of what others think of them, but they may also do so because they really like having nicer cars and homes. Frank is correct that taxes will stop people from purchasing luxury goods, but before we all agree to this I would like to have some evidence that he is correct. This book would have been much more convincing if he had some evidence."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"While reading this book, I had a hard time believing that this guy was really serious. Frank describes his living conditions while in the peace corps (&quot;no electricity, no heat, no indoor toilet, no running water. The local diet offered little variety and virtually no meat.&quot;) and claims that &quot;I experienced a feeling of prosperity that I have recaptured only in recent years.&quot; According to Frank we would all be just as happy living in those spartan conditions as we are now if we would only give it a chance. We are just deluding ourselves into thinking that we really want electricity or air conditioning or a varied diet. According to Frank we only want these items because our neighbors have them and they only want them because we do. According to Frank we will all be happier and live longer if the government simply taxes away our money so that we won't be tempted to spend it on these worthless items. Big government is really good for us. We just falsely think that we want to spend the money on our families and ourselves. Boy am I glad that Frank came along to tell me what I really want!"},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Professor Frank's title for Chaper 10 'smart for one dumb for all' sums up much of the recent business and political behavior in our country.Jobs are going to China and a flood of imports are drowning our factories because our government and business leaders are practicing &quot;smart for one&quot; while our country slides toward the status of a 3rd world nation.It is said that a nation's wealth is measured by what it can manufacture - not by what it consumes (who said that?)Every CEO worth his or her salt these days is moving manufacturing operations overseas as fast as possile to get a piece of the short-term profits under &quot;smart for one&quot;. If this continues, the 'dumb for all' effect will doom us to to poverty and China will (again?) rule the world of commerce.Luxury Fever is a great book which should be read by every person who cares about the USA over the long haul - especially our elected officials. I'd like to see RH Franks (Luxury Fever) team up with Ravi Batra (The Myth of Free Trade) as lobbyists to return sanity to our country's business climate.Adam Smith has been taken out of context. When he spoke about the &quot;Invisible Hand&quot; (of commerce) there was an ethic in the land that accepted pervasive empathy as a given. Today, our leaders push unbridled avarice and seem to think that empathy is only for the weak 'players'."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Driving to work daily, my small but reliable Toyota Corolla is often surrounded by these massive SUV jeeps driven by single occupants. The local supermarket parking lot is littered with either yuppie BMW's or these obscene gas guzzler SUV vehicles. In my hometown of Colts Neck NJ, a very wealthy suburb of New York City, farmland is being devoured by huge 6,000 square feet mansions on 5 acre building lots. I was raised in the community when it was very rural. Now older residents of the community are being squeezed out as property taxes skyrocket to pay for paving new and bigger roads, more street lights, sewer drainage, etc. Does this luxury spending really contribute to a higher standard of living for all Americans or does this overconsumption represent collective madness?As Robert Frank mentions, America is increaingly becoming a society of overconsumption by all income groups. A secretary in my office recently purchased a $40,000 Mercedes SUV. Just as the nuclear arms race betweeen Russia and the United States represented a misallocation of resources, luxury fever as he describes also has long term negative consequences. Already the U.S. trade deficit has skyrocketed to record levels as personal bankruptcies soar with household debt levels exploding and the national savings rate imploding to a negative rate. With farmland disapearing at a record rate and manufacturing employment falling last year by 300,000 jobs, I personally can't imagine that there will be a farm acre or factory left in America in twenty years. We will have to import everything from autos to basic food essentials. In the long run, America cannot and should not continue to finance this foolish excessive level of consumption from foreign creditors. No family or even nation can continue to consume more than it earns for an indefinite period of time. Maybe I'm too old fashioned in my views, but that's the way I see things."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Every reader should consider this book critically. Author Robert H. Frank's thesis is that runaway consumption of extravagant luxuries is a major problem in American society. This concept may have seemed more valid in 1999, at the height of the dot-com bubble, when the book first rolled off the presses, than it does in 2004. The intervening recession has done a lot to rearrange household consumption priorities. Yet one need only look at the houses, cars and home entertainment systems on the market to recognize that the thesis has not entirely lost all merit. For the more muscular theoretical foundation of this premise, readers are referred to the superior 100-year-old classic The Theory of the Leisure Class by Thorstein Veblen. Even in the shadow of that light, Frank's observations about the pressures to consume - especially the evidence that he marshals for an evolutionary compulsion to \\"keep up with the Joneses\\" - merits notice. While the author's proposed remedy of a consumption tax is sure to be controversial, we believe this book deserves to be read and appreciates its unusually stimulating, accessible writing on economics."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Luxury Fever opens with an anecdote describing the author's worn-out $89.98 propane grill, purchased in the 1980's. Mr. Frank laments that the nation seems to be stuck in a luxury arms race. He is forced to replace his inexpensive grill with one costing several times as much, losing a little bit of his humanity and time with his family in the process of earning the required money. Alas, the spectrum of grills and other products has lost its economical end. American society collectively spends far too much of its treasure chasing gold-plated versions of basic products, and Americans are forced to work impossible hours to keep up with the Joneses. His proposed cure for this problem is a tax that purports to punish wealthy individuals who dare to spend their money on luxury versions of common goods.Mr. Frank, I have some good news for you. I hope you haven't bought an expensive grill yet, because Sears sells a Kenmore propane grill, model 15400, for $129. This is not $89.95, but correcting for inflation it's almost certainly less than $90 in 1980's dollars. This is not an obscure label; it's available to Mr. Frank. This tale is repeated in product after product. I bought my first basic car for 1/5 of my first annual salary as a neophyte software developer. Although you can spend several years' salary on a car, you can now buy a basic car for less than 1/6 of a neophyte software developer's salary, and you will get a product substantially more durable, more reliable, environmentally cleaner, and safer than my first car.The range of most products has increased, mostly by extending the range at the expensive end a lot and also extending the range in the cheaper end a little. The bottom end of most markets has not disappeared, whether the product was high-tech or mundane. There are a few markets, like housing and bike helmets, that have lost their bottom end for regulatory or safety reasons. $19.95 &quot;Skid Lid&quot; bicycle helmets are gone; good riddance, I say. Dormitory-style low-cost housing is also gone.Mr. Frank then continues by claiming that the extension of important markets in the expensive directions inconveniences even those people who can't afford to or who don't want to purchase upscale goods, because if you don't spend yourself into oblivion you look shabby, with serious consequences. One of his leading examples is, for example, the need to wear a $2000 suit when interviewing for a job. I realize that it is a liberal axiom that societal rewards in an enthusiastically capitalist society is not primarily the result of hard work or native talent, but the result of capricious factors, but I've been on both sides of the interviewing desk recently. I've been offered both of the jobs I've interviewed for in a modest $200 suit, and when I was part of the team discussing a prospective hire we spent an hour or so discussing matters of substance, primarily the applicant's past achievements. If an applicant was odiferous or came to an interview in torn jeans and barefoot, we might not have seen past that and we might not have hired him. However, if he chose to spend $200 instead of $2000 for a suit to interview for an upper-middle-class professional job, the suit wouldn't matter. Perhaps it would matter for a high-roller $500,000/year job, but I'm not sure I believe that, since the hiring process for such a job would be even more meticulous and less likely to be capricious than in my market. Furthermore, the &quot;requirement&quot; for a $2000 suit is substantially less onerous to a person who would credibly apply for a $500,000/year job than it would be for me.Another market where Mr. Frank believes that luxury fever squeezes out people who choose to spend modestly is housing. Here he feels that the problem that results is that you must overspend to get into a district with good schools. This may have been true in the 1960 decade, but starting around 1970 most states passed legislation or had court decisions that funded schools from a statewide tax base. There are differences in the academic achievements of various regions, but much of this variation is a result of parental involvement, not parental wealth.I don't think Mr. Frank makes the case that gilded products are forced upon people who would not otherwise choose to buy them, at the cost of their humanity. Furthermore, if you do assume that society overspends on luxury goods and underspends on humanity, I don't think he makes the case that a steeply progressive consumption tax is the cure for the problem. I think he likes the idea of a progressive tax and of the social welfare state that it could support, and I think he built his argument to fit that result."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"The argument the author makes, in a nutshell, is that there has been more and more spending related to conspicuous consumption since the end of World War II and this has led to a veritable \\"arms race\\" among consumers that has led to many negatives externalities such as increased hours at work along with problems related to this (i.e., stress related ailments and medical expenditures) and a decreased willingness and ability of the public to pay for public services. A major cause of this spending pattern has been, the author purports, that growing concentration in the incomes of the very wealthy who do spend considerably on upper end products which, in turn, leads to their lesser peers imitating them. The author proposes, as a solution to this problem, the replacement of the current Federal income tax regime with a progressive consumption based tax.With respect to the conspicuous consumption, the author does seem to show some facts supporting his argument that the prices in the upper end of the consumer market spectrum (i.e., luxury cars and watches as opposed to those geared to the middle and lower ends) have been increasing at an incredible rate. For example, between the early 1980s and the early 1990s the price of very high end automobiles and watches has approximately doubled. He also claims, with less evidence however, that spending on upper end consumer products has been increasing relative to that of the rest of the market. Unfortunately he does not provide very much in the way of empirical evidence to support this specifically. For example, no market research data is provided showing how consumer spending has been split between the upper end and middle and lower ends. He provides considerable evidence showing that consumers have been saving less, working longer hours, etc. (this data is quite strong). This evidence, per se, does not support the contention that spending has been increasing at the upper end of the price spectrum than the lower. It could be that consumers, instead, have been being squeezed by lower real wages, higher prices for low and mid-range non-luxury products (i.e., gas, housing, etc.) and have hence had to increase their work hours.The author contends that the posited explosion in spending on upper-spectrum products has been caused by the massive increase in the incomes (and hence spending on upper end products) of the wealthy (the author does provide very strong evidence indicating that the incomes of those in the upper 10% have been increasing considerably). Again, the author provides little direct evidence that the non-wealthy have been imitating the spending of the super wealthy.The author believes that the solution to the explosion of \\"conspicuous consumption\\" is to replace the current progressive income based federal income tax system with a progressive consumption tax. The logic is that if consumption is taxed more than savings there would be an incentive to decrease consumption vis-&agrave;-vis savings and hence there would be less conspicuous consumption. There are a number of problems with this argument. The first is that even though there would be an incentive, there is no evidence provided that \\"conspicuous spending\\" per se (instead of all consumption) would decrease significantly. In addition, even a progressive consumption based income tax would fall much more heavily on the non-wealthy than the wealthy as the wealthy tend to save a much larger percentage of their incomes. A third problem is that the progressive consumption tax can be circumvented more easily than an income tax. For example, money could be channeled through financial instruments that appear like \\"savings\\" but can easily be converted into spending based instruments. For example, \\"consumption\\" can be decreased by investing in CDs or bonds but then loans can be taken out on those same CDs or bonds (using them as collateral) that can still enable high consumption patterns to persist.For the above reasons, the book is quite weak. Not only is there not strong evidence provided to support the author's contention that \\"conspicuous consumption\\" has been increasing relative to non-conspicuous spending, but the \\"solution\\" seems unable to provide a significant capability to decrease that \\"conspicuous consumption\\" and hence the negative externalities stemming from it (i.e., more work hours, etc.)."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"I'm concerned with many of the summaries offered of the book's main points. I cannot help but feel that most criticisms of Frank's book come from those opposed to taxation, especially progressive, as a general principle. Taken as a whole, that's fine- a discussion for another day, perhaps over Friedman's \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" and Sen's \\"Development as Freedom.\\" The problem is that it seems to give birth to partial quotations, accusations of returning to \\"planned economies,\\" and the like.Frank's book addresses many criticisms, although certainly not all. He does however take on those criticisms that seem, at least me, strongest and most common in the preceding \\"reviews\\" of his book. The proposal is not a call for a \\"planned economy,\\"- a point that Frank belabors convincingly. It is not an attempt to eat the rich- it is a proposal to _replace_ other taxes with this one.Many reviews have also ignored Frank's incorporation of evolutionary psychology/biology in discussing his proposal. This alone makes the book a worthwhile read. Even if one disagrees with his solution, the consumer behavior that leads him to these conclusions is fascinating and to me seems true enough. This competitive behavior exists, of course, in varying degrees in different cases- a point not lost in Frank's book but absent in many, many reviews. This is not a crank's work- certainly many creeds for taxation are. But as is often the case, a sort of fundamentalist belief in the association of \\"free markets\\" and \\"freedom\\" have clouded the reasoning and patience of many reviewers here."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Mostly, I enjoyed the book; however, it doesn't explain how money is available for meat inspections, pot hole repair, health care for the poor etc. if I simply refrain from buying an expensive car or grill.

Seriously, if one is satisfiedstop with the word requirements!"},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"An expansive view of 20th century literature in American economic thought finds two similar bookends. The beginning of the 20th century saw Veblein's classic \\"Theory of the Leisure Class\\". After a century of the largest economic growth ever undertaken by one country in the history of the world, the end of the 20th century is marked by a similar, yet different vein of literature; condemnations of overspending by the masses on luxury items. In other words: everyone is now spending like they are part of the leisure class. Many authors have taken a stab at this, and this work by Robert Frank is one of the better ones.Through the selective use of statistical data, this book shows how Americans are falling into debt in living like kings by buying unnecessary stuff that often and quickly gets outdated and uncool. Facts and figures from various sectors of the US economy (auto, home construction, restaurants, entertainment, etc...) are brought forth, chapter by chapter, to back up this point. The author attributes this spending to a \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\" attitude, decries the results, and proposes several government changes to remedy this problem. The latter include a savings deduction, and a progressive consumption tax. By reading this book, most readers will notice a slight liberal - progressive stance on the part of the author.The essential points of the book are true to all but the most obdurate observer of modern American culture. Unfortunately, the author should have suggested some other changes to remedy America's overspending besides the savings deduction and the progressive consumption tax. First, how about increasing the amount of minimum vacation time employers must give their employees. This in itself will give employees (all of us) more time to spend doing things like spending time with family, exercising, taking vacations, etc... that do not require purchasing goods. Studies have shown that the less time people have to recreate, the more money they will spend in doing the recreation, if only to make themselves feel that they used their free time fully. Second, eliminate the various deductions businesses and individuals can obtain thru the purchasing of goods and services. Third, eliminate complete public-funding of schools. If every family in America had to pay for some percentage of their children's K-12 education, parents would quickly and willingly instill the principles of sound finances in their children from an early age.Overall, a good book to read, but not the best of its genre. I do recommend it as a solid commentary on American society at the turn of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Certainly interesting and worthwhile, but if you want to read much of the same themes, with a broader biological perspective and without the preachiness and impractical political solutions, I recommend instead Happiness by Daniel Nettles."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"The national savings rate in America is now negative. In this boom, the idiot media (Forbes, Fortune, Wall Street Journal) have forgotten that there are very real problems with the American economy, particularly looking into the future.More thoughtful writers, like the Economist and many academics, have pointed out that the excessive levels of consumer debt are likely to prove highly damaging to the economy and individual consumers should economic conditions warrant a tightening of credit.People plainly spend beyond their means:people earning half of what I earn go to much trendier restaurants, have more expensive toys and gizmos, and attempt to resolve credit card problems by getting another card.Surely, there is a price to pay for such immoderation? Economic theory, common sense, and history all suggest this. That's why Frank's book is important, because it address a potentially severe economic problem by viewing it as an offshoot of a social disease. The next economic slowdown will prove the &quot;pessimists&quot; right. It is not consumerism that is wrong, but its mindless variant.

Frank has written a stimulating book that integrates research from psychology, evolutionary biology, and economics to address the raging \\"luxury fever\\" that is needlessly consuming precious resources in \\"overdeveloped\\" economies. Frank documents how luxury consumption in western industrialized countries has been rising at an astronomical rate, even though the latest psychological research shows that there is scant correlation between this consumption and levels of stated life satisfaction. Why, then, are wrist watches costing $20,000, huge houses of 10,000 sq. ft. and more, and myriad other forms of conspicuous individual consumption rapidly increasing, even as social spending on education, infrastructure, the environment, and other things that would raise the average level of life satisfaction in society decreasing? Frank describes how this perverse \\"luxury fever\\" occurs when individuals pursue their strong individual incentives to increase their relative position in society by consuming more than their peers. But when everyone does this, relative consumption (and perceived life satisfaction) remain constant, while absolute consumption (and related negative impacts on natural resource use, the environment, education spending, etc.) soars. Luxury fever is one of a class of phenomena known by various names in different disciplines, including: negative externalities, social traps, social dilemmas, the prisoner's dilemma, and the tragedy of the commons. Frank cleverly labels these phenomena as situations that are \\"smart for one, but dumb for all.\\" Once one begins to look, there are clear examples of these situations everywhere, ranging from drug addiction to pesticide overuse to arms races to environmental pollution and even women's fashions. While economists have recognized these phenomena, they have largely been relegated to the status of interesting but relatively minor anomalies. But Frank clearly points out just how pervasive, important, and wasteful they are, and how eliminating them can save literally billions of dollars while actually improving welfare. The \\"invisible hand\\" of the market cannot be relied upon to solve these problems, because, as Frank notes: \\"Far from being a principle that applies in most circumstances, the invisible hand is valid only in the special case in which each individual's rewards are completely independent of the choices made by others. In the rivalrous world we live in, precious few examples spring to mind.\\" (pp 271) Frank's solution to luxury fever is a strongly progressive consumption tax. This could be done in the US with a simple one-line amendment in the tax code to exempt all savings from income taxation. With this modification, the income tax would tax only consumption, without having to specify which consumption was \\"luxury consumption\\" and (because of its steep progressivity) without adversely affecting the poor. This consumption tax would have the effect of increasing the costs to individuals of conspicuous consumption (and thus reducing it), while freeing up significant resources to pursue increased \\"inconspicuous consumption\\" - things like education, infrastructure, environmental protection, and family time. Given the psychology of relative consumption and satisfaction noted above, this could occur with absolutely no decrease in welfare. In fact, average life satisfaction would increase because relative individual consumption would not change and the neglected forms of social consumption could be increased with the resources from the tax. Why has so obvious a \\"win-win\\" move not already occurred, and what are its chances in the future? Frank answers the first part of this question with the famous joke about the economist who sees a ten dollar bill lying in the street and concludes that it couldn't really be a ten dollar bill because if it were someone would have already picked it up. The first step is to clearly and convincingly lay out the problem and the solution as Frank has done - in effect to point out the existence of the $10 bill just lying on the ground. But the idea of a broad consumption tax (and the reasons for it) has been around for many years. It was first proposed by Thomas Hobbes in 1651 and has surfaced many times during the last 300 years. Frank concludes that it will just be a matter of time before the obvious benefits of such a tax are recognized and the plan is implemented - after all, most political changes have a significant gestation period. But there are also obvious impediments to implementing such a tax in the current political climate. In political systems run more and more by special interests it is difficult to implement any policy that might hurt even one of those interests - even if only in the short run. Overcoming the political impediments to any form of meaningful tax reform will require \\"government by discussion\\" rather than by interest groups and media manipulation. If social issues of the importance of those in Frank's book can be discussed rationally by the society at large then such obvious social \\"win-win\\" solutions as ecological tax reform and a progressive consumption tax can be appreciated and implemented. In a few countries this kind of social discussion occurs reasonably well, but in most it is a far cry from the current political reality. Just as it is very difficult for an animal caught in a trap to free itself, it is also very difficult for a society caught in a social trap to free itself, even when the nature of the trap and the way out has been clearly identified. Lets hope we don't have to bite off our social foot to escape the invisible hand."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Let Them Be LemmingsSome factual common trends are noted by Frank: in general, wages in the U.S. have been static and even in decline for most Americans in recent decades. Yet, proportional per capita spending on luxury goods has increased significantly. The results according to this author and others who've conducted numerous studies and research is a weaker economy, high personal debt, longer working hours, less sleep, and having to work until death, in debt of course.We're all aware of the American \\"gotta have this or that\\" bug. Many have it, but many don't. Some don't want it. Why do certain luxury goods and \\"gadgets\\" become oh-so-popular in American society? Frank notes, and correctly, that the desire for many to purchase certain material things is by no-doubt influenced by what others are buying or want to buy.The concept of \\"social status\\" is a concept where human beings in mass-consumption cultures judge each other in this context in RELATION to our peers. These \\"peers\\" may be the strangers we live next to in suburban anonymity, our co-workers, friends, or the strangers we see driving next to us in our daily suburban traffic jams. (Note my use of the word \\"stranger\\").The commonly known terms such as \\"keeping up with the Joneses,\\" the status treadmill\\" the \\"arms race of consumerism, Consumer Feticism,\\" and Velben's \\"Conspicuous Consumption\\" are presented. But not from a moralistic standpoint but a behaviorist, biological, psychological, and an economic standpoint.The first part of the book informs us about many things we already aware of but expands upon it through the various academic fields already noted above. The second part of the book is the \\"solution part.\\" What the author thinks can be done to change the current pattern. Here's where it can get sticky for some. The solution Frank offers from his research is a thesis on Human Behaviour, and he proposes a \\"political-economic\\" solution: taxing consumption. The solution is the part of this work that leads to the economic analysis of the \\"hypothetical\\" once again, and there's nothing wrong with that. Although theoretical, the first part is interesting, and the second part may be for some."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Frank's point is essentially that Americans spend too much on luxury goods that don't bring them satisfaction, and too little on things they really could make them happier. He makes a good case for using a consumption tax to remedy the situation. I really enjoyed the analysis of homo economicus versus homo realisticus. Frank argues that homo economicus (as used in mainstream economics) is concerned with rational betterment of his situation, while real people are concerned as much or even more with doing better than those around them. When I studied economics I realized that something was wrong with the standard homo economicus model, but Frank lays out the differences very clearly, in ways I hadn't thought of.Frank has some great commentary on the human condition here, too. My favorite is his analysis of why it helps to get up in the morning if you put your alarm clock out of reach of the bed. If you don't see what this has to do with economics--read the book!Frank makes some proposals that I think are bluntly naive. For example, he proposes curing unemployment by a program of public works. This simply cannot work. It has, of course, been tried, including the attempt by the Washington DC municipal government in recent decades. Inevitably it leads to dependency and corruption, and a multiplication of the number of people needing public jobs. Frank needs to think more about where the incentives are in such a situation. In my opinion, if the streets are littered with garbage that isn't being picked up, you have to look at where the garbage is coming from and who is benefitting from creating it. It should be sellers of plastic bottles, paper cups, and the like who should be paying for picking up litter from the streets, not general tax funds. Frank also needs to pay more attention to population issues. No public works program can support a continually increasing number of people. I think Frank also overlooks the large role in overconsumption of having no limits on the interest rates which credit card and mortgage companies are allowed to charge. Unlimited rates means that such companies have a vested interest in keeping the maximum possible number of Americans on the edge of bankruptcy, and not much of an interest in making sure they lend money only to people who are likely to be able to pay it back.Overall, though, this is a book with some useful and interesting ideas."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"As the review title indicates, students &amp; professors of economics, politics, psychology and other social &amp; behavioral sciences will benefit from perusing the pages of Bob Frank's commentary on contemporary American life. Regardless of whether you agree with Professor Frank's solution to our society's \\"arms race of consumerism\\", the book makes the reader think about the materialism evident in much of the U.S. Using amusing analogies to describe human behavior related to \\"buying excess,\\" Frank explains these activities with theories of psychology and economics. His insight provokes thought and entertains the reader throughout the book. Whether explaining why many middle class couples spend $5,000 for the latest Viking model gas grill for their patio, or describing how two millionaires childishly built larger and more lavish yachts just to own the biggest and best cruiser in the world, Frank delivers interesting examples which help provide an understanding for why many people do the things they do.Read this book if you are a student or teacher of the social or behavioral sciences.

I think Frank does a wonderful job of mixing research from a number of academic fields including economics, psychology, sociology, biology, and public policy. The result is a refreshing and multifaceted look at America's spending habits.Contrary to other reviews, I did not find Frank's tone to be at all condescending. First and foremost, Frank is an economist, and he eloquently explains how we are all acting independently to maximize our own utility. However, borrowing from the other social sciences, Frank is able to show how these efforts can sometimes go astray. It is not that we are irrational, selfish, or stupid. The problem is that as a society we have not yet learned how to utilize the benefits of both individual freedom AND group cooperation.I give this book 4 stars because I do agree with other reviewers that it does get a bit repetitive. Also, I believe that the first chapter, which highlighted many gross extravagances in spending by the ultra rich, was a poor introduction to the rest of the book.The consumption patterns Frank addresses in this work apply to all Americans, as do the consequences in terms of our schools, health, roads, environment, etc. Frank's arguments are logically sound and backed by a large body of research. His solutions for change may appear unpopular, but upon further research, I could not find any strong arguments against them. Overall, I believe this is an important and thought provoking book."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Mr. Frank's thesis is this: many of the consumer goods we buy are purchased not for the intrinsic pleasure they bring, but for the pleasure of keeping up with or surpassing the Joneses. By taxing consumption instead of earnings, people will buy cheaper luxury goods. This will keep all of the pleasure of the consumption race but raise extra tax dollars to spend on things that everyone truly wants for their intrinsic value - like cleaner air.It will also have the effect of increasing savings (because income is not taxed until spent, the incentive to invest is boosted). This makes us all richer long-term as capital investments grow our standard of living.The theory is well-explained -- perhaps too well-explained -- but the proposed solution is not. While Mr. Frank spends a couple of hundred pages explaining the problem, his solution - taxing consumption - is presented without question. But will it work? The goal of producing income is to spend it, and whether it's done now or later, the rich want to spend it all before they die. Doesn't it make sense that not taxing saving would simply defer consumption until later in life, and the rich would buy even *more* opulent goods later? The author never discusses this, or any other potential difficulties. Won't the rich just rent everything instead of buying? Won't people who might otherwise save, be instead persuaded to consume now, since they will be taxed more if they save to buy their dream good in a single future year? The point is not that these objections are unanswerable, but that they seem to never even occur to the author.As for the disdain with which Mr. Frank treats the acquisition of luxury goods, the reader should be made more than a little uneasy. What he says about social pressure may have some merit, but is this the *only* reason someone buys a Ferrari? And what about those of us who do not feel the need to keep up, and buy goods purely because they will enrich our lives in other ways? Again, these shades of grey do not slow down Mr. Frank's thesis. And the reader who is told he is &quot;polluting&quot; by choosing to wear an expensive suit - the author uses the analogy without qualification or irony - would be justified in feeling that Mr. Frank would have done well to temper the observations in his book with an understanding that human motivations are not as black and white as he thinks."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"Frank's book looks at human nature as the underlying cause of increasing luxury spending and the consequent decrease in savings. His claims certainly make intuitive sense -- who can doubt that many of the goods we purchase are heavily influenced by what we observe others purchasing, or that some of our excess money could be better spent? The extent to which we can make more lasting increases in well-being by allocating money differently is less clear. Much of the evidence cited by Frank is more anecdotal than rigorous, and while it feels correct, he leaves a skeptical reader not quite convinced.The biggest value of the book might be in bringing renewed attention to a very interesting idea, the consumption tax. Frank provides a nice history of the idea and why it has failed the past, leaving us with the hope that its shorcomings are not insurmountable.Some parts of the book suggest Frank's leftward leanings, which may turn off conservative readers and cause them to dismiss his ideas out of hand. However, the open-minded reader will find much food for thought in this well-written, provocative look at consumer spending patterns and incentives."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"About 100 years after Veblen coined the phrase, &quot;conspicuous consumption,&quot; Frank finds himself trying to make sense of outrageous consumption patterns during another era of prosperity. Why the love for expensive grills, cars and watches? The answer, in brief, is status. Because social status is measured relative to others (rather than by absolute standards), consumers step on a treadmill that finds them trying to outmeasure their peers. This treadmill doesn't lead to any greater happiness. Though individual satisfaction tends to increase with greater income and greater income slightly associates with higher satisfaction in the U.S., the elevations in per capita income within countries over time don't correspond with greater satisfaction (above some threshold). We have more stuff than our grandparents but not more satisfaction because of it. Pointing out that society as a whole would be better served by reallocating the resources wasted on individual luxury items by investing in clean air and water, paying teachers and maintaining roads, Frank shows that this conflict between individual and group interests represents a public goods problem. Though legal restrictions, social norms and other mechanisms have been advanced to solve these dilemmas elsewhere, Frank favors a progressive consmption tax for the U.S. This contention muddies the water between advocacy and the science of economics. In his support of it, as elsewhere in the book, he overgeneralizes from a few lines of evidence (&quot;all evidence shows that...&quot;) to broad conclusions, leaving the reader questioning how completely the relevant evidence has been reviewed. Yet the clarity, readability and timeliness of this book make it well worth reading. Will it help us get off the status treadmill?"},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"This fascinating book describes how a new virus, the luxury fever has Americans seemingly inescapably in its grip: people spend a larger and larger proportion of our money on luxury goods. And, because for most people incomes have remained static or have even declined (in the US and the UK), this extra spending was financed by lower savings and higher debts, making the economy weaker and more vulnerable. Further, most people work longer and tend to spend less time on important activities such as vacations, being with family, sleeping exercising, etc. To make things worse: Americans spend less on vital public services which leads to a deteriorating infrastructure, to higher crime, to dirty streets and parks, to water pollution, to a deteriorating education system, etc. And what about health? 40 million Americans currently lack health insurance.... This book explains how there is a competition 1) between different forms of private spending (do we buy luxury or do we spend our money differently?) and 2) between private and public spending. To expand on the latter point: a growing share of the US national income is spent on consumption and spending on vital publics services is increasingly threatened. Frank explains (on the basis of well-being research and the adaptation-level theory) that the main reason we buy luxury goods is to demonstrate to others that we can afford to thereby trying to distinguish ourselves from them. In doing so we try to achieve happiness by improving our relative status. The irony is, however, this absolutely doesn't work! The satisfaction we get from luxury spending, which Frank calls conspicuous spending, depends largely on context. The satisfaction we get from luxury spending lasts only shortly. Two examples: 1) If we buy an expensive car, this distinguishes us from our neighbour and we feel happy. If, however, next month our neighbour buys an even fancier one, our satisfaction will be largely gone. You can see how this leads to an escalation, an arms race, with no winners. 2) The satisfaction we get from luxury goods tends to decline steeply over time. We tend to get used quickly to what we have and the favourable features of the luxury good tend to fade into the background rapidly: we no longer notice the fancy features of our expensive car and our satisfaction diminishes. Bottom line: this increasing conspicuous spending does more harm than good. We have to discourage conspicuous consumption in favour of inconspicuous consumption. Frank explains that no individual or family alone can solve this problem. It has to be solved at a higher level. He proposes a simple but effective measure to discourage conspicuous consumption, a progressive consumption tax levied on consumption rather than income. Frank claims this tax can stimulate radical changes in the ways we lead our lives. Contrary to the believe of many, he convincingly argues, this progressive consumption tax would not cripple the economy but invigorate it. A fascinating book also highly relevant for European countries I think."},{"Title":"Luxury Fever Money and Happiness in an Era of Excess","review":"8 Years after its release, this book has only become more relevant. Its argument can be stated in a single sentence: Our soaring expenditures on luxury articles are the result of a zero-sum status seeking conquest, that leaves everybody worse off. This is ultimately an empirical claim, and as simple as it is, there are a lot of steps in this argument that could make it false. Is it true that we spend so much on conspicuous consumption? Do we care about our relative consumption position and not about the absolute amount and quality of the stuff we have? Does our happiness really go down if we spend more time at work to pay for our expensive ways, and less time exercising and relaxing? And so on.What makes this such a good book is that Frank builds his argument by painstakingly examining all these questions, taking a skeptic's perspective wherever possible. The result adds up to a very convincing thesis.The case for a remedy, a consumption tax, is also carefully crafted and makes big intuitive sense (especially after the US has seen another decade of zero savings).Both left and right wing thinkers should embrace this book. Left wingers will like it, because it argues for corrective government action in our wasteful rat-race. Right wingers should praise the analysis that starts from the premise that we ourselves know what's best for us, although our collective decisions may not reflect this.In short, my Professor in undergraduate microeconomics was spot on when he recommended this book as the book \\"every economists should read\\". So too should everybody else who has ever wondered whether we really need all the stuff we buy."},{"Title":"The Turret","review":"This book is an adorable book!!!!!I agree that everyone should read this AT LEAST once.READ IT!!!!"},{"Title":"Blessings","review":"A wonderful love story with a Southwestern setting, Blessings shares with its readers the love and warmth that the author has, not only for the Native American community, but provides the reader with an &quot;insider's view&quot; of life on the &quot;Big Rez&quot; at least as it relates to family and healthcare. Having married a Navajo women and being a New York trained physician, the author &quot;speaks&quot; with much experience and knowlege. One must suspect the book to be significantly autobiographical which, of course, creates a wonderful dilemna for the reader, to wit: what is truth and what is fiction. Having lived in New Mexico myself and having been a frequent visitor to the Navajo Nation, it made me a bit homesick. Having attended a Jewish friend's wedding in Lukachuki a few years ago when he was married, in a hogan, to a wonderful Navajo lady, this book brought back some great memories, which added to the experience. It was fast reading and easy to follow. It was pure enjoyment. A real &quot;feel good&quot; experience that was entertaining as well as educational. I strongly recommend it for anyone who lives in Arizona, New Mexico, or New York, Jewish or not."},{"Title":"Blessings","review":"I enjoyed reading this very touching love story of how despite cultural and religious differences, the respect for each others views, overcomes the difficult times. It makes one think about how we all might learn to live and respect one anothers cultures and religions."},{"Title":"Blessings","review":"Blessings captures the essence of the southwest with wonderful descriptions of the landscape and the Navajo people. Against the backdrop of the landscape Avrum Organick has delivered a human tale reminiscent of the legend of the bird and the fish who fall in love but their native environments are so different they cannot share their lives. In this story, the couple is able to overcome the obstacles and build a fruitful relationship where the very differences that could tear them apart bring growth.Blessings tells the story of Jack, a young Jewish doctor from New York City and Ida, a strong willed, beautiful Navajo girl who fall in love while Jack is on a tuberculosis rotation at a clinic on the Navajo reservation. Jack's immersion in the Navajo culture gives us insights into the Navajo way of life and way of thinking. When Jack and Ida move to New York City, Ida becomes the one transplanted and we gain new insights into American city life and the Jewish culture through the filter of her Navajo upbringing. Their children are raised in a thoughtful melding of Navajo and Jewish religions and outlooks, and occasionally struggle with native bigotry from both cultures. This is a rich and warm story describing the lives Jack and Ida build together. Having grown up in New Mexico, the descriptions of the reservation landscape made me want to sell my house and move back."},{"Title":"Blessings","review":"I found Dr. Organick's portrayal of life on the reservation and the strong family ties here beautifully portrayed. The People have such a moving story to tell as they struggle to keep the old ways and incorporate the new, and this book gives insight into that struggle. The reservation has changed dramatically in the last 50 years, and Blessings gives the reader the ability to see those changes from the early days of Anglo intervention to the present day. The personal nature of this novel and the ablilty of the author to delicately describe the feelings and thoughts of his characters have made this a book which transports the reader into the story. Accounts of both traditional Navajo and Jewish ceremonies/beliefs add luster to the story. I loved the characters and found them endearing in their honesty and their desire to find their true path. I have also sent several copies to friends and relatives."},{"Title":"Blessings","review":"I'm a certified Nurse Midwife. Carolyn, my wife, is a labor and delivery nurse. We live with our daughter, Hilary, in Chinle, Arizona. Right in the middle of the great Navajo Nation. Dr. Organick's book truly captures the spirit and beauty of our area and the Navajo people. I found that from the moment i picked up this delightful book, i was unable to put it down. We have read quite a few books about our area of the world and especially about the Navajo people, but have found nothing that is as enjoyable or easy to read. We have sent copies to friends and relativies and will continue to do so. This is the best book we've found to give everyone a feel for a great area and a great people."},{"Title":"Blessings","review":"This is an intimate portrait of two people who find love and happiness in spite of the huge social and cultural boundaries that separate them.Avrum Organick is a gifted and descriptive writer who is able to convey, not only his personal yearning for this beautiful Navajo woman, but also the exquisite beauty of the Navajo countryside in which he finds himself. Anyone who has ever spent any time in that part of Arizona and New Mexico, will be brought right back to the beauty of that place by the writers wonderfully graphic descriptions of that part of the world. Anyone who has not been there may well find themselves wishing to pay it a visit! You will find in this book a very honest portrait of the writer himself, who has the courage to lay bare a lot of his own frailties and insecurities. What rang particularly true for this reader was the frank portrayal of the longing and helplessness we all experience when we find ourselves falling in love with another human being. This is not to say that it is self indulgent book. On the contrary, it is a very charming and easy read. However, you will come away with the feeling that you have a very personal relationship with the author and his family.If this book had been published by a major publisher it would have been huge. I pray that it may yet be discovered by a larger audience. It has a lot of important things to say to us about tolerance, love, respect and understanding. Don't let it pass you by. Buy it. Read it. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Blessings","review":"I picked up this book while vacationing in the southwest. The subject sounded interesting. If only the story had been written by a ghost writer it may have been worth the time taken to read it. Blessings is a juvenile rendering of a love story. It's written on the level of teenage romance novels, but I doubt if any teenagers would find it any more engaging than I did. This is a story of an educated, older man approached by a young Navajo woman with aspirations of attending college. Unfortunately, from the moment they met, all of her goals for higher education were completely ignored all to pander to her husband's ego. Don't waste your time. The other reviews must have been written by friends."},{"Title":"Kithbook: Nockers (Changeling: The Dreaming)","review":"Just reasons to buy this book: -Romance and the Single Nocker.

I accompanied this book with D'Aulaire's, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin and got so much out of them all, much more than children can be getting in the class room today. I found my children (including myself) absorbed in the book wanting to keep reading more.

The characters of the American Revolution come to life: Patrick Henry speaks, George Washington leads; Thomas Jefferson writes; John Adams instructs; Benjamin Franklin teases; John Hancock signs. Across America, townsmen and frontier settlers and slave holders and free men hear the news about liberty and react to it.We love this book. Even the youngest listeners will get a true taste for the beauty of hard-fought liberty.We also enjoy Red, White, and Boom by Lee Wardlaw and Huy Voun Lee.Red, White, and Boom!"},{"Title":"The Fourth of July Story","review":"This book is aptly named; it is indeed a story. The basic elements are true. Flourishes are added to make the story more accessible for a young child. Those flourishes work well. They add excitement and a sense of pride to the story.The book starts with the Liberty Bell ringing on the very first Fourth of July. It starts by addressing the reasons colonists wanted to be free from the British, and how the tension between England and the colonists mounted. Next we see Thomas Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence, followed by spreading the news about the Declaration of Independence, and then the victory of the Americans over the British. All of this is told by three time Newberry Honor Winner Alice Dalgliesh, a seasoned storyteller with a rich voice and a keen eye for the elements of history that must be told if the story is to impart the awe of the founding of a nation.Dalgliesh also adds scenes that might have happened. For example a rider with the Declaration of Independence in his saddle bag, stops to talk with a farmer of German ancestry about the Declaration. The farmer continues thinking about what it means to live in a free country as the rider moves on through the countryside.The major figures of independence and the revolution have a place in the story: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington. There's a nice anecdote about a very young Andrew Jackson reading the Declaration of Independence to his neighbors.\\"The Fourth of July Story\\" was originally published two years before I was born. The illustrations look like the illustrations in many of the picture books, novels and textbooks I grew up with. They bring a simple view of the revolutionary time alive. The artist is not trying hard for reality. The last picture in the book makes this particularly clear. At the end of the war, Washington is reviewing his troops. Almost all the troops are wearing uniforms that look spotless. My understanding is that soldiers were lucky to have any part of their uniforms left after the war.\\"The Fourth of July Story\\" is great choice for reading on the 4th of July, or anytime the subject of the American Revolution comes up with young children."},{"Title":"The Fourth of July Story","review":"This is a good book for a young reader who is beginning to learn american history.

You Think Keeping Kosher Is Stupid, D. You Hated hebrew","review":"Gil Mann has successfully taken several hot topics and presented them in a manner that is reader friendly, insightful and intriguing.Reader friendliness is evident from the start; the book is written in interview format. Each chapter highlights a different person discussing a specific topic from the title. I read it in two days, and enjoyed the reading.I also enjoyed it because it was insightful. After reading several of Mann's interpretations of Judaism, I spent time reflecting on his words. His comments lead me to both forgive myself and to rethink the way I'd been thinking about religion, community and spiritualism.And that, to me, is very intriguing. He presented his insights in a clear and simplistic manner. While I don't agree with everything he said, I do feel that he inspired the participants of the book into questioning themselves, and me into doing the same.I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks they're a BAD Jew for not believing in God, not wanting to waste time in synagogue, and for hating talmud torture.

The three are \\"ethics, spirituality and peoplehood\\" (remember the acronym ESP). Becoming more involved in any of the three will make someone a more serious Jew and, such involvement in that one sphere may lead to becoming more serious in either, or both, of the others.Mann did interviews with individuals and with focus groups. Most of the chapters in this book are done as a dialogue between himself and an individual who is a composite. I bought this book for a teenager who thinks Judaism, or more specifically, religion in general, is a lot of nonsense.

I have the British Columbia/Canadian Rockies one, but they all contain the same text, which has been repackaged into different titles. As to this book itself, the layout is easy to find your way around and the information is reliable and has obviously been well researched. The hotel listings are especially detailed, down to descriptions of inroom curtains. This formula obviously appeals to many travelers and while I often pass up their hotel listings (too expensive for me), their restaurant descriptions are extremely helpful for me when on the road. They often describe actual dishes giving me a great feel of what to expect in each restaurant.On the downside, so much space is given to accommodations and restaurants that the most important part of traveling is as good as ignored-what there is to see and do. The reason I travel and that BC is so popular as a destination is the great outdoors. I want to read about what there is do and what to see-the best hiking trails in the national parks, why it's worth my money to go whalewatching, etc. Many marvelous places in the province are missing completely. The book also lacks photos and the maps are poor or outdated (nothing that a good map from a gas station will fix!).In conclusion, I like the look and feel of the Frommers book and have found that I can rely it when it comes to dining information. I always carry the Moon book as a reference for the ins and outs of each town and together the two books make perfect partners for my travels."},{"Title":"Frommer's British Columbia & the Canadian Rockies (Frommer's Complete Guides)","review":"I did extensive research before making the 3000 mile drive to BC, including the Canadian Customs site. I learned not to try and bring in a pocket knife, or mace, unless it's marked \\"for animals only\\". I even had paperwork for the travel medical insurance I purchased for my Wife and I. None of my research prepared me for the rude, militant treatment I got when I tried to cross the border. I was asked \\"have you ever been fingerprinted\\" at the kiosk, then instructed to pull over and enter the customs building. During the next 2 hours, I was searched and interrogated, and my car tossed. I resisted their baiting my temper, and was respectful and professional throughout, but in the end I was refused admittance due to a 22 year old misdemeanor DWI from college. My Wife, who was scheduled to fly up the following day, thought I was pranking her when I called her with the bad news. This was a very disappointing and expensive experience.

I have already been sitting at the piano sight-reading alot of the pieces I didn't already know.My one warning--the print (as in all Dover editions) is a little more difficult to read than more expensive publishers' print. I bought the book for a student who is a beginner reading music and I decided to keep it for myself because I want her early reading experiences to be with very easy to read print--then after a couple of years, maybe struggle with this. I have found this to be true of all my Dover editions, they're great to get your hands on a large volume of music and are definitely worth the price no matter how hard they are to read---but I've had to get better printed copies of pieces that I'm really working on for performances"},{"Title":"Favorite Piano Classics (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"I think this book is great.

I'm a music major who studied piano and now have much less time to practice. But, thanks to this compilation, all the famous and intermediate/high intermediate level piano literature can be found in one place. If you are a piano teacher, this book will be useful to you because it likely contains many pieces that your students 1) dream of learning or 2) would love to hear you play because they will recognize them. In addition, the editors went out of their way to choose easier--and still famous--compositions by the famous composers. For example, Chopin has several famous pieces, but the editors picked, among other pieces, the Raindrop Prelude, which is exceedingly gorgeous but relatively easy to play. You won't find any monster ballades or comparably difficult pieces. I mean, instead of I'sle de Joyeuse, they picked the First Arabesque to represent Debussy . . . know what I mean? A good pianist can fake their way through much of this and enjoy it leisurely. My only complaint is that these are not the best editions of these pieces. There are no fingerings or pedal markings.

It teaches very clearly, taking very many Scriptures that you don't often hear in this context. But it is also about a life of trusting God through and through, growing in trust and seeing God move. Andrew Murray says that we lose a precious opportunity to grow in the Lord by relying on man and the methods in nature, but he does not come across as forbidding going to physicians, but rather as earnestly urging us to go higher in faith, giving us a glimpse of the blessing of wholly trusting in God. And who can get enough of that? I do think that this alone makes this book an invaluable experience.Though I have been hearing teachings on healing for at least 10 years, the difference with this book is that when reading it, I sometimes feel I am on holy ground. Healing is not cheap, and Andrew Murray takes us on a journey with reverence and depth. You will be deeply blessed."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"Andrew Murray is one of my favorite Christian authors. I buy, read, and re-read just about all of this books. I recently was trying to decide whether or not to buy this one, and, believe it or not, even the negative reviews made me want to buy it!There are undoubtably some phoney faith healers in the world today, there have been in days gone by, and there probably will continue to be until the Lord returns, but this book simply exhorts and encourages those who want to believe what the Word of God says about the Lord's power and willingness to heal someone afflicted of a disease.Murray nowhere tells people not to seek the advice or help of physicians. He does say that when one receives healing by supernatural means without the help of natural remedies, one also receives spiritual blessings that don't accompany a natural cure, and this can and does bring a person into greater dependency (which is good) and trust in the Lord.The language is very easy to read, the book is divided into 32 mostly very short chapters, the last two chapters are about 7 pages each, the others are 2, 3, or 4 pages. This book is exactly what I was looking for, I'm going to read it and reread it and reread it, and believe that Divine Health is for me, for the purpose of my being able to work for the Lord at His request and bring Him glory!"},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"This book is a very good accurate view of the Bible's teaching on healing, one of the best writings on the subject I have ever read. If you are ready it can help straighten out your misunderstandings that block the way to health from God but if you looking for some easy quick fix you'll probably be disappointed. True sometimes you can get a pretty quick and easy answer to prayer for healing but that is usually not the norm and usually it's for something minor, a headache, flu, cold, sprained ankle etc.. These things many times can take a pretty intense wrestling with the powers of darkness, something most Christians seem to know little about or have little stomach for.Understanding faith and the healing that was accomplished for ever believer on Calvary is not something achieved through mere prayer and intellectual investigation it is something that comes through real humility, perseverance and Divine illumination. I really believe most Christians seem to know so little of the Spirit's illumination, we are so use to trying to understand the things of God with our mind alone that we do not realizing we are blocking God's light which comes through the spirit (Pro 3:5,6 ICor 2:14,15). We are too unbroken, reading Watchman Nee's \\"Release of the Spirit\\" might help to understand something of this.I heard some readings from the life of Andrew Murray and his journey into finding out about Divine healing I think 97% of today's believers would have given up. It was quite difficult for him and it took a lot of patience to understand how God works in this area, this is the experience of many who have had success in finding God's supernatural healing. Extremely valuable things don't come cheap. The church being behind for so many centuries in this area is another thing that hinders the way for all of us, we've had few people who can do a good job of instructing us about God's healing power and what faith and trusting in God's promises is really like. Much of what Christians think they know about these things is just almost always very misguided, shallow or down right fake.There are many temptations and subtle lies from Satan, many don't understand they are deceived by them. The Devil puts up an intense fight over this subject he enjoys watching Christians suffer more than anything, he hates them with a cruel and vicious hate and sickness is nothing but a curse and a work of pure hate. The Devil's diseases are a cherished tool he uses to rob and hinder the church of much usefulness in this world. The testimony that our God is the one and only real God is blocked as Christian's experience of sickness with no deliverance is usually not really any different than any other atheist or unbeliever's experience of sickness. So the world misses many opportunities to see a real God, it is just the same old theoretical powerless God in the sky that many believe in.Of course many Christians are so use to self deception they haven't the slightest idea they are under its influence. So most of the time they will cover up for this embarrassment of having a do nothing, powerless God by trying to rationalize, excuse and substitute half truths with testimonies along these lines :\\" Yes I am very sick but God gives me courage and cheerfulness to endure and this is a testimony to the world of what Christ can do for someone\\".Satan almost always seems to easily deceive and whip most Christians so they give up and adopt some pacifying deceptive excuse to explain why their God doesn't seem real when they need Him to heal them, when He promises to be their Healer and heal all their diseases, Jesus came to destroy the works of the Devil etc... The promises of God's get explained away as not meaning what they really mean, or that was just for the Jews and not the Church etc.. Hence Christians come up with many bizarre theories and rationalizations to defend themselves with.Faith is knowing you have something you can't see but most want to have something they can see before they believe they have it and this will never work, without faith it is impossible to please Him."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"This book is absolutley amazing!!!! The author knows the power of the Spirit of God and that Jesus came to heal! Sickness and sin are one in the same and sin prevents healing, Jesus came to set us free from both! God never causes illness and never chooses not to heal. This may seem brash to some, but I know this to be true for my own person, and it may seem contradictory to medicine, but I'm going into the medical field and I know the truth. If this seems confusing, just read the book lol."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"One of the best books ever written on the subject of divine healing, by one of the best authors ever! As with all books by A. Murray, the spotlight is on \\"sanctification\\" of the people of God in this book. Why do you want to be healed? What are you going to do with your healing? Be ready to have the Lord probe into your heart. Recently retitled \\"Healing Secrets.\\"Randy"},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"This book has been Murray's most debated book. While evangelicals love his books on prayer and surrender, few have taken time to read his book on divine healing of which Murray came to believe in after being healed himself. While it is true that Murray somewhat retracted from his views that he wrote in this book, he never denied that healing is needed in the Church nor that we should not obey James 5:13-16 and pray for the sick.The book is written in short chapters so you can use this book to read for your devotions along with your Bible. Murray takes portions of Scriptures that focus on healing and expounds on them. While the chapters are short, the message is full of meat (Hebrews 5:14).Overall I recommend this book for those wanting to study divine healing or deepen their faith in praying for the sick. No matter what your view of the manifestation gifts of 1 Corinthians 12, we all believe that the Lord God can do whatever He wants (John 14:12-14) and we should pray in faith for the sick (Mark 11:22-24) even if the person is not healed now. We should trust that God is sovereign and He does heal for His own glory and honor."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"John G Lake mentions this book in his writings, so I was very interested in reading it for myself. I was not disappointed. Andrew Murray presents a scriptural basis for Divine healing. He believed that salvation is for the body as well the soul, healing and forgiveness go hand in hand. He presents Christ as healer, and our need to take Him at His word. It can be hard to take, but he does believe that more sickness than we may think, is used as discipline. However with repentance, healing comes. This is a great work on healing, and I recommend it to all who desire to see God glorified in the healing of the body."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"This book changed my life, and lead me through some very hard times with my health, and taught me about Jesus and my religion, and helped me learn what It is all about, the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"This book is wonderful. Andrew Murray is an author that is easy to read and understand. His positive writings along with documentation of The Word explain GOD's Promises for healing us, mind, body, and spirit. I would recommend any book written by this man. His wisdom is so expansive and his understanding of THE WORD is Spirit driven."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"This book reflects and describes the way each of us have to walk in order to let Jesus fulfill His Word that His Body became flesh and our bodies new creations."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"Which Christian perspective on healing is true: faith healing (if you believe enough, God will heal you) or God-will healing (God will heal you if he wants to, even if your faith is only the size of a mustard seed)? Andrew Murray puts forth a scripturally based opinion on this topic in his book Divine Healing.As a health practitioner, I was very disappointed to find that Mr. Murray believes in faith healing. According to Mr. Murray, \\"Already the health of our bodies is a fruit of the salvation Jesus has acquired for us. We see also that health as well as salvation is obtained by faith.\\" We are healed in proportion to the amount of faith in our lives, not works. He stated that health practitioners and medications should not be used because they steal from God the opportunity to heal us and show His power. His position seems reminiscent of Christian Science, which forbids vaccinations, medications, and visits to hospitals.His strong support of faith healing may be due to the state of the church at the time in which he lived. The charismatic movement did not begin until the early nineteenth century, and very few miraculous healings or other signs of the Holy Spirit were seen during Mr. Murray's generation. Many people believed God had the power to do miracles, but they did not have the faith that God wanted to use his power in their lives. Thus teaching faith and healing would be very important to Mr. Murray.This book does contain small jewels about healing. For example, he states, \\"One of the chief benefits, then, of divine healing will be to teach us that our body ought to be set free from the yoke of our own will to become the Lord's property. God does not grant healing until He has attained the end for which He permitted the sickness.\\" Until God's purpose for allowing an illness is completed, even the prayer of faith will remain unanswered.This book is an excellent treatise on faith healing, and even those who don't agree with Andrew Murray's position may find nuggets of spiritual truth in Divine Healing.--- reviewed by Terri for Christian Bookshelf"},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"Looking for the healing power of Jesus Mr. Murray scripturally supports the healing ministry and offers reaching &quot;self-help&quot; and paths for the Christian who waits on the Lord for healing."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"Over the years Andrew Murray's books have always been both instructional and inspirational. This one is no exception. If someone in your life is in need of healing, please give this book to them or read it to them."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"This is a wonderful book on the subject of healing. He is very analytical in his explanation of why and how God wants healing for his children. He goes through the Bible and explains it very clearly. I wish I had read it years ago. I have been studying this subject for a long time and have found John G Lake very helpful in his studies and experiences with healing, and Andrew Murray is another author/minister who has done a fantastic job with this subject."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"This is the first book written by Andrew Murray which I read, and I'm very glad I did. I love his older English writing style, how he packs so much insight and depth into each chapter (many of which are relatively short), and how he exhorts the reader to simply trust in the Lord for their healing, to see God as \\"... the Lord that healeth thee,\\" and I particularly loved his explanation of how Jesus is the Vine and we Christians are the branches.A book which will strengthen and deepen your faith in God as Healer.Also: Andrew Murray wrote MANY books. I also have \\"With Christ In The School of Prayer,\\" which I've read about half of, and it's been wonderful. If you wish to strengthen your prayer life, read this book as well.Thank You God for Andrew Murray's books!"},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"Great Book by a Great minister. teaching other about healing and how to obtain it. very much based on the Scriptures."},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"For every christian looking to believe God for healing, this is a great book.

You won't be disappointed! From Wikipedia: &#34;Andrew Murray (1828-1917) was a South African writer, teacher, and Christian pastor. Murray considered missions to be 'the chief end of the church.&#34; I first read &#34;Experiencing the Holy Spirit&#34; by Pr. Murray, and since then I've been hooked.

For those who really want answers as to what the Word of God says about this subject and are not happy with their experience not lining up with the accounts in the Bible this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Divine Healing","review":"I have read a number of books on the subject of sickness, suffering and healing. I was drawn to Divine Healing by Murray's generally good reputation. I found the book disappointing in that Murray simply states the position held by many of today's faith healers and televangelists. Although Murray avoids many of the more outrageous and extravagent claims of those who proclaim a \\"health, prosperity and happiness\\" gospel today, the bottom line is that Murray has little use for medical science. If you relay on doctors, you are worldly and unspiritual. If you do not get healed, you don't have enough faith or you have unconfessed sin. Murray fails to answer the question why some of the most godly and faithful Christians in history have succombed to illness and died young in many cases. For example, has Joni Eareckson Tada spent her entire life in a wheel chair because she lacks faith? I found a much more balanced biblical view in books such as \\"Surprised by Suffering\\" by R. C. Sproul, and \\"Disappointment WIth God\\" by Philip Yancey."},{"Title":"Frisbee Disc Flying Is for Me (Sports for Me Books)","review":"This is such a bitchen book!

Wexler especially emphasized the role of photography in supporting a discourse of white women's purity and black slave women's (or newly freed black women's) down-to-earth, animal nature. An excellent book for all students of art, social science, or history, this text can be used for undergraduates or graduate students."},{"Title":"Tender Violence: Domestic Visions in an Age of U.S. Imperialism (Cultural Studies of the United States)","review":"Overall, a good book to explore both the benefits and potential pitfalls of applying semiotics to the study of history. Wexler provides good insights as well as a number of highly questionable interpretations (particularly of the photographs on the Olympia). If read with a critical eye, the reader will profit from being forced to examine the potential importance of images on our perception of history."},{"Title":"Tender Violence: Domestic Visions in an Age of U.S. Imperialism (Cultural Studies of the United States)","review":"This monograph was a requirement for one of my graduate seminars. Although I was &#34;forced&#34; to read it, I believe this book does offer an interesting perspective. At times, her interpretation seemed to be a bit of a stretch; for example, she &#34;read into&#34; a white divider between a photograph of a man and a photograph of a woman- some times a white border is simply a white border, in my opinion. However, for what it is worth, I do recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Biblical Theology of the New Testament","review":"This is an excellent book on New Testament theology for those wanting good scholarship and conciseness. It is more directed towards seminary students and the laity who are interested in what the New Testament authors had to say about certain key theological topics of each NT book. The authors are all moderately dispensational, yet have views that comes close to mainline evangelicalism. All the books of the NT are covered and each major theological issue is not shelved aside. Unlike Ladd's NT Theology book, the authors don't get into great exegetical detail on certain passages, but give adequate treatments on certain difficult passages (e.g., Hebrews 6:4-8; James 2:14-26; 1 Peter 4:6 to name a few). Also, they discuss topics like the relationship of the OT Law to the Gospel, lordship salvation, and the issue of promise-fulfilment. David Lowery's treatment of Paul's Missionary Epistles (pp. 243-297) is outstanding and can be used as a \\"Pauline Theology\\" outline. This book has been underrated in evangelical circles due to its theological persuasion. However, all evangelicals (including those in the Reformed tradition) can find this book a valuable resource in NT studies. Also, the practical implications brought out in this book is excellent. It is not purely theological because the authors also put emphasis on how to use these theological themes into practical Christian living. The only negative side (a minor one) is that the editors did not put in a Scripture index. This would have greatly enhanced the book. Overall, though, a great NT theology book written by very competent scholars."},{"Title":"A Biblical Theology of the New Testament","review":"...the main thing to know before buying it is that it is definitely a product of DTS theologians (Zuck, Fanning, etc.), so it's dispensational, reformed, etc. As long as one knows this, one will get one of the most accessible one-volume theological surveys of the NT on the market.

More importantly, my five year old loves it. I was looking for a book to read next to him, a little each day. He is in that awkward stage of reading where he knows his letters and reads small words on a worksheet well, but can't just pick up and read a story to himself. He kind of stumbles over Dr. Seuss, etc, and it goes real slow.Anyway, I saw this book recommended by a homeschooling catalog and went for it. It is perfect for this use-- the next logical step after Dick and Jane. Each lesson gets slightly harder, but they are short... a little excerpt each day with a fun photo picture as a caption. Even my four year old comes around to hear her little brother read it. Plus it has a word box at the top with pronunciation guide, so you can make sure your little one knows all the words before they start to read the excerpt. It's like a paragraph long, but formatted well on the page so if your reader balks at \\"normal\\" page layout (i.e. is afraid of a grown-up paragraph), it is friendly enough for them to try it.The stories are cute too, of little girls and boys, and their pets/outings. Nothing exciting but nothing objectionable either.By the time the book is done, your little one should be reading pretty much like a second/third grader. But more importantly, they feel like they read their first, real chapter book all on their own.

On numerous occasions, I've been asked when or where the family celebrated a certain holiday, when a child got a driver's licence, when we moved into a new home, etc., and all I've had to do is look it up in the gratitude journal. When doing so, I'm usually amazed at the flood of memories that come to mind about what was going on at the time, memories that might have been lost forever if they hadn't been faithfully jotted down.After the first journal, I turned to other journals rather than continuing to buy Ban Breathnach's original one.

The only reason I put 4 stars is because for the first time in over a decade of using these journals, this year's came without the marker ribbon. It doesn't look like it ever had one.

This book looks nice and has some great thoughts at the beginning but really is just a diary like any other."},{"Title":"Simple Abundance Journal of Gratitude","review":"After seeing the author interviewed on Oprah's Super Soul Sunday, I was touched by her life story. I had owned \\"Simple Abundance\\" when it first came out. But it was really the concept of Gratitude Journaling that was particularly impressionable. Like Oprah said, it ritualized \\"Gratitude Journaling\\". In my haste after the interview, I ordered both the book again and the journal because I had no idea where my copy of the book was. After reading book reviews, commencing with the \\"1\\" star reviews, I realized that her target audience was women. I proceeded to cancel the book reorder. But still excited about receiving the journal. Unfortunately, when the journal arrived, it was ultimately disappointing. I had developed a threshold of at least 5 things I wanted to site as something I was in gratitude for. There were hardly enough blank lines to write a decent paragraph per day. The book would have been much more beneficial if 365 pages were allotted with a brief inspirational quote each day.I also must confess and say that I am always fascinated by people who gain great wealth, as Ms. Breathnach had, and lost it in a short amount of time. It makes me wonder if I will be prepared once that great wealth happens to me. I hope that my \\"wants\\" are now much more practical. Therefore, preventing me from making rash fiscal decisions."},{"Title":"Simple Abundance Journal of Gratitude","review":"This book is a gentle reminder that no matter how bad your day was, you can find at least 5 things to be grateful for.

What Sarah Ban Breathnach has written here in essence is one side of the Truth only, and it is seriously unbalanced and as such disturbingly dangerous. There are two basic flaws in her approach, both of which are implications by her ommisson to acknowledge there is more than just &quot;Something Else&quot;. Firstly, by ommission she implies that women only have spiritual needs, and men have only wants ... wants driven by power, control and sex. Wrong! Ban Breathnach is divisive, she has divided female against male because she fails to recognise we are all truely our soul selves, and not our egos. We are all souls regardless of our sex, and we are all worthy of love and respect, not necessarily deserved of love and respect, but certainly we are all born worthy of these God given rights of life. Secondly, she has written this book from what I call &quot;heart-sense&quot; only, and without &quot;mind-sense&quot; in equal proportions the book is spiritually unbalanced. What do I mean? Love isnt everything, it is part of the balance ... Love must be balanced by Responsibility, and Responsibilty must be balanced by Love. Not only must we be responsible to and loving of ourselves, but we must be responsible and loving of those in our lives as well. Heart-sense and mind-sense, they must be in balance for spiritual Truth ... that is why God made Man and Woman, Sun and Moon, Light and Dark to constantly remind us of this. Sarah gave us &quot;Something Else&quot;, not &quot;Something More&quot; in this book, but mind you, she is right, there really is &quot;Something More&quot; out there, and we are ALL worthy of that :) I welcome any comments about what I have written, and I hope Sarah isnt offended for what I had to say."},{"Title":"Simple Abundance Journal of Gratitude","review":"I foget to write in it, it's prob my own issue, but there is no ongoing reading so I basically read the intro, wrote in it a couple of days and forgot about it..."},{"Title":"Simple Abundance Journal of Gratitude","review":"The only erason it was popular was because of opra"},{"Title":"Simple Abundance Journal of Gratitude","review":"The idea behind this journal -- to each day write down 5 things you are grateful for -- is a good one.

Quite often though, I find myself often giving thanks for the same things over and over again: the love of my husband, good health, the beauty of nature, the joy of humanity and the peaceful nation in which I live. These precious gifts could be broken down further but the scanty amount of space does not leave much room for any lengthy thoughts.

Just this morning, I was reading some old entires and this phrase came into my mind: Happiness is a renewable resource. That thought in itself is a blessing to me.

It's good material for persons new to Baptist life/churches."},{"Title":"The Baptist Identity: Four Fragile Freedoms","review":"Walter B. Shurden is a well-known Baptist historian, author, educator and editor.I disagree with some of Mr. Shurden's conclusions, but I recommend that this book be purchased and read. The work is thought-provoking, scholarly and the research is thorough.In his book, The Baptist Identity, Walter Shurden sets out to answer the question \\"What makes a Baptist a Baptist?\\" He says \\"what I have tried to do in this book\\" is define the essence of what constitutes being a Baptist. So he sets out to find any \\"spiritual and theological marks\\", any \\"generic distinctives\\", \\"any peculiar convictions\\" that Baptists have in common and that make them Baptist. To be a \\"five-star\\" book, Shurden must accomplish this purpose.Shurden tells us when and how he arrived at his consensus of Baptist distinctives, as presented in his Four Fragile Freedoms. \\"I first identified the four freedoms discussed in this book in the concluding chapter of my book 'The Life of Baptists in the Life of the World,' published in 1985.\\" He goes on to note, \\"I arrived at these Baptist Freedoms by analyzing the sermons and addresses given by Baptists from around the world at the meetings of the Baptist World Alliance from 1905 to 1980.\\" Herein lies what I believe was Mr. Shurden's mistake -- his conviction that sermons and addresses given by Baptists at the Baptist World Alliance is the best place to look to find Baptist distinctives. I think such a conclusion is mistaken because it is too narrow.1. The time element (1905-1980) is too narrow. Looking in this time frame alone dismisses a large volume of Baptist thought prior to 1905. Shurden believes that Baptists arose out of English Separatism in the early 1600's. But he does not investigate what was distinctive in that time that caused those men/churches to leave Separatism and become Baptist, nor does he look the 300 years following. The time period is 75 years, but it also only represents 14 meetings of the Baptist World Alliance (see Dictionary of Baptists or BWA on Wikipedia, e.g.). The bibliography also reveals almost entirely 20th century sources.2. The \\"Baptist variety\\" element is too narrow. It might seem that a sampling of Baptists from across the world would give the best variety. Though there were approximately 135 Baptist bodies represented in the BWA at the time of Shurden's writing, the purpose of the BWA somewhat skews the type of Baptists that participate.The numerical majority of Baptists in America were represented in the BWA then (due to the presence of the Southern Baptist Convention). Nevertheless, only 14 of over 50 groups of Baptists in the United States belonged to the Baptist World Alliance. In England, only the liberal open membership Baptist Union is represented. Albert W. Wardin, Jr. [BWA member and author of the Baptist Atlas] identifies three broad divisions of Baptists worldwide -- mainline ecumenical, conservative evangelical, and separatist fundamental (p. 3), and says that the BWA \\"includes all Baptists of the first party and a good cross section of bodies in the second party but none of the third group.\\"3. The content element is too narrow. Shurden pulls his information from \\"sermons and addresses...at meetings of the Baptist World Alliance.\\" With no intended disrespect for Baptist intelligentsia, it is my opinion that the people who would be invited to speak at the Baptist World Alliance probably are not the best representatives of what rank and file Baptists really are -- not necessarily even the rank and file of those bodies affiliated with the BWA. One could probably find a broader sampling other than those who spoke before the BWA. The fourfold purpose of the BWA is to unite Baptists worldwide, lead in evangelism, respond to people in need, and defend human rights [Baptist Atlas, 1995, p. xxx]. This fourfold purpose of the BWA surely affects and limits the type of speakers who would be chosen to address the assemblies.Shurden's \\"four freedoms\\" are a fair representation of commonalities in the sermons and addresses given by speakers at the Baptist World Alliance. How well do these speakers represent the constituency of the BWA, and how well can they represent Baptists as a whole? Mr. Shurden chose this format in which to frame his argument, and therefore it is his task to convince us that this is a broad enough pool of Baptist thought and representative of the broader body of Baptists. In my opinion, he fails to do so.Another book that addresses the Baptist identity is More Than Just a Name: Preserving Our Baptist Identity by R. Stanton Norman (Broadman & Holman, 2001). It comes from a different perspective as well as a different methodology. Mr. Norman investigates a broad range of writings in a distinct body of literature that consciously addresses Baptist distinctives -- \\"What makes a Baptist a Baptist\\". Those interested in buying Mr. Shurden's book should also consider buying Norman's book."},{"Title":"The Baptist Identity: Four Fragile Freedoms","review":"Interesting book.

But overall it focuses more on the \\"Joe Blogg\\" tips and tricks approach, which may work for some people and not for others. I still believe knowing sincerely how to solve problems will get you far. But the PR book makes for an interesting read, gives you some excellent strategies (e.g., about the essay sections etc) and does the best job of introducing the concept of \\"difficulty level bins\\" -- which is how the CAT works. For those about to take the GMAT, some tips:1. Definitely get yourself the 'Official Guide' (published by ETS) -- that is indespensable. You should aim to complete it from cover to cover - it gives you a really good idea of the test questions though the math is a liitle easier than what I saw on the test. It even has a comprehensive, complete list of essay topics. I worked with the 10th edition, the latest possible edition would be a good buy lest you should miss out on some novel nuances.2. Practice tests -- my scores in Powerprep : 780,770; Kaplan : 670,650,690; Princeton : 750,720. So I'd venture to recommend this book to get a decent estimation of where you really stand, and therefore u must take the included tests seriously -- i.e., emulating the real testing conditions -- in order to get an accurate idea of your potential. Kaplan is really tough - I haven't seen too many folks scoring above 700 in thier tests - infact when i gave the first test straight after a 780 in powerprep and got a 650 I was pretty turned off - but later found out that it wasn't really a big deal. Get Kaplan for practice, but the PR and the official guide should be enough.3. PREP MATERIAL: Well other than the Official guide, I used PR and Kaplan. I found the math tips in Kaplan (50 of them) quite impressive but the practice tests in PR give you a very good idea of difficulty levels of math/analytic because it lays out the test in \\"bins\\" (easy bin, medium bin, and the tough bin).

It was written for scholars of German history and is a dense analysis of politics from the foundation of the Weimar Republic to its fall under the Nazi onslaught. The focus is on politics with a detailed discussion of political history. Social history, economic history, and diplomatic history figure prominently but primarily in the context of how they affected the politics of Weimar. Mommsen's mastery of detail and ability to integrate these different aspects of Weimar's history are impressive. While the descriptions of political manuvering can be a chore to read, ths level of detail is necessary to achieve a complete picture of the history of Weimar and are the foundation for the often masterly analyses that dot this book. This book is never less than complete and many sections, for example, the descriptions of the collapse of the Imperial state or the rise of the Nazi party, are outstanding. More than anything else, Mommsen provides a vivid picture of the huge obstacles faced by the Weimar Republic. From its inception, the Republic and its commitment to a democratic state faced opposition from several important segments of German society, including the Army, much of the civil service, much of industry, the traditional aristocracy, much of the juidiciary, and most of the professioriate. Coupled with a very unfavorable international situation and the enormous stresses of the Great Depression, it is remarkable that the Republic survived as long as it did."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of Weimar Democracy","review":"This book is not necessarily and easy read, but if you are truly interested in the dynamics in Germany leading up to WWII this is the one for you."},{"Title":"In search of Scotland","review":"In the Lion's Mouth: Gisi Fleischmann & the Jewish Fight for SurvivalJerusalem Journal: Adventures in a Desert LandscapeSmokestacks and Black Diamonds: A History of Carbon County, PennsylvaniaNeed a vacation but can't get away?

I started reading \\"In Search of Scotland\\" right after finishing Morton's wonderful \\"In Search of England,\\" and I have to admit I found \\"...Scotland\\" something of a letdown.I've been trying to decide why exactly that is, and I think it may simply be because \\"...England\\" was a diverse, you might say, book, with a wider variety of personalities, encounters, and generally interesting things to do and see. It may be, too, that Morton was more familiar with England and so could write about it more broadly and confidently. One of the things I found most surprising about \\"...Scotland,\\" in fact, was Morton's discussion of how unknown most of Scotland -- particularly the Highlands -- still was to the majority of English people, even as late as the time Morton was writing (1929). Scotland was in many senses a foreign land, making \\"In Search of Scotland\\" Morton's first piece of \\"foreign\\" travel writing (all his previous books had been about England, and mostly about London).While parts of \\"...Scotland\\" dragged for me, there were still many times when Morton's descriptive skill shined through, and the reader comes away with a strong sense of the role history plays (or played?) in the average Scot's understanding of himself and his place in the world.

He was also critical of state socialism for being just another bureaucratic system holding the individual in its suffocating grip. That was then, now the bureaucracies have been delayered and flattened out. It's management by email.As the old saw goes: Be careful what you ask for. In \\"The Culture of New Capitalism,\\" Sennett seems somewhat nostalgic for the security and rewarding work that bureaucracies once provided. The dismantling of large-scale institutions did not result in the communities of trust and solidarity for which the radicals had hoped. Instead, they left modern day workers in very fragmented and ambiguous working conditions.According to Sennett, these conditions came about in the 1970's and have accelerated since. After the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement, capital markets became globalized. Corporate managers became more concerned about increasing short term value - higher share price - and less concerned about the long-term welfare of their employees. Over the years wages have stagnated and benefits have been reduced. In short, \\"the new capitalism\\" or \\"new economy\\" of which he speaks has been reconfigured to give an increasing amount of wealth to shareholders rather than employees.What effect this has had on the workplace is the focus of this study. The target industries of this study were high technology, finance, and media, but what has taken place there foreshadows what is happening in other industries and also the public sector.First, Sennett finds that employees must learn how to manage short-term relationships; corporations no longer provide a long-term framework. Second, the modern workplace values a meritocracy of potential abilities rather than craftsmanship developed over a long period of time. And finally, one must learn how to let go of the past and accept the fact that one's place in the corporation is no longer guaranteed. To sum up, the ideal worker in the new economy is someone who must think in the short term, constantly develop their potential and not look over their shoulder.That's great if you are young, unattached, wealthy, and well educated. However, if you are middle-class, middle-aged, and have multiple responsiblities, it's a cruel world.For nearly a generation, globalization has brought downward pressure on unskilled wages, but now - thanks to technological innovations - it is bringing downward pressure on skilled wages as well. Never before has capitalism had unlimited access to labor. There has been a race to the bottom in search of lower wages.Americans seem to have resigned themselves to the vicissitudes of the global labor markets; the Europeans and the Japanese have been less sanguine, or a least more protective of their lifestyles. It may be that Americans believe free markets are an intrinsic good. I believe that at some point there will be a backlash against outsourcing and offshoring, and that this book may be prescient. As Sennett rightly notes, free markets do not necessarily translate into more freedom for individuals."},{"Title":"The Culture of the New Capitalism","review":"Richard Sennett in THE CULTURE OF THE NEW CAPITALISM reflects upon the reactionary extirpation over the past three decades of the Western social capitalist state. Starting with a discussion of Bismarckian social capitalism which was founded on the model of the Prussian Army's highly successful bureaucracy and which provided structure and discipline to cultural relations, Sennett ends with a bleak meditation on the values encoded in the New Economy versus the Old. These include the elevation of process over craftsmanship, of \\"flexibility\\" over stability, of superficial over deep knowledge, and of centralized power over mediated authority. Along the way, Sennett shares pithy insights into the nature of this revolutionary shift and the cultural and economic dislocations it has caused.Sennett states that three new pages were turned in the late twentieth century workplace. \\"First has been the shift from managerial to shareholder power in large companies.\\" (pg. 37) This shift in power, according to Sennett turned a second new page: \\"The empowered investors wanted short-term rather than long-term results.\\" The third new page representing a challenge to the past \\"lay in the development of new technologies of communication and manufacturing.\\" He notes that \\"one consequence of the information revolution has...been to replace modulation and interpretation of commands by a new kind of centralization.\\" (pg. 43) At the same time, automation, growing out of technological innovation \\"...has affected the [social capitalist] bureaucratic pyramid in one profound way: the base of the pyramid no longer needs to be big.\\" (pg. 43). Circuits replace people.According to Sennett, the old model, built on the pyramid model with a mass of workers at the bottom responding to a chain of command situated at the top is on the way out. In contrast, the new model he likens to an MP3 player: \\"The MP3 machine can be programmed to play only a few bands from its repertoire; similarly, the flexible organization can select and perform only a few of its many possible functions at any given time. In the old-style corporation, by contrast, production occurs via a fixed set of acts; the links in the chain are set. Again in an MP3 player, what you hear can be programmed in any sequence. In a flexible organization, the sequence of production can be varied at will.\\" (pgs.47-48). (Notably, and perhaps inevitably, the new model got its start in the cutting edge businesses of finance, technology, pharma and media and their support industries: marketing research, advertising, and business consulting).In a remarkable section on the shift in how employees are assessed - based on achievement in the old structure and \\"potential\\" in the new -- he shows how SAT testing supports the new regime. Sennett notes that \\"in the search to consummate the project of finding a [Jeffersonian] natural aristocracy, the mental life of human beings has assumed a surface and narrowed form. Social reference, sensate reasoning, and emotional understanding have been excluded from that search, just as have belief and truth. ...These [flexible] institutions ... privilege the kind of mental life embodied by consultants, moving from scene to scene, problem to problem, team to team. He says that \\"...this talent search cuts reference to experience and the chains of circumstance, eschews sensate impressions, divides analyzing from believing, ignores the glue of emotional attachment, penalizes digging deep--the state of living in pure process which the philosopher Zygmunt Bauman calls 'liquid modernity.'\\" (pgs. 120-122)He notes that while citizen-workers might have been trapped in Max Weber's \\"iron cage\\" under the old system, nevertheless the structure gave its denizens a sense of meaning and was roughly consonant with general social values. In essence, Sennett says: \\"Time lay at the center of this military, social capitalism: long-term and incremental and above all predictable time.\\" (pg. 23).This new architecture, crafted by the business consultant class to whom agency is given by the new corporation, enables the exercise of enormous centralized power through new communications technology, and at the same time evades the responsibility of its recommendations, as do those who hire them. Bloodless terms like \\"flexible\\" workplaces,\\" \\"off-shoring\\" and \\"right-shoring,\\" \\"downsizing\\" and \\"right-sizing\\" are, for instance, deployed to mystify mass firings and those responsible for them.The ideal worker in this paradigm is conceived to be flexible, cooperative, efficient and not get too involved in the nuts and bolts when doing problem-solving. Want ads looking for \\"entrepreneurs,\\" and \\"self-starters\\" are emblematic of this shift. The ideal worker is most of all attuned to short-term shareholder values, values which insist on change. Whether the change is good or bad is almost irrelevant: change is in and of itself a signal to investors of impending short-term gains.Sennett offers \\"five ways in which the consumer-spectator-citizen is turned away from progressive politics,\\" each element of which arises from the culture of the new capitalism. He says that the consumer-spectator-citizen is \\"(1) offered political platforms which resemble product platforms and (2) gold-plated difference; (3) asked to discount 'the twisted timber of humanity (as Immanuel Kant called us), and (4) credit more user-friendly politics; (5) accept continually new political products on offer.\\"(pg. 163). Summarizing these points, he says: \\"The culture of the new capitalism is attuned to singular events, one-off transactions, interventions; to progress, a polity needs to draw on sustained relationships and accumulate experience. In short, the unprogressive drift of the new culture lies in its shaping of time.\\" (pg. 178).In his last paragraph, Sennett attempts to end on a hopeful note: \\"What I have sought to explore in these pages is thus a paradox: a new order of power gained through and ever more superficial culture. Since people can anchor themselves in life only by trying to do something well for its own sake, the triumph of superficiality at work, in schools, and in politics seems to me fragile. Perhaps indeed, revolt against this enfeebled culture will constitute our next fresh page.\\"I don't know about you, but I'm not holding my breath."},{"Title":"The Culture of the New Capitalism","review":"Sennett presents a passionate analysis of the latest developments of our working conditions and how these affect our feelings of inadequacy and frustration as workers/employees, etc. Contextualized in a diachronic explanation of the business practices, his essays are mainly centered around the bureaucratic (dis)function of corporations and on the way workers and employees react to the latest logic of capital, which is presented as a moving target of uncertain consequences. Although his reflection is at times too quick--to the point of falling into some stylistic mishaps--the reader has a better understanding regarding the whys and hows of the frenzied realities associated with consumption and desire. Sennett does a great job of integrating into his interpretation different philosophical and theoretical approaches, using good analogies and concise language. However, as I was reading his intelligent dissection of the \\"the specter of uselessness,\\" particularly in relation to the lack of recognition for a \\"job well done\\", I was surprised that the author did not make a connection with the traditional Marxist concept of alienation. Similarly, I would have liked to see Lacan's ideas of desire when Sennett elaborated on consumption.I recommend this book to anyone interested in having a clearer image of the dynamic nature of late capitalism and its impact on the quality of our lives."},{"Title":"The Culture of the New Capitalism","review":"This book presents a different perspective on traditional and contemporary capitalism. The author uses arguments of philosophers such as Max weber, karl Marx and other significant individuals to make distinctions, compare and validate certain points. I recommend the book for anyone interested in learning more about the topic. I only gave the book four stars because I did have some difficulties understanding certain perspectives in chapter III but overall a decent read."},{"Title":"The Culture of the New Capitalism","review":"Sennett's thesis is sustainedly incisive and well-reasoned, his analyses based on years of interviews and field research for his various book projects and now here rendered in a distilled, leavened and non-reportorial form. What he identified as the deficits of the new social capitalism as a result of the upheavals to the old bureaucratic order of labor is disquieting and makes one wonder how we might possibly ameliorate if not counter it. His suggests this at the end of the book in pointing to 3 social developments that aim to re-foster a sense of life narrative, social community (through unions that act as job matchers and social community, and job sharing schemes) and personal agency in planning one's life (through some form of personal allocation of funds by the state).Elsewhere, his diagnosis of the inherently agitating, dynamic and shifting new economic order based on the ownership of shareholders seeking short-term gains and implicitly heralding the virtues of constant change, organizational reengineering and creative destruction over stability and long-term value building might bear challenging in some respects. While there is truth in his statement at the time of the book's publication, the ensuing global economic downturn has hearkened a return to the perceived desirability of stability and stolidity in corporations as investors seek shelter from the economic mayhem.I also questioned his portrayal of the superficially engaged and ever change-responsive ideal employee bearing 'potential' over experience, the suggestion of which is that the new economy no longer affords the accumulation and deepening of experience or development of a spirit of craftsmanship. While this might be true to some degree for some and especially junior employees, experience can be built upon even through non-consecutive or short-term projects and job assignments; experience and craftsmanship is not necessarily as narrow or constricted as he'd suggest, as in a formal capacity calling for a multifaceted awareness and approach such as general or human resource management. That said, I agree with his broad thesis that that is how society is tending to shape our valuation of experience.He makes interesting correlations between the effects of the new economy and broader social and psychological implications of our attitudes to politics and consumer consumption in the form of a kind of surrendering of the person to a surfeit of information and promise of potential. The thrall we fall under to marketing and packaging of the slick young politician over the seasoned war-weary statesman finds parallels in our consumer society's obsession with possession of the new, the gold-plated surficial differences between brands.Despite my mild reservations above, Sennett here (as in his other works on class and the accordance of social respect) offers richly leavened material for consideration. His invitation to reflection on the kind of society we were emerging into remains relevant even almost 10 years on."},{"Title":"The Culture of the New Capitalism","review":"Getting the book, I thought it 'would change my life' through all the insight Sennett would bestow on me. Sadly not the case, it was a lackluster title. I don't really have any suggestions as to what might be better."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"Excellent book. P.W. Singer really enlightens the reader about a very alarming and shocking trend in modern military tactics in the world today. This is an issue that most Western people would be horrified by, but are not because it is an issue that is largely unknown. He really shows the reader how this is a global trend in war zones in many continents, not just Africa. He also shows the history of this trend. Good read."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"a friend of mine recommended this book when he heard I was doing research on African child soldiers and this book ended up helping me more to understand the effects and cause of the problem. I was really shocked to read about the ordeals these children go through in the hands of these wicked recruiters.Another must read for anyone interested in international affairs"},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"Being an International Relations student about to embark on a years study on this subject I was looking for a solid grounding on which to begin my study and this provided a perfect answer. Singer uses simple dialogue and logical progression in his publication to provide information on the recruting of child soldiers, what they are subjected to in the field, the difficulty of soldiers facing children, the worst culprits, reintegration of soldiers and proposed methods of ending this aspect of modern warfare.An important aspect of this book that isn't mentioned so much is its discussions on how military forces should approach fighting child soldiers. As a potential officer of the future I felt this was particularly important, Singer mentions that the US Army supplied early drafts of this book to its officers as guidelines for potential situations so clearly they believe his suggestions hold merit also.It should be noted that any reader should of course expect some horrific details from this book, I had expected these but was sickened by some of the stories. There are particularly brutal aspects that you could not imagine, just a word of warning as one of the accounts has left me particularly troubled by hummanity.In conclusion I believe this book to be a perfect introductory reading to anyone studying, or simply interested, in the subject. I would also state that those more advanced in the topic should look at this book as, if the information and proposals are not new to you, the research is excellent and so the references can provide you with more resources that you may potentially have not yet accessed.Altogether a superb book, ideal for anyone wishing to gain further knowledge in the subject area."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"While I don't think this is a brand new problem, the author tackles a difficult subject from a modern perspective, with much focus on the role of children and the recruitment of children into militia and small armed forces rather than state-sponsored armies.Many parts of the book were truly shocking, particularly the descriptions of the indoctrination methods used by the organizers of child soldiers to make the children into soldiers capable of greater atrocities than adults.The author's clear writing, thoughtful explanation, and collection of a wide range of source material all make this an excellent introduction to this important topic. It's also nice that the author includes endnotes to point to sources and allow for futher research."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"This book talks about the active recruitment of children in many areas of the world today. He covers how they are recruited, abducted or conscripted, trained and finally set off to fight in whatever hot spot is active at the moment.The one surprising thing about this book is that it treats this as a new problem. War has always been a young persons game. To read the biographies of woldiers of World War II, a surprising number lied about their age to join the army at fifteen or sixteen years of age. In the American Civil War around 100,000 soldiers were fifteen or younger. A surprising, but unknown number were under ten. The pictures of the end of the Third Reich show young boys greeting Hitler. The first American killed in Afghanistan was shot by a 14 year old sniper.On the other hand, by bringing attention to the fact that our Army will have to face children in the battlefield Dr. Singer may help prepare our forces and our public for the real world."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"The face of warfare has changed dramatically in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In the first years of the new millennium, we rarely find state-led armies clashing across the boarders of sovereign nations. Rather, most wars occur within the boarders of an autonomous state. Civil and guerrilla conflicts have replaced the international and colonial wars of the recent past. All too often, the armies fueling these new internal struggles for power are composed of children.Dr. Singer has created an excellent and through study of the new phenomenon of children at war. Singer looks at the variety of ways that child soldiers are recruited across cultural and political arenas, the perceived benefits of child soldiers to their political patrons, and the long-term repercussions of inundating the world's children in to an existence based upon violence and death.Singer's work is based upon personal interviews with child soldiers, adults involved in the raging conflicts, as well as international aid agencies, the UN and others closely involved in the \\"new warfare.\\" Such a work is an invaluable contribution to the emerging cannon on the changing face of warfare. Only with such studies will the world begin to see the problems of children at war, but also begin to create solutions."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"As far as I know, Singer is the first to point out that child warriors are making possible a new kind of war, a war without ideology or purpose other than taking something someone else has. Adults fight better with a cause and a purpose--children are more easily drugged, brainwashed, and cut off from other support. They can also be far crueler in battle and harder to rehabilitate. Singer points to responses to lessen the problem, but she is far from optimistic."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"This is a welcome follow-up to the author's previous work \\"Corporate Warriors.\\" While each book highlights an emerging and disturbing trend in modern warfare, the practices described in \\"Children at War\\" are particularly horrific. Training children as young as 12 to kill without mercy and to be used as cannon fodder to shield adult soldiers sounds like some crazy vision of a dark future. Singer, however, builds a strong case that this dark future is here. It would be easy to blame this on one or two sadistic tyrants, but Singer shows how a confluence of global factors have led to this situation. What to do with these children when the fighting ends, or when they are rescued from a war zone is a challenge that the global community is just beginning to recognize. While the author does what he can to recommend a solution to this problem, there are no obvious solutions. This may not win an award for \\"Feel Good Book of the Year,\\" but it should be a contender for \\"Most Important Book of the Year.\\""},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"It's a great that another book has been written on this deeply troubling yet narrowly recognized problem in today's world affairs.The author presents the problem, traces its roots, lists a wealth of examples and statistics, discusses the causes and effects, and proposes solutions while recognizing the difficulties.I hope policy-makers would read this book and recognize the grave consequences that this salient problem would entail if it is not dealt with quickly and effectively."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"Reading through the other reviews here it struck me that they seemed to share a lack of prior knowledge about the subject. Had anyone read more widely they would have discovered that 'Children at War' is a piece of pseudo-scholarship. This book is based upon a completely misguided assumption - that the involvement of children in warfare is a new phenomenon. In making such an assertion the author reveals either lack of any proper engagement with the literature or simply bad faith. The sad fact is that children have been involved as solidiers in many, if not most, of the wars recorded in history. In spite of Singer's erroneous claims to the contrary, the US Civil War involved large numbers of boy soldiers. Similarly the First World War. Children fought and died with the partisans in Nazi-occupied Europe, and so on. Towards the end of the book, Singer reveals a disturbing political agenda. It seems that his real concern is less with child soldiers and more with the challenges for US troops faced with children in places like Afghanistan and Iraq where killing them is bad for morale and also looks so bad to the folks back home watching CNN.In terms of sources, Singer relies overwhelmingly on journalistic accounts that are simply intended to offer shock value to their readers and, like his own book, lack any deeper engagement with the history and context within which child recruitment takes place. Aside from one quote, none of the copious quotes from child soldiers seems to have come from Singer's one fieldwork. Indeed, the reader is left wondering if Singer has ever actually visited a setting where child recruitment takes place.This is a work of truly poor scholarship. It is a mystery how it ever got published and why so many people have been apparently taken in by it. Perhaps it is a case of telling people what they want to hear?If anyone is looking for a proper discussion of this subject they would do far better to read David Rosen's 'Armies of the Young'."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"Back in the mid-1990s I spent many months reporting on child soldiers in places including Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. I wrote from the immediacy of a journalist's perspective, but was unable to examine the cause-and-effect realities of this disturbing phenomenon. In \\"Children at War\\" P. W. Singer has produced a truly important study of the socio-cultural, economic and historic causes behind the militarization of children in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Singer's work is an incredibly valuable contribution to further the study and understanding of armed conflict in the post Cold War-era. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the welfare of children and the state of our world in often-neglected locations such as sub-Saharan Africa. It is also an insightful look at how \\"warlordism\\" and the greed driving so-called commodity wars is changing the face of modern armed conflict."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"War is so terrible that sociopathic leaders in some parts of the world use child soldiers, ages 12 - 18, to fight their wars. This book tells the terrible story. This is not a new problem. Even in the American Civil War about 100,000 soldiers were age 15 or youngr. Many parts of this book are shocking as it explains the recruitment, training, and discipline of these young children as they are developed into brutal soldiers at the same time that they are robbed of their childhood."},{"Title":"Children at War","review":"The Author writes about a chilling new chapter in post-modern warfare. It is a very objective and scholarly work that covers in comprehensive detail the underlying causes, recruitment, implications and response to \\"Child Soldiers\\".

Despite the fact that you may get either emotional or angry at the author for how he conveys his message in select chapters, I strongly recommend that you purchase this book.

Too many stories, all of a similar vein. I should have gotten the Devil's Dictionary!!!"},{"Title":"The complete short stories of Ambrose Bierce","review":"Ambrose Bierce's most famous story is An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and many of his stories follow that same kind of pattern: an event is related with some surprising or revelatory twist at the end. The stories of the Civil War are especially interesting as they are not at all typical writings about war. Bierce does not see the battle so much as one of North against South rather he sees the war as the child sees the war in his story Chickamauga, his attitude is one combining fascination at the spectacle and utter disgust. Life is an unresolved jumble of confused forces and mixed emotions for everyone in Bierce's haunting tales that read like dreams but dreams informed by much contact with reality as Bierce was wounded twice(once in the head)in the war he describes. The descriptions of Civil War battles are told with great precision(and alone make this volume worth having) though there is always an additional element to make them more than war reportage, Bierce turns his accounts into stories because he sees through all the cannon smoke to the small detail which encapsulates the essential thing about an event. In one of my favorites, Killed at Resaca, a courageous captain gallops across a field to deliver a crucial message only to find the field is impassable because of a deep gully, instead of turning around however he merely waits for the enemy to shoot him. Going through his personal things a fellow soldier, the narrator of the story, finds a letter which explains this resolve. The letter reads:&quot;...I could bear to hear of my soldier- lover's death, but not of his cowardice.&quot; Later, when the narrator has a chance to return the letter to its author he is asked by her how her soldier-lover died. &quot;He was bitten by a snake,&quot;is the narrators reply. Bierce's pen was dipped in wormwood and acid said H.L. Mencken. His stories of soldiers and civilians are told with a bitter and venomous clarity. His humor was always of the sort aquainted with the gallows. He said at age 71,&quot;I am so old I am ashamed to be alive.&quot; And so he rode off to Mexico. It's hard to imagine Stephen Crane existing without the example of Ambrose Bierce just as it is hard to imagine Bierce without Poe.

Still, this collection is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The complete short stories of Ambrose Bierce","review":"Ambrose Bierce was the one of the 2 writers of major significance to fight in and survive the Civil War (the other being Sidney Lanier). He was bitter to begin with, but the experience changed him into an even more cynical man. An eloquent writer, his best subject is fear: his ghost stories are dark and spooky - the civil war stories are as well, but with the added horror of a very real war and fear of battle. &quot;Chickamauga&quot; is one of my favorites - Bierce was actually at the battle but the story is fictional, and adds a supernatural angle to an infamous time and place. His writings are ghostly and vivid tales of America in the mid 19th century. The horrific experiences encountered in his tales are both real and imagined. If you are a ghost story fan or an American history/Civil War buff, you'll enjoy Bierce."},{"Title":"The complete short stories of Ambrose Bierce","review":"To anyone interested in the English language and its application by a master story teller, this author must be read.

There are some great stories here that can be read aloud to a group or enjoyed silently by the fireplace. Bierce was a veteran of the American Civil War so his experiece shows in many of his stories like \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\", \\"Killed at Resaca\\", and \\"Chickamauga\\".The subject of Bierce's own death is a mystery.

Your editor states that five of the war stories are not included."},{"Title":"The complete short stories of Ambrose Bierce","review":"Ambrose Bierce is as famous for the circumstances surrounding the end of his life as for his bitter fatalistic prose. Bierce was a journalist/author and a Civil War veteran. In 1913, after the breakup of his marriage and the death of his sons, he set out for Mexico to meet Pancho Villa and observe the Mexican Revolution at first hand. He wrote to a friend:Goodbye, if you hear of my being stood up against a Mexican stone wall and shot to rags, please know that I think it a pretty good way to depart this life. It beats old age, disease, or falling down the cellar stairs. To be a Gringo in Mexico--ah, that is euthanasia!With that, he disappeared into Mexico and was never heard from again, fueling wild speculation about his fate (i.e., Carols Fuentes' novel The Old Gringo). A fitting end for an author whose works combined a bleak view of life with elements of mystery.Bierce's Civil War stories are bleak little tales of death and destruction. There's one here that nicely captures his cynical world view--most of us saw a film version of it in grade school--An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge. Peyton Farquhar is a Southern planter captured behind Union lines on a spy mission. As the story opens, he stands upon Owl Creek Bridge with a noose around his neck thinking of the wife and children he will never see again. But when the Union soldiers try to hang him, the noose slips and he swims off downstream. He flees across country until he finally reaches home and as he approaches his open armed wife...the rope snaps tight and we realize that he had imagined the whole episode on his way down. Here in one tidy package is the brutality of war, the futility of life and the bitter wit that characterizes his work.He's not for all tastes, and I'm not generally big on short stories, but I like him.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"The complete short stories of Ambrose Bierce","review":"A master horror story teller"},{"Title":"Asterix en Bretana (Spanish Edition)","review":"Excelente titulo de las aventuras de asterix y obelix.

The number 5 is significant in the bible (1/2 hour or .5 may equal the grace of God).

We are only months away from the true rapture May 21 with NO Q mark this time! But 1994? was a fantastic introduction to the verified timeline of the Bible for the history of this world published at a time when eyes were starting to open concerning the true nature of salvation and how so many places in scripture offer clues for the timing of the return of Christ. This is The only date Camping had introduced up until then. He taught that 1988 was the END of the church age which not so surprisingly some other Bible teachers had identified 1988 wrongly as the return of Christ and or the end of the world rather than the end of the church age and silence in heaven. Although this is a great place to start, it is also sort of a waste of valuable time to start here. If someone wants to read a book containing a lot more refined and corrected view of what Scripture teaches about the timing of the end, get a hold of the much more recent \\"Time has an End\\" or even better yet the booklets \\"We are almost there\\" or \\"To God be the Glory\\" Whatever we do when read these books we do NOT want to trust Camping!

He does this to emphasis the fact which he reiterates in the book - that there could be something he missed.So although he doesn't cover the &quot;latter rain&quot; (Revelation7:9, James5, Joel2, Duet32) - most of the information remains astonishingly accurate. From the &quot;Great tribulation&quot;(Matthew24, Rev7:9) to the &quot;end of the church age&quot; (1Peter4:17, 2Thess2, Rev13, Rev18, Daniel12) - many end-time subjects are covered. Other such books I recommend are &quot;Adam When?&quot; and &quot;Mystery Babylon:The abomination of desolation?&quot; written by Harold Camping and Dan Webster, respectively.Mr. Camping is able to teach doctrine in a way that leaves very little room for doubt or misunderstanding. His method is simple. Every single verse which relates to the subject material must be carefully analyzed. For most of us - that's an overwhelming task, but it's been Camping's job for over four decades. (He quite engineering in his late 30's to pursue a career in Bible study, which he's done to the present day - 50 years later). Most of his &quot;critics&quot; are those who have been unable to prove their points on the live, radio call-in program which he hosts (&quot;the Open Forum&quot;). When they find they can't discredit what he say's on a Biblical level, many begin to engage in character assaasination.One thing that marks Camping as different from most other teachers is that he encourages people NOT to trust him - but rather to trust the Bible alone. In other words - he's not seeking followers, he seeks truth. The fact that he shares it with many others is a true blessing.Camping's studies are almost always of unsurpassed quality and &quot;1994?&quot; is no exception. Mr. Camping is a genuine child of God and is well established as an excellent Bible student and teacher.I encourage each person reading this review to get a copy of &quot;1994?&quot;."},{"Title":"1994?","review":"Length:: 3:46 MinsObjectively speaking, the actual title of the book is \\"1994?\\" (notice the question mark). The author included the question mark in the title because the author was not 100% certain of the year."},{"Title":"1994?","review":"Like Edgar Whisenant's \\"88 Reasons Why the Rapture Will Be in 1988\\", Harold Camping's \\"1994?\\" is another book that heralded what would become a failed prediction of the end of days. Unlike other endtimes datesetters, Camping's scenario does not follow the usual dispensationalist line. In fact, Camping's system is so idiosyncratic as to not qualify as following any standard eschatological system. To be quite honest, it is hard to even tell if it is self-consistent since little of it makes any sense at all.Camping spends most of the book taking passages out of context and then tying them to numerical calculations he devises but never justifies. He manipulates numbers in such a haphazard way as to closely resemble a crooked accountant who is fudging financial data to keep his superiors from discovering his malfeasance. The hope is that in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Camping certainly pulled it off to a certain extent as his book was a sensation - right up to the point it was disproven.Since the failure, Camping has written books claiming the Church era is over (didn't Christ say it would not end until his return?) and more recently that the end will come in 2011. Apparently the only thing Camping has learned in the intervening time is to put the end date further off. Thankfully, there are a lot fewer people listening this time around."},{"Title":"1994?","review":"Harold Camping's odd work is heavily influenced by numerology, a psuedo-science influenced by ancient mysticism that trys to find hidden truth behind literal meanings of the Bible.The book is filled with strange assumptions based upon allegory mixed with ignorance.

But, I became confused after he started asserting that he knew when Christ would return, since by this time I thought that he did have a deeper understanding of the Bible than most. To me, it was quite clear that from Matthew 24:36 - But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. So, I bought the book anyway to see what was said. So, people are willing to believe Mr. Camping's complex manipulations of the scripture and ignore the clear teaching of Matthew. I understand Christians' desire for the return of Christ, but that has been the case for over 2000 years. Now I read that Mr. Camping is asking people to leave their churches. Poor sools that follow after this deceived man.

A person thought Oct 2005 was the end and it did not happen.

Amen.\\"The Church Age, \\"The New Covenant,\\" will have no end. So, lets do what we can to make a differance in our world instead of sitting back based upon a prediction that will never be...let the Bible be your guide not a man's interpretation of it.As Dr. Loraine Boettner once said:\\"...when a prophecy or promise has been fulfilled once, there is no valid reason why it must be fulfilled again, or repeatedly.\\"And today as you know it in the churches they think the end of the age was talking about the church age but the real age it spoke about was of the Old Covenant, called Judism, which Hebrews shares was slowly fading away and would soon be no more. Just like David and Saul lived during the same time and were both kings, it was Saul who still was reigning until he pasted away and then from there on David was king so it was with the old and new covenant, side by side they were but once the old pasted away the new was fully known so it is not the church age which will end and the church is not a building either for the church is the body of Christ and each one of us in Christ are of that body...the true church.http://www.audiowebman.org &lt;&lt;&lt; over 100 plus audios added weekly to help you get back into the Bible and begin reading it for what it says not for what someone thinks what it says...remember \\"AUDIANCE RELIVANCE.\\""},{"Title":"1994?","review":"It seems retired engineer Camping was only too eager to join the parade of failed religious prophets before him in this amusing slice of millenial madness. It stands alongside other classics like &quot;666 : The Final Warning&quot; by Gary Blevins and &quot;Gorbachev! Has the Real Antichrist Come?&quot; by Robert Faid as an incredulous and unintentionally hilarious record of the religious fringe in the early 1990's.Some may be put off by the fact that the central tenet of Camping's book is a completely failed prophecy. But don't let that stir you from your beliefs! Just because Camping was totally wrong on every one of his predictions doesn't mean he is a total failure. Apparently not for some people, since many evangelists are still recycling the tired arguments from this and Campings subsequent book published in 1993. The need to believe knows no bounds in some circles, it appears.A good prophet never misses a beat, and Camping still churns out his radio show, rarely acknowledging his brief trip into the world of failed prophets.

The author is Harold Camping, president and general manager of Family Radio (also known as Family Stations).The basis of this book is secular. The book hinges on what the author describes as \\"the timeline\\" or the \\"biblical\\" calendar of history.If you use the Bible only, then you can NOT validate the \\"biblical\\" calendar of history. Some people say \\"if you start with 931 B.C....\\", but how would you know that year if you used the Bible only? You wouldn't. Yet it is so natural to think this way.The Gregorian calendar is not biblical; no man-made calendar is biblical. If you add the Gregorian calendar to the Bible (even just a little bit...just one tiny date), then you are in violation of Revelation 22:18. It really is that simple. There are no B.C. or A.D. dates in the Bible; nor can you arrive at such dates without ADDING something to the Bible.We are seeing one of the dangers of adding to God's Word. How can anyone deny the many proofs and coincidences? What really happens when we add to God's Word...even when we think it is justified? Perhaps \\"miraculous\\" things happen...things that would lead us to believe that what we have done is the right thing.\\"1994?\\" was preceded by \\"Adam When?\\" and \\"The Biblical Calendar of History\\" and \\"The Perfect Harmony of the Numbers of the Hebrew Kings\\", and several other books written by Harold Camping. The foundation of \\"1994?\\" includes the books mentioned above. If you read these books, you will notice that many non-biblical sources were used to write them.This author writes books incrementally, and then he writes later books that are based on his prior books. The result is a cascade of lies and deception that is not fully realized by the reader until his final books. One of his later books is calledTime Has an End: A Biblical History of the World 11,013 B.C. - 2011 A.D.. In this book, the author aggressively and emphatically taught that Christ would return and Judgment Day would begin on May 21, 2011; and that the end of the world would occur on October 21, 2011. He continued to teach these lies even after May 21, 2011.Do not get trapped into reading this author's earlier books. He uses his earlier books as his basis for later books like \\"Time Has An End\\". His logic and reasoning and analytical approach to studying the Bible has led many people astray.When we add to God's Word, terrible things happen.When we take away from God's Word, terrible things happen.When we mix the understanding of mankind with the Holy Scriptures, terrible things happen.Some people elevate the \\"biblical\\" calendar of history to the same level as the Bible itself. The calendar has become their idol. Without the calendar, the Bible loses much of its meaning. Almost every teaching from these folks features a date as its focus...either justifying May 21, or supporting October 21. It seems that without a date, a \\"study\\" is incomplete.Other people who are considered \\"teachers\\" of this doctrine include Anthony Hernandez, Bill Thornton, Bob Bradshaw, Charles Miller, Chris McCann (Christopher J McCann), Dantes Joseph, Darrell Lockridge, Eddie Ramos (Edwin L Ramos), Ernst Gunther von Harringa Sr., Gary Higgs, Guy Berry, James Rachell Sr., John Robert Carman, John McOwen, Kevin Brown, Marty Cattuzzo, Robert Fitzpatrick, Ron Exum, Tom Evans, Tom Holt.\\"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.\\" (1 Corinthians 10:14)\\"Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!\\" (Ezekiel 13:3)\\"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.\\" (2 Corinthians 11:3)\\"That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;\\" (Ephesians 4:14)\\"And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not: For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.\\" (Mark 13:21-22)"},{"Title":"1994?","review":"As a listener of Harold Camping for many years, I was stunned when I first heard about this book in 1993. I went out and bought a copy.Mr Harold Camping never said that 1994? was the absolute date for Christ's return. However, he does present an interesting case for this possiblity. Obviously, he was wrong but that misses the point. He does make a successful case of how close we are and I don't think any true Christian can deny it.If you can find a copy, take a look. It's worth the read because you will learn tons about the end of time question plus Harold Camping reveals how it was possible for a biblical scholar to calculate the birth of Christ using Old Testament scriptures. He tries to extend the same method to forecast the return of Christ in 1994. It is amazing how many paths and suggestions the Bible reveals for 1994. Surely, 1994 must've been an important year.The book is typical Camping in that he does an excellent job of research and presents to the reader a clear, concise, biblical explanation.Excellent book and very much recommended for Christians and Non Christians."},{"Title":"Vampire State Building","review":"With stunning regularity, the like of which I could have never have hoped to predict, I (as a children's librarian in New York City) have been approached more times than I'd care to recall by eight-year-old girls desperately wanting good vampire fiction. I kid you not. And, to be perfectly frank, this is a segment of the population showing a great need but without anything to fill that void. Oh sure, I can recommend James Howe's, \\"Bunnicula\\" until the cows come home, but vampire rabbits aren't what the ladies look for. And at eight I'm loathe to lower myself by mentioning Anne Rice's name. Thank goodness we've Elizabeth Levy instead. Now I'm not going to say that, \\"Vampire State Building\\" is the greatest book ever written. Quite frankly, it's repetitive and not particularly well thought out at times. Just the same, though it obviously owes quite a bit to the aforementioned James Howe, the book is an amusing mystery for young readers that have just grown comfortable reading chapter books on their own, but still need the occasional picture and potentially spooky premise to help them along.The perils of online chatrooms are no stranger to anyone. But who would've thought that chess-loving Robert would've come into direct contact with a vampire because of it? At least that's what Robert's little brother Sam and cousin Mabel think has occurred. Vlad Clinciu is a Romanian chess wiz, and over the last few months he's been enjoying playing (and mostly beating) Robert. When a huge chess tournament is announced in New York, Robert discovers that Vlad's coming to visit. But why is it that Vlad has such pointy incisors? Why does he avoid garlic bagels? And what's the gigantic secret he's been hiding from Robert all this time? By the time the tournament is over, it's clear that there may be more to sweet Vlad than anyone really suspected.The book is a step up from such similar kids-in-a-mystery-having-fun series like \\"The Magic Schoolhouse\\" or the \\"Droon\\" chronicles. Levy's writing, while not about to blow anyone away with its wit and wisdom, has enough jolts of cleverness to get one's attention. For example, when Robert shows Vlad his living breathing gerbil and his once living and now stuff gerbil, their names are Terminator and Exterminator. You can guess which is which. The plot is interesting without ever becoming scary. And I was intrigued by the relationships between the characters. Sadly, the girls in this book don't break out of the broadest of stereotypical devices (shopping seems to be their number one concern). Otherwise, all is well.If a child runs up to you and insists on a vampire title, I still think \\"Bunnicula\\" is the way to go. But if they've already read through all the vampire bunny tales in the world, kindly switch their attention to Elizabeth Levy's Sam and Robert Bamford series. It has the added benefit of (if they live in New York and like their home town) a whole heaping helpful of pro-NYC information. A fun title. Not deep. But fun."},{"Title":"Vampire State Building","review":"I read VAMPIRE STATE BUILDING.I thought it was a really good book because it has chess in it.It is about a kid named Sam and he plays chess on the internet with a boy named Vlad , who lives in Romania.

Dan Mckeag is shot and left for dead. His wife is murdered and his nephew has to hide out in the mountains in order to stay alive. With the help of a crooked judge, Dan's land has been deeded over to Prager. However, for Prager, the hard times have just begun. Not fully recovered, and against the advice of his friends, Dan McKeag and his brother-in-law, Paddy, set out to make things right. Sure, he knows that vengeance belongs to the Lord, but McKeag figures that, this time, the Lord could use a little help. And he plans on meting out the justice before the man upstairs has time to object. Mr. Martin's superb style of writing has no equal. Like a runaway locomotive going downhill, the action in McKeag's Mountain increases until it crescendoes into an explosive conclusion that will just about leave you breathless. If the ending of this book does not satisfy your hunger for justice, you are on the wrong side of the fence."},{"Title":"McKeag's Mountain","review":"This is a very enjoyable western. McKeag is a wonderful 'hero' who loves his wife and his ranch and will not sell out to his threating neihgbor, Bert Praeger. The dialogue is excellent and it's very intense when Dan McKeag's wife and hands are killed and his ranch burned down........and he's shot and left for dead. Fortunately he's taken in and hidden until he recovers somewhat and the rest of the book is dan's revengful search for the 7 murderers and his attempt to get his ranch back from praeger who claimed it as his. His sidekick in the search,Paddy, is none other than his wife's brother who hasn't spoken to him since dan married his sister without his consent. Much action and graphic violence. For those looking for a love story, this isn't it. Not one love scene to be found. As a devout fan and reader of Mr. Martin's wife Kat Martin, I also saw her hand in some of the character development. Too bad he didn't let her add some romance..............."},{"Title":"Key Debates in Anthropology","review":"What is anthropology? What is society, culture, language - and how are they related?In this volume, edited by the intrepid Tim Ingold, we find these issues and others debated by some of the leading anthropologists in Britain. The fact that the format is a debate, and not merely the prosaic monologue of one author after another that one usually finds in an edited volume, means that the book engages the reader on a direct level, and that the volume inevitably raises more questions than it answers - and that is as it should be.The debates are: 1. Social Anthropology is a Generalizing Science or it is Nothing. (Participants: Keith Hart and Anthony Good for, Anthony Cohen and Judith Okely against). 2. The Concept of Society is Theoretically Obsolete (Marilyn Strathern and Christina Toren for, J D Y Peel and Jonathan Spencer against). 3. Human Worlds are Culturally Constructed (Wendy James and Roland Littlewood for, Tim Ingold and Paul Richards against). 4. Language is the Essence of Culture (David Parkin and Brian Moeran for, Alfred Gell and James Weiner against). 5. The Past Is a Foreign Country (David Lowenthal and Penelope Harvey for, Gillian Feeley-Harnik and Susanne Kuchler against). 6. Aesthetics is a cross-cultural Category (Howard Morphy and Jeremy Coote for, Joanna Overing and Peter Gow against).In each case, an concise and interesting introduction is provided by Tim Ingold.As the topics show, these are indeed 'key' debates. The debaters take into account the recent scholarship on their topics both within and outside anthropology, making the debates interesting for non-anthropologists as well.I would recommend this book most highly to all students of anthropology, interested laypersons, or those involved in sociology, linguistics, and religious and cultural studies."},{"Title":"Passing the baton: Church planting that empowers","review":"Tom Steffon does an excellent job at laying out a model for planting self-sufficient churches. His model is complete and easy to understand. Steffon provides five stages a new plant goes through from pre-evangelism, to phase-out."},{"Title":"Passing the baton: Church planting that empowers","review":"This is a good read for anyone interested in church planting strategy. Obviously this includes church planters themselves, but it may also include sending Christians who want to learn more about mission strategy. Unfortunately, there are missionaries that do not allow future potential leaders to develop into leaders. This book stresses the importance of developing Christians that will be able to lead. Missionaries need to train and develop Christians in a way that allows them to be trusted with ministry.This book does an excellent job of showing a very obvious fact about missions- planning is good. We obviously need to be dependent upon God for everything in our lives- but this doesn't mean that we wander aimlessly in our mission work with no planning or strategy (based on a Biblical worldview of course). Another excellent point that is continually covered in the book is the danger of paternalism. Never will believers or churches mature if they are never trusted to live their own Christian lives and minister on their own. A good church planter will recognize and apply this.This is an excellent book and I don't want the following two criticisms to override the review of this book. But here are two areas that I found negative about the book. FIRST, a term that the author employs frequently in his book is \`phase-out.' The relay-race is used in the book (and the title) to illustrate \`phase-out.' While I personally believe that it is an important goal to develop leaders that can lead churches, I also believe that this emphasis can be detrimental if taken too far. In our efforts to \`phase out' of a location, missionaries can actually communicate to the target people that they do not belong to the universal body of Christ. We work so hard at making them a \`three selfs, phased-out church' that we forget that they are brothers and sisters in Christ. Love and Scripture-based living need to take precedence over planting a \`textbook' church. SECOND, there is a lack of Scripture in this book. There is a small section in the second chapter entitled \`The New Testament Perspective,' but it hardly comes to any convincing conclusions. I would have appreciated more of the author's strategies and ideas based on Scripture."},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach: Workbook Three, Tackling the Text (Career Development Series)","review":"Actors and students everywhere: put down the imaginary coffee cup and GO somewhere TODAY and learn the Meisner Technique.

I know of no finer book on acting, and I have read a lot of them. It is the clearest, the most step by step, and the most inspirational book on true acting that has ever been written. This also holds for the other three books in his series. Did reading his book make me a better actor over night? Of course not. And Larry Silverberg never said that it would. Let me repeat that - he never said that it would! So what did it do? It opened a path that I could begin to follow - a long and very difficult path, but a wonderous and life changing journey. It showed me where my training was lacking, and what real actor training could be. It inspired me and gave me a map to use to begin exploring with fellow actors the craft of acting. And it lead me to seek out new teachers. I am a better actor because of this book.I have used Larry Silverber's books in many university acting and directing classes. When I started using his first volume, teaching became fun and exciting again. I have seen his approach work with so many students, and it is miraculous.

Like many, I believe you need to study acting in a class to learn the craft, but these series of books are a rare exception. Not only do they teach the technique using a step by step process which allows the actor to really understand what s/he is doing, but they reveal the essence of the Meisner approach which is to specify a role until it has ULTIMATE MEANING for YOU!Also, if you didn't know by now from reading the other reviews,\\"Meisner gave Larry and Smith & Kraus\\" written permission to publish these books."},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach: Workbook Three, Tackling the Text (Career Development Series)","review":"I have personally worked with Larry Silverberg, and before that used his books both to learn and teach the Meisner Technique.

The story revolves around Michael Henchard who, under the influence of alcohol, sold his wife and child. This is enough to demonstrate that one mistake can lead to a life of utter misery. Although Henchard thrives and becomes mayor, his past comes to haunt him when his wife returns. Hardy's description of Henchard's downfall is unrealistic. However, what I found most unconvincing was the manner in which Donald Farfrae completely replaced him.

Hardy came after Dickens and before James, and his style intrigues as you connect parts of it to the former, parts to the latter.His plotting is sort of Dickens \\"lite.\\" There are mysterious benefactors, sudden tragic deaths, reversals of fortune, paternity mysteries, ect. His prose is cleaner and easier to read than both Dickens and James; \\"Casterbridge\\" scans better than \\"Bleak House\\" or \\"The Wings of the Dove.\\"The story begins when a pastoral laborer, in a drunken rage, sells his wife and child one evening (I hate it when that happens...). When he wakes the next morning, abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The novel truly begins eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, we witness the fall of the now Mayor of Casterbridge, brought about by his own character flaws and the interventions of fate.Henchard, the main character, is a facinating combination of hot-spirited volition and turn-on-a-dime repentance. He is quick to do things which damn him but just as quick to admit his guilt. He is a wonderful character and a precursor to the later \\"psychological\\" novels of James and Forster. The satellite characters remind one of Dickens, but they are not nearly as startling and interesting, but of course, a character such as Henchard never existed in all of Dickens.The novel proceeds to its forgone conclusion inexorably, albiet with a few melodromatic touches, yet it sustains its tone and readibility due mostly to Henchard, and the dramatic situations Hardy puts him through.Well worth a look."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Since I have decided to dedicate part of my time spent reading in 2003 to the classics, I started first with The Mayor of Casterbridge, not the most famous of Hardy's works but seemingly a good place to start. I will definitely read the other works by this author since I was so captivated by this book.The novel begins with the sale of Michael Henchard's wife and child to the highest bidder at a local summer fair. Henchard is drunk and his wife, tired of his habits, decides to leave with the sailor who bids on her and her daughter. Henchard wakes up the next morning, somewhat remorseful for what he has done and vows not to drink for twenty-one years.The very next chapter picks up the story nineteen years later, with the return of the wife and child into Henchard's life. Henchard is now quite wealthy and is such an important man in his community, he is now Mayor of Casterbridge. From here, a series of wrong decisions and misunderstandings lead to the devastating conclusion.Hardy is well known for his tendency towards gloomy endings and this book certainly fits the mold. But he is also well known for his lyrical descriptions of the English countryside and describing a way of life which had disappeared even in his own time. There were beautiful passages about the hay carts being driven through town, loaded so high that people on the second floor of homes could reach out and touch the top of the hay. Small details abound, describing the sound of rain on trees and the smell of the local foods. But perhaps the most significant aspect of the novel for me was the feeling that Henchard had wished for everything that had happened to him, and all of his wishes came true, and thus ultimately his downfall. These wishes were almost all made in a rash moment, when perhaps a minute or more of reflection could have produced a clearer head. Yet Henchard lives by his instincts, since for almost twenty years they seemed to serve him well.I would recommend this book to any serious literature lover and I believe it serves as a good introduction to his other works. His books serve as a bridge from Victorian literature to modern literature, with no happy endings guaranteed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"At first I was forced to read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in school more than 12 years ago. Reading it slowly made an impact on my life. This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I'm re-reading this book that thrilled me years ago and thrills me today. Now, however, I realize just how &quot;modern&quot; it is, even more so than the works of Dickens, whom I also revere, but whose writing had a quaint quality that actually makes him the lesser artist, in my opinion. Hardy's writing is spare but nothing is left out. You feel it, you taste it, you live it. It has the firm, sure quality of a minimalist work of art, and yet the twists and turns of its plot are dizzying. I detect its influence on novelist Toni Morrison, I might add. I'd be willing to bet she's a Hardy scholar. I read many passages, many scenes, that reminded me of her &quot;folksy&quot; conceits. And I was amazed at Hardy's contemporary understanding of addiction, in this case alcoholism. In fact, Henchard is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot; He abstains from liquor for 21 years, but his character defects and lack of spiritual awareness catapault him right back into his disease when he begins drinking again. In fact, his life spirals out of control faster and faster with his first return to drink, showing that alcoholism, like all addictions, is a progressive disease. A reviewer here said the book was depressing, and that Hardy is dark. However, the &quot;light&quot; in Hardy comes with his wisdom, not unlike Faulkner's, of human nature. There are so many themes of the enduring truths that one is uplifted just by the reading. Sometimes I mourn for the writers I will never meet, the ones who have passed on. Their teaching is so important to my own spiritual and artistic growth, that I have experienced a great love from them and for them. Hardy is one of those for me. Wherever he dwells now, I send him my appreciation."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"When Thomas Hardy penned The Mayor of Casterbridge, he brought to life a very authentic character in Michael Henchard. He is possibly the perfect tragic character. The only other character I can think of to compare him to as I struggle to describe him and the story - for he is so much the story - is King Lear. But where Lear was a King who was foolish, Michael is the common man, a simple hay trusser, with several character flaws ... most notably shortsightedness and a desire to \\"be on top\\". He at no point feels something that most people don't but where we restrain our first rash and selfish actions (most of the time), he goes full out until he has cost himself everything and too late finds redemption. His flaw is insidious and all too common, so we relate easily even through his most outrageous misadventures.In a fit of drunken despondency, feeling that he is being pulled down by the responsibility of being a twenty-one year old husband and father, he jests that he would gladly part with his wife and daughter for the sum of five pounds. After having sworn this so vehemently for the entire evening, he has little recourse when someone takes him up on it and his wife, in shame and anger, agrees to go with the purchaser, taking their daughter with her. When sobriety brings full realization, it also brings a vow of temperance from Michael who in the following fifteen years builds himself up to a position respectability and public admiration in the nearby town of Casterbridge.Though he seems to have learned his lesson, we are only on chapter two and his story is just beginning as his wife and child return and his friendship with a trusted friend and critical advisor becomes a bitter rivalry. Time and again he demands allegiance when he need only ask it and return it in kind.Hardy's writing style is direct and straight-forward with no flourishes like you might find with Dickens or Twain. He has a story to tell and he tells it - no swashbuckling adventures like DeFoe or Dumas. However you feel about that, the character of Michael Henchard continues to skulk around in my head. He represents to me a very real possibility of personal failure and haunts my mind now just as Scrooge's deceased partner haunted him in A Christmas Carol. I would have given this book a fun factor of three stars when I first read it. Now I give it five stars because I have had the time to realize what a masterful job Hardy did when he created Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Having thoroughly detested Tess of the d'Urbervilles for its overload of melodrama and odious characters, I was hesitant to It often seems that to be considered a classic, a work must be both lengthy and tragic. Mayor is indeed a tragedy, but unlike start on another novel by Hardy. It was then a happy surprise to find that The Mayor of Casterbridge, though less famous than Tess, is an infinitely more enjoyable work.Tess, it succeeds in drawing sympathy from the reader. Thomas Hardy's irony is also much in evidence, and he comes across as quite witty. The result is a concise and interesting mixture of humor and tragedy in which characters are reasonably likable. Henchard is impetuous and comes to his end almost entirely through his own actions, but his actions are always motivated by realistic emotions and there is nothing overblown or melodramatic about his downfall. Because he is so human and flawed, it is far easier to feel sorry for him than it was for Tess, Hardy's embodiment of the perfect woman.There are, of course, elements in Hardy's style that do not change from novel to novel. His writing remains very Victorian and therefore rather ornate and longwinded. Nor is the melodrama absent from Mayor-- events often take on such an absurd turn that the reader is left momentarily with the impression of a soap opera. The plot relies heavily on coincidences, reminiscent somewhat of Dickens, and things work out so neatly and implausibly that incredulity must be firmly restrained.It is worth it, though. Beneath the superficial plot lie careful writing and hidden parallels. The elaborate Biblical Saul and David parallel with Henchard and Farfrae throughout emphasizes the unchangeability of human nature (the love/hate relationship between Henchard and Farfrae) and the cyclical rise and fall from power. Hardy also uses limited third person narration that allows the reader to know the characters and events only through their actions and conversations, further evidence of a meticulously constructed novel. In a refreshing change, Mayor moves along quickly with virtually no extraneous events.The Mayor of Casterbridge is an unusual book, and one that can be understood on multiple levels. On one, it is the simple story of the fall of a proud man; on another, it is a retold Biblical story, updated but not deprived of its original power. And though I never thought to say this about Hardy's novels, The Mayor of Casterbridge also does pretty well as entertainment...Ailanna"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The first book I read out of Thomas Hardy's many works was \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" back in my secondary school days. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. Reading \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" only confirmed that my liking for Hardy's works was not misplaced. The Mayor of Casterbridge is absolutely brilliant as the author uses his perceptive insights into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalities. For example, Henchard is an alcoholic who suffers from many of the accompanying afflictions that include low self-esteem, shame, guilt, self-castigation, self-punishment, loneliness, a death wish, and a tendency to depression.The book starts in the first chapter with a dramatic masterpiece that perfectly sets the tone and theme for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work. They go to a country fair where Henchard, an alcoholic, gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Once Henchard sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family. Abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The story unravels nineteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, Henchard who was now the Mayor of Casterbridge falls from grace, this being a result of his own character flaws and the hand of fate.I enjoy reading Hardy's impressive prose, which is strong, sharp and descriptive. The various scenes the author describes are filled with vivid and compelling imagery that leave one wanting to read more and more. Thomas Hardy is especially adept at describing the environment which he has a deep seated love for. The ironic twists of fate provide a setting that demonstrates the brilliant writer that Hardy is where he expertly weaves a plot that shows the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice. That makes The Mayor of Casterbridge very pleasant to read despite the sad story.For those who wish to study English Literature, The Mayor of Casterbridge is on the top of the recommended list. The book provides exceptional descriptions of England and its culture as well as exposing the student to themes of profound gravity and importance. The book provides clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy. It is well-written, is easy-to-understand and to follow."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Having never read Hardy before, I picked this book at random off a list provided by my Western Civilization teacher. I can't help but attribute my choice to destiny; this is quite possibly the best book I've ever read, written by the single greatest English author in history. While some other reviewers have classified his descriptive passages as somewhat dull, I thought they were rather intoxicating; I don't know how one could not enjoy the superbly vivid style Hardy employs. It's impossible to really describe his writing to one who hasn't read it.The plot in Mayor of Casterbridge is compelling throughout. I read somewhere that the book was originally published a few chapters at a time in a literary magazine, and this is quite evident, as every many sections seem individually complete with rising action, climax, resolution, etc. Hardy still manages to integrate these individual sections without flaw and create a wonderful composition of the life of Henchard. As everyone else has testified, the conclusion of the book is moving beyond description- without a doubt the most affective book I've ever read. Be forewarned: this is a book that will surely leave the reader in a depressed and brooding state. Going by Kafka's standard, that a book should be &quot;like a suicide... an axe for the frozen sea within us&quot;, The Mayor of Casterbridge is surely one of just a handful of the great books in English literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I can understand the polarity of opinion about this book.

It has a \\"heavy\\" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic).

Foreseeing its approach, I would want to put the whole novel aside, but morbid fascination led me to continue reading. That's the way it is with thrillers.

The Mayor of Casterbridge is widely considered to be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel. It is a classic tale of the spiral and eventual demise of an essentially bad man. The story is rich with personal intrigue... sins, lies, cover-ups, love triangles, secret identities and so on... making it a continual pleasure to read. The regional dialect (spelled phonetically throughout) can be a bit cumbersome to wade through at times, though it certainly lends atmosphere to the novel.The characters are interesting and easy to relate to and Hardy did an admirable job of making most of them distinctly human: Michael Henchard is \\"bad\\" (as evidenced by the sale of his wife and child in the opening scene) but is also carefully drawn as essentially flawed and insecure, rather than a flat parody of evil. Donald Farfrae, who is as good as Henchard is bad, is also flawed in his own ways which adds depth to his character too. Hardy was obviously better at creating men than women because the women are a little more \\"Victorian stereotypical\\": the good ones are pictures of chaste virtue who can actually take ill and die over a nasty shock (puh-lease) and the bad ones are fat hags in bawdy houses. The women are certainly less interesting than the men in this book.The plot is nearly impossible to adequately discuss without writing a book of my own. After the initial unforgivable act, the book fast-forwards 19 years and we soon learn that the previously down-on-his-luck Henchard has made a success of himself in the rural town of Casterbridge, where he is a wealthy merchant and mayor of the town. At the same time that he takes on a quick and capable apprentice (Farfae), his wife and daughter reappear in his life. Farfrae proves to be better at Henchard's business than Henchard is, Henchard has to abandon another woman in favor of doing right by his wife and the daughter's paternity is quickly called into question. Intrigue, twists, turns and surprises ensue. And all the while, Henchard's selfishness, quick temper and poor-decision making contrive to bring about his eventual fall. It all makes for a very satisfying read... not as satisfying as say, reading about the Count of Monte Cristo dealing out his brand of justice... but it is interesting to see how things unravel for Henchard nonetheless.The Bottom Line: a very entertaining and complex story from the Victorian era. Worth a read whether you're plowing through the 1001 Books list or not.This review originally appeared on my blog. See my profile for details."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"\\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" captures a lot of what makes Thomas Hardy resonate with people today: hard existential truths playing out amid pastoral splendor; naturalistic descriptions of fantastic events; an agnostic worldview that centers around a sense of Christian guilt and loss. The countercurrents create a lot of creative tension.But what makes \\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" so powerful more than a century after its 1886 publication is its multifaceted, emotionally conflicted depiction of the central character. Like King Lear and Ibsen's Solness the Master Builder, Hardy's Michael Henchard has no one but himself to blame for most of the misery that befalls him. Still he compels sympathy and a growing sense of investment from the reader.We meet him, in one of the all-time great openings of noveldom, selling off his timid wife and child in a fit of rum-tinged pique. He regrets this almost immediately, but fails to relocate them. Instead, he swears off liquor and remakes himself years later as a prosperous leader in a town he chances upon in his travels, Casterbridge.Alas the dark spikes of his id are never far from the surface, especially after his wife and her daughter come to Casterbridge. \\"Though under a long reign of self-control he had become Mayor and churchwarden and whatnot, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the rind of Michael Henchard as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair,\\" Hardy writes.Henchard is a portrait in grayscale, nothing too black or white. In one scene, Hardy shows him mercilessly humiliating a lazy farmhand, then tells us Henchard keeps the farmhand's mother stocked with coal in winter. When the wife returns, Henchard has a romance brewing but puts it aside to do right by the woman he wronged. He's definitely not happy about it, and prone to self-pity and lashing out, but Hardy's intuitive narration keeps you identifying with Henchard, never leading you too far from his point of view.For a character study the story moves fast, even if the prose style is ornate. Hardy's descriptive abilities are on constant display, with scenic rides through the country. There's much local Wessex color (Hardy's own quasi-mythical kingdom, where most of his novels are set) and a chorus of memorable townspeople, like a fellow whose theft of coins from the eyes of a corpse is excused thus: \\"Money is scarce, and throats get dry. Why should death rob life o' four pence?\\"Death is omnipresent in \\"Mayor Of Casterbridge\\", but Hardy justifies the novel's gloomy tone with a memorably powerful, courageously bleak conclusion. \\"Casterbridge's\\" greatness lies at its two ends. In between, the story keeps your interest but keeps hitting the same notes, with some sketchy melodrama and improbable coincidences amid brighter moments. Hardy even gets maudlin with a dead goldfinch metaphor.Most problematic of all is the absence of interest in the main characters beyond Henchard. Except for a jilted lover who forces her way back into Henchard's life with minxish self-possession, they are an entirely boring crew, existing only to be contrasted with Henchard's more forceful personality.\\"Casterbridge\\" may leave you wishing you chose something else to read in a lighter vein, say \\"The Painted Bird\\" or \\"The Bell Jar\\". But it's worth reading for that same emotional toll, a reminder of life's harder truths that may leave you sad but perhaps a bit more conscious of the truth behind the line: \\"There but for the Grace of God go I.\\""},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"In some ways this is a hard book to get into since it is set in a totally different culture from ours -rural England of the mid-nineteenth century. You would think that that is close enough in time to not be a problem. But to me the things like their courtship customs, or what is considered scandalous/honorable behavior, are really at a variance with the way we act today that I found it hard to relate to. Add to this some of the implausible melodrama and coincidences that make up the plot and I almost ended up putting down the book.However I kept reading and in the end I thought it was an excellent story. This is because it illustrated a truth about life that I could empathize with. How a man through pride, anger, stubbornness and alcoholism could end up destroying his relationships with all of the people he is close to and in middle age end up being alienated from everyone who was important to him in his life. Since this story was written there have been millions of guys like Michael Henchard. The details of their lives are different, their endings may have been different. But there is an underlying truth that is the same. That aspect of the story is timeless."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"this is the first book ive read out of thomas hardy's many works, and i thought it was absolutely brilliant. he uses his perceptive insight into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalites.each scene he describes is filled with vivid imagery that leave your senses tingling.i highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a well-written, easy-to-understand classic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I have not read any of Hardy's books before - and chanced upon this one, and found no regrets. Once I developed a comfort zone in his type of writing, I found myself totally engrossed. His literature style is one of grace and flowed easily between each new turn of the plot. Not only was it beautifully done as a character building story, but it was full of surprises, twists and turns you didn't expect. I recommend this book, and intend to continue reading the rest of his writings."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy is a fictional novel teaching many life learned lessons. When a man sells his wife and daughter to a sailor for five guineas, he becomes devastated. Finding a whole new life, he becomes the wealthy mayor of Casterbridge. Not ever thinking he would see his wife and daughter again, the inevitable happens. As the story goes from bad to good and good to worse, various characters explore the realms of fate.The work of Hardy allows his readers to have a better understanding of the world. Many people today are nave of the terrible things happening all around them. The exaggerated situations, such as a woman dieing because of embarrassment, allow readers to have a new perspective of life. A realization is created that everyone has two sides to them; good and bad. Whether it is a lie or the truth, people affect the lives of others.What if one secret could ruin the lives of many others? What if one secret could ruin the life of one? As lies and secrets lead to the downfall of many characters, life is taken advantage of and hearts are broken. When evil seems to take control, it is learned that no one can control the power of destiny. In The Mayor of Casterbridge the truth of life is displayed. The light of the world can not always hide the dark shadows that dwell in everyday life."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I greatly enjoyed The Mayor of Casterbridge, not only for its clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy, but also for its themes. The loss of a wife, mother, daughter, love, husband, father and mentor are all carried off extremely well. I chose to read this book for a project I'm doing in my English class and although it was not my first choice, I do recommend it to anyone who loves English literature. I'm a big fan of Dickens and Hardy and truly loved this magnificent piece of work."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge isn't really about a man who sells his wife and daughter. Yes, that is part of it, but 80% of the story has little to do with that fact. In actuality, it is about relationships, and the choices we make that can have an impact on those we love. The story twists and turns, and weaves several different characters' stories into one neat ending, but can be predictable at times.I personally enjoyed the book, but it can be slow and predictable at times, as I already mentioned."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I chose this book because I had never read any Thomas Hardy.

It was delivered quickly, and came in great condition. The pages seem a little thinner than would appear in a \\"better quality\\" books, but other then that, it's a great book for a great price. The story is fantastic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The book came in perfected condition as it said on the review of this book. It came just in time."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"About two thirds through this undeniably great work, I began to question everything I thought I knew about this book. Kicking off in high drama and then barrelling on in that fashion with not even a stop for air, the twists and turns in Hardy's tale of morality, regret, and character seemed to occur due to the faults and failures of the principal actors, and not thanks to any plot contrivances on the part of Hardy. Which ever the case, this is a great testament to Hardy's writing abilities, but as the story progressed, the idea that Hardy was pushing the limits of \\"fate\\" and \\"tragedy\\" to its extreme seeped in. By the time I finished the book and sat puzzled over the complete change in tone for the last two paragraphs, I realized that Hardy had written one of the greatest pieces of satirical tragedy ever.Based on an actual inicident Hardy read about in a local newspaper, a husband, travelling on the road with his family, gets drunk and auctions off his wife to the highest bidder. After being offered a considerable amount of money, the wife is sold and she willingly leaves with the highest bidder, daughter in tow, as the drunken husband stays behinds and drinks.End first scene, cut to 18 years later. The man has become a teetotaler and has so righted his life, he has become the Mayor of Casterbridge. The wife enters the town, beautiful now older daughter in tow, looking for her former husband now that her husband-by-auction has died. They meet, work out a plan to remarry, and set about doing that.We then discover that the Mayor is already engaged to another woman. We discover that one of the Mayor's enemies is interested in wooing his daughter. We discover that the girl he believes is his daughter- has been told is his daughter!- is not actually his daughter. Discovery after discovery rain down upon us, each one forcing the characters to react in ways that while always consistent with their characters, creates further drama and eventually, tragedy.Hardy is an incredible author and even if this was nothing more than a tale about character and ethics, it would be an incredible read. When viewed as a satire of such tales, however- like an updated Job story without the God aspect, with the Mayor being Job- the work rises to another level. Hardy is funny, and even in the context of obviously serious works, there are occasional lighthearted moments. But once one grasps this complex work as a satire of similar works, Hardy verges on being hysterical. The Mayor of Casterbridge is a living character with obvious faults, but the heap of abuse that Hardy piles upon him in no way corresponds with his initital heinous act. Unless, of course, you're trying to be funny.Regardless of whether this is meant to be taken seriously or not, it is an underrated (as far as Hardy books go) classic.(And those last two paragraphs I alluded to above: their tone, syntax, vocabulary all sound like they come from a different book. To me, it sounded like Hardy was having one last laugh, foolishly trying to validate all the tragedy that occurred with two \\"intellectual\\" sounding paragraphs. One last bone to throw to those so absorbed in morality tales that they couldn't see that this whole journey was a farce.)"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Fast delivery and was able to enjoy with my daughter on a cross country trip. It came just as I thought."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Nineteenth century literary classic, details a man seeling his wife and daughter and the long term consequence. It's a pretty powerful and deeply ambitious story, one that makes up for a couple feeble plot stimulators with a powerful psychological representation. What's most interesting is the protagonist, the titular individual. A man so committed to drunk and evasion that he will sell off his own family. Also a man that works across the rest of the novel to redeem himself from this moment, but not without much backsliding and fresh egotistical mistakes. He's also capable enough to claw his way up into a position of wealth and authority, but then later lose that fortune, and the book is quite effective in showing the degree to which his admuirable qualities are tied in with his core defects. He's far from a monster, and for all the damage his pride and spiteful rejection cause to other lives there is much to admire about him, his strength of character, his general optimism and the way he's able to come forth with strong ethical choice at the most surprising moments. He's an intriguing, complex and overall plausible character, most notably in the way that none of his grand transcendetal moments lack, the way he continually reverts back partially to his earlier ways.More generally, the work shows an engaging cynicism about the status of class, gender and hypocrisy in contemporary England. There are some very strong critiques in here against Victorian society, to the extent that I'm surprised it attained the popularity it did in its own time, and these are always coonected to an engaging novel. It makes me a lot more interested in reading the other nineteenth century literary classics I've so far neglected. And more Hardy, of course.Worse than: Crime and Punishment by Fyodor DostoevskyBetter than: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles DickensAlso better than: Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The story of a man who ruins his life by doing the right thing at the wrong time, both in business and in his relationships with his wife, a potential wife, and his stepdaughter.

This shocking event is our introduction to Michael Henchard's tempestuous character.Once sober, Henchard searches high and low for his wife and child, but with no success. He makes a vow in church to abstain from alcohol for the next 21 years, and he keeps that vow.We encounter Henchard two decades later, now a prosperous corn and wheat merchant and the Mayor of Casterbridge.Character is fate. Henchard's nature, violent and remorseful, jealous and generous by turns, will give him no rest in this life. We can't help pitying the man, deeply flawed though he is.The Mayor of Casterbridge is a classic of English literature. It's also a totally gripping story, abounding in reversals, romances and local color. Don't start reading it on a night that you hope to get to bed early!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"In Michael Henchard, Thomas Hardy created a tragic figure of Shakespearean dimension. The opening scene of a drunken Henchard selling off his wife and infant child at a country fair immediately establishes him as a rash and impetuous character. These qualities will return to haunt him and those nearest to him again and again as his fortune rises and falls.Henchard is contrasted with the genial and almost too innocent Scotsman Donald Farfrae who starts as his friend but becomes his rival in almost all things. Farfrae has an easy charm about him that makes him an unwitting competitor that stirs additional dark forces in Henchard as his rashness mixes with a growing envy.The Mayor Of Casterbridge is one of Hardy's great works alongside Tess and Jude The Obscure. Hardy's vision is dark and the relentless sadness in his work may put off some but in the end these characters he created are as strong as tragic figures as those of any writer in the English language.Finally Hardy's descriptions of rural England and the people who inhabit including their dialects of the time are priceless."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"This story STILL haunts me since first reading it in college, 20 years ago.

Everything he has built threatens to unravel when his dying wife shows up, almost-grown daughter in tow, seeking a guardian for her child.

The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere. I wish that I had not wasted some of my life reading this book."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I have recently read this book (not out of choice) and I am at a loss to understand why Hardy wrote this and why anyone would willingly read this for &quot;fun&quot;.

Everything about it seemed boring; the cover, the title, and even the way the pages smelled. It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.Even with a premise as weird as this one, the book's beginning was painful. It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble, \\"Sure...\\"Some people deem this book, \\"Depressing,\\" however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a \\"free-read;\\" But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books, and this one happens to be on the list, then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first, but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be, that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Hardy was a naturalist in whose novels everything goes wrong. Michael Henchard is a drunk who \\"sells\\" his wife Susan and infant daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor. Susan doesn't realize the sale is bogus because she is \\"simple,\\" throws her ring away, and leaves with the sailor. When he sobers up next day, Henchard searches all over for his lost family, and finally enters a church and swears an oath over an enormous bible that he will not drink from his current age of 21 to double that age. Meanwhile, and 18 years later, when the sailor dies, Susan, with Elizabeth, comes looking for Henchard at Casterbridge. He is now a corn merchant and mayor of the town. As a teetotaler, he is described as drinking glass after glass of water at table for a town hearing. Eventually Susan, via Elizabeth-Jane, contacts Henchard and he pens a note suggesting that they meet at the \\"Ring.\\" This last turns out to be a ruined Roman amphitheater or coliseum, a 1500-year-old relic full of ghosts and whose very name symbolizes the dark past. Henchard and Susan agree to remarry, playacting a courtship for public appearances, and to keep the daughter in ignorance that the sailor was not her biological father. After they marry, Henchard and the manager of his business, Farfrae, have a falling out because the latter shows the former up and makes a fool of him, making himself more popular than the mayor. To make matters worse, Elizabeth-Jane falls in love with Farfrae.Frankly, that's as far as I've gotten. I know how it ends for Henchard, but I won't spoil the ending. Hardy is a mean naturalist writer, and has no sympathy for his characters whatsoever. _Casterbridge_ was first published in 1886, when alcoholism was little understood - least of all by people like Hardy who didn't have the disease. It's all too easy for this author to condemn and be judgmental of alcoholic people. I would suggest for an alternative reading Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh_, since O'Neill was himself an alcoholic and could rightfully speak for alcoholics. The subject, no matter in whose hands, is by nature depressing. All my editorializing aside, Thomas Hardy is a great novelist who has earned his place in the canon. His poetry is good, too. _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ is worth pursuing to the end if you're not an alcoholic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"This book was originally written to be printed in newspapers, newspapers were then used to wipe one's posterior.

So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \\"classic\\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \\"Blas&eacute;\\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull.

Although I do not feel it is one of Hardy's finest, it was, never the less, entertaining. It did not seem to achieve the level of pathos, or engender the concern for the main characters that \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" did. There were numbers of similarities between this book and Dickens' \\"Little Dorrit\\", except Hardy appeared to see how many mistaken innuendos, statements never made that could have cleared up false impressions, and misguided moralistic pressures could be fit into one story.

Once you get used to the period of time and the style of writing ~ in old english, of sorts ~ one needs to continue this type. You get so much more out of a book that way.While this book may have been written in the 1800's I must say that the events taking place, the people and their responses doesn't seem to have changed one iota to the way society behaves today. This is a charming story of rags to riches to rags again. A story of humility, starting over, of pride, of desolation and back to humility again. It does have a bit of subtle romance, which keeps the story flowing.Both of the Thomas Hardy's books (Tess of the de'Ubervilles) and this one are wonderful stories and well worth reading.Interestingly it wasn't after I finished reading them that I discovered that these books were considered Young Adult reading. I guess someone rated it this way because it's a pure, non-smuttly book so ubiquitious of today's media.I don't care about the rating I just appreciated Thomas Hardy's contribution of literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Thomas Hardy was never one to refrain from controversey in his writing, as is evidenced by his decision after the negative reviews that \\"Jude the Obscure\\" received to never write novels again but to devote himself entirely to poetry. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" opens with perhaps one of the most unique plot devices in Edwardian/Victorian literature, when Michael Henchard, a young haytrusser becomes drunk at a country fair and sells his wife and daughter to whoever will pay five guineas for them. What follows afterwards, for Michael Henchard, is a life tinged by regret, even as he finds himself prospering in all other manners. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a compelling story of how falsehoods and regrets can overshadow one's life if they are allowed to do so.After selling his wife and daughter, Michael Henchard vows that he will not touch alcohol for twenty-one years and manages to build himself up to the position of a prosperous businessman and mayor in the town of Casterbridge. As he nears the twenty-first year of his oath, his wife Susan returns, finding him in his exalted position, and Henchard knows the only right thing to do is \\"remarry\\" her since they have been legally married all these years, and therefore make it possible for him to claim Elizabeth-Jane as his true daughter, not just step-daughter. Yet life has many secrets for Michael Henchard - some he keeps, like the fact he is engaged to another woman, and one shocking one that his wife keeps from him that will desperately impact his dealings with Elizabeth-Jane. While Henchard has prospered up to this point, a falling-out with his foreman, the Scotsman Donald Farfrae, leads to his eventual downfall in both his private and his public life. As evidenced by the selling of his wife, Henchard allows his quick temper to get the better of him, and he sets his mind on revenge to all those who have wronged him, whether acutal or not. Therefore, he constantly finds himself at odds with Elizabeth-Jane, with Donald Farfrae (whom he would like nothing better than to kill), and with another woman from his past who has upset his life.Michael Henchard is truly a tragic character, for while it may be easy to dislike him for his roughness and his callow actions, he is not entirely an evil man. His fault is that he regrets his actions, just usually too late. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a surprisingly fast-paced read, with a vivid setting and an extremely intriguing character in Elizabeth-Jane. The web that Michael Henchard manages to spin for himself is compelling and familiar, as these characters and their motives transcend beyond the time period captured so effortlessly by Hardy."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"...but without the histrionics.One of the greatest novels ever written. Also one of the most suspenseful and (for those whose palates have not been ruined by trash) one of the most enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Reread this one recently - what a great book. This is my favorite of all Hardy's books. The fascinating part of this novel is the protagonist, because he is such a mix of good and bad. He has good and even heroic impulses and acts, and bad and even evil impulses and acts. The way he manages to sabotage the good things he could get reminds me of Lily in the House of Mirth, although Henchard's sabotage is due to through bad temper and anger and insecurity, while Lily's are due to ambivalence. But the trip downward is quite similar. Basically it ends up being the story of a man's self-destruction. What a crime that Hardy's novels were unpopular when he first wrote them, and the bad reviews discouraged him from writing more! I have them all but wish there were more."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is undoubtedly one of the finest novels of the Victorian Era - quite a tribute given that the period produced a countless number of classics. The conflict between Michael Henchard and Donald Farfrae reflects a clash between tradition and modernity. This dichotomy is perhaps best encapsulated in their contrasting styles of record keeping; Henchard relies entirely on intuition and memory while Farfrae maintains extraordinarily meticulous accounts of all his transactions. Furthermore the struggle between Farfrae and Henchard reflects a conflict of vastly different temperaments. Henchard proves to be of a passionate temperament while Farfrae is rational and levelheaded. For instance, despite his modest means and limited experience, Farfrae boldly ventures into agricultural trading and through a series of shrewd bets manages to unseat Henchard as Casterbridge's preeminent merchant. In order to regain his erstwhile position, Henchard engages in rash and seemingly desperate speculation - in contrast to the prudent risk taking of Farfrae - that ultimately culminates in his ruin.While some AP students have chastised Henchard for his inability to overcome his animalistic nature, the more astute reader realizes that his inveterate character serves to illustrate a basic theme of most Hardy novels - the philosophy of determinism. The rise and fall of Henchard illustrates the unpleasant reality that one's life is subject to forces beyond one's control - in Henchard's case a deeply flawed character - and these forces often overwhelm the power of one's determination and ambition. This doctrine is certainly anathema to 21st century Americans who firmly believe in the concept of free will and a future holding great promise. While constantly lamenting one's ill fate is self-defeating, it would be naive to entirely disregard the power of destiny to shape one's life for worse as powerfully shown in the tragic tale of the Mayor of Casterbridge."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The mayor of casterbridge is a descriptive, sad, but fun to read novel that keeps the reader glued to the seat. In this novel, Tomas Hardy's skill for describing the enviroment is clear, and his characters are vibrant and true to life. I recommend this novel to anyone who is in search of a great read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"This is truly a classic tragedy, and perhaps Hardy's very best. The opening is one of the most memorable I've ever read; Michael Henchard gets drunk and auctions off his family. The tale spins off from there, boldly and without restraint. Though Hardy is a pessimist, he knows how to craft a story of unforgettable characters inspired by all sorts of passions- some taking whatever they can find for themselves, and some giving generously and unconditionally. Wait until you meet and get to know Elizabeth; she is a beautiful human being! I always learn so much from Hardy. I'm grateful that he wrote the novels he did before turning exclusively to poetry. This one in particular is so well done that I don't know how anyone can fail to be impacted and changed by it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"A question about the source of human tragedy lies at the heart of The Mayor of Casterbridge. Characters frequently mention fate and providence as causes for tragedy (and joy), but Hardy offers more subtle and complex explanations for individual tragedy. At times, Hardy seems to indicate that circumstance and timing play a more important role than Providence in shaping the course of human destiny. Can people survive without the aid of luck or providence by pure force of will? Henchard (the Mayor) is a man whose loneliness, egoism, and pride cause him to make bad decisions. His faulty judgement certainly do not help him in his quest for fulfillment, either. Hardy's depiction of an ultimately unknowable universe is achieved partly through his characters' false assignment of meaning to meaningless incidents. Fate, human will, and faulty perceptions are central issues in much of Hardy's writing. Though not as moving and intense as Hardy's masterpiece Tess of the d'Urbervilles, The Mayor is not to be missed. Hardy's complex rendering of Henchard's multi-faceted personality is remarkable. In addition, The Norton Critical Addition provides excellent commentary and background information from noteworthy critics."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"In the novels of Thomas Hardy, tragedy can be an externalized force like Egdon Heath in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE or it can be of the internalized sort, the kind that Michael Henchard brings on himself in THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE. In either case, nature is unforgiving, a quality which is a given in any of Hardy's works. When tragedy is of the latter kind, then the protagonist is not unlike the doomed tragic hero from classical Greek drama wherein he is first seen as a great or simply a good man who suffers from a tragic flaw, the results of which drag him down so that by the end of the action, his state is so miserably pathetic that the reader/audience can do no more than shake their heads in sorrow at his downfall, that in another and less proud man need not have happened at all.Michael Henchard is the post-Victorian man of mixed qualities who like Oedipus, commits a sin and then spends the rest of the book trying to make amends. His sin is maudlin self-pity. He allows his current debased financial position to lead him to drink, all the while blaming his wife and child. At an auction, he offers his family for the sale to the highest bidder. He ignores the warnings from those present that he is courting disaster. An unknown man offers the highest bid and off he goes, taking Henchard's wife and child with him. Hardy takes pains to place Henchard squarely in the middle of this somber farce. Hardy gives no name to the successful bidder nor does he allow the reader to note the wife's actions. She, surprisingly, remains silent, but weeping. Henchard, by contrast, is loud, crude, and obnoxious. He occupies central stage until the next chapter when he sobers up, is filled with remorse, and then tries to set things right. He fails and winds up the leading citizen of Casterbridge. The image of the drunken Henchard and the mayor Henchard are startlingly unlike. The latter is sober, industrious, and respectable, causing the reader to commiserate with him. But the tragedy of Henchard does not lie merely in a series of vain regrets. Just as he seems to undergo permanent rehabilitation of self, his ex-wife shows up again, with a new child from the now dead bidder. Hardy complicates the plot with his usual unwieldy complications. As a result, Henchard plunges again into the depths of despair; this time he shows that his old sins of false pride and egotism have returned with a vengeance. He tries to bankrupt his business partner Farfrae, for reasons purely of jealousy. It becomes progressively more difficult for the reader to maintain the same sympathy that they had earlier. Later, at the novel's close, Henchard is made to wander like a wounded Lear, and this alone partially elevates him back to his previous stature of a tragic figure. He, like Lear, dies repentant. From his death, the audience discovers that the essence of a tragic fall lies not so much in how much sympathy that protagonist garners during that fall but rather in how true to life his fall was. Michael Henchard was neither saint nor reprobate sinner. He was the Victorian Everyman with a mixture of goodness and mean-spiritedness, either of which could emerge under the right circumstances. At his fall, the reader saw that the \\"right\\" circumstances were sufficiently ordinary so that anyone of us might have done the same. This is the essence of the tragedy of THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Read this novel after Far From The Madding Crowd and Return of the Native. It's a very bleak and depressing novel - without the comic flourishes and moments of his earlier work.The story follows Michael Henchard, a hay-trusser, who sells his wife and child for five guineas in an 'auction' during a fit of inebriety. He spends the next 21 years regretting his action, but during that time he does well for himself, becoming mayor of Casterbridge, a rural town. Years later, his wife and daughter reappear. This starts a chain of events that leads to Henchard's fall. He eventually ends up losing everything because of his pride, passion and stubborness. The main character isn't very likeable, but there is something of the tragic about him that commands your attention."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Mayor Henchard was drunk when he sold his wife and child. This instance of reckless cruelty would come to haunt him in his later years. Overall a pious and good man, his downfall was his reluctance to face his past. His will dictated his epitaph.

Traveling by foot with his stoic wife and baby girl, hay-trusser Michael Henchard arrives in Weydon-Priors during its annual fair. Having drunk too much laced furmity he makes an astounding offer to those gathered in the tent: he will auction off the unvalued females to the highest bidder! Fate protects poor Susan and Elizabeth Jane as the only bidder proves a decent sailor named Newsome. The simple-minded woman does not realize that such a contract is not binding, but remains with him--even emigrating to Canada for 18 years--until his reported death at sea.Somewhat sobered the next day Henchard feels deep remorse--to the extent that he enters an empty church and swears abstinence for 21 years in penance. Arriving in the major city of Casterbridge-site of ancient Roman ruins and some lugubrious customs-he works his way up in Society until he becomes a respected grain merchant and eventually the mayor. Though unwed he had a dalliance on the island of Jersey with a local girl named Lucetta, who nursed him through an illness--thus compromising her own reputation.The wheels of fate are grinding away when Susan and Elizabeth Jane-who may not be his daughter after all-arrive in Casterbridge. The latter has been raised in ignorance of the auction and Henchard's role in her life, but her mother is nervous, desiring to appeal to him quietly before deciding her next course of action and residence. On the eve of a big feast in town another newcomer arrives: a young Scotsman named Donald Farfrae, en route to Canada himself. Taking an immediate liking to the smart young fellow, Henchard convinces him to stay on and serve as his manager. Thus Hardy sets in motion the literary mechanism of a complicated plot: two men courting one woman; two women who are attracted to one man and eventually two men claiming to be Elizabeth Jane's father.There is a sense of fatalism in many of Hardy's novels; his characters strive against their destiny (the result of poor choices, as well as untoward coincidences) but they seem compelled to play out their dismal roles. Tragedy perhaps, pathos definitely. Hardy highlights the often unfair role of women in his society, set against a backdrop of snobbery, poverty, a strict class system and an undercurrent of superstition. A bit grim but satisfying for devotees of 19th century British literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, Thomas Hardy's great novel published in 1886, is a classic of English Literature.

If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"One of Hardy's best novels. The characterisation are excellent and the descriptive writing is superb. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" seems to be a moral allegory. In a moment of drunken callousness, young Michael Henchard sells his wife and daughter to a genial sailor. When he awakes from his drunken stupor Henchard sinks deep in regret, and swears not to touch the bottle again for two decades. He searches for his family, and unable to locate them he stumbles into the town of Casterbridge where he develops a successful farming business, becomes mayor and the pillar of the community. Eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter find him the single and temperate Mayor of Casterbridge makes haste in reclaiming his lost family, and it seems it's all well that ends well.At the same time a young dashing Scotsman Donald Farfrae enters Henchard's life, and the Mayor is determined to make Donald his acolyte. It seems that the two have much in common, but Donald proves he is in fact the Mayor's polar opposite. Whereas Michael can be both generous (he pleas with Donald to remain in Casterbridge to work for him) and stingy (he fires Donald after dancing with his daughter Elizabeth-Jane), loving and brutal, brooding and quick to anger, Donald is the model of the proper Christian businessman and husband. Donald understands, forgives, tolerates, and endures all of Michael's impetuous insults and attacks, and he is finally rewarded with Michael's lover, daughter, business, and mayorship.But ultimately Michael Henchard is the protagonist of the novel, and while he is certainly petty, provincial, and proud his fall is both epic and poignant. Michael had eighteen years of quiet prosperity in Casterbridge, but the novel makes no mention of it at all, and Michael must endure one tragedy after another. It seems that Michael's undoing is that he thinks and feels too much. He is quick to anger and proud of mind because he is first to love and steadfast in his loyalty; in comparison, Donald Farfrae seems cold and calculating, slowly and methodically building his reputation at the cost of Michael's. Yes, Michael did fire Donald, but Michael had urgently pleaded with Donald to stay in Casterbridge and given him experience, connections, and a reputation: if Donald had truly been good and loyal he would have left instead of staying to compete with Michael. And then there's Lucetta who was engaged to Michael but eloped with Donald: this one act proved the irreversible destruction of Michael's fortune.If this is a moral allegory, and ostensibly it is nothing but a moral allegory it is not certain what is being said. Should we really aim to be like Donald Farfrae who is cold in his generosity and calculating in his fair-mindedness? And yes there really isn't much to be said for Michael Henchard's pride and anger, but there was also something concretely good and stubbornly noble about the man. He was also capable of reflection, and in the end he sought to do what was good, even if it meant disappearing forever. Look under Donald Farfrae's smooth handsomeness, and you'll discover guile and duplicity. Look under Michael Herndon's rugged vehemence, and you'll discover love and goodness. Michael Herndon has wronged so he seeks to do right. But having never done wrong does Donald Farfrae know the difference between right and wrong?\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" marks a revolution in rural England, as the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution finally begin to set in. Calculating reason and Christian piety seek to overturn the rural tempers and superstitions that have dominated the England countryside for so long, and so Donald Farfrae must inevitably triumph over Michael Herndon. Yes, with Michael Herndon's departure, the world has become a calmer, more reasonable, more enlightened place. But \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" leaves us with a hanging question: are we better for it?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"This was an ok novel.

Never have i read such a wonderful piece of literature. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The notes on the back of my copy of this book describe it as a &quot;Sophoclean&quot; tragedy. This is a very apt description. Like the plays of Sophocles, Hardy's novel proceeds directly from one mistake and misunderstanding to the next with very little padding in between. As a result, the plot can seem unlikely (as several below have commented). It's sad, however, if people reject it for that reason.This novel contains one of the more fascinating characters in literature. Michael Henchard is a man of the &quot;old school&quot; who conducts business on a hand shake and who constantly acts and reacts to the visible world. Despite this, he is often aware of his mistakes after the fact, yet is unable to use this knowledge to avoid future pitfalls.He's contrasted brilliantly with Donald Farfrae, who is a &quot;new man&quot; who trusts in the future. Ironically (and I suspect intentionally) Hardy make Farfrae seem a far shallower man than Henchard. Yet, the &quot;new man&quot; ends up on top.The end of this novel is one of the bitterest in all of literature. Henchard's will being an almost total negation of his existance. What could be more tragic than that for a flawed, but essentially good man?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I loved the irony.

This trivialises it, for it is, to my mind, truly tragic. In a shockingly irresponsible drunken act, protagonist Michael Henchard sells his wife at a local fair. The consequences, stretching over a couple of decades, sweep away both him and other characters.The plot teems with journeys, coincidences, long-lost people showing up, and a strong vein of morality. In typical Hardyesque style, Henchard moves from the height of civic success to bankruptcy and alienation. A quasi-Greek-tragedy air of fate prevails, but Hardy manages to keep suspense alive. Protagonist and antagonist (Farfrae) are pitted against each other on civic and domestic fronts. There is not one Mayor of Casterbridge, but two, and success, failure and rivalry play a large part. There is also competition among the males as lovers, husbands and fathers.This novel gives an insight into civic life, the worthy burgesses of Casterbridge networking in their council-rooms and taverns. But the animal instincts of the wife-sale, the gutter-press viciousness of the locals' \\"skimmity-ride\\", and the proximity of the countryside, where so many Victorian characters wander to survive and to lay bare their feelings, reveal the fragility of civilisation and our urban constructs.Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I read this novel in English class, like most people probably did. It was one of the best assigned to us.Hardy is a gifted author. He writes in a clear style with vivid descriptions that really bring the setting alive, without making the reader (at least this reader) feel inundated with borning, unnecessary detail.The thing that I look for most in a novel, however, is quality characterizeations, and this book had them in spades. Dialogue was used effectively to flesh out characters. These are not stock characters, either. These people have flaws and shades of grey. They seem as though they could be real. I found that I could relate to the characters, and I did empathize with them, even when I didn't agree with their choices. Everyone had clear motivations. The characterization of Henchard shows that Hardy clearly understood the notion of the tragic flaw and the tragic hero/anti hero.Students who have to read this book as part of their English class may find it a bit on the long side. I would urge you to stick with it; once you get through the initial chapters the book will pick up (a commonality that all British classics seem to share). The book is easy to follow and understand. It is a key novel that marks the shift from Romantic Age to the Victorian Age, so it's an important read for anyone who has a serious interest in English Literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for.As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones, lacking even Hardy's Preface, though it has a bibliography. The dedicated will want something more extensive, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Michael Henchard, a down-on-his-luck, unemployed hay trusser, succumbs to the siren call of alcohol at a country fair. Subconsciously feeling his wife, Susan, is holding him back from success in this world, he awakes to sobriety the next morning and realizes that, in a foolish fit of pique, he has auctioned her and his daughter, Elizabeth-Jane, off to a sailor. Despite his frantic efforts to find them, they have disappeared. Ravaged with guilt over his selfish, impulsive act, he swears he will not take another drink for twenty-one years.Whether his wife was indeed one of Henchard's problems is left for the reader to ponder as Henchard moves to Casterbridge, prospers wildly in business and eventually becomes the town's leading citizen and mayor. Henchard's wheel of fortune, however, begins to spin on a wobbly axle as Donald Farfrae, an enterprising young Scot travelling to seek his fortune, enters his employ as the manager of his business. At the same time, Susan and Elizabeth-Jane, re-enter Henchard's life believing that Michael Newson, the sailor who had purchased them some nineteen years earlier, has perished at sea. Henchard's life truly begins to come apart when Lucetta Templeman, a former lover, also moves to Casterbridge and, ashamed of her past romantic entanglement with Henchard, seeks to hold him to his promise of marriage!Hardy raises many issues but, not expressing his own opinion through an unequivocal direction in the story's plot line, seems content to leave these issues as topics for sober analysis by his readers. Hardy questions the conflict between the merits of tradition vs modernization. There is the enormous irony that Henchard's success as a business person seems clearly attributable in part to his tee-totalling vow but is founded upon the five guineas seed capital raised through the auction of his wife and daughter! Henchard seems to epitomize the constant personal conflicts we all face between decisiveness and strength of character as opposed to impulsiveness and stubborn bullheaded intransigence! One wonders whether Lucetta is flighty, coquettish, thoughtless and selfish or is she an early manifestation of modern woman sadly out of time and years ahead of the ladies around her? Is Farfrae to be admired or scorned for his meteoric rise to power in Casterbridge and his complete devastation of Henchard's place among his peers?Perhaps the most powerful moment of the entire novel comes with the discovery of Henchard's will and his words directing that the world leave him to rest in forgotten isolation and that no person mark or mourn his passing in any fashion. Once again, we are left to decide for ourselves whether Henchard's life should be pitied, forgiven, admired or looked upon with scorn and disgust.To the readers of the day, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" would have been perceived as a darkly pessimistic tragedy that might have evoked emotions akin to those raised by Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" or Sophocles' \\"Oedipus Rex\\". A classic worthy of the term, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", certainly never cheerful or uplifting, is however many, many things - compelling, moving, disturbing, thought-provoking and poignant. Above all, it is worthy of being read and enjoyed by any lover of classic 19th century British Literature.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"This book has everything fans of the 19th century novel, such as myself, love-melodrama, romance, secrets, plot twists, mistaken identities, rising fortunes, and, of course, a tragic ending. I can't give much away because the novel rests on a series of shocking revelations-each more shocking than the last!However, since the book begins with the most startling event of all, and since it is given away on the back of the book, and happens at the very beginning, I will only deal with that event, which is what drew me to the book in the first place. This will set the stage and make you want to read the book as much as I did when my friend told me about it!The main character is a certain Henchard who SELLS HIS WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER. That's right, he sells them! To a sailor! Granted, he is drunk. It's an intriguing study of alcoholism, although some men wouldn't have to be one to want to sell their wives for some beer if they could get away with it. Henchard's wife is understandably furious, and leaves with the sailor. After this, Henchard vows to never again drink-although the introduction to my edition suggests that he remains a \\"dry drunk\\". I don't exactly know what that that entails, but the introduction assured me that it was one of the first books on alcoholism which is important enough.Henchard then redeems himself and in Jean Valjean fashion would like to both atone for, and hide, his shameful past. He tries to find his wife and daughter, and that's where all the fascinating plot twists come in. It's very well-written and kept my attention throughout. I have also read \\"Tess\\" by Hardy and I like his writing style. I cannot say that his works moved me in any profound way as other literature has, but I'm not sure why that's important. There's a lot of humor and farce in this book which is first-rate, and I just enjoyed his protagonist-it's not easy to create one so believable and yet so interesting at the same time.Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life? I'm sure all those who panned this book may have known someone who found a way to surround themselves with drama even in this day and age. All the book's drama is caused by Henchard and his mercurial personality-if at any time he'd played things differently he could have had a better life. But no, he had to be a lunatic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"One of my favorites works of English literature. The opening \\"wife selling\\" chapter is one of the best in all literate, setting the major tone and themes for the entire book. The ironic twits of fate provide a wild, entertaining ride that shows off Hardy's themes of the balance between fate and individual choice in a non-didactic way. The Mayor must be ranked as a tragic character in line with Shakespeare's best work. A work that makes profound psychological and philosophical statement while remaining engrossing on every level."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I began reading The Mayor of Casterbridge as an ISP (Independant Study Project) novel, as it was reccommended to me by my English teacher. At first, I found the book to be unbearably boring, but beautifully written. The language is something to be admired. But I soon became absorbed in the story, and I have to say it was one of the most compelling ones I've ever read. I might just say it's the best book I ever have read. And it's sad. I'm a 16 year old guy, and I cried at the end. I don't want to sound prissy, but it's true. And you will cry too, I'm sure. If there is one thing I can say to you, it's this: read The Mayor of Casterbridge. It would be a great injustice to one of the most profound stories of our time."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"For being written in 1886, this book felt surprisingly modern and completely engrossing. The twists and turns of Henchard's life enthralled me and though many of his actions proved him reprehensible, he was still somehow likable... Farfrae also was an interesting character, though Elizabeth-Jane truly stole the show. All in all, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed reading this and I will certainly keep an eye out for his other works. Hardy is one of those classic authors that genuinely isn't a chore to read!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" es a truly remarkable novel. Interesting throughout, it is the story of the rise and fall of a man named Mechael Henchard. Ay the beginning of the novel, Henchard is a volatile, twenty-one-year-old hay-trusser. He becomes drunk at a fair and sells his wife and daughter to a sailor in an auction, which originally began as a joke, turns serious.Upon realizing that he has sold his family, Henchard searches for them to no avail, and takes an oath to give up alcohol for twenty-one years. After the supposed death of the sailor, Michael's wife, Susan Henchard, and her daughter began a search for Michael Henchard, who has become the mayor of Casterbridge.The novel proceeds as many soap-opera-like events unfold. The unique plot-twists made reading the novel a very entertaining experience. An unfavorable trait Henchard possesses is not letting go of past mistakes. Although he tries to atone for the past indiscretions, fate always seems to catch up to him. These factors and others contribute to the downfall of Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Thomas Hardy has a reputation for writing bleak, sad stories. The Mayor happens to be my first Hardy read, and I can't tell you how saddening I found the overall tale.Many points are made by Hardy: dealing with the past and its haunting effects; pride before the fall; and even the folly of mental inflexibility.I couldn't shake the parallel of the King Saul/David story from the Bible while reading this. You have the powerful man who takes in an apprentice then becomes overcome with jealousy and envy as his apprentice eventually outshines him. And rather than putting his usurped life in perspective, allows his anger and envy to make matters much worse.I saw Michael as a flawed man who is redeemed by his sense of duty and obligation.I think the theme of duty to world versus self is important here. Michael's duty to his first family overrides his desire to be with his new girlfriend Lucetta. He probably would have been happier with Lucetta; but wouldn't we as the audience have seen him as selfish if he had chosen her instead of Susan? Both women were manipulative, one aggressively, one passively, so it probably didn't matter. But it does raise the question of how much of our personal happiness should be sacrificed for societal duties.Donald Farfrae, the Scottish apprentice is put here purely to provide Michael Henchard with a foil. I don't feel he is developed at all, and is kind of dull, as is Elizabeth Jane.There are character driven stories and plot-driven stories. And in plot-driven stories, you know that the characters' personalities or decision-making won't really matter in how things end. That's an aspect of Mayor...that some may find the most frustrating. You never could shake the feeling that destiny was unalterable. I, however, had no problem with it. It was a good ride."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Opinions on this novel seem to be a bit polarized to say the least. The plot is a tad too complex and soap-opera-ish for its own good, but the twists and turns are interesting enough to keep people interested, and it really isn't a tough read. Additionally, it represents the transition between the more emotional, passion-centered Romantic era (Henchard) to the more mechanical Victorian Era (Farfrae), and that in itself is a pretty interesting concept."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The story twists and turns and Hardy takes the reader on a journey exploring the hopes and shattered dreams of the book's central characters.This is a masterpiece.I, like many reviewers above, had to study this text aged 16 for school exams. At the time, I remeber thinking that the long winded descriptions of the countryside irritated me. Perhaps now, aged 28, I would appreciate this book more. I feel that those who criticise it are entitled to do so - but the criticisms (if genuine) ought to be more constructive than those above - which are just bitter and inmature!As a story, this is first class and a must. Read it and savour it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"If I were ever to be an English Literature teacher, The Mayor of Casterbridge is the first book I'd start with. Not just because it's filled with themes of major gravity or features extraordinary descriptions of England and its culture, but simply because it's a damn good read. One reads it at a breakneck pace, occasionally stopping only when plot twists have one's jaw dropping on the floor. This is one of the most truly amazing books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is a superbly crafted tale of youthful folly and the futility of repentance. Set in the early Victorian Wessex beloved of Hardy, the time and place still speak to audiences more than a century after the novel was written.The title character commits one huge act of drunken folly in his youth, to his eternal regret. He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community. But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read! The many TV movies and mini-series do not do it justice!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Thomas Hardy's books are somewhat difficult to read, but this book, set in an English market town, is well worth reading to obtain a picture of life in rural England during that time period along with a complex tale of an ambitious man's rise and ultimate fall. A man rising from the ranks of farm laborers builds himself up to become a successful grain merchant and leading citizen of the town.

In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I loved the book!

The story is classic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Michael Henchard (yep - - later he's the Mayor, all right), having sold his wife and baby early in the novel for 5 guineas while in a drunken rage, gets what he deserves despite his valiant efforts at atonement years later after an initial rise in fortune and a 'chance' reunion with his long-abandoned wife and daughter. Not that an example of Divine retribution is Hardy's intention; Hardy was an atheist. But he stacks the cards so heavily against Henchard that it's hard to believe he isn't a True Believer after all. Chance? Irony? Coincidence? (Synchroncity?? Gadzooks!) Divine retribution? All grist for Hardy's deterministic mill, and a grinding mill it is for Henchard. It ultimately doesn't matter - - to prove his point Hardy orchestrates the narrative so obviously and nothing can stop Henchard's downward spiral, of course. Everywhere in the novel, it's plain he's doomed. Hardy created this character whose final wish, as Hardy has him spell out in his will, is that he be forgotten. And then Hardy titles the novel after him for the ages. Did I hear someone say 'Omniscient Narrator'? Pretty divine, I'd say."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The book is essentially a daytime soap opera.

This mayor is one twisted, selfish and self-loathing individual. He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head, and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved. Fun guy? Nope.

There was still plenty to stir my imagination. This study of human character - especially that of Henchard - was very interesting. Really enjoyed the book!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge is a story about Michael Henchard attempts at redemption and the many sorrows, pain, and misery that comes with his decision to uphold his pride and name. To say that Henchard is the only character that suffers in this novel would be a misrepresentation; almost every character at some point suffers immensely in some trial of life, whether it is death of someone close, pain of separation, or the frustration of a relationship. For these reasons, this work is not a \\"light\\" read by any stretch of the imagination, and will probably test even the optimist's patience in getting through. Still, Hardy's story, the descriptions of the countryside and the characters' inner feelings, as well as the way he ties together every character in this book, is a remarkable feat and makes for a powerful read.The story begins with Michael Henchard walking with his wife, Susan, to the fair as they cross the countryside. While there, in an act of drunkenness, Henchard sells his wife to a sailor, and seemingly sets in motion his irreversible bad fortune. Not being able to find his wife the next day, he makes an oath to not drink alcohol for 21 years, the exact amount of years he has lived. The novel then fast forwards 19 years to find Henchard the Mayor of Casterbridge, and a noteworthy man of respect. Susan finds him, marries him after forgiving him, but there are many secrets that both parties have and will have until the end of the novel. It seems that many of these secrets are the character's downfalls. Henchard, while Mayor of Casterbridge, meets a man named Donald Farfrae, who he comes to like and implores to stay in town; however, eventually he and Farfrae become bitter rivals in not only their business and society, but also in their relationship with Lucetta, a woman who had an affair with Henchard in the past.Henchard's fallacy of character lay in his stubborn pride and his foolish belief that name and appearance is everything. He sometimes tries to create a faade, or cover up one sin with another secret or problem. When he tries to persuade Lucetta to marry him, so as to not destroy her name, he retorts: \\"But it is not by what is, in this life, but by what appears, that you are judged.\\" He is a tragic individual who seems to not be able to change his views long enough to make something right occur; when something does go well, it is short lived. He even gets to a point where he connects himself with an ominous and unpreventable fate, at one point referring to himself as Cain. He never really heeds Elizabeth's attempts at love until very late in the novel when tragic occurrences seem to be set in motion.Still, despite all his problems, and all his pride, he is a \\"likeable\\" character because he makes the effort at retribution and is sorrowful each time he gets hit with a dilemma or makes an unfavorable decision. He has the willingness and conscience to try to amend his deficiencies, but, in the end, he just makes too many mistakes, and has too much pride to reverse his fortunes."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"An early fall afternoon in the 1840s bucolic world of Wessex. Michael Henchard, a young hay trusser, sells his wife Susan to another man for the paltry sum of five guineas. The 400 page classic by Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) goes on to chronicle the rise and fall of Henchard. The main characters are:1. Michael Henchard-The tragic Mayor of Casterbridge who loses all he values in life and all those people he loves to his rival. Henchard is a visible proof of the fact that fiction displays \\"the human heart in conflict with itself.' He is a Faustian striver who is ambitious in business as a corn chandler; politics as he becomes mayor and love losing the three women who have meant most to him. Henchard dies in an obscure hut near Egdon Heath desiring to be completely forgotten by the world. He has a death wish and wishes to achieve the oblivion of death in a universe controlled by fate, chance and irony. He is one of Hardy's great creations.2. Sue Henchard is the wife sold by Henchard to a sailor. She emigrates with him to America. When she returns 20 years later to Casterbridge she remarries Henchard but dies soon after the wedding. She is a simple-minded country woman lacking in knowledge and sophistication.3. Donald Farfrae-While Henchard represents ancient Wessex in folkways and beliefs, Mr. Farfrae is a young Scotchman who soon steals Henchard's supremacy in Casterbridge. He is hired by Henchard to straighten out the latter's business affairs but leaves him to start a successful rival business firm. Farfrae is the second Mayor of Casterbridge in this novel. He marries Henchard's mistress Lucetta. When Lucetta dies after being the center of a scandal caused by old loves letters to Henchard being revealed, Farfrae weds Henchard's stepdaughter Elizabeth Jane. He is a kind man who seeks to help Henchard to no avail.4. Eliaabeth-Jane-She is an intelligent person who returns from abroad with her mother Sue. She has been raised to believe that Michael Henchard is her father. Elizabeth-Jane becomes a hired companion to Henchard's quondom mistress Lucetta. Elizabeth Jane later weds Farfrae. This young lady learns her real father is the sailor Newson and Sue.5. Seaman Newson-The real father of Sue who returns to find her twenty years after the deal of exchange he made to purchase Sue as his wife from Michael Henchard.6. Lucette-The Jersey miss who had an affair long ago with Michael Henchard. Lucette is sexy and exotic. She weds Donald Farfrae dying after details of her affair with Henchard lead to scandal.The characters in this ironical novel are all puppets in an uncaring universe.The last word in the novel is \\"pain\\"! There is plenty of pain to share among all the characters.As with all of Hardy's classic novels, the descriptions of the town folks and the flora and fauna of Wessex are beautifully written. Hardy is the best regional novelist in all of English literature.The Penguin Edition of the novel contains excellent illustrations by Robert Barnes which were included in the original edition. A helpful chronology of Hardy's life; discussion of the textual history of the novel and a useful introduction by Dr. Keith Hardy are included. The novel is one you should read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"My second reading of a Thomas Hardy novel was every bit enjoyable as the first, if not more. Having a very limited background with this gifted author, it has taken years to appreciate his talents.The Mayor of Casterbridge starts with a very dubious event...concerning a drunken 'sale' of two persons by one Michael Henchard...bidding them a not-so-fond farewell; once Michael sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family.Flash forward 19 years, when a weary woman and her now-grown daughter appear near Casterbridge, searching for the woman's first husband, who has now become the mayor, and succeeded in keeping his 21 year pledge to abstain from drink following his grievous error years before.Susan Henchard, now the widow of a missing sailor, comes looking for Michael, and is surprised at what she finds. A sober, well-to-do, respected member of the community, and a leader. A far cry from the man who bartered her away years before. Also new in town is Donald Farfrae, who, once apprenticed to hay and corn merchant Michael, becomes more than Michael bargained for.To tell any more of the plot would be to deprive a reader of numerous twists and turns that occur along the way to the conclusion of this wonderful novel. Perhaps its due to a limited amount of experience with Hardy, but I found several jaw-dropping revelations along the way, and more twists than a television reality series.The story is never dull, nor is it mired in too much unnecessary detail or character introduction. Each of the 'dramatis personae' are well-realized, as is the notion that the past can always change the course of the future.For newcomers to Hardy's works, indulge in this page-turner, which is fraught with enjoyment. As this is a less 'dreary' tale than Jude the Obscure, I would recommend it as an introduction to Hardy's style...and a chance to meet a masterful storyteller."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge has so many plot twists and turns that it would not be an exaggeration to label this book as a \\"plot spiral.\\" With practically every new section, Hardy invents a new way to reveal some surprising (and sometimes not so surprising) twist to the plot line. Hardy creates a complex story about love, lust, relationships, economical hardship, family, shifts in power, and more in a beautiful and picturesque way. He concentrates so much on detail that it seems as if you are watching the events first hand. His style presents information as if you were reading it in the form of a play. He nearly always sets up the scene before beginning the action, which makes it so much easier to delve deeply into the action of the characters.Hardy also creates enormously dynamic characters that are subject to so many changes throughout the novel that they become like real people. The author's grip on human emotions makes his characters believable and easily loved and then hated. The fluctuating emotions of the main character, Michael Henchard, as he falls subject to disappointment in every avenue of his life is a true example of Hardy's gift for characterization.The contrast of the out-dated and underdeveloped town of Casterbridge vs. the complexity of the relationships that develop within it is brilliant and makes the reactions of the common townspeople to these relationships even more significant to the development of the setting and also the relationships themselves. Though not portrayed obviously in the book, the town of Casterbridge itself plays a very large role in the story. As Hardy thrusts outsiders from other cultures into this archaic town, things suddenly become very complicated and even more so when the newcomers begin to meet and mix together. The Scotchman, Farfrae, and Lucetta, the Jersey girl, as well as some others, react in such a way to the old ways of this society as to disrupt the harmony of this simple community, making this novel an avenue for Hardy to demonstrate his gift for rich dialogue and language, as created in direct relation to the character&#65533;s point of origin.Hardy has created a book about rises and downfalls of a small group of people and presents a very fitting theme about the events of ones life and how they affect everyone around them in death. I must say that I enjoyed this novel for its substance and complexity, as well as the timelessness of the general plot outline."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the &quot;evils&quot; of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, focused and simple the premise has been in itself, affords a quite convoluted plot that packs with events as the memorably niched characters play out their lives and unravels the novel. The book is riddled with a well-faceted theme of conscience: the purging of conscience and its reconciliation through an allusion to deceit and characters' shameless past that ceaselessly haunt them and render them despondent and guilty. The tragic actions revolve around one man who manages to establish prestige, wealth, and authority over Casterbridge and ironically the very elite status leads to the fall of the deeply flawed man.In a fit of drunken anger and delirium, young Michael Henchard sells his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor for 5 guineas at a county fair. Over the course of the years, though he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the town from literally nothing, Henchard still affords a ray of hope in reuniting with his family, until he meets Lucetta Templeman who nurses him in America. Such black spot of his youth as wife-sale caused by his fits of spleen not only renders him ashamed of himself but also wears an aspect of recent crime: something that will shame him until his dying day. Behind his success is always lurking such shameful secret of his troubled past shielded from the public and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper.Contributing to the suspenseful nature of the novel is the return of the mayor's wife and daughter some 18 years later whom Michael Henchard believed to have perished at the sea. The sentimental reunion, which marks Henchard respectable 20-year abstinence from alcohol, brings about a heartrending revelation and an ironical sequence of events that irritate Henchard. The very truth cruelly leaves in him an emotional void that he unconsciously craves to fill. At the same time, the regard he has acquired for Elizabeth-Jane has eclipsed by this revelation. The new-sprung hope of his loneliness (or \\"friendless solitude\\" in Hardy's own words) that she will be to him a daughter of whom he can feel as proud as of the actual daughter she believes herself to be, has been stimulated by the (yet another) unexpected arrival of the sailor to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her.All these ineluctable consequences of his past shameful transaction at the fair take a stupendous toll on Henchard and his conscience. He is also uneasy at the thought of Elizabeth-Jane's passion for Donald Farfrae, whose rising prestige and success in his independent business provoke in Henchard enmity and envy. Henchard quails at the thought that Farfrae shall utterly usurp her mild filial sympathy with him, that she might be withdrawn from him by degrees through Farfrae's influence and learns to despise him. The pricking of conscience subtly manifests in Henchard's solicitous love and growing jealousy. His fear of losing tie after the death of his wife is sympathetically understandable. Though he in his effrontery has been weaning Elizabeth-Jane from the sailor by saying he is her father, she understands that Henchard has himself been deceived in her identity.Lucetta Templeman, inescapably torn between her past disgraceful entanglement with Henchard and her love for a more refined gentleman, is also pricked by her conscience. In an impulsive moment, purely out of gratitude, Henchard proposes to the Jersey woman who has been so far compromised to him. But as the years gone by, Lucetta is more convinced that she has been forced into an equivocal position with Henchard by an accident. She has discovered some quantities in Henchard, who is either well-educated nor refined in manner, that irretrievably renders him less desirable as a husband than she has at first thought him to be, notwithstanding there remains a conscientious wish to being about her union with him.When Lucetta learns of the wife-sale, she immediately dismisses any possibility of being with him and realizes she cannot risk himself in his hands. It will have been letting herself down to take Henchard's name after such an ignominious scandal. But her past which she diligently seals, if not expunge altogether haunts her. The surreptitious history with Henchard becomes the torture of her meek conscience and the reconciling of which through a marriage with a second man remains also her secret alone.Subtitled \\"A Story of a Man of Character\\", Henchard's origins remain unexplained but he literally begins and ends the novel away from Casterbridge, where he achieves his prominent status ironically destines his downfall, through the lampooning and skimmity-ride. A psychological study, the novel accentuates the fury that causes him to lash out against both himself and those who stand closest to him. It depicts to the fullest the very self-destructive nature of the power that causes Henchard's fall, which is so obvious through his louring invidiousness.2004 (46) MY"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit. Suggest you try another kindle version."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"This 1964 Heritage Club Edition is a treasure! The hardcover is appropriately decorated with motiffs of Casterbridge. The wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker are wonderful and unique! Of course, the story reads like a tragedy - Henchard is certainly his own worst enemy. On the other hand, Thomas Hardy's prose is certainly wonderful reading, unlike many 20th century so-called literary authors. Hardy's descriptive analyses of places and characters are exquisite, including the historical aspect of the English countryside near Casterbridge. The secondary characters are varied, some solid and some weak in spirit. Henchard seems to use them all to his detriment and the detriment of others. Elizabeth-Jane and Farfrae give the story balance and in the end are winners despite Henchard's downward spiral.This review is not in any way a descriptive review of the book's story line. However, there are hopes that your interest has been peeked and that you will give this book a complete reading. Also, there are DVD's of this story which can be accessed on Amazon.

I'm just tired of neurotic English characters who are obsessed with class (are they ALL obsessed with class?) and destroy themselves due to inherent character flaws. Henchard is hot headed and makes bad decisions. He drinks, repents, drinks, spirals out of control. This is almost a clich&eacute; in novels now. I suspect Hardy might be lost or relegated to Freshman English classes as the canon grows and embraces more \\"diversity.\\" In short, Dickens' characters are more interesting. Forster's visuals transfer better to the screen thanks thanks to the Merchant Ivory team. I hope Hardy does not get lost in the shuffle because I actually enjoyed the prose quite a bit, although I probably liked his descriptions of the town and countryside and even some of the minor characters (that old \\"seer\\" guy who predicted the weather) who were more representative on a mythic level more than Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet Classical Books)","review":"A story of hope - from a lost cause to glorious circumstances.

Her sickly life and early death (aged 35) make for dark, tightly written meditations on mortality, life and love. her love affair with writer Georges Bataille makes for compelling reading as her desperation at being sick with TB makes her cling to him more. The biographical sketch also sheds light on a key unrecognised figure in the Paris / Surrealism 30s scene.

Much loved by the late kathy Acker."},{"Title":"Laure: The Collected Writings","review":"Reading the collected writings of Laure one can easily understand why Bataille loved her with such passion.

Poetic and fluid, strangely and necessarily harsh at times, Laure's beautiful ambling takes a curious mind and engages it so fully as to permanently tattoo her perspective with a shockingly pointed brevity. Whether or not it stays with you forever, her writing will indelibly leave a delicate mark."},{"Title":"Managing Across Borders: The Transnational Solution, 2nd Edition","review":"This seminal book has been a part of my professional library for almost a decade, now. I am an Associate Professor in International Business and teach the subjects covered in this book. From this book a number of concepts have grown which continues to dominate the discussion of global management. Let me jus mention a few: administrative heritage, which is the idea, that the organisational structure of multidomestic enterprises reflects the historical period they were established in - especially with respect to the regime of coordination and communication. For instance, whereas the typical american firm entering Europe after 2ww would follow a strategy of tight operational control (given the business circumstances of this firm) Phillips, a multinational from the 19th century would display a strategy of much more delegation and subsidary autonomy.Another concept is that of transnational companies - firms which simultaneously seek to adjust to local circumstances and enjoy the benefits of global integration. This idea remains a hot issue in global management even today - more than a decade after this book was published."},{"Title":"Managing Across Borders: The Transnational Solution, 2nd Edition","review":"An amazing book detailing the differences between global, international, and multinational companies while providing a new innovative way to approach business, the transnational way.

He goes through a variety of identities, each designed to seduce the woman he has targeted. On his tail is a detective, who is always one step behind him, but is constantly inching closer and closer.There are six chapters to this book, each one is told from a different character's point of view. Your sympathy shifts from feeling sorry for the killer, to distaste, then disgust; as his insanity becomes increasingly clear. The writing style here is reminiscent of Faulkner's, As I Lay Dying. The constant shift of narrators allows the reader to see the events from every conceivable angle. You comiserate with some, encourage others, feel hatred and disgust, etc. This is what makes the story stand out, otherwise it would be another serial killer tale. The narration is what makes this one stand out.James Robinson and Phil Elliot have crafted a simple and elegant tale that stays with you long after you've read it. It has long been overlooked as the great story that it is."},{"Title":"My Mother's Lovers (Western Literature Series)","review":"There are times when you pick up a book that you feel you really connect with the author, that somehow you know her and the people about whom she writes. For me, \\"My Mother's Lovers\\" was one of those books.While this is clearly a book of fiction, the vivid description of the characters, particularly the grandfather, resonated with me.I always enjoy books about young people coming of age in the 1960s and 1970s, perhaps because even at 49 I'm still coming of age. (Or, so I dream.)This is also a book about a mix of cultures, Italian and Jewish, and about hippies and what used to be the establishment (which so many of the hippies have since become).I look forward to Passanante's next book."},{"Title":"My Mother's Lovers (Western Literature Series)","review":"An artist and a bookstore owner, the narrator's parents in My Mother's Lovers are known in their small town as \\"those hippies in the purple house.\\" Mimi, the central figure in her daughter Lake's life, is the mother many of us would love to have yet would resent bitterly until we came to understand her. Looking back through a child's observant yet uncomprehending eyes, Lake describes how she was charmed and mystified by Mimi as a young child, then grew to resent her mother's hunger for passion and authenticity, which she experienced as betrayal. Complex and intriguing characters move in and out of Lake's life, such as GraceAnne, a native American hair dresser whose silence invites her customers to confide the bizarre stories of their lives, or Aunt Dee Dee, a would-be Princess who swoops into town bearing clothes, Barbies, and the family's first telephone. Many of these characters, including Mimi herself, have secrets that were not open for young Lake to read, so the adult Lake periodically builds on her childhood memories to imagine for herself their thoughts, experiences, and emotions. Those passages are the most evocative and beautiful in the book. In particular, if you haven't already been captivated by Passanante's poetic, humorous, and visually gorgeous style by the time you reach the sensuous interlude of Mimi and her scarred logger, you will surrender to Passanante then.My Mother's Lovers is a short novel that compresses in its humorous, tragic, and gorgeous pages the timeless story of a girl's coming of age, her achievement of a hard won wisdom. Love is also the book's subject; there is not one false moment, no cliche, in Passanante's wise and deeply observed treatment of literature's most common theme."},{"Title":"My Mother's Lovers (Western Literature Series)","review":"Passanante's book grabbed me in the first chapter, and I never let go.

No matter how well you think you know the basic building blocks of astrology there is always more to add and The Astrological Guide to Self Awareness provides a fine instrument to give further inspiration concerning well loved material.This is an excellent beginners book explaining the fundamental concepts clearly with examples while providing real value for money for you can read it again and again"},{"Title":"An Astrological Guide to Self Awareness (15th Anniversary)","review":"Donna Cunningham has produced a fine work here. This is a terrific manual for those who want to 'feel' what the planets mean as well as know their meanings on an intellectual level. She explains how we must all deal with all of the planets in our lives and how we can turn negative chartacteristics into positive ones. For example, a Neptune in the 1st house has the potential to be parasitical, and dependent on drugs or alcohol yet can also be a sensitive counsellor or talented musician. Her concluding chapter 'The Stars Via Subway' in which she takes her students on an excursion is one of the most heartfelt pieces of writing on astrology I have ever read. Compassionate and easy to understand, a worthwhile addition to anyones library."},{"Title":"An Astrological Guide to Self Awareness (15th Anniversary)","review":"One of the first astrology books I bought, many years ago, it still makes interesting reading. With the main emphasis on the planets, Donna Cunningham provides an excellent overall introduction to chart interpretation and transits. It is obvious that this book is based on a great deal of practical experience working with astrology, and her extensive background in social work and mental health is a strong positive influence.The approach to astrology here is all about empowering the individual. The planets mirror back to us the truth of our lives, and armed with this self-knowledge we can begin to take more responsibility for ourselves. The chart can help by showing more constructive uses of our basic traits. Cunningham is keen to avoid any cop-out as in blaming our chart or the planets for bad things in our lives. &quot;Wrong thinking and wrong actions are at the root of most of our troubles&quot; sums up her approach.One unusual feature are comments on the meaning of the symbols for some of the planets and signs e.g. the glyphs for Jupiter and Saturn being upside down versions of each other. There are many other interesting bits and pieces. The final chapter is a very touching and moving account of an evening with astrological students who are recovering alcoholics, and their trip to an astronomical observatory."},{"Title":"An Astrological Guide to Self Awareness (15th Anniversary)","review":"Very insightful with many personal views on certain subjects.

The times are past, thank goodness, but like most kids, mine are fascinated with helping the desperate slaves reach freedom.We liked making a diorama of a house with a secret hiding place... we liked the mapping...we did make lanterns, although that was kind of a mess... and of course, my kids liked making coded messages and secret handshakes.The best part of this book were the fugitive slave stories -- the book offers many, many, many stories of people who escaped. Each one is heroic and most are heartbreaking. There is enough here that even older children will be satisfied with the information, but not so much as to terrify very young children.I especially liked that the accounts were mostly those of Black people -- the emphasis was on Black folk helping themselves and one another, with some help from Whites. Too often, the Underground Railroad stories are of heroic Whites rescuing helpless Blacks. This book is better because it shows the active resisance of Blacks to their captivity.Parent notes: descriptions of violence, beatings, whippings, restraints and shackles, human misery, sexual assaults. Parents know best what is right for their kids."},{"Title":"Wild to the Heart,","review":"I am not a Rick Bass expert. I have only read In the Loyal Mountins, The Watch, and now Wild to the Heart, but i love his writting. Wild to the Heart is no different. The book contains thirteen essays written by Bass ranging in scope from Siera Club meetings to birthday partys that involve both canoeing and clog dancing. This book is filled with all of Bass' genius, the simple but magical language, the vivid descriptions of nature, and his interacting with people and earth. I love the way that Bass can write about nature and hiking and even if you've never done these things, he brings them alive and shows the beauty of them. The thing that I liked most about this book (and all his books) is the fact that his language is clear and easy to approach. He doesn't bog the writing down by trying to show off his masterfull vocabulary, and this creates very fluid prose. Such descriptions as &quot;niglets of rain splatter us&quot; are so interesting, and he never seems to use cliche metaphors. This book is strong all the way through, but I would have to pick &quot;On Camp Robbers, Rock Swifts, and Other Things Wild to the Heart,&quot; as my favorite. There is a scene in which he's describing different birds that both hade me laughing and wondering at how someone could write so well. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that i found the story &quot;Paying Dues&quot; a little weak and it got a little preachy towards the end. While this book is not as good as &quot;The Watch&quot; (but really, how could it be) it is most definatley a great book and worth anyone's time who cares to read it."},{"Title":"Wild to the Heart,","review":"I really like Rick Bass' writing style and love affair with the wildness of nature.

And in embracing this faith adventure, Meeuwsen says we can live God's purpose for each of us.Meeuwsen shares her personal story, her unique struggles and successes, her God adventure, in this practical, thought-provoking book.When God wants something done, He looks for men and women to take the assignment; much like the old television program, Mission Impossible. \\"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is ....\\" We are offered the opportunities; we just need to decide if we're going to accept His assignment. If we don't, someone will. But we'll never know what we've missed! It is an act of faith and not without risk-taking to follow God. But Meeuwsen believes that when we put our own plans on hold, wonderful surprises will occur. She calls it a God adventure.This was a timely book for me as I've been on my own \\"wilderness journey.\\" I was able to look back on my own life and clearly see where I stepped out in faith and where I hesitated. After reviewing those experiences, it is clear to me that taking the risks, believing that God knows what is best for me and will do His best by me, has been, by far, the best part of my journey.After reading this book, I can name and claim my experiences as my very own God adventure."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"I have lived and worked in Russia for the last ten years. I remember when I first read this book - I felt that it helped me understand Russia, although I can't point to the exact parts of the book that did this. I re-read it at least once a year, and always find something new to enjoy. The plot and the characters are very rich, and the ending is uplifting, in stark contrast to the reality of Bulgakov's life. I find it difficult to recommend books to people. It is unlikely that they will read something in the same way as you. This is the only book that I recommend to everyone, who suggests to me that they might be interested in my recommendation."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"The Master and Margarita is my ultimate favorite book. It is an suprising allegory which manages to make one rethink subjects like religion, good and wrong, love and philsophy. Bulgakov lets us enjoy a creative and inventive combination of fantastic litterature and high love in a setting of a burlesque adventure. It has some of the complexity of a Dostovesky novel and a story worthy of Robertson Davies, wherin there lives the same kind of people as in the works of Herman Hesse. It is a very brave achievment, not only to write it, but also to try to publish it in a time whan Josef Stalin governed Russia. It is very difficult not to fall in love with Margarita and to hope for a world where people like her and the Master lives and breaths and where other Bulgakovs are still at their writing. Its a great achevment to be able to create a book that plays itself out on your mind and that for some never will leave it. It is one of those books that may change the reader."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"The first few reviewers said it all... this is a wonderful book, one of my faves, and if you havn't read it yet then pick it up- trust us, you'll love it.

As a Rolling Stones fan for close to 25 years, I had long known that one of their all-time classic songs, &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; was based on this book, as it was a favorite of Jagger's. So, I finally broke down and ordered it, and I'm BLOWN away! It's a wild ride throughout! I found myself gasping at every turn of the page, alternately shocked, and laughing! This book causes you to THINK. I'm no student of literature, so I can't speak for the various translations, (I read the Ginsburg translation) but this book is simply MARVELOUS and utterly enjoyable."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"More or less a novel, this book is also an allegory. Like Moby Dick, there are probably a dozen interpretations that can be given to it. The extensive local color comes from Moscow in the early Twentieth Century. (The author wrote and revised it from 1929 to 1940). The main plot centers around a crowd of Russian literati - authors, theatre goers and hangers-on, particularly one older world-weary author (the Master) and his beautiful young girlfriend (Margarita). The devil and his sidekicks come to town and a lot of evil doings ensue. (If this were a modern Latin American novel, we would call it magical realism.) Interspersed with the Moscow chapters is a mini historical novel that the Master is writing about Pontius Pilate and his agony over his decisions leading to the Crucifixion. Given that the Soviet Union in this era was promoting atheism, closing churches and persecuting religious folks, the main thesis seems to be summed up as follows: \\"Surely the devil is real, and if so, there must be a God.\\" This edition has notes keyed to each chapter to explain many references that are obscure to modern readers particularly those not familiar with Stalin-era Russian politics. Like Dante, in his Divine Comedy, the author uses his work to settle old scores with critics and censors. I wouldn't say that it's a book that I couldn't put down, but the plot moves and it kept my attention. One thing that struck me is that Moscow was \\"behind-the-times\\" apparently, and much of the plot felt like it was set in the late 1800's. But then a phone would ring or someone would arrive by plane and it jarred me back to the proper era."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"The copy I ordered from Amazon several weeks ago hasn't been delivered yet, possibly due to a combination of Christmas and too much mail-disrupting snow. So how can I review an unseen book? Answer: because, of course, it's not unseen but read with such pleasure in a library copy that I must possess my own. I first read and loved the novel in the translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky which supplies extremely helpful explanatory notes. Amazon gave samples of this translation and Glenny's and I had to agree that Glenny's English was more natural and fluent. By now my paperback had fallen apart. I would need to own a hardback. So the choice became Glenny in hardback. Admittedly this may fall apart too as I know I'll read and re-read Bulgakov's spell-binding amalgam of satire and love-story.

This is not a Mirra Ginsburg translation for sure. The name of translator is not mentioned anywhere in the book. I find it to be very shady."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"The Master and Margarita is a fresh of breath air in literature. An ingenious storyline in the ilk of Dante, with the Devil as the main protaganist. It is hard to forget the story was written during the highest time period of censorship in Russia. THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANYBODY OVER THE AGE OF 13."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"There are four translations of \\"The Master and Margarita\\" presently available Two of them, those by Mirra Ginsburg and Michael Glenny, are based upon a 1966 censored Russian version of the novel, while the later, Burgin/O'Connor and Pevear/ Volokhonsky translations are based upon the final uncensored version. Additionally, the latter two translations contain useful endnotes (footnotes would have been preferable) that explain references to people, places and things in the Moscow of the Thirties.Despite these shortcomings, after reading all four translations, I found that I enjoyed the Ginsburg translation the most. Since I do not read Russian, I based that opinion on the facts that (1) for me, it read the most smoothly, and (2) the comic passages were simply funnier in her translation (Russians, justifiably consider the novel to be a comic masterpiece). I attribute these characteristics to the Ms. Ginsburg having been born and raised in the country of Byelorussia and her being a successful writer (in English!) in her own right.Based upon those criteria, I rank the translations as follows:1. Mirra Ginsburg (1967) [ISBN 0802130119]. Simply the most readable. Read also her translation of &quot;Life of a Dog.&quot;2. Diana Burgin and Katherine O'Connor [ISBN: 0679760806]. Conveys a wonderful sense of mood, especially in the Pontius Pilate chapters.3. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (1997) [ISBN: 0141180145]. I had the sense that this is the most accurate translation, but it is less literary than the two preceding choices. The comic passages simply do not come across. Pevear and Volokhonsky, a husband and wife team, are prolific translators of Russian literature. I have enjoyed several of their other translations, but this one just does not seem to work.4. Michael Glenny (1967) [ISBN: 0679410465]. No reason to buy this one.Having read all four, would I do it again? Absolutely! I'm convinced that this is one of the great novels of the 20th century, and with each reading I picked up subtleties that I had not noticed before."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"The only thing worth saying about this book in a forum which Bulgakov himself would surely have despised is this: don't read the Ginsburg translation, it is substandard. The Michael Glenny translation is much more lucid...its worth the wait."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"I simply love this book. I first read after I had starred as Pontius Pilate in stageproduction of the book. The play had been named &quot;Satan arrives in Moscow&quot;.

The book has many levels - and even if you look no further than the very surface, it is a bizarre yet hilarious story. If you put more thought into the reading, it delves in to themes of good and evil and all that good stuff (and thankfully, Bulghakov is much more eloquent than I am). It was several years ago that I read this so I don't remember many of the details, but I do remember that it was my favorite piece that we read in the course. I lent my copy to a friend and I never got it back, which is too bad because I'm dying to read it again. One of these days when I can justify spending the money on a book I've already read, I'll get myself another copy. Until then, I'll just leave you with my highest recommendation!

It can be taken on so many levels, that is hard to make an argument against it's brilliance. It's social inferences, historical references and economic overview of Moscow all lend to a fascinating map of a civilization in despair.Apart from its importance in the understanding of the Russian people, it is one of the most astounding and interesting philosophical works ever written. By using Faust as a central theme and working through both good and evil, Bulgakov seemingly, not directly, presents answers to the eternal questions and tells the tale of eternal struggles that go on within man and spirit alike.It is a fabulous story and it is presented in such vivid and alarming detail, that it creates a timeless and utterly re-readable story. This book is crammed with the supernatural, the natural and the inevitable, and it makes for either a quick and thoroughly enjoyable bedtime story or an in depth read into the rationality and irrationality of man.Buy this book."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Best book I ever rea"},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Unbelievably poor quality edition:No ISBN number anywhere in the bookNo name of the translator anywhere in the bookPoor typesetting, lots of mistakes.Will never buy anything published by this \\"publisher\\"."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This is a beautiful, tragic, and uniquely written work. However, much of its beauty depends on Bulgakov's command of the Russian language, and the English translation does not manage to bring across the full magnificence of this book. This novel is inaccessible to Americans for one further reason. It is, in a way, a political and social commentary, and to those who do not know the times in which Bulgakov wrote, who do not understand his veiled thrusts at the Soviet system. . .this book has no meaning. Do not imagine for a moment that it is merely a fantasy, or even a philosophical novel (though that is partially true), it is first and foremost a commentary on the Russian society of the time. And without understand of that society, the book will have little meaning to the reader. If you have enough Russian at your disposal to read the original, do it! If not, read this translation, but I fear that a great deal of the magic, the beautiful language, the unique power of the written word that characterizes Bulgakov will be lost to you."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Satan and his cohorts come to Moscow and wreak havoc. People disappear or need urgent psychiatric treatment and as a hostess for satans ball Woland chooses Margarita who willing accepts in order to free and be with the Master,an oppressed author of a novel about Pontius Pilate...Written during Stalins infamous show trials, Bulgakov's use of magic realism does invoke the climate of enforced thinking and terror,and in turn satarises the drabness and tedium of soviet life, but for me this book just doesn't shine. Its no '1984' or 'Gullivers Travels' and neither does it give the joy of Garcia Marquez's use of the style. Yes, I got the idea abour cowardicw being terrors greatest ally and there's plenty of qoutable scenes, but you're often left wondering exactly is the point he is making.(The reading of the introduction and annotations are a must to keep the novel alive)The book was written, re written and revised many times between 1928 and 1940 and as a result it does seem over egged. I was put in mind of Bernard Malamud's story about Feidelman whom, on painting a masterpiece, thought he could make it better and kept altering it so that in the end his masterpiece became a mess!'The Master and Margarita ' isn't a mess,but it just doesn't pack the punch its reputed to do.

I truly love this book. That's why I cried when reading the CreateSpace edition. I mainly bought it because I liked the evil looking black kitty on the cover. Never judge a book by its cover! The translation is horrendous and the editing done so carelessly that I wonder if anybody bothered to look it over before giving it into print at all. The pages are teeming with typos, and that, in the addition to the weird formatting, makes it torturous to read. You get the feeling that the people who published this book really hate Bulgakov and want to punish all of his readers. The publishing house is apparently just after a quick buck, abusing literature and readers in the pursuit of their goal. Do not buy this book, do not support this careless, corporate abuse. I highly recommend the Penguin editionThe Master and Margarita (Penguin Classics) (Paperback).

The reader has to get used to long flights of fantasy, almost like an imaginative childrens' book with super-natural happenings (the devil, his consorts including a very drole cat, as well as a witch and her lover). Alongside this is a completely straight retelling of St. Matthew's gospel and an, ultimately, repentant Pontius Pilate which is truly beautiful, descriptive prose that makes you feel as if you were there.Read this book -- it's like no other you will have read. Possibly, One Hundred Years of Solitude has something of the flavor with, of course, a totally different subject matter. It's sometimes difficult to keep all the (probably) unfamiliar Russian names straight, but persevere, it's well worth it. You may well find it haunts you too for a long while afterwards and, like me, you will strongly recommend it to all your friends."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"There seems to be some trashy translations of the Master and Margarita. We just got a new brilliant Norwegian version who got rave reviews in all our major newpapers.Back in 1976 I was reading the Master and Margarita for the 2 time I had the radio on and the Norwegian corenspondent of Moscow was on the news with his review from the opening nights of the Master&amp; Margarita in Moscow. It was the first time it was aloud in a theater. He was suprised because the audience were so negative, until he discovered they were all KGB/military/Politnicks from the party. Bulgakov detested these people and ridicules them the whole book trough. Good ridance.He creates some of the funniest scenes in any books, some of the most inventive dialogues, one of the most lovely romances, a most belivable meeting with the most famous son on earth and his tormentor (or vice versa?), and the most catty cat there ever walked on four and two!Read Bulgakov with your heart and its more than enough. Read him with your brain and thats great to! Combine the two and you got everything. You do not have to know russian or russian politics to understand the book. I don't and I love it. You only need a open mind and a heart.I have gone on to see it on the ecene in Edinburgh (ok, but to few actors) Copenhagen (brilliant; I still have the $ bills) and in Stockholm (Lena Ohlin was not at her best unfortunately and the same russian director was minimalistic).If you have a open mind and love good literature then this is the book for you. If the first pages dont grab you, wait to you are ready for them. It's worth waiting for."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This is my favorite book of all times. In fact, I always have a copy of Master &amp; Margarita on my nightstand. I had read this book in English and Russian (my native language). I must say that the English translation by M. Ginsburg is inferior one. While it is more accurate as a linguistic project, it fails to capture the fluidity and the style of the original. All in all, the translation (forgive me I don't remember the name of the translator) published in a red/white cover is a much better one. It relates the story closer to how Bulgakov wrote it in Russian."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This may well be the finest literary work of the twentieth century. It is certainly one of the great works of twentieth century Russian and Soviet fiction.Not only was the publication of the book a literary happening, but it was and is a cultural phenomenon. The apartment that Bulgakov resided in (and which Woland comes to inhabit)near the Patriarchs Pond is lined with Bulgakovian graffiti from its first to its fifth storey. The most popular tourist excursion of one Moscow company is their Bulgakov's Moscow tour. Periodically the theatre near the Taganskaya metro will put on a version of Master i Margarita as well as the Heart of A Dog. And the manuscripts don't burn statement of the book became a popular phrase amongst Moscow's dissidents in the 1960s. Even today Bulgakov remains perhaps the most popular of 20th century Russian writers; a recent poll in a Russian newspaper had Bulgakov far ahead of his next competitor, Nabakov. Few writers have had such an impact.I have read several translations of Master i Margarita. I like Ginzberg's (but it is a translation of the Moskva printed version which leaves out an important chapter and a large part of another). Glenny's seems rather stilted. The Ardis is excellent. I was a bit disappointed by Pevear and Volokhonsky's Penguin version.By the way, Bulgakov was an opera fanatic and his love for the medium is reflected in this great work.My suggestion dear readers, is to get thee to this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Michael Glenny's 1967 translation of Mikhail Bulgakov's preeminent masterpiece is still indisputably the best available in English. Far inferior translations feature much more prominently in bookstores and in internet book search results, which is really too bad for the unwitting reader who would otherwise be in for quite a treat.Although some of Glenny's opening paragraphs sound awkward, every other translation I've come across butchers the rich, humor-laden language of this fantastical and brilliant tale, which is probably the most important piece of Russian literature written during the last century.For example, while it's great for the English reader to know that Bezdomny's name means \\"Homeless\\" in Russian, several English translations go so far as to stupidly render his name as \\"Ivan Homeless\\"or just \\"Homeless.\\" Why not just go all the way and call him \\"John Homeless\\" while you're at it? John is the English equivalent of Ivan after all. And while you're at it, why not just make the whole story take place the United States or England instead of Russia?While no translation can be expected to render the full glory of the original Russian, the myopic and fatuous work of lesser translators exacts a ruinous toll on countless passages, squandering the joy,humor and sheer wit of Bulgakov's writing and mangling the brilliant tale.If you doubt me, simply compare for yourself. Take for example the scene in the end of Chapter 5: \\"The Affair at Griboyedov.\\" Glenny's rendition remains true to Bulgakov's sidesplittingly funny language. Here, Bezdomny addresses the psychiatrists at the mental hospital, where he's been admitted following an encounter with the Devil, who Bezdomny had thought was a foreign Professor:\\"Now look, everybody--ring up the police at once and tell them to send five motorcycles and sidecars with machine-guns to catch the professor. And don't forget to say that there are two others with him--a tall fellow in checks with a wobbly pince-nez and a great black cat. . . .\\"The translations by M Ginsburg, Pevear & Volokhonsky, Burgin & O'Conner, and others simply don't measure up. Take my advice and read Glenny's version, it's available only in softcover hardback as the \\"Everyman's Library edition\\" from Amazon, or find one of the other out-of-print Glenny translations, originally issued in 1967 by Collins and Harvill Press, London. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"The book is the same wonderful book that I knew, but the copyediting is not very professional which makes the translation seem awkward at places. Still, a classic of dark fantasy literature and much more."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This book never stops to surprise me. It combines an elaborate plot, briliant sketches of Russia in the beginning of the century and effortlessly alternates between the grotesque and tear-breaking episodes. At one moment it can talk about people's quarrels over very small and earthy things, but in the next moment it suddenly rises to the discussion of such things like Destiny, Satan and God. This is one of the most compelling love stories of the century and at the same time a deeply phylosophical journey into the meaning of life. How Bulgakov was able to cobine this all in such an elegant and complete package is still a mistery to me. This book was a labor of his life. He was finishing it while he was already dying of cancer in his apartment in the Stalin's Moscow. The book was not published until long after Bulgakov's deth and it immediately sprked a cult following among the Russians. Many quotes from the book are now included in colloquial russian- a solid testimony to the quality and beauty of Bulgakov's writing."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"I first read the book when I was about 12 years old. Since then I have re-read it numerous times and had a different experience every single time while following the same story. You can read just the story of Christ's execution or enjoy the life of the city of Moscow in the light of Lucifer himself visiting that city. And both stories are beautifully blended together giving you a unique view on things that surround you in everyday life."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"While everyone comments on the novel itself, I feel the need to comment on the quality of existing translations. The one done by Michael Glenny is very elaborate and verbally close to the original text. However, it is apparent that he never cared to find out the details of life in the Soviet Russia in the '20s, thus his text does not relay all the esoteric details of subtle Bulgakov's humor and sarcasm. Read Mirra Ginsburgh's translation for better understanding of the sole of the book -- but beware, she completely let out big parts of the novel, some of them are essential. There is not a single word in this book that is out of place or has no purpose -- I urge you, read carefully and read both translations -- after all, it is only the best book ever written"},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"The Master and Margharita is a treasure chest of wild, creative thought and enthralling characters.

His portrayal of his characters questions our fundamential ideas of life and death, good and evil. He puts religion in a light never before seen, in a place never before imaginable. And he does all this wrapped in an unforgetable story of love and effection. A must-read for all who dare to question everything that we think to be stable and unquestionable."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"If you enjoy value challenging books such as &quot;Brave New World&quot; or &quot;1984&quot;, you MUST read this book! The praise for this book is well deserved"},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"The Master and Margarita by Michael Bulgakov was written at the height of Stalin's reign in Russia. The story is a tale of Satan's visit to Moscow for Walpurgis Nacht juxtaposed with a tale of Christ's cruxification as told throught the eyes of an unseen observer, who later turns out to be none other than the devil. This is a tale of the indistructable love and sacrifice of the Master for his beloved Margarita. Add to this a mix of befuddled bureaucrats, self-important party officials, murder and general mayhem and you have an incredably readible modern comedy. The author says it best with the quote from Faust -- &quot;Who art thou?&quot;, &quot;I am he who wishes forever evil, yet does forever good.&quot"},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"If you were forced to read Russian literature in high school and felt like you just didn't get it, or worse felt like you were being tortured like I did, give this book a chance. With a few more years on my bones I now appreciate those other works, but had I been introduced to this book back then, I wouldn't have felt that all Russian literature was like eating a bowl of dust while being hit over the head repeatedly with a rubber mallet.Written with a wry and twisted sense of humor, this fantastic tale is set in the early Soviet Union. The book starts with two members of the writers guild having a conversation about Jesus when the Devil shows up. He joins the discussion, predicts the soon to be death of one of the characters, and when this actually comes to pass, it plunges his friend over the edge. You can take it from there, but it's a far cry from the \\"suffering is good for the soul\\" style from Dostoevsky and Tolstoy.By the way, the quality of these everyman's library classics are top notch and a bargain for what you get."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This is a brilliant novel, very funny, yet tragic, very moving, and very observant._The Master and Margarita_ is set in Moscow, apparently in the '20s or '30s. One day a couple of literati are talking when they meet a strange man. Before long the man is laughing at there confident assertion that the Jesus and the Devil don't exist, and telling a story about Pontius Pilate and his encounter with Jesus, or Yeshua, and also predicting the death of one of the two men. When the death occurs, the other man goes mad. The strange man, who is, of course, the devil, and his associates, including most memorably a talking, gun-toting, very large, black cat, are spreading havoc throughout Moscow. Most spectacular is a catastrophic magic show. Those Muscovites who encounter the devilish group are mostly humiliated, sometimes killed or driven mad. One notable, perhaps ambiguous, exception, is the case of the Master, who has written a novel about Pontius Pilate which has been excoriated by the figures in power in the Moscow literary world, and his lover Margarita. Margarita encounters the devil, and goes through hell itself in an attempt to free the Master.The novel is an odd combination of very sharp and funny satire, striking descriptive passages, and some very moving events. It also has the power of staying in your head after you read it. And I found the several long passages about Pilate and Yeshua and Matthias the Levite very affecting as well. An excellent book."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Untill recently I had no clue this book was translated in into English, so when I felt homesick I asked my friend, who brought all her favorite books with her, if she had &quot;Master and Margarita&quot;. I enjoyed reading it for the 8th time in my life: its language, its sarcasm and humor as well as the deep idea of the author. Since I work in the college library I was curious what this book looked like being translated (I would never have thought somebody actually did it) and I was dissapointed. The version of M.Glenny has nothing to do with what Bulgakov wrote. Sorry. I feel very sorry for those who cannot read it in Russian, however this is the first book one should read in Russian literature."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This is simply the best book I've read all year. I'm going to savor it for a few days and then read it again."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Even if you're not a fan of contemporary Russian literature, you should read this novel. This translation seems extremely good, and is true to Bulgakov's original, but much revised, text. You should also read about the author and the history of this novel's creation. It's fascinating and will greatly enhance your reading experience."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This book is one of those that achieve what most books aspire to achieve: it colors your dreams and changes the way you think. It is an amazing series of interwoven tales about Pontius Pilate, Jesus, and writers in twenties-era Moscow that call into question mythologies and conventional Judeo-Christian notions of good and evil. There are few novels I've read that have so skillfully alternated between comedy and tragedy. It explores love, despair, and hope--subjects that are constantly written about in a trite and contrived fashion--in a beautiful and ultimately poignant way. (This is an alternative classic in Russia: hard-core fans make pilgrimages to the apartment in Moscow upon which Bulgakov based the apartment in the book to paint the stairwell with drawings of the characters.) In short, I could not give it a higher rating."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This book is the &quot;Testament&quot; for the Russians. If you wanna make friends with them - just mention that you know ABOUT this book - and bingo! It is a multilayered story that concerns everyone and everybody, anywhere in the world and any time from the the year 33 AD up to this very minute. Again, it is NOT about Russia or Russians - &quot;it talls for thee&quot;. No man can ever give a full and comlete tribute to this great novel - I can only express my own awe and admiration. A mortal can never create such a novel: Bulgakov was only a choosen &quot;receiver&quot; and diligent &quot;recorder&quot; of the ideas and words of the Divine Supreme Creator. It's true for all the masterpieces of Art and Literature, but this Book simply confirms and justifies this point to the fullest.

Only discrepancy is the book cover received was different than what was shown."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"I am not going to argue over who has the better translation. I will just say that this is MY translation; Glenny captures the Prussian mannerisms of Satan's posse to a \\"T.\\"Now on to the novel:I know of no other writer who has so accurately described life as it is. Bulgakov was a savant, not only a soldier and doctor but also a man with a clear grasp on philosophy, aesthetics and power relations. Very often these types of men wonder aimlessly about life until they wind up in a mental ward (as does the Master).The decisions in life are the following: (1) join the power elite in their lies, schemes, and general mess, as does the character Bezdomney. (2) Fight against the system of manipulative priestcraft, as does Christ. Or (3) Escape the system entirely and life a live of autonomy away from the liars who control the world.The Master (within us) takes the third option.Remember not to write bad poetry."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"The Master and Margarita is indeed one of the best written books ever. Unfortunately Glenny's translation leaves much to be desired. It reflects none of Bulgakov's witty, quirky, beautifully flowing style, and reads more like a verbatim translation of a theological treatise."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"I loved this quirky little novel. First off it came with it's own book mark, even if the book was awful I would still love it just for that lol. Satan and his group are almost the comic relief for the story. Strangely enough the part of the story I loved the most was the interaction between Jesus (using his Hebrew name no less!) and Pilate. I enjoyed this tremendously and wished the author would have published a full sequence of the events. For me this is saying alot because I am no where near christian. I also thought the end and how everything gets brought together a joy."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Which is to say, I dont think this novel compares to Lolita, Mrs. Dalloway, Gargantua and Pantagruel, Wuthering Heights, and The Stranger in literary quality. The horrific scenes of Satan's taking full advantage of human stupidity and avarice are stunning and entertaining--at least at first. Then they become redundant and tiresome. The second half of this novel suffers from the same flaw that Milton's Paradise Regained suffers. The latter is the story of absolute good winning over evil, the former about absolute evil winning over good. Both stories are deficient in that the forces (either good or evil) are absolutely invincible; there is no question of their success, thus no tension, thus really no reason to go on reading. I found it difficult to plod through the second half of the novel, principally because I knew that Woland would succeed, would free the Master and Margarita, would drive half of Moscow insane, yadda, yadda. This did not make for very interesting reading. Evil has a huge potential to be interesting, because it is imaginative and energetic. Woland is imaginative and meticulous, but after the first several hundred people he kills/drives mad fails to interest me in the second half of the book. Also, the others of his retinue fail to develop beyond their initial presentations; they become repetitive rather than increasingly intriguing. How many times do we need to hear about Koroviev's check suit and flawed pince-nez, or Azezallo's one fang? And I didnt think much of Behemoth's antics, either; at first they were amusing (like his attempting to board a tram) but again it gets redundant after several chapters of the same. The structure of the novel is intricate, but flawed in my opinion. For instance, the epilogue was rather dry and unnecessary. I enjoyed the fanciful scenes of Margarita flying over the city and later on horseback, the devil and his retinue flying through the cosmos. I especially enjoyed it after having to endure the seventy-fifth destruction of some part of Moscow by Woland and his band. Don't get me wrong, I do think highly of Bulgakov's attempt at an intricate and ambitious novel. For the most part it is provoking, especially when considering the atheist, Stalinist Russia in which it was written. But I expected more of a crescendo. I didn't care for Woland. He was as interesting as one of the many MacBeth rambling soliloquy's. His ball was about as scarey as a typical halloween costume party. In fiction, Satan can (and has) been much more interesting. The Master and Margarita's tale begins as touching, but ends rather stale and predictably. To sum up, the book succeeds and fails wildly. I would give the first half of the book five stars, the second one and a half. Thus, the final tally of three."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Bulgakov was obviously a sympathizer to all things diabolique. His masterful novel has the clear-cut intention of inverting the universe, praising the murderers and murdering the praised. That his nefarious tale has spawned a cult in Russia is no surprise. Wolland is just fascinating as a murderer, a leader of slayers, hell-bent on denying the &quot;Sinless One&quot; and being the ruin of those who get in his way. Truly, Wolland is Lord of the universe, with the globe at his fingertips, destroying the innocent and condemning those who dare deny him to an eternity of pain. Obviously, this was Bulgakov's mindset, his paramount objective in his dying years. It's so delightful, it's a shame he only wrote one book like this. A classic of truly Satanic literature."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"I am taking the middle path with my view that while the book possesses some poignant prose, it's essential message is one of antiChristianity. As a practicing Theravada Buddhist (who, unlike others, knows enough not to say &quot;God bless&quot; when pure Buddhists have no god) I must say I was taken aback by the antiGospel presented in the tale of Pontius Pilate. Pilate is a fascinating character. Yeshua, on the other hand, is presented as quite the opposite of his Jesus of the Gospel counterpart; Yeshua is fearful to the point of cowardice, bumbling and idiotic, he dies violently, does NOT rise (key difference with the Gospel, that any fool with the most remedial knowledge of the Gospel would know), and ends up a corpse buried with other common criminals. How this can substitute for the Gospel, how this shows Jesus coming off fine is WAY beyond me. This is an antiGospel. Those who are not Christian wont be offended. The book is fine fiction, but not to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"I was chatting with a chatroom friend who asked me if I had read this book. The chatmate, who lives just outside Moscow, said this book is very popular in Russia right now. His comment made me curious. I thought I'd read a couple of reviews on this book since I'd never heard of it. The reviewers said this is a great read, so I ordered the book.I really didn't see the genius in this &quot;masterpiece.&quot; I could follow the story line, and had no problem with the Russian names, but I wasn't able to even find a central plot to this book. I was really intrigued with Satan's ball in which Margartia was the naked hostess, where all of the guests had to kiss her knee as they entered. After this, I felt the story fell apart. I felt that this was the climactic moment in the story, and this scene was in the middle of the book.I would recommend this book to someone who is studying Russian literature, but this just isn't the kind of book that you will want to wrap yourself in a blanket and read on a rainy weekend."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"If you want to feel creepy, weird, dark and half-way insane, please read this book - it's perfect for that. I also thought it was blasphemous."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Unequivocally a heap of putrid, sickening tripe...a collection of overrated, overwritten, underimaginative, repetative fatuousness. Bulgakov is the complete antithesis of Russian greats like Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Nabakov. Bulgakov's characters are predictable, his plots uninteresting, his descriptions jejune and redundant. If I could I would give it zero stars. Waste of time!"},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"Everyone, let's forget about the analogies to Stalinist Russia and all the other subterfuges used to acclaim a book that is nothing more than a devil-worshipping treatise. I simply dont understand how people can give accolades to this novel when it shows innocent people being driven mad, and even has a physically sickening scene of satan rejoicing at the violent and gruesome death of a young child: &quot;He was too young to have sinned.&quot; What is that? What does it even mean? I can understand all the clever references Bulgakov makes to Stalinist &quot;purgings&quot; and the like, but what his book boils down to, quite simply, is that Christianity is for the weak and insane, whilst satanism is for the strong and admirable. But how admirable does Woland (aka the evil one) show himself to be when he takes joy in a child's death? Oh, and I really dont believe the Gospel NEEDED to be retold; especially from the viewpoint of one who obviously doesnt believe. The fat old Russian was simply fooling around, dabbling recklessly in witchcraft, and doing all he could to disparage the name of our Lord. I wonder why no one here has noticed the blatant attack on Christianity this book represents. The truth is, however, this book, though trying desperately to invert the Faustian myth, has only succeeded in further establishing it: the devil can only ever be a deceiver, and destroyer, a loathsome creature who hates mankind...such is Woland's character.Im not here to push my religious views, and I know that my one star stance on this pernicious piece of literature will get me lots of &quot;NO&quot;s as to whether this was helpful (if it is even published). But I felt I had to get this out there, because it appears so many people are missing the essential point of Bulgakov's &quot;classic&quot;: to besmirch the Church and anything holy because he, through his black witch wife, was messed up in the occult. But given all the praise heaped on this book, I think I should be allowed to differ, and should be given voice among all these amazon posts.No matter what the outcome, however, Bulgakov and the Mrs. are doing their time. Justifiably so."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"I've always been a fan of Russian novels, ever since I read my first Dostoevsky novel at the age of 10...(okay, it was a Classics Illustrated comic book version of Crime and Punishment!)but had never run across anything by Bulgakov until a few years ago. A Russian friend of mine really pressed me to read the book. I bought it, but it just stayed on the shelf until a few weeks ago. All I can say is, I didn't know what I was missing. Master and Margarita is a wickedly funny, sad, frightening, and ultimately haunting masterpiece of fiction.Bulgakov was one of the first generation of Soviet writers who flourished in the 20s, during the short lived Soviet Experimental movement, and then suffered horribly after the stregnthening of Stalin's regime. Bugakov was primarily a man of the Theater, and something of a theatrical quality hangs on to this book. The chapters have an almost tableaux style construction. When the Stalinist purges began, Bulgakov was began work on Master and Margarita, pretty much to please himself. He knew that he would never live to see it published.The novel itself is nearly impossible to describe. It consists of three separate plots. On the surface is the visit to Moscow, of the Devil in the guise of a professor named Woland, and his henchmen, two grotesque disfigured men, a naked woman and a cat who plays chess among other things. The group proceeds to essentially terrorize the city's intellectual community, mostly by exposing each character's inner hypocracy. The satire of communist society in this section is quite biting, and uproariously funny. Embedded in this story is a \\"novel within a novel\\" ...the story of Pontius Pilate and his encounter with the itinerant spiritual man, Yeshua. Finally, there is the story of the separated lovers, the Master and Margarita, who interweave between the other two stories. They live in the present day Moscow, but the Master ostensibly wrote the manuscript which told the story of Pontius Pilate.This rich and complicated stew of a book works on so many different levels. At it's most obvious, it is a scathing attack on communism and the cultural elite's complicity with the evils of the system. It is also rather pitiless in it's exposure of the greed, corruption and mendacity of human nature. But Bulgakov is not a conventional moralist. The Devil as Woland is an evil figure...sometimes a terrifying figure, and yet he ends up as the instrument of the redemption of both the Master and Margarita. There is a deep spiritual viewpoint at work here...Early in the novel, Yeshua tells Pilate that, \\"all men are good\\", to Pilate's incredulity. In the context of the novel, Yeshua seems hopelessly naive, but by the end of the novel, you wonder if this may actually not be the author's central point. Even the devil is capable of some good here.This book contains a whole world. Characters change in dizzying fasion and events go by with lightening speed. And yet, by the last pages there is a haunting beauty, an almost incandescent light that shines over the prose. Some of these final images stay etched in my brain even now, several weeks after finishing.I highly recommend that anyone read this book. It may be one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. It certainly is the greatest Russian novel of the last 100 years!"},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This review does not refer to Master and Margarita, which is a powerful and genius work of art. This review, instead, refers to the Classics House translation of a powerful and genius work of art.I will sum it up like this: I came across the phrase 'bum-freezer made of air' on the second page of the Classics House translation. I am fluent in Russian and have many Russian friends, and I asked one of them for their Russian copy of Master and Margarita, so what in the world the translator was intending to convey. In short, they had translated 'vasdooshnei pidjakot' (which means an airy or diaphanous jacket) as 'bum-freezer made of air'. Good job, translators!Throughout the text, I found extremely strange phrases and sentence constructions that were clearly the result of some of the shoddiest translation I have ever seen.

Meanwhile, a brilliant writer has been committed to psychiatric hospital after he's written an account of Christ's passion from Pilate's point of view.

When the times are such that the Satan himself is repulsed by human vice, don't we all wish to have that special ointment and rise above our petty struggles to achieve what we truly love. Never before have I read about as just Devil as Woland, or as spiritually joyous God as Ha-Nozri. And yet the book is not religious--it is Bulgakov's personal, tormented symphony of imagination, both tragic and hilarious, sad and uplifting and one, he knew, that will never be read in his lifetime.Update 24 Oct. 2012: A very pleasant Russian TV show (10 episodes) based on the novel was released in Russia in 2005, directed by Vladimir Bortko (&#1042;&#1083;&#1072;&#1076;&#1080;&#1084;&#1080;&#1088; &#1041;&#1086;&#1088;&#1090;&#1082;&#1086;, &#1052;&#1072;&#1089;&#1090;&#1077;&#1088; &#1080; &#1052;&#1072;&#1088;&#1075;&#1072;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090;&#1072;)."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"This book is fantastic.

Bulgakov uses wonderful imagery, intertwined with the torment, confusion, rejection and withdrawal of The Master to bring forth his views on religion, politics and society during Stalin's rule. His masterful spin on Satan and his position, coupled with the bizarre, yet amusing steps that Margarita must take to save her one true love.This book travels through light, whimsical antics to deep, malicious acts for the deserving played out by a talking black cat and his associate, a rather oddly dressed, quirky fellow. In Margarita, he demonstrates, the often difficult path to freedom and the strength she gains while in it's pursuit, as it is not for herself in which she strives to reach her goal, but for her one true love.An oddly compiled work of religion, politics and love. Truly intriguing and enjoyable."},{"Title":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA","review":"To put it simply, it is the best work of fiction that has ever been written.

A younger version of Miss Marple, she is decidely more open to life's possibilities, and the rekindling of a former love just adds icing to this delicious confection of a mystery.Miss Prentice's keen mind and flawless instincts are put to work when one of her former students is found murdered near the library copying machine.Her ensuing journey of discovery introduces Miss Prentice to a host of interesting characters, and Edwards Kennedy's sure hand with characterization keeps the reader enthralled.

[....]Amelia Prentice is a high school English teacher in her forties. She figures she will always be a spinster, until she trips over the body of her former student, Marguerite LeBow, in the public library. Her head wound brings out the worst of the town gossips, who start in on poor Marguerite. However, it also reacquaints her with her former beau, Gil Dickensen, and the old sparks fly:\\"He kissed me. It was apparent from his technique that Gil had put in some practice since we had last done this. As for me, I had to rely on memory and trust that, just like riding a bicycle, it would all come back to me. I gave it my best.\\"Gil enlists the aid of his nephew Vern to both watch over Amelia and help her, which turns out for the best as Amelia herself is at the heart of the mystery. Ms. Kennedy does a great job of totally confusing the reader with all of the town's characters. It makes for great reading and an interesting labyrinth. Kennedy teases the reader with the initials UDJ, floating them in and out of the action. Every great cozy should have a cat, and Amelia's Sam is lazy and languorous, providing a kitty Falstaff to the cast of characters. Amelia's old house provides a great backdrop for the action, as well as a source of strength and sanctuary for her, as her dead parents provide warm memories.Ellen Edwards Kennedy has produced a signature mystery in the old cozy, read in a wingback chair on a rainy day, tradition. She has added to the Old Grand Dame herself, Agatha Christie. Her characters are recognizable; the action keeps the reader fascinated and entertained, and the ending is very satisfactory after a great denouement.

Ms. Kennedy's talent with dialogue and character description are especially striking. Also particularly moving is the deftness with which she draws the reader into the very fabric of each scene, weaving careful, creative and very realistic detail throughout the text, blending plot, character, and setting into a living, breathing, and very believable literary tapestry.

I think if the group is led by a person experienced in the Baptist denomination who can 'flesh\\" out the course with more interesting examples from real church life.

I lived in Utah for many years and have done extensive research into Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and the mormon religion and, have found, like all of history, that there are those on both sides who feel strongly about 'the prophet' Joseph Smith. Wells approaches this controversy from the Christian (non-mormon) standpoint so be aware of this when you read it.

Ever confused by the nuances of multiple inheritance? Ever wonder what XML or OOP or Relational Databases have to do with each other? Ever wonder if all those A.I. programmers in the 70s actually created anything useful? Ever wonder how type systems work? Ever wonder how to store complicated and vague data into a database?This book doesn't really have answers to these questions (nobody really does, in my opinion) but learning the information in this book is the first step you'll want to take to get closer to some answers...It basically covers 3 main topics: FOL (traditional logic like you probably learned in college) Frames (sort of the grandaddy of OOP) and Description Logics (a really powerful synthesis of object-thinking with strict logical fundamentals)This book has a bit of hairy mathematical notation in it, so if your not comfortable talking about things like \\"an object x that is an element in the domain\\" some of the chapters will require a bit of effort on your part. The authors are careful, however, to follow every difficult mathematical analysis with some concrete examples that ease the learning process- I often wish examples were more frequent in other theoretical tombs like this. Any computer programmer can process this text with a bit of moderate effort.I couldn't imagine being a professional programmer and not knowing the information in this book now that I have read it. Although the topics in this book are somewhat obscure today, I think they will receive far greater appreciation in the future- especially among medical software developers. Here's your chance to be ahead of the curve in the field of knowledge representation!"},{"Title":"Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence)","review":"I came across this book looking for a text that would explain the context of First Order Logic, why it is used for so many knowledge representation problems, how it is used to solve them, and its limitations. I must say that this is far and away the best book I've found to answer these questions. If you search around a little at the competition, you will find much of the text quickly turning to mathematical proofs and deductions in their explanations. While this is of course necessary and helpful, it doesn't (for me) really give an idea of how and why these methods are used practically. You can tell that these authors spent some time on ensuring consistency and fluency of the writing, which I find so very helpful.I'm trying to think of something bad to say about it: I wish it were longer! If you read the preface you will see the authors call it an introduction, which is definitely true. Maybe they will team up again for a more in-depth text on some aspect of this subject."},{"Title":"Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence)","review":"I own an old edition of the classic Russell and Norvig (R&N;) which I read 10 years ago and did not feel like going through the huge new 2009 edition to learn about current topics, so I went looking for something a bit more recent with a focus on knowledge representation, and came up with this book. I have to say unfortunately that while not a bad book, it does not cover much more than the old R&N; (side note on this: R&N; is very comprehensive and covers the full AI spectrum. This book seems biased toward one particular school of AI. This may or may not be bad for you: if you're not interested in the additional material in R&N;, such as neural nets, you're possibly better off with this book. I doubt there are many of you in this case though) and tends to be less pedagogical. It is also more uneven regarding the depth at which topics are covered, with a fairly strong bias toward the topics where the authors appear to be active researcher. Such a bias would be ok for a more advanced textbook, but we're talking about a fairly introductory text here, and it feels a bit unbalanced. I cannot therefore recommend it highly, but I am not highly critical either, as I still managed to learn a couple of things. Below are detailed notes, which I hope might be of interest to outline the stronger points. As a side note, this is a very theoretical book, with no direct programming application or exercises. This did not bother may, but may not be clear from the other reviews.The introduction sets the scene well and provides a useful conceptual background. How the following chapters are articulated against the principles discussed in the introduction is not always straightforwardly clear though. In that sense, the authors may fall a bit short of their overall goal.The second chapter (the language of first order logic) is unlikely to be big news for anybody schooled in undergraduate mathematics, but I understand the material must be included for the sake of completeness and autonomy. The third chapter is entitled \\"expressing knowledge\\" and in my view does not really do justice to the topic, as demonstrated by the matter covered in the afterthought section \\"other sorts of facts\\": these \\"other facts\\" include statistical and probabilistic facts, default and prototypical facts, intentional facts (beliefs etc...). The book deals with some of these later to be fair.At this point in the book, all that has been achieved is to show how one can use first order logic (FOL) to deal logically with some problems that a six years old can probably solve without the need for the framework. Chapter 4 shows that it is possible to teach FOL to a computer and to have him assess the truth of a statement formulated in FOL given a number of others FOL statements. The algorithm is not completely trivial but not overly complex either. Unfortunately, the time taken to deal with such tasks is potentially very large for problems not amazingly complex if one allows FOL statements of arbitrary structured. Chapter 5 is dedicated to the exploration of Horn clauses, which are basically a type of FOL statement for which algorithms are available that converge faster. This motivates the need to embed some hints on how to reason with a given problem within computer languages. Chapters 6 and 7 explore this respectively in the context of PROLOG and of the so-called \\"production rules systems\\". As one gets familiar with the above approaches, a number of limitations become clear and the subsequent chapters are about moving away somewhat from FOL. Chapter 8 introduces object oriented representation, using a formalism a bit on the heavy side for a concept that's actually fairly clear. Give or take a few examples, a reader of R&N; is on familiar ground up to this point in the book. The next chapters, respectively on description logics and inheritance cover material that was less familiar to me and might be a reason to dig into this book. It shows a couple of neat ideas (taxonomies, inheritance networks) and how reasoning with such data structures can be difficult when one encounters contradictions. This motivates the need to clarify the concept of \\"default\\", which is done in chapter 11, another good chapter in my view. Chapter 12 includes an introduction to probabilities that probably ranks with chapter 2 as something most readers don't really need. It also covers fairly superficially bayesian networks, influence diagrams and the Dempster Shafer theory. In all honesty given the brisk pace at which this is all done, I don't think it's really possible to get much out of what's covered here.The concepts in the next chapter (Explanation and Diagnostic) were newer to me. While not straigthforward to implement, it seems the core approach of the authors is here at an advantage over other more opaque techniques.The next two chapters (\\"Actions\\" and \\"Planning\\") deal with topics that are closer to the preoccupation of standard AI. As they're both good topics to motivate the AI endeavour, introducing them earlier might have made more sense.The last chapter is about \\"the tradeoff between expressiveness and tractability\\". The authors look back at the big picture that had been evoked during the introduction, but which had to some extent taken the back seat during most of the time. Fairly uncontroversially, they point out that being able to deal with very expressive languages is desirable, but typically fraught with tractability issues. One senses that thePS: I bought the Kindle edition of the book, and as unfortunately too frequent, it suffers from some navigational issues: the table of content does not link correctly to the materials referenced (links are off by a few pages) and citations are not hyperlinked, which makes it less than user-friendly to determine what book or article stands behind the reference [137].

Lots of yammer about the righteousness of cutting your intestines out for no clear reason, and keeping neat, squeaky clean and ready for death. As I understand things, during this period you were a lot more likely to cut out your own intestines than die in combat. I suppose I would take inspiration from such a thing if I were a \\"sararyman,\\" a bodyguard, low ranking soldier in peacetime, or some such self-loathing type, but meanwhile it really isn't for me. Perhaps it is the book for someone else; Tsunetomo's era has more in common with our own than Musashi's does; he was a bureaucrat -chances are, you're more of a bureaucrat than you are a Samurai.On the other hand, the book did develop an appreciation for the concept of badger skin underpants."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"The Hagakure has changed my life and the way I look at everything."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"Outstanding book! also recament Code of the Samurai : A Modern Translation of the Bushido Shoshinsu"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"if you can't finish reading this book, then you are useless. if you don't like it after you've finished it then you are a useless fool. if you don't understand it, then you are a cowardly useless fool"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"Wonderful book if you want to know more about the practices of the samurai.

It brims with warrior energy--especially beneficial for someone going through a particularly low or troubling period of their life where they need some motivation and can vicariously appreciate the struggles of others.The simple message of the book is this: in order to master yourself you need to kill your self.What does that mean? It doesn't mean suicide. Far from it--in fact it is the opposite: it is a birth or a rebirthing. What we are killing is that part of ourselves which confuses our values, which puts us in tension with ourselves: the ego. In the words of Guru Prem, Tsunetomo is asking that the EGO become an AMIGO. It is TAMING THE WILD HORSE--and, subsequently, breaking her.The style is aphoristic. That means its EASY to digest and SIMPLE to navigate. You an really pick it up anywhere and read it from that point. It is not a linear and progressing narrative. You could read it completely out of order.

This book, intentionally or not, captures the spirit of those older days, and serves both as a manual for younger samurai, and as a historical document for people who are interested in &quot;The Way of the Samurai&quot; today.In his excellent introduction, the translator makes the very relevant point that this book is not a rigorous philosophical treatise, at least not in the way that Western scholars would define it. Instead, it is a collection of stories and phrases about a certain way of living. It doesn't hold up to scientific cross-examination (the author contradicts himself frequently), but it shouldn't have to. Yamamoto gives the impression that if faced with a philosophical attack on his &quot;way&quot;, he would shrug his shoulders and say, &quot;Yes, but that doesn't change a thing.&quot; In other words, his examples and aphorisms speak for themselves, and are not meant to either exclude other points of view or force others into conformity. Yamamoto even states that the Way he advocates is specific to his region of Japan -- samurai of neighboring regions are free to develop their own Ways.The passages in the book usually focus on one of two topics: bravery, or etiquette. Yamamoto offers a lot of advice on charging into battle, seeking revenge, executing others, etc. The main thrust of most of it is: the Samurai does not spend a lot of time thinking about killing his enemy. He just rushes in and gets it over with. On matters of etiquette, Yamamoto discusses the proper way to hold a Tea Ceremony, how to cover up a yawn, how to pay attention to people you are talking to, and so on. One of the charming aspects of this book is that right after discussing the swiftest way to cut off someone's head, he'll discuss how to make yourself look nice even if you have a hangover. This could be a result of the editing, but it still makes for entertaining reading.The other theme that permeates almost every paragraph of the book is loyalty to one's master. Yamamoto never tires of discussing the extremes that a samurai should go to so that he may honor his master and show his loyalty. He gives the example of a samurai who was being beaten by his master: during the course of the beating, the master dropped his staff down a hill, so the samurai immediately ran down to retrieve it, and return the staff to his master so he could continue to be beaten. Of course, the ultimate act of loyalty to one's master is to kill oneself after his death. Yamamoto spends a great deal of time discussing various aspects of this tradition, and regrets that his own master forbade him to commit suicide in such a way.The book reads very quickly (it took me about 4 hours), in part because it is organized into brief paragraphs and anecdotes (much like a book of sayings), and in part because the underlying material is almost inherently fascinating. It gives a very complete picture of the state of mind of an aging samurai, and depicts the world of the samurai as it existed in the 17th century.The translation flows very well, though I cannot attest to its accuracy, and the translator includes a somewhat useful glossary in the back of the book, as well as the introduction which I mentioned. I should also mention, for the curious, that this is the translation that Jim Jarmusch used as the source of his aphorisms in the recent film &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"&quot;...if you are slain in battle, you should be resolved to have your corpse facing the enemy.&quot;Yamamoto TsunetomoHagakure -- which can be translated as either &quot;hidden leaves&quot; or &quot;hidden by leaves&quot; -- was published on September 10, 1716. It is a compilation of the philosphies of Yamamoto Tsunetomo, a close retainer of Nabeshima Mitsushige, the third ruler of what is now Saga Prefecture.The book can be very dry, especially if a person is not especially interested in Japanese history or Samurai thought. But if one does enjoy those subjects, Hagakure is interesting not so much for all of its philosophies, which run from the profound to the mundane to the absurd, but rather for the historical context in which it was written. By the time Mitsushige passed away in May 1700, Japan had been at peace for almost exactly 100 years. This left the samurai with the same problem facing our modern military: how do you remain a proud, disciplined warrior in times of extended peace?Reading carefully for the feeling of the passages rather than just the facts, one gets a sense for how the fanatical, death-driven, honor-obsessed samurai of feudal Japan must have felt as they watched their profession stagnate. Tsunetomo himself was forbidden to commit junshi, a retainer's ritual suicide in order to follow his master into death, by the command of the Tokugawa Shogunate. No doubt, this added to his misery and frustration.So, in a way, Hagakure is not just &quot;The Book of the Samurai,&quot; but also a last bit of verbal bravado from a dying breed. It is particularly ironic if you read the version adapted by one of Japan's most celebrated authors, Mishima Yukio, who commited ritual suicide samurai-style (called hara-kiri or more often seppuku) in the office of Japan Self Defense Force General Mashita for numerous reasons including Mishima's obsession with &quot;bushido,&quot; the way of the warrior, which is embodied within &quot;Hagakure.&quot;.The philosophy of Hagakure is typical of the unique blend of Zen and Confucianism that was prevalent during Edo Era (1600-1868) Japan. This particular social system was promulgated by the Tokugawa Shogunate because it added to the focus of Zen the Confucian emphasis on ancestor worship, which strengthened the status quo and the concept of feudal class systems.Although Japan is becoming increasingly Westernized in recent times, the Tokugawa Shogunate's 268-year rule still has a strong subconscious impact on Japanese behaviour. So, to better understand the Japanese, it is useful to understand their socio-political history, though it is certainly true that most Japanese (esp. those under 30) have never heard of &quot;Hagakure&quot; or Yamamoto Tsunetomo.In addition to the historical character sketch it paints of samurai during the Edo Era, there are some gems of Eastern philosophy to be mined from the book, including the idea that one must always focus on every moment of his life, so that he may not be found negligent. For as Yamamoto writes in Hagakure, &quot;The end is important in all things.&quot; By this he means that if everything else goes well, the one bad thing that happens at the end of the day, so to speak, is what people will remember when they think about you.For Yamamoto, however, &quot;Hagakure&quot; is the legacy he is remembered by."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"Whether you find HAGAKURE of interest depends on your approach to the book. Although this is not a book of sword technique, it is much like a traditional swordmaster, teaching only what the student is open enough toknow, and teaching on many levels. On one level, it is a book of eyewitness accounts and stories from the declineof the Samurai era. Tsunetomo has a gift for storytelling,and for slipping in little details that might be of use tothe aspiring Bushi. For example, do you know the quickest,easiest way to remove a dead enemies' face from his skull?He also gossips in an entertaining way about the lives ofvarious local notables. It is as if you are having dinner with a slighly cynical, retired Samurai, the saki is passed around, and he begins talking freely.On another level the book adresses the questions of loyalty,honor, and the meaning of life. It celebrates virtue andvalor, while avoiding the sugarcoating that such subjectsget in the west. Anyone who faces dangers and obstacles in their day to day walk will find this little book strangelysupportive. In this age where loyalty has a price, andcommitment is a meaningless word, the savage beauty andstrange purity of the Bushi mind, as revealed by Tsunetomo, can strengthen the heart, and recharge the mind.IF YOU LIKE HAGAKURE, you should read:THE BOOK OF FIVE RINGS, Miamoto MushashiTHE UNFETTERED MIND, Takuan SohoACTS OF WORSHIP, Yukio Mishima"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"HAGAKURE: The Book of the Samurai is a very interesting book which describes the everyday life and mindset of a samurai. For those that are not interested in the Samurai thought, this book may appear rather dry and in some instances, absurd. However, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The book is made up of short entries of various topics. Whether it's describing a wise samurai's actions, or cracking jokes at the noblemen around him, it is obvious that Yamamoto Tsunetomo was truly a samurai in every aspect of his life. During Yamamoto's time, the prestige of the samurai was declining, due to a long period of peace in Japan. The samurai lived to die for his lord in battle, but how can one remain a noble samurai during times of peace? Yamamoto answers this and many other questions in Hagakure. He also points out that when one is focused on dying, he will not be afraid in the presence of death. As Yamamoto liked to say, &quot;The way of the Samurai is found in death.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"Hagakure is a guide to the proper roll of a samurai during feudal times. Things such as expected behaviour, dying with honor, obeying one's lord, etc...For today's reader, this book offers several tips on the proper mindset when in combat from a samurai's point of view. Still, Some of these rules are, to say the least, a little strange.For a serious martial arts student, this book will probably find a place on your bookshelf (if it hasn't already). However, if you saw the movie &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; and were expecting a book of straight warrior-wisdom, you may wish to consider the fact this book has a lot of Japanese history in it. Some of Hagakure's content is a little dry, and although it offers profound insight in some places, it can be a bit hard to sort out what is useful in today's world.Hagakure is also not put together in an user-friendly format. You have to search for specific quotes, because there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to it's layout. This can be tough when you want to go back and review how something was phrased to better understand it.Still, this book is well worth the time and money. I have read it several times, and I'll probably read it several more..."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"Deliberate before purchasing this book unless you are a hardcore Japan fetishist. I know that most of the reviews here are glowing and I am nonplussed by this because, frankly, this book is definitely way too esoteric for most.Hagakure is a compilation of the selected musings of a 'retired' Samurai as recorded by a disciple or admirer who visited him in his post-retirement gig as a Buddhist monk. These selections pertain to the day to day comportment of a 'good' Samurai, sweeping statements about how things work, and examples of good 'Way.' As this was dictated during the late 1600's, you can imagine how otherworldly much of this information is, and frankly this is the book's main attraction: The total alterity of a supposed way of life of a discrete segment of the population of historical Japan.If one reads enough books about subjects Japanese, one is bound to run into excerpts of this book being quoted say, or displayed as chapter headings. This is because the book has some really excellent 'sound bites' that beg to be used as such. Sadly, this nugget-like structure makes a linear reading of the book a bit of a bore.Also, if one reads the text closely (assuming that the translator has done a good job, and I am not sure that I would concede this point), one is forced to realize that either the narrator is not a particularly deep-thinker or that the scribe to whom he spoke did only a fair job of capturing the essence of the narrator's speech. One needs only to have read, from Japan, Sei Shonagon's brilliant 'Pillow Book' or 'The Story of a Rogue,' as I believe it is called, for the contrast between these truly perceptive and insightful efforts and those found here to cast this book in a very poor light. I highly recommend an excellent book by Hiroaki Sato titled \\"Legends of the Samurai\\" where, incidentally, I believe that Yamamoto is quoted, as an alternative to this as a means of getting the Samurai perspective."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"The hagakure is a short book, but that does not mean that it is a short read. On the contrary, this is longest short read you will ever encounter. This book is dense, it will take you many reads to undestand this book. I have lost count of the amount of times that I have read it.Many deride this book as being written by an armchair samurai, noting the fact that yamamoto tsunetomo never actually fought in any battles. But this is the wrong way to look at the book. The Hagakure was written by a peace time samurai for peace time samurai, and is thus valuable for american practioners of the way. An invaluable book, recommended to all."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"I have to truly say that I have mixed feelings about this one. It provides an eye opening view into the use of Bushido, beyond dry tellings of it's core beliefs. The Hagakure puts fire behind these beliefs and tells anecdotes reflecting this philosophy. The flip side of this is that Tsunetomo could truly be called a psychopath. One anecdote told of his walking down a crowded city street one day when his purse was stolen. Not seeing who had stolen it, he whipped out his katana and killed everyone within 10 feet to be sure that he got the cutpurse. I have to say that anyone interested in the study of Bushido, Budo or just Japanese history in general should buy this book. If you are looking for wisdom in these pages, take everything with a grain of salt. A big one. Think the size of your head."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"The bulk of the reviews prior to my own do a great job of covering the books aspects. However, I wanted to make one point in regards to those who, after reading the book, were really impressed by it. If you enjoyed reading the book, also try and find a copy of &quot;The Way of the Samurai Yukio Mishima on Hagakure in Modern Life&quot; from a library or used book store. It is out of print for the time being, but if you can get ahold of a copy you will get even more out of Hagakure after reading this book.

With this understood, however, it is an excellent read. The Hagakure, or Book of the Samurai, lets the reader into the world of 17th and 18th century Japan. Written by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, well written is actually inacurate. It was passed on to a visitor of Yamamoto's, who then transcribed it. Unfortunately it comes to us incomplete. This no doubt has aided in its patchy narration.The copy I have has no chapter headings or titles other than 1,2, and so on. It appears that there never was any sort of division to the ideas therein, but rather a man pouring his thoughts on to the page.Samurai's have been called warrior philosophers over the ages for the sometimes irrational reasoning of honor and service to their master, or at least to western understanding. The Hagakure clears up much of this philosphy in many anectodes and short explainations throughout the text. The Samurai contends that there is victory only in death. Westerners are confused by this ideology, but Yamamoto spends a great deal of time on this subject of honor in death.\\"Above all, the Way of the Samurai should be in being aware that you do not know what will happen next, and in querying every item day and night. Victory and defeat are matters of the temporary force of circumstances. The way of avoiding shame is different. It is simply death.\\"This is quite confusing to the west, but to the Samurai \\"simply death\\" is understood as honor to oneself, ones master, ones family, and most importantly ones ancestors.The Hagakure isn't for everyone, but I highly recomend it to anyone who has a unending curiosity for different cultures and different understanding of life"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"This has been a long time problem with the American understanding of Japanese Samurai. The Samurai &quot;Code of Ethics&quot; never really existed. This book is based on a romanticized view of Samurai and their way of life, it is not all fact.

Congratulations HA GA KU RE!I appreciate that the title 'The Book of the Samurai' is fairly cheesy, and riding on the back of Tom's 'Last Samurai' (a highly admirable film, incidentally) one is inclined to feel that there is some wobbly 'Samurai Bandwagon' rolling into town and the party had best be avoided, but not so. HA GA KU RE (hidden by the leaves) is a work of immense beauty and wisdom, a rare breed indeed. A book penned around 1700 that is as relevant to your life today as any 'healing' or 'self-help' book will ever be, only MORE so. What HA GA KU RE truly delivers is not hippy-dippy fake compassion and moral guidance based upon the lowest common denominator. What it offers is a 6 O'clock roll call awoken by a cold shower and a mirror shoved in your sleepy face so that you can see yourself all puffed up in the morning and your hair standing on end. You are NOT beautiful, you simply ARE.Page after page this book is filled to the brim with startlingly obvious and brilliantly simple maxims, ideas, quotations and distilled wisdom that will offer a torch-light to anyone out their who is lost and looking to get back to the Way.

And whichever is your chosen Way one thing is sure, it will bring together a number of other areas of your life, or your interest in things Japanese, polish them all up and give them a whole new lease of life.N.B.

Whilst this book is very much \`of its time' and may seem unusual at times to western readers, it has a lot to offer if you take the time to digest it's wisdom properly and think about the ideas enclosed. Far from being about fighting and killing (although these aspects are touched upon) this is about living with a certain peace and honour.

If one manifests the determination, he can move heaven and earth as he pleases. But because man is pluckless, he cannot set his mind to it. Moving heaven and earth without putting forth the effort is simply a matter of concentration.&quot;That's just one of my favorite quotes from the book. There are a lot of similar reflections in the book that give the reader a feeling of the Samurai code. I've read a lot of books on Taoism and Zen, and I find the Hagakure a nice departure from the traditional eastern philosophy books. Whereas a lot of eastern philosophy seems to focus on how one lives the central point of the Hagakure appears to be how one dies. However, its not as morbid as you may think. The focus is on how one reacts, and escapes the pontifications found in most Zen texts. Its a simple read, and it gave me an illuminating insight into the Samurai lifestyle."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"This is a great book however the problem lies with in ther traanslation. the problem is that only 300 of the 1300 phrases were translated.

Also the entire 5th chapter is left out of this translation. I would recomend to everyone to find a better translation than this one."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"As a philosophical book, or a book about a way of living, I think the Hagakure falls short. Yamamoto Tsunetomo often comes across as simply an irritable, grumpy old badger. During his service to his lord, he never participated in a battle (he lived in the Edo period) and he was not really the world's greatest retainer either. Therefore it is difficult to put any merit into his personal ideas and philosophies.If you are looking for a book about the Samurai spirit, or way of the warrior, I highly recommend Code of the Samurai (though the Cleary translation leaves a little to be desired), and the Wilson translation of the Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi.Let me give an example of my viewpoint. The basis of Tsunetomo's idealogy seems to be that the greatest achievement of a samurai is to die for his lord. He goes so far as to say \\"merit lies more in dying for one's master than in striking down the enemy.\\" Granted, he lived in a time of peace, but as a warriors philosophy, this just doesn't ring true. It feels as though he took the Zen/Martial idea of losing all fear of death a little too far. Musashi's viewpoint in the Book of Five Rings seems far more correct. Musashi states that while a warrior should always be prepared for death and willing to die for one's lord, the essence of a warrior is actually in the striking down of an enemy. There is no other point to conflict than victory over your opponent.There is merit in the Hagakure. It is very interesting and useful as a historical text describing how warriors felt and acted in the Edo period of peace. It also contains anecdotes from Sengoku era samurai, which I found very interesting. Also, when Tsunetomo is not going on about rushing to one's death, he does manage a few gems of good advice. For instance, \\"When there is something to be said, it is better if it is said right away. If it is said later, it will sound like an excuse.\\"If you are a samurai collector, then this book belongs in your collection. Just be aware of what you are getting."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"Truely this is the first book if have encountered so far that captures the essence of Bushido so well...most likely due to the fact that it was written by a samurai.

As you may have just read, this book is about the mindset of the Samurai. And really, it isn't about the samurai as in a sense of all samurais lumped together as one group, or even a type of samurai, as it is more about just one samurai, the author. However, many of the reviewers here fail to make the connection with this book to today's trials and tribulations.Much of what Hagakures writes is outdated - instructions and etiquette on murder, suicide, treatment of women, etc. However, there is much of this book that is applicable to today. Look through the absurd passages into the lesson behind the text. Portions of this book that discuss fighting enemies, too, are outdated. But one must make the connection of terms like \`enemy' with struggle or test; etiquette on waking up from a nap doesn't necessarily refer to literally waking from slumber. There is so much in this book that many will never see if they read it without pondering its teachings. The references to specific situations may seem obsolete, but one must look deeper.The Bible passage of not putting a stumbling block before a blind man does directly mean just that. However, a blind man does not necessarily refer to a man without his eyesight. And a stumbling block may not be a physical object. If one can truly read this book without paying so much attention to the writer, and more to translating the deeper meaning between each passage, then this book will change your life. Passages of awaking from sleep, the spirit of an age, tackling obstacles without complexity, form and emptiness, and (my absolute favorite) the lesson of a rainstorm, will undoubtedly bestow a new level of understanding life to any deep reader.I recommend this book for all of the reasons others have previously listed; but I also recommend this book for so many more."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"This is a very interesting book about samurai culture. It is a must read for those who are studying the way of the samurai. On the other hand, care must be taken to understand the figurative meaning of some parts of the book. That is to say, this was a transcription of Musashi Sensei wods by Tsunetomo Yamamoto and sometimes reflect the things were done then. Some passages such as those regarding women and harakiri are good examples of that. They express the prejudice towards women and the way that honor was preserved back then. It should not be seen as a bible of samurai culture, but as a nice picture of how this culture managed to keep some of its most important values such as respect, politeness, honor, courage, some of which are clearly lacking in our culture nowadays.As previously stated, a must read."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"My son loves this book.

I didn't really know what to expect, but the book has some very interesting aspects on life and ways to live, that still work extremely well in todays society. I have at many times found myself in situations described in the book and even though some answers might be a bit hard to understand, the book has given me answers, or perhaps ways to answer/respond, in different situations. It's not really a book you read from cover to cover, but pick up and read a couple of &quot;rules&quot; every now and then, which after a while are in the back of your head, ready for use.I highly reccommend this book to pretty much every one."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"An interesting historical treatise, well translated and engaging. It is filled with the musings of Yamamoto Tsunetomo (1659 - 1719), a samurai retainer of the Nabeshima Clan who later became a Buddhist monk. Translated as \\"In the Shadow of Leaves\\" the various anecdotes cover everything from dying properly to how to avoid yawning in public. The Hagakure was once a secret text known only to the samurai vassals of the Hizen fief. Consequently this is translation offers unique insight into feudal Japan. It's not the easiest reading style-wise, but I suspect that is a result of the translation process. Overall it is very interesting and engaging.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"I read this book when it was near/below freezing outside; I sat on a metal bench. I read with such intensity, that I needed the cold to dedicate my mind to the words I was reading. I was often confused by the writings, where I would think about them in great detail until the message became clear. Each paragraph is very important. It is a short book, but it should take longer to read than the Bible. I read it in two weeks, thanks to the cold, but, still, I missed more than I can imagine. Should your eyes miss one word, or a single thought take you away, you need read the passage again and again. This book will change your perspective... change how you view life. It is VERY philosophical, if you concentrate on the reading. I recommend it to those who need change in their lives, those who feel powerless but especially those who feel they cannot control their thoughts. This book is about concentration, dedication and loyalty. This is an important piece of literature!"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"This book brought me out of a dark age in my life. I was an Infantryman in the U.S Army for a while. In the beginning I was satisfied. Towards the end I became disillusioned and malcontent. I felt like I had wasted my life, my youth. I was miserable. I first read this book during a winter field rotation. Halfway through the book, I was revitalized, and at the same time ashamed of myself. This book gave me a fresh perspective, which allowed me to pinpoint the things that were making me unhappy. I resolved to change and attempt to make the most of my time. The advice and wisdom contained in this book is timeless. What applied to a Samurai in the past still applies to us today. There are several quotes that have stuck with me and have helped me get through a particularly difficult day, here are a few: \\" If a retainer will just think about what he is to do for the day at hand, he will be able to do anything. If its a single day's work, one should be able to put up with it. Tomorrow, too, is but a single day.\\" \\" There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to everything.\\"There are a few dated (O.K a few absurd) pieces of advice in this book. You can easily make the distinction of what can be applied today and what can't. Overall, this book can help put you in the right direction and give you renewed focus. To move forward sometimes you have to look in the past."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"The translation may be a little enigmatic at times, but the core of the material is extraordinary. As a historical document, it reflects on the ideals that defined the Samurai spirit, and laments the loss of this selfless nature."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"I was looking around for a time for a book on ethics that directly spoke to the issues of those in the professional warrior class. Why? Well for those of us in the corporate world, those that have any depth of experience that is, that there are issues of ethics popping up quite frequently.The company that you work for likely presents you with a set of values the day that you start working for them, which is OK, that is if you do not think for yourself. While those values may suffice for many, it is important to remember that it is at the end of the day your choice to believe in those stated values and follow them, it is a part of the work contract that you have with your employer.I for one, am one of those people who do think about the ramifications and consequences of what it is that I do, and what values I do follow, I have to. I have studied the subject as deeply and thoughtfully as I can. When it comes to ethics, the values of some company's managers that say that they follow these values does not always match the truth of their actions, sad but sometimes true.So what happens when you find out your beloved company's values are merely words on a piece of paper, and that your manager doesn't really act in manner that is in line with those values? What do you do? How is one really supposed to deal with the challenges of this kind of work environment?Reading up on the ethics of those who had to fight their way through life, literally, does give one pause to at least think about it, since it was this culture that produced one of the more civilized of society's. (WW II notwithstanding, the murders and the like that followed during Japanese expansionism).Why? They lived in harsh times, and where conduct and honor, (professionalism would be the modern day equivalent), were the measure of a man. (Women also followed the Code of the Samurai). It can be reasonably argued that Japanese society is one of the most polite a standard of behavior that one could come in contact with. I took my time and measured it against every other single military code of conduct that has existed through out time, and found it intriguing. It shares common ground with other texts that speak on matters of ethics.While some advocate religious or spiritual texts for principles and guidance for their careers, and some of those are superlative, I am not knocking them, in fact I applaud them as most are shared by myself. However the challenge is when you are in a tough situation sometimes it is better to just walk away and save your honor.Think about how ethics plays out in your life and how it is measured, are they your ethics? Are they a code of honor that actually honors others, or are they borrowed? How deeply have you thought about your own ethics?"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"I've read various versions of \\"Hagakure\\", and this one is my favorite. Very philosophical and inspirational, delves into the mindset of one whose only dedication is to serving one's master and way, in everyday life, and into one's chosen path, the battlefield."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"Hagakure is a very interesting and enjoyable read which can open up lots of opportunities for discussion and reflection. Enthusiasts of the samurai ways and Japanese history will easily see its value. This translation is by far the most popular. It is very readable and yet not so dumbed down that it loses the enigmatic spirit of the original.It is important to note, however, that even though here in America the book is often marketed as \\"The Book of the Samurai,\\" the work itself is representative of the opinions and principles of Tsunetomo himself. All manner of samurai thought and tradition is not found in full in this book alone, in fact, Tsunetomo's approach was considered rather extreme even for his own time. The practice of suifuku (seppukku upon the death of one's lord), for instance, was declared illegal because of its being overkill. Tsunetomo was of the opinion that it was a sign of utmost respect, but many other samurai would have disagreed because of its impracticality (seriously, the whole clan would cease to be!).I'm saying all this simply to remind readers that Hagakure is not such a general and encompassing work on the samurai culture as it is often made out to be. I recommend it to anyone interested in the samurai, but I also recommend much further reading."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"The \\"hidden leaves\\" of Yamamoto Tsunetomo were collected, between 1710 and 1716, by a young samurai. Tsunetomo had been a samurai himself, when his original master died. Prevented by imperial command fromfollowing his lord into death, and unable to accept the new lord, Tsunetomo withdrew into monkhood. This collection summarizes the wisdom gained in his career.This book collects passages, a few lines to a page long, on a wandering range of topics. Some reflect on historical events, others on proper behavior, yet others on Zen and bushido. The range of topics appeals to me, making it easy to open the book at random and read until something touches on my current thoughts.One recurring theme is acceptance of human failure, with examples on pp 28, 42, and 113. By analogy, a wooden beam may be a little out of true or hold little knots and weeps, but still be strong and sound - perfect boards are rare, and very rarely needed. He also acknowledges (p.52) that \\"great genius matures late,\\" that one can not reach the highest achievements without twenty or thirty years of development. This has meaning for me personally, and I hope for the best.I have a few reservations about this translation, no matter how much I like it. It abridges the original 1300-plus passages down to 300, and abandoned the traditional organization of passages. I appreciate the brevity, but I wonder how much this non-native translator may have sacrificed in the abbreviation.This is an important look into the samurai's heart and mind - I do not see that becoming a monk ended his life as a samurai.

It connects you to history and should be compared to Machiaveli's work."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of the 17th century Samurai! While some of this material evokes a Zen-like sense of clarity and wisdom, other passages seem just plain ridiculous to my modern Western mind. I found that the constantly recurring references to ritual suicide, while ghoulishly interesting at first, grew more and more repulsive as I read through the book. In the end the fierce samurai come across as nothing more than a bunch of mindless robots. In the politics of old Japan, the samurai were just cannon fodder to be moved around from battle to battle. Their masters expected then to follow orders without thought or hesitation, be it attacking a castle or spilling one's guts to atone for some minor infraction of the rigid warrior code. In the end the whole &quot;seppuku&quot; thing is just too tiresome to put up with anymore. Despite all the spooky ceremony attached to the samurai method of suicide, the act remains what it has always been - the coward's way out of difficulty. Rather than sticking around to suffer with shame and embarrassment (and just maybe figure out a better way to conduct his affairs) the proud, stiff-spined samurai drops through the convenient trapdoor provided by suicide. &quot;Hagakure&quot; offers us a look into an alien world, a way of living (and dying) far removed from ordinary everyday experience. In many ways it is strange and repulsive, and yet, like so many other repulsive things, it manages to be very interesting."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"This book is a series of the most &quot;interesting&quot; excerpts from a much larger japanese version. Tsunetomo's thoughts are interesting, although occasionally a bit odd when compared to other writers on the same subject. Also, the ideas about combat, and courage are hard to pay attention to, as the author never fought in battle. Nevertheless, this book is very much worth reading. Also, fans of Yukio Mishima will want to read Hagakure for insight into Mishima's attitudes"},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"This book was written in the 18th Century by a monk. It was thus written long after the Samurai had ceased to be real warriors: the age of feuding clans had ended early in the 17th Century. The kind of lifestyle described in this book by the author Tsunetomo is quite simply a lifestyle that was never led. While it is not entirely 'pure imagination', it is a work that focuses on all the most extreme and suicidal examples of Samurai behaviour. The author was trying to 'bring back' a macho ideal of bushido that had in fact never existed. He was upset by the way that the Samurai class had lost their martial edge. Unfortunately, his own biases distort the truth of how Samurai of previous eras lived their lives. We have a great deal of evidence from earlier periods pointing out that the Samurai enjoyed the pleasures of life, and tended to behave as humans, unlike the robotic and slavish picture portrayed by the author. To give a Western analogy, his book is like the works of 19th Century Europe which romanticize the lives of Medieval knights: attributing knights with single-minded devotion to the Code of Chivalry and submission to their 'ladies'; while in reality the Code of Chivalry was never really formulated, and the 'ladies' were other men's wives. I give this book two stars because it is of some use in understanding what an 18th Century Japanese bookworm thought the old Samurai were like, and there is some cultural interest in that. If you want a book that gives a real picture of Samurai duties, lifestyle and obligations, then read the 'Code of the Samurai' which was written in the 17th Century, which, although a time of peace under the newly-installed Tokugawa regime, was only starting to lose its martial traditions. By the time Hagakure was written in the 18th Century, the true memory of the 'Age of the Country at War' was very confused and blurred."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"I'm not quite sure I undertand how in the transition from hardcover to paperback, the family crest on the front got replaced by the biohazard emblem?

The world today would be a much better place if more people were to live their lives in this manner."},{"Title":"Hagakure","review":"Hagakure is a very interesting book in the genre of \\"The Art of War\\" and \\"The Book of Five Rings\\" - on the surface it is about martial valor, underneath it contains broader principles applicable to all facets of life. Similr to \\"The Art of War\\" (or even \\"The Prince\\") the book needs to be taken in historical context - it was written after Tokugawa had unified Japan, as the Samurai were redefining their purpose away from being pure fighters.Some of the stories, or lessons are immediately relevent, such as, \\"A person who knows but a little will put on an air of knowledge. This is a matter of inexperience. When someone knows something well, it will not be seen in his manner. This person is genteel.\\"Others are lost, \\"The master took a book from its box. When he openned it there was the smell of drying clovebuds\\" - Not enough context for this reader to understand the lesson. (To read or not to read - is that the question?)The book certainly falls under the banner of wisdom literature that has stood the test of time.

Kahane\`s books have a layout somewhat similar to the Mesillat Yesharim (The Path of the Just) by Rav Moshe Chayim Luzzatto in the sense that there is a style of focus of: defining the desired trait, the division of its elements, the manner of obtaining it within, and the factors that detract from obtaining the trait. Kahane follows an authentic Jewish intellectual process to outline and define the stages to a desired outcome. Of course Kahane's focus is not Luzzatto's focus. Luzzatto's aims are for the private metaphysical benefit of the reader and he stays in that direction. Kahane's aims are for the private, communal and secular application benefits of the reader, this clearly places Kahane in a North American Yiddishkite and separates him from the historic Euro Yiddishkite. It makes Kahane so singular and appear to be so out of sync with the mainstream of the orthodox. But Kahane is well grounded in Torah and is not off course at all, and he provides the bridge for Jews to link with authentic Torah without the timid culture of the Diaspora shtetle which due to a long exile had prevailed over the Jewish intelligentsia. These books explain why the orthodox base and secular Jews have always been wary of Kahane and it was quite evident by his own words that he understood their angst. Kahane represents empowerment, courage, and independence attractive to the youth, whereas the orthodox and secular communities are conditioned towards accommodation and compromise, more a norm for those older weighed with commitments or benefiting materially from their status quo, no wonder he really scared the willies out of them. It is now more clear to me, why the Israeli elites and media so misaligned and defamed him. Because Kahane wanted a reform in Yiddish culture, and had conceived how to keep it linked to Torah, they really did have a serious reason to fear him, because for many of those Israelis he represented a potential psychological revolution should he attract the young back to the \\"grandpa's religion\\" they ran away from and now relentlessly misrepresent. The loss of Kahane have left many who shared his dreams of a real Jewish sovereign Torah based nationalism which is not an aping of the non Jewish nationalism without a guide, these books are a poor substitute for the power in the man himself."},{"Title":"The Wonder of Weather","review":"The first section on weather proverbs was great fun.

Based on personal experience, I would agree. I confess that I managed to get a BA and MA at an elite American university without coming across an academic treatment of the Acadian story. I've been teaching for 16 years at a top flight American high school, and the Acadian tragedy has never been part of the curriculum.Faragher's book offers a compelling narrative of a people, living on the border between the French and British colonies in America, who realized early on that they had little interest in the global conflict that might make them temporarily part of one empire and then subjects of another. All they wanted was to farm and be let alone. (Faragher provides a wonderful ethnographic description of the Acadian cultural world that was largely destroyed).There is something comic about Faragher's descriptions of the interchanges between the Acadians and the governors sent by Britain to rule them. Repeatedly, the crown required that the Acadians take an oath of loyalty. Repeatedly, the Acadians offered the following response: we are happy to pledge obedience to the king, but with the understanding that we will not take up arms in the case of warfare between the British, the French, and their respective Indian allies. As Faragher explains it, the successive British officers were puzzled, annoyed, and angered by this response for about half a century, but couldn't figure out what to do about it. The British needed a local population to economically support their fortifications, they didn't want the Acadians to move to territories of their French adversaries, and New England was interested in trade with the Acadians. For several decades, local British commanders would report that the Acadians were insolent, but then accommodate themselves to Acadian declarations of neutrality.The \\"Great and Noble Scheme\\" was the horrific plot to resolve what might be called \\"the Acadian problem.\\" It is hard to read Faragher's vivid description of the exile of the Acadians without thinking of the more familiar story of Jews being herded on to trains and sent for resettlement in Poland. The men were arrested, the women and children forced to report, and then crammed onto ships in numbers that could not be accommodated. Families were divided, and died of disease and malnutrition on the journey; they were abused and imprisoned when they arrived in the various American colonies that did not want them. This may not have been a plot to purposely murder the Acadians, but half the Acadian population died in the process, and Faragher explains that it was a carefully planned early version of \\"ethnic cleansing.\\" He makes the case that this narrative belongs in American, and not just Canadian history (after all it was largely plotted by New Englanders seeking fertile lands for settlement). One can imagine this case study considered alongside other American incidents of removal and dispossession: the Trail of Tears and the internment of Japanese-Americans. It might make for an interesting comparison because race was not an issue in the Acadian case. This is a superb documentation of the Acadian story. Faragher makes the argument that their exile deserves a more prominent place in the historical narrative of early America."},{"Title":"A Great and Noble Scheme: The Tragic Story of the Expulsion of the French Acadians from Their American Homeland","review":"A great read...couldn't put it down.

Here's in broad terms is what happened, Frenchmen settle in Newfoundland, then called Acadia and in contrast with the Puritan settlers in New England they work with the indigenous people, they ask where they could settle and not be a bother, work out agreements regarding hunting, farming etc. This contrast between Puritan interaction with the Mikmaq and the French interaction is a sub-text that runs throughout the book and is very illuminative of the differences between the two sets of Europeans. Basically the French in Acadia treat the Indians like people (imagine that!), while the Puritans of New England, along with the English, war against them. For example, the French being French their hearts soon turn to love, and as the local Indian woman are smokin' hot the French want to marry them of course! Such interactions being so rare among the Puritans the John Smith Pocahontas affair becomes noteworthy and is rhapsodized about even today. In contrast, the French fall for the Mikmaq woman in such numbers that intermarriage is not even worthy of a Gallic shrug much less a misty eyed mythos. Being good Catholics marriage means conversion, so many Indians convert the Church asks them to slow down! They even send over some Jesuits to oversee the conversions, to guarantee a solid foundation in the Faith. Again, in contrast the Puritans seem unable to get along with the Mikmaq and war against them.Imagine that!The Acadians work to stay neutral and avoid conflicts with everyone, this is successful until the English and their Roundhead allies in New England won't allow it, guess why....money! The following blurb from the Pennsylvania Gazette, Sept 4, 1755 tells you all you need to know:\\"We are now upon a great and noble Scheme of sending the neutral French out of this Province, who have always been secret Enemies and have encouraged our Savages to cut our throats. If we effect their expulsion, it will be one of the Greatest Things that ever the English did in America...\\"To get the full import of the above citation mess up your hair, bug out your eyes and read it with a maniacal tone. That's some scary writing, what's even scarier is it assumes the readers will agree this is a good thing! Sadly, the Roundheads and their minions win, and disperse the Acadians to the winds amidst much suffering.

But why is this ascribed to 'American history' and why does the author claim it was the first 'American' ethnic-cleansing? The Acadians did not live in the land that became the United States of America. They lived in a land that became part of Canada. THe story of the Acadians is very much a Canadian story and if it isn't Canadian than it is a part of English history.It seems like this book set out to slander America and to tar America with a negative brush, rahter than to lay the blame where it deserves to be layed, at the foot of the English colonialists. Americans had nothing to do with what was done to the Canadians and the fact that the author sets out to write a piece of propoganda to slander a country that didn't exist and insult the national heritage of a people, the Americans, who lived elsewhere, is both sad and immoral in itself.Canadians and the English should take responsibility for what was done to the Acadians rather than blaming others. This books faulty analogies and attempts to pretend that the Acadians were living a social utopia full of multi-culturalism and diversity is a further perversion of history. There was no such thing as multi-culturalism or 'diversity' theories in those days.Seth J.

The Acadians actually tried to remain neutral in the series of conflicts known as The French and Indian wars between the British and the French for control of Canada and North America. Acadians preferred trading to war. They continued their commerce with the French in Quebec and France, with the British and, also, with New Englanders. Acadians prospered with this economic freedom.Most historic accounts of the 1755 expulsion focus on the actual incident and what happened subsequently to the Acadians who were \\"scattered to the winds\\" in boats where they sailed to ports on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Faragher's history takes the time to describe the nature of the \\"neutral\\" Acadians prior to the expulsion, or those who wanted to remain free and aloof from the continental conflicts.Faragher describes how the Acadians became victims of the schemes some claim were premeditated by British Lieutenant Governor Charles Lawrence (1709-1760) and Massachusetts Governor William Shirley (1694-1771).Using a classic propaganda campaign to stir up negative news about the Acadians, Faragher describes how Lawrence and Shirley preyed on colonial anti-French sentiments of the time. Lawrence used weaknesses he perceived in the Acadian social or political systems to justify writing a deportation order, forcing them out of the property they developed during over a century of settlement in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley region.Back in Massachusetts, Governor Shirley sought the assistance of John Winslow to supplement the British troops in Nova Scotia, thereby contributing to the Acadian expulsion scheme. Recruitment of Massachusetts militia began in early February, 1755, immediately after the colony's Assembly voted to approve an expedition to Nova Scotia in a secret session, writes Faragher. Winslow was a highly regarded New England citizen and a seasoned military man. Due to his good reputation, he quickly recruited about 2000 Massachusetts militia to join him and the British in executing the \\"Great and Nobel Scheme\\" of 1755, writes Faragher. Winslow's recruits were motivated by clerics and others who preached against the Acadians who were Roman Catholics. \\"French Catholics must be evicted from L'Acadie at the muzzle of our guns and at the point of our Swords\\", wrote Governor Shirley on February 18, 1755.Lawrence supposedly ordered the Acadian expulsion without authority to do so, but modern historians have tried implicating the British Crown in the incident.Faragher keeps the horror of Le Grand Derangement alive with this well documented accumulation of data about a horrible incident in America's colonial history."},{"Title":"A Great and Noble Scheme: The Tragic Story of the Expulsion of the French Acadians from Their American Homeland","review":"This is a readable, well-researched history that lets us look at the well-trod landscape of colonial history in British North America from a novel and revealing perspective.In its own right, this is an interesting story with much vivid detail - which was undoubtedly a challenge for the author given the lack of detailed written source material for Acadia, especially as compared to Canada, New England, or even Newfoundland. The author does a good job of suggesting some of the deeper and more abstract historical analysis he gleans from his work without overburdening the story itself.There are some places where the author's own perspective is clearly revealed, as well as places where he brings some baggage from being an American rather than a Canadian looking at this relatively unfamiliar history (for example, he suggests intermarriage between the French and Native Americans in Acadia was unusual even by comparision to the rest of Canada, when such intermarriage was quite common in the Canadian interior). I suspect some of the analytical points look much different to those more steeped in Canadian history and its themes.But the book is most interesting read together with histories of New England or Canada. The Acadian story highlights some of the choices made that altered the cultures of each area, such as the differing relationships with Native Americans, or the differing relationships with the mother countries. For those interested in more popular and accessible history, I might suggest reading this together with \\"The Unredeemed Captive\\", for example.In a number of cases, I would have enjoyed still more attention to some of the relationships between the settlers and their land and transplanted political institutions, and Faragher's work only begins to scratch the surface. The fact that the signeurial tenure system did not prosper in Acadia while it became well established in the St. Lawrence River Valley, for example, is an area where still more detail would have been welcome. Likewise, the adoption of quasi-representative government along the New England model (and the later quashing of this representation because of the Acadians' Catholicism) is an area rich for further investigation and review. At the same time, whenever one wants yet more detail in a 400 page work of history, the author has a success on his hands!"},{"Title":"A Great and Noble Scheme: The Tragic Story of the Expulsion of the French Acadians from Their American Homeland","review":"Being descended from French Canadians, I had more than a passing interest in the heartbreaking saga of the Acadian people. In \\"A Great and Noble Scheme: The Tragic Story of the Expulsion of the French Acadians from Their American Homeland\\" author John Mack Faragher traces the long and troubled history of these truly unique people. Determined to remain neutral in the ongoing struggle between the British and the French for supremacy on the North American continent, the Acadians constantly found themselves at odds with officials on both sides of the conflict. Yet the reality was that for decades the Acadians led a peaceful, prosperous and largely independent existence, forging alliances of convenience with both local Indian tribes as well as French and British interests depending on the circumstances.Over the years the Acadians insistance on remaining neutral became more and more unacceptable to local British officials and ultimately the Acadians would be viewed as a thorn in their side. Many of these officials called for drastic measures to deal with the Acadian problem. In fact, plans were in the works to expel the Acadians from their land as early as the mid 1720's. But as events unfolded the actual removal of the Acadian people would not begin in earnest for another three decades.\\"A Great and Noble Scheme\\" is a meticulously researched and well written book. John Mack Faragher has succeeded in capturing the essence of these tragic events. Much like the Cherokee \\"Trail of Tears\\" that would occur nearly a century later, the removal of the Acadians from their adopted homeland in L'Acadie is a cruel and disturbing chapter in the history of this continent. At the time British officials attempted to justify their actions as a \\"cruel necessity\\". Many historians would argue that the expulsion of the French Acadians is a clear case of ethnic cleansing. I suggest you read \\"A Great and Noble Scheme\\" and draw your own conclusions. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Great and Noble Scheme: The Tragic Story of the Expulsion of the French Acadians from Their American Homeland","review":"John Mack Faragher examines the colonization of Nova Scotia by French peasants in the seventeenth century and how their occupation of this strategically important peninsula eventually resulted in their forced expulsion by the British military -- an event that Faragher regards as an instance of \\"ethnic cleansing,\\" if not outright genocide.Faragher delves deep into colonial archives to locate obscure source material that brings to life a people who were at best semi-literate. He does so by drawing on government correspondence (between colonial administrators and government officials in London and Paris), on the personal diaries of British soldiers, on the memoirs of French missionaries, and on letters written by the few literate Acadians, among other sources.More than previous writers, Faragher stresses the intimate relationship between the Acadians and the local Micmac Indians, with whom the Acadians intermarried much more frequently than thought originally.He also emphasizes the leading role played by New England \\"Yankees\\" in carrying out the expulsion, showing that the event was hardly a purely British operation.He traces the Acadians' repeated efforts to secure their New World homeland by swearing an conditional oath of allegiance to the British crown -- allegiance in exchange for wartime neutrality. To do otherwise, Faragher repeatedly notes, would have been for the Acadians to invite attack from the French military and their Indian allies . . . as did indeed happen at the village of Beaubassin, when Indians under French command burned the village in an event that mirrors the \\"burn-the-village-to-save-it\\" mentality of the Vietnam War (my comparison, not Faragher's).The book is heavily documented, complete with detailed endnotes and bibliography; and despite the academic trappings it reads like a swashbuckling novel.As a professional historian, I highly recommend this book to scholars and laypersons alike."},{"Title":"A Great and Noble Scheme: The Tragic Story of the Expulsion of the French Acadians from Their American Homeland","review":"I have been searching for books on the early history of Canada, and this was one of the few I have found that is, #1, still in print, and #2, about a specific event. Most of the history of Canada books I have found are very general, and give overviews of events, instead of getting really involved in a particular period or geographic area.

On the North American continent, the treatment of native Americans amounted to one form of such cruel displacement from home and prosperity, that of African slaves another. But few remember the clearest case of tragic forced removal as government policy in North American history: the treatment of the tens of thousands of French-speaking Acadians living in Nova Scotia in the 1750s, the central topic of Faragher's book.The ethnic divide here was one of religion, language, and political affiliation as well as race. The Protestants of New England feared attacks from the Catholic French forces in North America, and had suffered defeats against them before. The Acadians by their language and religion seemed more naturally allied with the French crown than the English, and British officers and governors constantly suspected them of sedition and treason. The Acadians had also intermingled freely with local Indian tribes, something much rarer in the English settlements. Before the French, New Englanders had feared the natives at least as much, so the native element did not help improve relations.The other clear element in the ultimate expulsion policy was one of greed: Acadians were clearly prosperous, their farmlands producing great plenty; the prospect of free developed land was surely a strong motivating factor in the displacement. But this seems to have been lost in the event itself - in the end it was only years afterward that English settlers came to claim it, and much longer before they learned how to prosper there.Faragher does a wonderful job of describing the early history of the settlers, the first families who came in the 1600s, and additions through the years. After several exchanges of sovereignty, Nova Scotia finally fell into the hands of the British, who demanded a loyalty oath of the inhabitants. The Acadians were happy to be good subjects, but refused to swear to take up arms against their fellows, and constantly insisted they were entitled to a modified version of the standard oath, a constant source of irritation to those in the British bureaucracy not attuned to local custom and feelings. The Acadians had a natural streak of independent feeling coupled with close community ties, using local representative councils to present a unified front to their governors.The irony is that this expulsion of \\"traitors to the king\\", spurred principally by the New England colonies and Massachusetts in particular, happened only a bit over a decade before the rebellion of the thirteen colonies from that king's son. And that time, the French were on the colonies' side.Faragher's account is most enthralling in the chapters covering the preparation for and act of expulsion. The process was clearly meticulously planned by the local British leaders. Adult males were separated from their families for a space of time, lies were told to them about what was happening, then all were boarded on ships and dispersed in small groups to other English colonies, some of which were clearly surprised by the new refugees. Huge fractions of those thus deported died in the process, or not long after arrival; Faragher estimates a total of 10,000 lost. The treatment was truly horrific.The treatment was also greatly reminiscent of the so recent dispersal of victims of Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans was not the original destination of any of the Acadians, but via France and the other colonies, many arrived in Louisiana in the years that followed the expulsion, settling new lands on the Mississippi and gulf coast and developing a new culture from the old Acadian one: the Cajuns. The connection in place and culture over time is haunting; Faragher's book of course predates the 2005 hurricane season.Many of the Acadians settled much closer to home - among the much more numerous French population of Quebec, or in the interior of what are now New Brunswick and Maine. Some returned to Nova Scotia, but were treated as little better than slaves there for a very long time. Faragher covers all this aftermath, both positive and negative, in as thorough a fashion as the early history.While this book has clear villains and victims, as the truth surely does, Faragher spends much time considering the motivations and thinking behind those who caused this to happen; in some ways he makes it all too easy to understand. We prefer to keep what is clearly evil more remote from us, but this is not the story of the Holocaust, communist purges, or other familiar injustice; seeing how such tragedy can happen in a situation unfamiliar yet so close to home would force any reader of this book to come away questioning prejudices, and perhaps a better person for it."},{"Title":"A Great and Noble Scheme: The Tragic Story of the Expulsion of the French Acadians from Their American Homeland","review":"The story of the expulsion of the Acadians from what we now call the Canadian Maritimes is told here with a rare combination of passion and objectivity. Faragher shows how the Yankees and the British, at both the governmental and the individual level, systematically set out to wipe the Acadians from the land -- and from the earth. Looked at with 21st century eyes, this historic episode is clearly seen as a shameful American story of ethnic cleansing. Faragher does not call for collective guilt, but for acknowledgement; yes, this is part of our nations' histories -- Canada, Britain, and the US --it happened here. This is particularly poignant in 2005, which marks the 250th anniversary of the beginning of Le Grand Derangement, where thousands of children, women and men died and thousands more were deceived, robbed, brutally treated, sent into a most painful exile and in some cases held in de facto slavery.

It is a fact-rich retelling of the events. The author provides extensive details, with citations to specific documentary records and specific witnesses, unlike the apologists for the Israelis, who almost uniformly cite anonymous or confidential \\"sources.\\"Mr. Ennes provides a moment by moment description of the attack, its brutality, and its effects on himself and his shipmates. His detailed first hand account of the repeated Israeli reconnaissance, flights prior to the attack, their careful jamming of the Liberty's radio frequencies during the attack, the obvious and prominently displayed American flag on the ship, and the conduct of the Israeli torpedo boat crews in machine-gunning of the ship's life rafts, leads to the inescapable conclusion that the attack was deliberate and premeditated.The book also deals with the efforts by the United States government to cover-up the culpability of the Israeli government in the attack.

A member of the crew from the decommissioned USS Liberty was transferred to this ship. One night, after a few too many drinks, he told me a wild and, at that time, unbelievable story about what had really happened when the Isrealis attacked the USS Liberty while it was steaming in international waters during broad daylight while flying a very large US Flag. I had read the official account in TIME Magazine and thought that he was a liar. Reading this book made me realize that TIME Magazine and the US Government were the liars! If I knew the where abouts of my old shipmate, I would call him on the telephone and ask his forgiveness for thinking that he was the liar. Maybe TIME Magazine was duped into lying to the public, but they printed lies and I believed them at the time.After more than thirty years of following political intrigues, and the lies that shroud the machinations of politicians, it is my opinion that the Isrealis planned the attack on the USS Liberty with the intention of sinking it, with all hands on board being lost. Since it was off the coast of Eygpt, and we were not on friendly terms with that country at that time, the sinking could be blamed on Egypt. With there being no survivors to disput the story, the American public would be outraged against the Arabs. Then, Isreal, being our good ally, would help The US seek revenge against Egypt and it's Arabic allies. That way, they would not have to be the aggressors in the Six Day War, which they were after the sinking of the Liberty did not actully take place as planned.Since reading the book, I have aquired the video tape of the twenty year reunion of the USS Liberty survivors.

Why did the US Government and Israel cover up this terrible event, could the truth be so terrible that the American people would forever distrust the government?The Author makes us realize that if the truth is so terrible, it can be covered up and hidden from us. A call for a Congressional investigation that is honest and truthful is called for and should be undertaken so tragic events like this will never again occur in America's or Israel's history.A great military book and exciting history.

The USS Liberty, which was brutally and intentionally attacked by Israel June 8, 1967. What is the best book on the subject? Assault on the Liberty, by James Ennes, Jr.I read this book from cover to cover in one sitting. Some books are well written, others are compelling, this one is both. Even though Jim Ennes was a member of the crew, so he was able to write about the attack on the ship from a first hand point of view, but he also did his homework and documented the details of this little known piece of history very well.If you have a shred of patriotism, like history that is written with the intrigue of a novel, I strongly recommend this book. It should be required reading for every high school student in the United States."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"Ennes tells a straight-forward, powerful story of a deliberate attack on a US Navy ship. Backed-up by decades of research and countless hours of interviews not only with his USS Liberty shipmates but also with then-members of the American military/intelligence community the tale is riveting and unbelievable -- yet absolutely true.Despite the fact that the Sixth Fleet refused to come to the aid of the USS Liberty, at least one officer attached to the USS Davis (now-RADM Paul E. Tobin - email: 096@ocean.usno.navy.mil; tel 202 762-1020) was awarded the Bronze Star for his heroic actions in combat against an enemy of the United States despite the fact that he was never closer than 400 miles from the battle and he arrived on the scene at least 12 hours after it was over."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"This book is still for sale bythe very fine Institute forHistorical Review.

A member of the crew from the decommissioned USS Liberty was transferred to this ship. One night, after a few too many drinks, he told me a wild and, at that time, unbelievable story about what had really happened when the Israelis attacked the USS Liberty while it was steaming in international waters during broad daylight while flying a very large US Flag. I had read the official account in TIME Magazine and thought that he was a liar. Reading this book made me realize that TIME Magazine and the US Government were the liars! If I knew the where abouts of my old shipmate, I would call him on the telephone and ask his forgiveness for thinking that he was the liar. Maybe TIME Magazine was duped into lying to the public, but they printed lies and I believed them at the time.After more than thirty years of following political intrigues, and the lies that shroud the machinations of politicians, it is my opinion that the Isrealis planned the attack on the USS Liberty with the intention of sinking it, with all hands on board being lost. Since it was off the coast of Eygpt, and we were not on friendly terms with that country at that time, the sinking could be blamed on the Egyptians. With there being no survivors to disput the story, the American public would be outraged against the Arabs. Then, Israel, being our good ally, would help the United States seek revenge against Egypt and it's Arabic allies. That way, they would not have to be the only aggressors in the Six Day War, which they were after the sinking of the Liberty did not actually take place as planned.Since reading the book, I have aquired the video tape of the twenty year reunion of the USS Liberty survivors. The many interviews, especially the one by the ex Chief of Naval Operations, only confirm the legitimacy of this well documented book.As an added concern, the only country to benefit from the 9/11 World Trade Center attack was Israel. After the Muslims crashed the airplanes into the towers, Americans no longer cared about the slaughter of Palestinian people by Israel. I sometimes wonder if the Israeli Mossad was involved in the planning of the WTC attack. Reading this book only adds to my concern."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"On June 8, 1967 (during the Six Day War), unmarked Israeli jets and marked gunboats tried to sink the USS Liberty knowing that the ship was flying the US flag, was in international waters, was unarmed, and was well identified.

As important as this book is, it should not be read alone. Other books about this attack add additional details both major and minor. And raise additional questions. A major question is the deployment of nuclear armed jets. In \\"Attack on the Liberty\\" by James Scott, Scott states that arming the planes with nuclear weapons on an aircraft carrier at the time of the attack was an exercise, Ennes states that nuclear-armed planes on deck were standard procedure on a carrier and that these planes were sent to assist the Liberty but were recalled to the carrier, Peter Hounam in \\"Operation Cyanide\\" states that the planes left the ship to bomb Cairo and when recalled had to land at Cyprus. What really happened? How close were we to a shooting war with the Soviets, Egypt's ally? As to why Israel would attack the Liberty, Ennes' timeline strongly supports that Israel was trying to cover up its attack on Syria in order to seize the Golan Heights. But was this the only reason? The details of Operation Cyanide have never been declassified, but some evidence suggests that the Johnson Whitehouse may have colluded with Israel on a minimally damaging attack on the Liberty in order to give the US an excuse to blame and attack Egypt in an attempt to raise President Johnson's poll numbers prior to the 1968 election. Captain McGonagle of the Liberty reported that the jet attacks were only a couple of passes and lasted six minutes followed by the torpedo and machine gun attack by the gunboats.

Israeli pilots wre recorded as saying that they recognized the ship as American - but were told to attack anyway.The cover up by the Zionist influenced LBJ and Secretary of Defense MacNamara stinks to high heaven. Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State, did not buy it, nor did Admiral Thomas More. The cover up was basically a prelude to 09/11, done by the same Israelis.

Yet, the attack was never investigated by the US Congress? Why did the USA accept the flimsy Israeli excuse of &quot;mistaken identity&quot;?

Two carriers sent fighter aircraft to help the Liberty, but were recalled by President Johnson. Subsequently, motor torpedo boats attacked, firing five torpedos at the Liberty... one hit. 34 were killed in the attack and 171 were wounded.The ship's crew is certain that the ship was knowingly and deliberately attacked by Israel. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and other high U.S.officials agree with the crew. Israel says itmis-identified the ship, thought it was an Egyptian horse transport. The U.S. governmentput a lid on any discussion of the incident, threatening service personnel with court-martial and imprisonment if secrecy was violated.This book displays the events leading up to the attack and some possibilities as to the reason for the attack.

Note that AIPAC is by far the most influential lobbying firm in America and you're labeled an anti-Semite (witness Mearsheimer and Walt's treatment...). Become critical of Israel in Congress and you're likely not to get re-elected (read Congressman Findley's They Dare to Speak Out). Write a book on our beloved \\"ally\\" deliberately and repeatedly attacking a US Navy technical research vessel in international waters in broad daylight with the Stars and Stripes flapping in the wind and you're labeled a conspiracy theorist.Such is the state of public discourse in America today. Most non-historians, I dare say, have never heard of the attack on the USS LIBERTY. In 1967, during the Six Day War, LIBERTY was cruising in the Mediterranean in international waters. Though technically a \\"research vessel\\", it is/was no secret that she was a \\"spy ship\\", fitted with sophisticated communications equipment capable of intercepting signals traffic. After being flown over at low altitude several times by Israeli aircraft (making her identity unmistakeable), LIBERTY was subsequently strafed and torpedoed by Israeli aircraft and torpedo boats, killing 34 US sailors.Distress signals from LIBERTY were received by the USS SARATOGA, which on two occasions launched Phantoms to assist LIBERTY. On both occasions, the rescue planes were called back by Secretary McNamara.Despite the accusations of \\"conspiracy theory,\\" many senior government representatives, including then-Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Moorer, have publicly stated their belief that LIBERTY was attacked deliberately by the Israelis. Ennes provides a moving and thorough account. No student of American history, Naval history, or American foreign policy should miss this book."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"I found this as a used book for a friend of my brother.

Despite the author's evident anger at the trauma he and his shipmates underwent, he manages to remain circumspect about the ultimate causes of the attack and the lack of followup by his own country's military and political establishment. Ennes makes a compelling case for the deliberateness of the attack; perhaps the whole story awaits a Congressional investigation, one which should have taken place years ago and can still take place if interested readers press for one."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"After studying photographs of the damage to the Liberty for over two years I can say Mr. Ennes' desription of the devastation caused by the air attack is accurate. It refutes Israeli claims that it was a cursory 12-14 minute attack carried out by only 4 aircraft and no more than 6 strafing runs. The photos reveal that most of the damage to Liberty, with the exception of the torpedo strike, was caused by rocket fire from the aircraft. The scores of hits to the superstructure and hull from almost every conceivable angle attest to a much more punishing and methodical attack which would have required many more aircraft and strafing runs and much more time to complete. The tremendious extent of the damage supports survivor's statements that the air attack lasted 25-30 minutes casting very serious doubt over the \\"accident\\" explanation for the attack. The jets flying at a typical cruising speed of 500mph would have consumed about 10gal/min of fuel. In 25-30 minutes they would have each burned 1,500 to 2,000lbs of fuel. The pilots wouldn't have used so much fuel over the target unless they planned for it from the beginning."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"The attack on the USS Liberty during the Six-Day War is one of the most unusual events in the history of modern warfare. Traditionally, when US Navy ships are attacked, the results are predictable and swift: the Gulf of Tonkin, Pearl Harbor, The Luisitania, The Maine. But not in this case.James Ennes, a USS Liberty officer who lived through the attack, was the first to write the history of this disturbing event in \\"ASSAULT ON THE LIBERTY\\". This volume, drawn from the eyewitness accounts of the survivors, tells the chilling story of how the ship was sent into Harm's Way, and then abandoned. And afterwards, the survivors were sworn to secrecy.This book is a must-read for anyone who seeks to understand the history the involvement of the United States in the Middle East."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"During the Six-Day War that occurred 37 years ago, an international tragedy failed to capture the public imagination. Israel's deliberate attempt to destroy the USS Liberty and murder its crews is a disturbing episode in the American-Israeli relationship that was willfully suppressed by both sides from entering the general public consciousness.Lieutenant James M. Ennes Jr.'s book is a must to those who wish to apprehend extensively this little-known tragedy. Many Americans are sadly ignorant of this horrific crime committed by a supposedly friendly ally. The historical background of the events leading to the attack and its aftermath are provocatively analyzed. Being a credible eyewitness, one has no reason to doubt the author's testimony.What is profoundly shocking is the deliberate cover-up and obfuscation of this tragedy by both the American and Israeli governments. The latter's inordinately powerful lobby has succeeded in stultifying every attempt to pursue a constructive dialogue on the controversies surrounding this event. As with many of its crimes, Israel was never penalized for this monstrous act which it carried out against its benefactor; despite the overwhelming evidence pointing towards its culpability.Ennes's book is a moving documentation on a forgotten American catastrophe. It persists in its demand for justice for the victims of the USS Liberty murdered by Israel. This is the kind of historical material that deserves to be distributed nationwide.

I have talked to many of the survivors, and find that not one disagrees with the facts as Ennes recounts them. Every survivor that I know of is absolutely positive that Israel knew the ship was American when it attacked it. Much has happened since about 1980 when Ennes wrote the first edition, and everything that has happened since supports Ennes book. For instance, the Navy legal officer and major figure in the Naval Court of Inquiry now says that the Court was fraudulent and a sham and the participants were ordered by higher authority to come to the conclusions it did. During the court, sailors were not allowed to talk freely, but were ordered to answer the questions only. Yet the Naval Inquiry is used as a basis for other inquiries, which all support the lie of the Inquiry and of organized pro-Israeli efforts to discredit the survivors. Ennes did not pick and choose his stories, but included them all -- including the Executive Officer's proclivity for booze, an embarrassment, to be sure. Any survivor will tell you that the facts are there and are ignored by our congress.

The Liberty was in the eastern Mediterranean when Israel Air Force aircraft attacked the ship with rockets and napalm, and Israeli boats torpedoed the Liberty and machine-gunned the empty lifeboats in the water. Ennes claims the attack was deliberate, and was done to keep secret, Israeli operations during the 1967 War. Israel claims the attack was an accident, and that the Liberty was mistaken for an Egyptian ship.Ennes was an officer on the Liberty, and provides a qualified account of the attack, and subsequent efforts to keep the ship afloat. His writing style is fluid, and easy to follow. He also includes many photographs taken during and after the attack. The controversial part of his book is his claim that the attack was deliberate, and that both the United States and Israeli governments subsequently whitewashed the incident. Since the book was written by somebody who was there, I anticipated that Ennes' account would not be entirely impartial. I felt that Ennes made some compelling arguments about the attack including:1) Israeli reconnaissance planes shadowed the Liberty for some time before the attack.2) The Liberty was flying a large American flag and the weather was good.3) Egypt had no ship that was of comparable size and configuration as the Liberty.Ennes bases his claim on circumstantial evidence, since he did not have access to U.S. Navy and Israeli records. Without sufficient counterarguments, it is difficult to ascertain the truth, although it is evident that, at the very least, Israel's actions were extremely negligent.Whether the attack was an accident or deliberate, I feel that the vitriolic accusations thrown at the author are unfair, and that these critics are trying to downplay the incident. Ennes saw 34 of his shipmates killed, and nearly 200 wounded. Whether I agree with his conclusions or not, I can certainly understand his anger. Those who denounce him as a Jew-hater because of his criticism of the Israeli government are insulting American military personnel, and doing a disservice to the Israeli people, who deserve a government and military that are accountable for their actions."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"\\"Assault on the Liberty\\", is a brilliantly written saga of an American tragedy and a national shame. James Ennes Jr., has captured in print his eye witness account of the brutal attack on a United States Navy ship while serving as a commissioned officer aboard the USS Liberty. Thirty four (34) of his, shipmates, friends and fellow Americans were slaughtered while another 171 men were gravely injured in an unprovoked attack by Israeli armed forces.Mr. Ennis goes beyond the span of just providing an accurate account of the event. He reveals the political cover-ups disguised as political correctness which is so prevalent in our country today. His pain and frustration to bring honor, dignity and the shocking truth on behalf of his fallen comrades is documented in clear and concise text which holds the readers attention as he reports the appalling facts. He has concisely documented that the United Stated Government abandoned a ship of the fleet and its crew in their fatal hour of need, and for over 30 years thereafter collaborated in the cover up for the State of Israel.This is a \\"must read\\" for those who seek the truth about American politics and her strange and evil bedfellows.

Expertly written and entirely readable, it is also an unflinching portrayal of the ineptitude (and cowardice) of our politicians and military as well as an eye-opening revelation as to our so-called ally, Israel, and the heights of deception and brutality it will employ to accomplish its ends.Though many apologists from both Israel and the US have tried to explain this incredibly vicious and murderous attack on a noncombatant away as an \\"accident\\" or a typical \\"friendly fire\\" episode, reading this eye-witness account will explode those fantasies and put the lie to their best excuses. It is a sad commentary on the state of our country that heroes like the late Captain McGonagle (Congressional Medal of Honor) and the other highly decorated men who went through this hell, should be disbelieved.

Anyone, in whatever country, who is thinking of making a career in the military would do well to read this book first.It is absolutely heartbreaking to read how the Liberty's officers and men, who thought they were serving their country, were betrayed by their superiors at every turn - with dozens of them losing their lives or suffering permanent injury as a consequence. But it is a story that must be told.In so many ways I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"This amazing book is well written. This should be made into a movie! That this attack happened is a criminal actyet the people responsible have never been brought to justice. Learn the details of the attack from an eye witness.Shame on our government and how it treated the american sailors and the American people."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"The crew of the USS Liberty sustained an abominable experience far beyond the scope of most of us. It is in this sense that such a book might be useful.But the author's understandable zeal for finding WHY it happened has taken him down some paths strewn with speculation and anti-Israel zeal.The author's ire drove him him to dish up dishonest hyperbole against Israel on matters having nothing to do with this tragedy.For example, about 18 years ago, Ennes wrote to a New England newspaper and claimed, among other things that, \\"...It is Israel that daily maims and murders an unarmed population in Palestine. It is Israel that daily bulldozes homes of suspected adolescent rock-throwers.\\"This is, of course, false. But it does serve to show that among the victims of the Liberty incident is objectivity.One might argue that a crew member of the USS Liberty at the time would be in an ideal position to know what happened.But such a notion is like claiming that a crewmember of the USS Arizona on December 7, 1941 was in an ideal position to know what transpired among the officers of the Japanese Imperial Fleet prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, or an NVA soldier during the Vietnam War could understand the inner workings of Robert McNamara.As such, this book was not a huge disappointment, since the reader should expect such a perspective.The passion to explain this attack has led Ennes and others to conclude that it was deliberate.But as radio personality Les Kinsolving once noted, \\"It is as preposterous as the idea that Capt. John Paul Jones would have been ordered by Gen. George Washington to sink the French troop ships bringing soldiers and artillery to help us win our war of independence.\\"So where does one turn for an objective account of this military disaster?The answer is \\"The Liberty Incident: the 1967 Israeli Attack on the U.S. Navy Spy Ship\\" by J. Cristol. The author, a federal judge and former naval carrier pilot, spent 14 years researching every possible source of information on the attack.While others embrace all sorts of theories about why Israel deliberately attacked the ship, Cristol approached the event with the passion of a relentless detective.Liberty IncidentAs for the conspiracy folks, they would be wise to consider the following comment from Adm. Leon A. Edney, USN (Ret.), former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic; and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Atlantic Command:\\"Only those with an ulterior motive can still cling to the conspiracy theories after Judge Jay Cristol's excellent coverage documents each detail that led to the tragic mistaken attack.\\"Nevertheless, this book could have been much worse, as demonstrated by author Peter Hounam's steaming heap of speculation, \\"Operation Cyanide.\\""},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"Though this work has attained classic status among proponents of conspiracy and intrigue, it does no service to the truth. In 1967 a tragic series of errors led to an attack on a US ship by Israeli planes and ships. The book, with apparent attention to detail, explains the attack was deliberate, and could not have been otherwise. But it can be otherwise. No plausible explanation is given for why the tiny nation of Israel, at war for its life against tremendous odds, would complicate matters by intentionally going to war with the most powerful nation on earth. A friendly and supportive nation at that. Nor does the book plausibly deal with the some-13 government and official inquiries which declared the incident a tragic error for which Israel paid reparations and to this day studies as an example of mistakes of war. Our government in on a plot? Of course. Bloodthirsty Israel lying? Of course. Officials involved at all levels of the many inquiries in on it too?? Why yes! In ASSAULT ON THE LIBERTY we hear repeated every sad myth that has arisen since the attack; Israeli aircraft strafed our life rafts, attacks continued after the ship was identified by Israel, and all the rest. These myths have been studied and discarded by more credible sources. The Liberty incident was a tragedy. And like the US downing of an Iranian passenger jet, or the attack by US Jets on our own helicopters during the gulf war, the Liberty incident teaches us about the tragedy and mistakes of war. ASSAULT ON THE LIBERTY, sadly, teaches us little."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"For some time, the United States had had an emergency plan to attack Israel, a plan updated just prior to the 1967 war, aimed at preventing Israel from expanding westward, into Sinai, or eastward, into the West Bank.In May 1967, one of the U.S. commands was charged with the task of removing the plan from the safe, refreshing it and preparing for an order to go into action.This unknown aspect of the war was revealed in what was originally a top-secret study conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses in Washington.In February 1968, an institute expert, L. Weinstein, wrote an article called \\"Critical Incident No. 14,\\" about the U.S. involvement in the Middle East crisis of May-June 1967. Only 30 copies of his study were printed for distribution. Years later the material was declassified and can now be read by everyone, although details that are liable to give away sources' identities and operational ideas have remained censored.Strike Command, the entity that was to have launched the attack on Israel, no longer exists. It was annulled in 1971 for domestic American reasons and superseded by Readiness Command, which was abolished in the 1980s in favor of Central Command (CENTCOM) - which today includes forces in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan and Afghanistan - and the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).As Willy Wonka said \\"It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal!\\"The United States of America, an alleged ally did knowingly initiate and prepare military plans to attack Israel and interfere in here ability to defend herself and deal shattering blow to their enemies. The U.S.S. Liberty was a spyship sent by the treacherous United States Govt into the area to gather data to allow StrikeCom, the arm of the army that would be responsible for initiating this attack to know where to better strike.Its there, it almost happened and the only ones responsible for the Liberty is her Captain who knew exactly why they were spying on Israel and the joint chiefs of staff, its all been declassified so dont try and pretend this is some imaginary Zionist fairy tale.You setup the Maine , Pearl Harbor, even Americans are saying that the United States are the ones behind 911, so maybe you should trash your own goverment over this."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"The latest edition by Mr. Ennes could easily be titled &quot;Assault on the Facts.&quot; The errors in the book range from minor to major, and that doesn't even take into account that by June 14, 1967 the author's mind was made up and he &quot;was convinced that the attack was deliberate, premeditated murder.&quot; (pg. 137.) He claims the Israelis attacked his ship, knowing her to be the American ship, USS LIBERTY. The author allows no room for doubt because he had already concluded the Israelis could not have made a mistake. Yet acknowledgment is made of the multiple U.S. military command, control and communication failures which contributed to the tragic incident. While the U.S. can make mistakes, the Israelis (engaged in a major war) for some reason can not.All one need do is read the book (plus two addendums-1986, now 2002) as well as Mr. Ennes' other published works to understand that the story-telling of events has not only not been consistent, but given the available documentation, not accurate either.Some representative examples of problems are:The author ignored hand-written logs, sworn testimony and messages which directly refute the claim in the book of an Israeli &quot;extended&quot; attack (which he did not witness.) Mentioned in the addendum (pg. 7) is that the 23-page Summary of Events attachment to the JAG endorsement report supports the author's claim. It does not. The summary is taken straight from the 160-page testimony record, which has no mention of any &quot;extended&quot; attack.In the book (pgs. 145-146) there is mentioned a reportedly under oath, but unrecorded, exchange involving Cdr. McGonagle and the court. That only could have been told to the author directly because there would not have been any other individual present (such as another, unnamed, LIBERTY officer as stated.) Credibility also suffers when only part of McGonagle's original 1967 released condensed testimony is used, and not the complete transcript of proceedings, which was available (pg. 146 endnote 1, and pg. 219.)The author initially wrote a non-specific story that LIBERTY overheard IAF aircraft reporting to Hdqs that the ship was American (pg. 220). Then later it became the author personally was told this when it was &quot;whispered&quot; to him by a supervisor, CT Chief Smith (killed in the attack.) It then changed to having personally heard these reports from the intercept operators. Additionally, the author wrote in 1984 that LIBERTY was recording Israeli communications on June 5 relating to the planned attack on the Syrian Golan Heights. This while the ship was still in the central Mediterranean; does the author assume the IDF did not have secure telephone lines between Tel Aviv and Northern Command? Then later the story switched to LIBERTY had orders to not even listen to (or record) Israeli signals; as well as stating there were no Hebrew linguists aboard. Now in the addendum (pg. 17, Errata) the author claims, without any supporting material, that one linguist, NSA civilian Allen Blue (also killed in the attack) knew Hebrew because somehow, somewhere, it has been discovered that Blue supposedly learned it in his spare time.As the LIBERTY'S electronic material officer the author claims the ship had no jamming (ECM) equipment (pg. 218.) Yet NSA has released photos of LIBERTY'S foremast/antenna arrangement, with multiple ECM antennas specifically noted.The author writes Israel issued a &quot;news release&quot; stating Israel asked the US Gov't &quot;for the location of any American ships near the Israeli coast, and had not received a reply.&quot; (pg. 127) Yet no &quot;news release&quot; has ever been produced, or quoted.In the book the author states that the piston-driven A-1 Skyraiders would be the only Sixth Fleet aircraft which would &quot;require ninety minutes&quot; to reach LIBERTY (pg. 240.) Yet it is documented by the Sixth Fleet that the jets would require ninety minutes, and the Skyraiders, a full three hours to do so. Why the difference? The author assumed all aircraft can fly any distance at maximum published speed, regardless of any ordnance load.In pg 116 it is written LIBERTY encountered a Russian destroyer (marked &quot;626/4&quot;) in the early hours of June 9 while ignoring LIBERTY'S log entry of encountering a Russian merchant ship at 4:40 AM, with no mention of this ship &quot;standing by.&quot; The Russian 626 had in fact been trailing/harassing the carrier AMERICA on June 8 near Crete and tagged along when the task group steamed towards LIBERTY during the night. The Russian 626 didn't arrive until late AM on June 9. Revealing an unfamiliarly with naval communication procedures, the author forgot to drop the &quot;/4&quot; (numerical check digit in naval messages) when he copied this later reference of a nearby Russian destroyer from a LIBERTY escort June 9 PM message.To summarize: the author has simply not demonstrated the true story of Israel's attack on an American intelligence ship."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"There have been 10 official investigations since this friendly fire incident to prove that it was an accident. Israel's accusers still can not come up with a reasonable explanation for this incident. The author of this book as well as several reviewers are obviously Jew haters and this is evident by what they write which has nothing to do with the book.None of Israel's accusers can explain why Israel would deliberately attack an American ship at a time when the United States was Israel's only friend and supporter in the world. Confusion in a long line of communications, which occurred in a tense atmosphere on both the American and Israeli sides (five messages from the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the ship to remain at least 25 miles - the last four said 100 miles - off the Egyptian coast arrived after the attack was over) is a more probable explanation.Accidents caused by \\"friendly fire\\" are common in wartime. In 1988, the U.S. Navy mistakenly downed an Iranian passenger plane, killing 290 civilians. During the Gulf War, 35 of the 148 Americans who died in battle were killed by \\"friendly fire.\\" In April 1994, two U.S. Black Hawk helicopters with large U.S. flags painted on each side were shot down by U.S. Air Force F-15s on a clear day in the \\"no fly\\" zone of Iraq, killing 26 people. In April 2002, an American F-16 dropped a bomb that killed four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan. In fact, the day before the Liberty was attacked, Israeli pilots accidentally bombed one of their own armored columnsIsrael apologized for the tragedy and paid nearly $13 million in humanitarian reparations to the United States and to the families of the victims in amounts established by the U.S. State Department. The matter was officially closed between the two governments by an exchange of diplomatic notes on December 17, 1987."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"Ennes's book should be considered more a work of fiction than of fact. He decides in advance that Israel attacked the Liberty in full knowledge that it was an American ship. Ennes maintains that there never has been an investigation of the incident, in spite of the fact that at least five thorough U.S. Governmental investigations (Navy, Congressional Committees, etc.) have been conducted; they all conclude that the attack was due to errors made by both the U.S. and Israel. Ennes, like other conspiracy theorists, want to believe otherwise, and he twists facts, and manufactures others, while ignoring all evidence to the contrary, to prove his point.Ennes, disregarding all available evidence, as well as logic, implicates President Johnson, and high American officials, as well as the captain of the Liberty, in the \\"cover-up\\". There is no plausible motive given for Israel, in the midst of a war of survival, to knowingly attack the vessel of the only country in the world which was friendly to it.To obtain a dependable account of the investigations and their conclusions, read Jay Cristol's THE LIBERTY INCIDENT: THE ATTACK ON THE U.S. SPY SHIP. Cristol is a former officer in the U.S. Air Corps, and is a judge.

If I may, I will quote page 176 of Paul Findley's book: &quot;The cover-up also dogged Ennes in the marketing of his book.

Its author was the deck officer when the attack began. Israel claimed the attack was accidental. But Ennes concludes that the Israelis acted deliberately, knowing the target was American. He cites as evidence the jamming of the Liberty's radio frequencies, the machinegunning at close range of the Liberty's liferafts, the prolonged attack after close examination of the flag and ship's markings, and other details.Officially, the US government accepted the Israeli explanation. But top US government officials who were in office in 1967 agree with Ennes: the attack was deliberate, not accidental. Nearly twenty years ago I wrote an AP story on the Liberty incident that was published in the Los Angeles Times and many other U.S. newspapers. I spoke to Secretary of State Dean Rusk, CIA Director Richard Helms, NSA Deputy Director Louis Tordella, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Moorer. They all told me the attack was no accident, it was deliberate. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara said he had &quot;no recollection&quot; of the Liberty incident. I spoke on the phone to Admiral Isaac Kidd, who presided over the Naval court of Inquiry into the incident, told him what Rusk and the others had said, and asked for his opinion on Israeli culpability. He said &quot;the giants of that time can speak up but I know when to keep my mouth shut.&quot;Earlier this year, Captain Ward Boston, legal counsel to the US Navy Court of Inquiry, was quoted in the Navy Times as saying that both he and Kidd believed the attack was deliberate and that the Court reported otherwise because &quot;officers follow orders&quot;.Was the attack an accident of war or a deliberate act? The dispute has been dragging on for thirty five years, and will probably not be settled definitively until the U.S. and Israel release all their secret files. That seems unlikely to happen any time soon. Meanwhile I recommend that readers read Ennes' book before they make up their minds one way or the other."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"I've read the book and seen the video. The author was an officer on board during the attack. One of the reviewers, the reader from MT, says that no plausible reason was given why Israel would attack a warship of her major ally. If I remember correctly, the writer says that Israel was preparing for its assault to capture the Golan Heights,then in Syria's possession. Israel feared the US intervening upon learning of this plan. USS Liberty was &quot;spook ship.&quot; Her mission was to collect both signal and electronic intelligence. While the US 6th Fleet was pulled by into the western Mediterranean, Liberty steamed into the east Med. It is possible that Israel calculated the Johnson administration, after weighing overall US interests against bringing the matter to light, decided it would not be worth the candle. If true, it reminds world politics is Machiavellian. Decide for yourself. Read the book."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"What would your reaction be if our oldest ally, Great Britain, attacked a lightly armed US military vessel with overwhelming force: a stunning array of jet fighters, bombs, missiles, machine gun fire and torpedoes? And further, once the ship was nearly sinking, attacked lifeboats in the water, spraying them with a hail of deadly fire from attack boats and strafing runs by jets?What would your reaction be to a final butchers bill of 34 US sailors dead and 171 grievously wounded? Would Americans of an earlier era have filled the coffers of Great Britain with treasure as a reward for such a perfidious act?What would your reaction be if you were told that such an attack was not carried out by Great Britain, but by our staunchest ally Israel, supposedly the only democracy in the Middle East?Sadly, this is not fiction. Rather than being the plot line of a Tom Clancy technothriller it's a very real piece of horrific military history from the 1967 Middle East war.Kudos to attack survivor, James Ennes Jr. for this compelling and brutally honest book."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"This book presents plausible answers to several important questions about this amazing event. Facts apparently not disputed include that the Israelis attacked a US warship in international waters, killing many sailors. Almost everything else is disputed by someone.Q1. Did the Israelis deliberately attack a US warship?P.A. The huge disrepancy in size, appearance, and visible equipment between the Liberty and the Egyptian ship the Iraelis claim to have mistaken her for make Israeli claims hard to believe. If they thought they were attacking an Egyptian ship, why were Israeli jamming efforts targeted so specifically against American communication procedures?Q2. Assuming the Israelis thought they were attacking an Egyptian ship, did they obey the Geneva conventions?P.A. The attacks on lifeboats, and various other Israeli actions, violate the Geneva conventions, as well as all rules of war that have been recognized for centuries. They appear to have been motivated by a desire to leave no witnesses. The behavior of Israelis in this attack, as given in sworn statements by American eyewitnesses, bears significant similarities to accounts given by eyewitnesses of others attacked by Israel, which Israelis and their apologists normally dismiss due to alleged racial or cultural inferiority of the witnesses.Q3. Why did other US forces not rush to the defense of the Liberty?P.A. They started to, but were ordered not to by politicians in Washington who were more concerned with 'spin' than with American lives.Q4. Why has this attack never been given an official public inquiry and report by the US government?P.A. The truth is too embarrasing.Q5. What motive could the Israelis have for attacking the Liberty?P.A. Only the Israelis can know for sure. At the time of the attack, the US government wanted to resupply Israel enough to prevent an Israeli defeat, but not enough to enable the Israelis to gain the crushing victory they did. The Liberty was sending back to Washigton information that showed the Israelis already winning, which, if allowed to continue, might have caused the US to stop resupplying Israel. (A recent poll in Israel showed that 72% of Israelis believe the attack was deliberate, and for the above motive.)It is notable that those reviews that show more loyalty to Israel than to truth never try to answer Question 2, but confine themselves to Question 1 (fog of war) and an I-didn't-see-the-answer to Question 5."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"I met the author of this book on a message board on the Prodigy service back in the mid 1990's. After writing a note to him on a message board I immediately came under attack from the Jewish crowd that was hounding him. I was branded by this crowd an anti-semite, Israel hating neo-nazi for having an interest in something I had never heard about so I bought and read the book to see what all the fuss was about.(after reading some of the critical reviews, especially all those from \\"A Customer,\\" I have to wonder if some of those same folks are still hounding him. They sure sound familar).In the past several years I have come across several articles (see below) which indicate Mr. Ennes, contrary to what some would have you believe, is truthfull in his book. To me what's more uspetting than an ally attacking a US ship is the US government not responding to the attack then covering it up.

James Ennes bases the entire book on his alleged encounter at a coffee machine with another Liberty officer in 1974. This man claimed to have been at a Pentagon meeting with Admiral David L. McDonald. In this meeting he claims that William Fulbright stated that Pres. Lyndon Johnson told him that he believed the attack was deliberate.When interviewed by A. JAy Cristol, Senator Fulbright confirmed that he and Johnson weren't on good terms at the time and weren't even talking. McDonald, chief of Naval Operations in 1967 was also interviewed and he &quot;had no recollection of any such conversation with Fulbright. In short Ennes makes claims that are NOT verifiable and this proves the sloppy journalism that this book, Assault on the Liberty, is guilty of.There are many books on this subject that are backed up by facts and evidence, read one of those instead of the book above that is based simply on hearsay and revenge fantasies."},{"Title":"Assault on the Liberty","review":"This book is absolutely junk.

It is only one man's propaganda against a nation he hates.Look at what the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) says about this accidental attack. There have also been too many investigations for any of MR. Ennes' lies to stand up. For example, here are the investigations that found no wrong doing:C.I.A. report June 13, 1967 no malice; attack a mistakeU.S. Navy Court of Inquiry June 18, 1967 mistaken identityReport by Clark Clifford July 18, 1967 no evidence ship was known to be AmericanSenate Select Committee on Intelligence 1979/1981 no merit to claims attack was intentionalNational Security Agency 1981 Mistaken identityHouse Armed Services Cmtee 1991/1992 No support for claims attack was intentionalFriendly fire accidents happen all the time in war. They happened in WW2, in Vietnam, in Desert Storm (most allied deaths were from accidents in this war). Even the other day the US shot down a British Tornado warplane. Was it on purpose?

During the first chapter I seems to be going great, the drama was cleaver and catchy. But suddenly in the second chapter it just stops and all the events seem to be going nowhere. Besides the construction of the language is boring and confusing. It feels like the author worked in this novel for a while, then left it during some years locked in a closet and one fine day decided to complete it, but without being at ease doing so."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"haven't read it yet...but if it's half as good as the sound and the fury it'll be well worth it...."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"One of Faulkner's finest achievements of almost Dostoevskian intensity, second only to &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot;, this anti-war novel is a must read for anyone wishing to understand our century."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"Sent this edition as a collector's gift.

I knew that this was going to be a difficult book but not to the point that it discourages a person to never want to pick up another book. Faulkner's language and structure was not beautiful but forced and didn't seem to come natural like it had for me in his other works. There were times when I was reading when I thought that Faulkner was enjoying himself ramble aboout a non-sensical detail that left me frustrated and wanting to put the book down for good, but I carried on and finished the book.The book had its moments but not enough of them to make a clear and understandable story for me. Read at your own risk of being completely disappointed with Faulkner's A Fable."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"A Fable: Another very difficult read by William Faulkner. As in his other novels, I feel as a member of an extraterrestrial race trying to understand the language of humanity. Or maybe it's the other way around, Faulkner is from another (better) planet. Faulkner speaks for all of us, about all of us, but uses a language that has not yet been invented. Think about people living in Vienna in the 1820's who happened to listen to Beethoven's last quartets or piano sonatas. It took over a hundred years for these pieces to become routine pieces to play or record. Same here. We have to struggle with his writing because it comes from another place, space, world. But it does show profound knowledge of man's affairs and struggles.The most amazing feature of his writing, to me, is the lack of time parameters. He reached the peak of artistic use of this technique with the beginning of Sound & Fury, but the Fable is a good example as well. What happens happens many times, in different parts of the book, and in the same sentence often one finds links to three or even more threads, episodes with a three-legged horse in Kansas are knitted together with a woman in France, 1918, a piece of bread, a minister and the FBI! Of course you will not get it, this is the whole point, this is a real BOOK not a story. There is a hidden universe in almost every sub-section, and to add to the universal message of this work, the names of those involved are rarely used. To give an example on how broad the scope of this work is, let's try to make a movie out of this parable:it will last 1/2 hour and suck for the most part. Instead, read Faulkner as you would read a book in a foreign language, with a pencil and paper on your bedside table, take notes, reread often. There is no rush, quite the opposite, the more you save for tomorrow the better your week will be!"},{"Title":"A fable","review":"I'll start this review by saying that I don't pretend to be a literary critic but am simply an avid reader. This is my second Faulkner novel having read The Sound and The Fury twice many years ago. This won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize which has been done only a few other times. I had high expectations as I think so highly of The Sound and The Fury and Faulkner is clearly one of the great twentieth century authors.I was also fascinated by the topic of the Christ analogy in World War I. Finally, Faulkner considers A Fable to be his masterpiece.I was prepared to reread where necessary and I was prepared for a difficult book.Despite all this, I truly hated this novel. It is an extremely dense novel where absolutely nothing is spoon fed to the reader. Every day that I read this I found to be an immense chore. I love reading but could only stand to read A Fable at a pace of around 20 pages per day. While reading it, I described it to friends as sapping my will to read.In the end, I consider it a noble failure. Perhaps only a great writer like Faulkner is ambitious enough to fail so completely. Despite reading the entire book and even rereading large chunks of it, I found it completely unenjoyable.As far as describing the plot, I'll simply quote the Wikipedia entry which is a good summary. POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING: Though the ending is no surprise, it is described in the following entry.---A Fable is a novel written in 1954 by the American author William Faulkner, which won him both the Pulitzer prize and the National Book Award in 1955. Despite these recognitions, however, the novel received mixed critical reviews and a reputation as one of Faulkner's lesser works.[1] The author, on the other hand, spent over a decade and tremendous effort on A Fable, and considered it his masterpiece when it was completed.Historically, it can be seen as a precursor to Joseph Heller's Catch-22.The book takes place in France during World War I and stretches through the course of one week. It tells the stories of \\"Corporal Zsettslani\\", who is representative of Jesus. The Corporal orders 3,000 troops to disobey orders to attack in the brutally repetitive trench warfare. In return, the Germans do not attack, and the war is simply stopped when the soldiers realize that it takes two sides to fight a war. The Generalissimo has the corporal arrested and executed; he is representative of leaders who use war solely to make themselves stronger (he invites the German general over to discuss how to start the war again). Before he has him shot, the Generalissimo tries to convince the Corporal that war can never be stopped because it is the essence of humanity.----Obviously several people consider this to be a masterpiece and I certainly don't see that as a ridiculous opinion. I simply couldn't warm to it at all and I assure you that I enjoy difficult but rewarding fiction.I read a blog entry by someone who read all the Pulitzer winners in a five year period. I'm paraphrasing but they described A Fable as the one that almost sunk them.Masterpiece to some but noble failure to me."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"I've read some other novels by Faulkner, and this is the first away from Yoknapatawpha. Personally, I like most of the time difficult reading, with which I can struggle to understand it, even when sometimes (like this) I don't get it at all. I find that is brave in an author, to write whatever his head produces, without caring if the reader is going to get it. I think Faulkner wrote a great part of this novel without caring. The story is captivating in its resemblance to jesus life not quite accurately, but in the exact level to find it believable. And it shows how a single life is important for the rest of us."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"No wonder there is so little said about this award-winning Faulkner work. It is a chore to read. Only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story. Worse than that, the characters are like Rorschak blots with the Christian mythology mixed in. Stick with Faulkner's southern writings for characters who remain in your memory and images that are profound."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"I must agree that, at times, the experience of reading _A Fable_ is much like feeling one's way through a very dark tunnel. However, there is indeed a light at the end of that tunnel; as with many of Faulkner's works, the individual stories that make up the novel dont come together until the last hundred or so pages. It takes a very patient reader to glean the important details from the beginning and middle of the novel, and to remember those details when they emerge again later in the book. One must also be fairly well-acquainted with Christ's passion in order for a true understanding of the correlation to reveal itself (which, in many places, it didn't for me). Contrary to the book's selling-points, Faulkner is not merely retyping the Christ story in _A Fable_. He's updating a myth (or &quot;fable,&quot; if you will), and using his narration to describe humanity's condition in mid-century (cf. many paragraphs w/ 1950 Nobel Prize speech). This is a long, tedious, and fanatically detailled narrative, but a great novel that pays off with a terrific closing 50 pages for the patient reader. Both the new and the acquainted should be prepared for Faulkner at his most brilliant and difficult."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"It seems every modernist attempted to write a great work concerning the great war (except fitzgerald, who didnt get to go himself). Faulkner's attempt may be second only to Hemingway's &quot;A Farwell to Arms.&quot; &quot;A Fable&quot; is classic, which won the pulitzer prize,has long been overlooked simply because it represents a change from Faulkner'susual subject matter. In reality though, it may be his second greatest work behind &quot;the sound and the fury.&quot; THis work is a brillian anti-war novel that looks at wars affects both on soldiers and civilians, and even on religion. A must read for any fan of Faulkner or modernism."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"I am not entirely sure why this book recieved some of the lousy reviews it did. This book is brilliant, it requires more from the reader than passive reading, so if you are looking for a story you don't have to think about look elsewhere. Anyone familiar with post-Great War literature will find this book to be par for the course. Dos Passos's \\"Three Soldiers\\", comes easily to mind. Don't pay attention to the other reviews, this book won awards for a good reason. If you read the book and find yourself frustrated go back and reread sections. Literature is not always meant to be read in a passive state. This book requires active reading and should not be taken lightly. This book does carry a message about the horrors of war, but also our own individual responsibilty in allowing those horrors to go forward."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"At nine o'clock one morning in the spring of 1918, a regiment of the French army - every man below the rank of sergeant - refuses to take part in a futile assault on the German position. Strangely, the German line opposite fails to take advantage of the situation with a counter-attack, and by noon that day no shots are fired along the entire French line. By three o'clock in the afternoon, the entire western front has fallen silent. It emerges that a saintly French corporal, together with his twelve apostles, has been making the rounds of the Allied forces (and apparently the German forces too) spreading by word and deed a gospel of non-violence and universal brotherhood. The troops, it seems, have understood that they can stop the killing simply by laying down their arms. Naturally, this is anathema to the military hierarchies on both sides, who (tipped off by the Judas among the disciples) are already making covert plans to resume hostilities. The generals, after all, have a living to make and a war to run.\\"A Fable\\" is an allegorical novel about the conflicting impulses that exist within each one of us. The French corporal represents man's impulse towards unconditional love and brotherhood; or, to put it another way, he's the \\"champion of an esoteric realm of man's baseless hopes and his infinite capacity - no: passion - for unfact\\". Like Jesus, the corporal holds out the light of selfless love to humanity, but he's doomed to suffer the consequences. For within every man, too, lives the desire to get on in the world, an egotism which produces conflict, wars and armies. This impulse - represented in the novel by supreme Allied general, who is the corporal's father and the author of the quote above - will always conquer in the world of brute facts, will always prevail, but the example that Christ and Faulkner's corporal offer to humanity can never be extinguished. \\"I'm not going to die,\\" says one of the corporal's disciples at the end of the book. \\"Never.\\"\\"A Fable\\" is a difficult, audacious and profound book. If complex meditations on the human condition are your idea of a good time, give this one a try."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"You don't read Faulkner as much as you work your way through Faulkner; at least that's my experience. The sentences are often over a page long, the punctuation is highly arbitrary, the spelling is suspect, the words are frequently archaic or unfamiliar (sometimes almost unheard of), the concepts are convoluted, the stories are never straight-forward, and it is often hard to know who he is even talking about at various points. He makes references to literature, myths, the Bible and other things without attempting to hint what he is talking about. This book is Faulkner at his most obtuse and bizarre, and best!. All of this can be very off-putting, but this is just Faulkner being Faulkner!Why in the world should anyone even read this book? Good question! If you love Faulkner, by all means read it. If you are unfamiliar with Faulkner, give it a shot, but beware! He did win a Pulitzer Prize for the book in 1954, so it is supposed to be good - maybe that's one reason. You're curious about one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, a Nobel Prize winner for literature - that's another good reason.I really like Faulkner. I've read 6 or 7 of his major works over my lifetime and am never failed to be fascinated by him. (My Faulkner favorite is 'A Light in August', which is also one of my all-time favorites of any book by any author.) I have no idea how his mind can generate the kind moods and slants on things that it does, and I actually like not knowing where he is going. I am fascinated by his use of the language, the crackling dialogue, his exquisitely passionate and elongated style, as well as his brilliant dry humor. Although I am NOT in love with his existentialist outlook, I confess it can make for great stories, some of which are very tall stories as well.'A Fable' is about WWI, instead of his usual subject, the Old South. Surprisingly, it takes place in France for the most part instead of Mississippi, although an intriguing flash-back takes place in the South. It is about a heroic individual attempt to bring WWI to end by peaceful means. There is a lot of potent Christian symbolism embedded in the story. (Faulkner, I believe, was very familiar with the Bible even though he probably was not a believer.)Bottom line is that I thought this was a great book, but cannot vouch for its readability. I can only say that, in my opinion, Faulkner being Faulkner is worth the considerable effort if you are willing to go there."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"This is what I would say to people considering purchasing his novel, it is not a short review (nor a short novel!) but I hope it is helpful to some of you. Note, I wrote this review prior to reading other folk's reviews, as not to be biased. Note II, please excuse my poor grahmer and spelling, if I could write as well as I could read well...I've spent the last 5 years studying all of Faulkner's written works, an experience that has been very rewarding personally. For me A Fable was as rewarding a read as any of WCF's other works... but then again I purposely left this novel to the very end of my list of his major novels & short stories and feel that this choice made a big difference in my ability to extract the most from it. I can crank through a \\"regular\\" novel in a day or two and most of WCF's novels in twice that time, but it took me well over a year to \\"read\\" a Fable (I took a few breaks here and there too. A Fable can be read in a week, but not read well), almost a third of the total time I dedicated to studying his oeurve. I believe that comprehension of Faulkner's unique talents increases geometrically with each of his works read, with 3 or 4 novels representing the point along the learning \\"S\\"-shaped curve that is closest to vertical. What to the beginner would seem an incomprehensible and exceedingly challenging read, eventually becomes smooth and extremely rewarding as you get comfortable with WCF's unconventional style and recurring themes. Without having read them, I can guess that the reviews on this page will be mixed or negative... I hope you will consider my experience with this novel as context for these reviews. Had I just happened upon this novel I would not have finished or enjoyed it. It is a rich work but also requires a commitment of time, energy and focus... the plot, time & place, setting, and even narration can change in an instant leading to a tangled and haphazard appearance. There are plenty of WCF fan's that are smarter than I who consider A Fable one of his lesser works, but then again there are other smart folks that place it among his best. It was clearly an important novel for Faulkner personally and I conclude that in the end it was something he looked on with pride.While all of WCF's works are studies of the human heart, like many authors Faulkner's literary efforts vacillated between commercial enterprises aimed at satisfying his ambitions for financial security and and some degree of fame or recognition, and, at the opposite pole novels he wrote purely out of his need to express himself without much, if any expectation of publication. After all he got a taste of the work-a-day life in his role as postmaster at Ole Miss and despite the need to support a small family his decision to pursue a literary career was sealed the day he left the Oxford post office to discover the artistic community in New Orleans, if not then, for sure a few weeks later when he met Sherwood Anderson and was encouraged to pursue writing. I believe that A Fable was not primarily intended as a commercial endeavor. For example, early in his career he poured his heart and soul into the production of Sartoris (an early novel that would take another 4+ years to be hacked up and later hesitantly released as The Unvanquished by his editors, only to be published in it's original format after his death), a novel that was a commercial disaster and what must have felt like a personal repudiation of his talent (sadly, WCF never received the notoriety or [secondarily] financial success that he deserved while alive... in my view he was a man that was sensitive to the views of others, although no so much as to allow others to stifle his creative expression). Out of the period of intense introspection and frustration that followed this professional tragedy, two of his more celebrated novels, The Sound and The Fury & As I Lay Dying were written in only a few months... obviously not written for mass appeal.Before you buy this book, think about this; Many of the author's most complex and celebrated works were completed in months. Faulkner took 10 years to write, re-write and perfect A Fable. Many aspects of its production, and additionally the setting and tone of the novel are outliers. Sure, he took a break now and then to, for example, finish off the Snopes trilogy and spent a lot of time in Hollywood during that decade. But if you look at a timeline of his productive career, it is clear that this novel had tremendous meaning and relevance to him... it was a special project. Everyone should ask themselves what they want out of this novel before getting started. If you are looking for just a entertaining book to get lost in, I think you will be very disappointed and probably will not make it through more than a few \\"chapters.\\" In my opinion, this is a book where each page should be read twice, slowly, and with meticulous attention. Make it easy on yourself and take notes on the characters, narrators, times and places... you will to refer back to them later. Then you should read it again. Taken for what it is, I believe it is one of Faulkner's more touching and meaningful works and one of the most thought provoking novels on the nature of war. I agree with the professional critics that this novel is more dry than many of his other novels (ranging from light, easy reads to very dark novels), such as The Reivers (Faulkner's sense of humor was never a big draw for me, but certain novels like Reivers are a pleasure to breeze through while others are a very dense. Note that the Reivers was published after A Fable), but A Fable has all of the intensity of Absalom, Absalom! (maybe less than Go Down, Moses in my view, but let's just say it is intense). The story of the three-legged race horse is classic Faulkner, and gives you a taste of Yoknapatawpha as well as some lighter reading in an otherwise very foreign setting and dense work. It may also help for readers to understand a bit of Faulkner's personal history before they take this on. War left an indelible mark on his psyche. During the first World War he was not found fit for service with the branch of the US armed forces to which he applied, and joined the Canadian Air Force instead, but never saw combat. I can't help but feel that his development into adulthood during WWI contributed to his desire to tackle this subject. In many, if not the majority of his works, most notably Soldier's Pay, he deals with the subject of war and often with young men's ambition for glory... this novel is no different being set in WWI. In fact, A Fable is rife with themes that run through his other works... themes that and are quickly sniffed out by readers familiar with his works. What makes A Fable special - aside from it's very allegorical/symbolical plot (which may make it one of WCF's most interesting works for literary scholars to dissect, but does not add tremendously in its appeal for me)- is that Faulkner attempts/struggles to distill earlier themes dealing with the human condition to their absolute core then confront his audience with hem... I believe this is a departure from some of his other works in the degree to which he demands his audience to look inward. He crosses a new boundary by challenging our views on courage, human suffering, compassion, the absence of love/compassion, religion, leadership, conflict, social status, and on and on. This is one of the factors that makes the novel great. One weakness, is that some of the characters (especially many military figures) do not feel as real, tangible or human versus those in his other works, although many of them will immediately feel familiar to the reader and pop out of the pages with the same quality of characters in his other works.In summary, I would recommend taking on a few other WCF novels (The Wild Palms is Faulkner's most under-rated novel, and among his most touching works. It is an easy read, and can be read and enjoyed by WCF novices with ease, especially since -much like A Fable- it is not a part of the Yoknapatawpha series) before diving into A Fable. If you chose to go for it, understand that this is a rich, dense and at times confusing novel that most people will not finish... so take the time to soak in all the richness and remember it is natural to feel lost in the plot in your first read, just keep moving forward a let go of the need to feel centered in the plot the first time around. Then you can decide for yourself if it was worth the decade of effort he sunk into its production.*****- CW"},{"Title":"A fable","review":"I generally like and admire Faulkner's work, but this novel (or whatever it is) got the better of me. Usually I make myself finish any book I read no matter how difficult, but with &quot;A Fable&quot; I simply couldn't do it (and I've managed the entirety of James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; and Proust's &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;.) I may have a Master's Degree in English, but I still had great trouble following what was going on in the book, much less appreciating what it was trying to say. It's amazing to me that the Pulitzer Prize committee could even manage to get through this thing, much less give it an award. I haven't given up on Faulkner, but for the first time since I was a college undergraduate, I've given up on a book. It took &quot;A Fable&quot; to bring me to my knees."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"For some reason, this book gets slogged off as \\"unreadable\\" and even irrelevant in the Faulkner canon. I don't get it. Faulkner is almost ALWAYS difficult, his novels usually closer to puzzles than straight narratives. Why has this book been singled out as the height of his obtuseness? If anything, it's an even MORE lucid book than some of the agreed upon Faulkner classics. It's also a brilliant, provocative, dense, and haunting meditation on war and religion and duty and ethics and whatever else W.F. could cram into 500 pages. It's not a perfect book - there are perhaps some too-abstract and off-putting sections (particularly the long background summary of the Old General). But this book is mostly filled with some of the greatest writing of this great writer's career. Another thing: this is NOT a \\"re-telling of the Christ story in WWI.\\" To think of the book in such terms would be an absurd oversimplification. Yes, that ancient tale plays a major part in this one, and there are parallels drawn throughout, but the Christ story is only one element of this epic fever-dream. This totally unique novel is more like a supernatural/philosophical detective story than a religious parable. If you love Faulkner for more than just the trappings of his Southern landscapes, you MUST read this book. It goes without saying that anybody interested in simple and fluid prose need not bother with Faulkner in the first place - criticizing Faulkner for being \\"confusing\\" is like accusing Homer for being \\"poetic.\\" I don't care how smart you are: you will be confused by Faulkner. But confusion can be beautiful, and human, and even transform into the best kind of enlightenment."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"A Fable is Faulkner's thinly disguised allegory of Christ's story in the guise of a mutiny on the Western Front in World War One. In this sense the novel mirrors some of Faulkner's short stories about the Great War. His writing about that conflict had a great deal of grounded verisimilitude. But A Fable contains much of extraneous matter, is a difficult and dense read, and comes in very long 437 pages. This is Faulkner doing all of his tricks. The long, long sentence, the page long paragraph, the dense and tedious plot all but submerged in an ocean of language. Faulkner's work is never for everyone. For A Fable this may be doubly true."},{"Title":"A fable","review":"William Faulkner considers A Fable his masterpiece. It won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1955 (one of only a handful of books to win both in the same year). These accolades, however, have not led to widespread acclaim or longevity for the novel, and for years it was relegated to afterthought status, deemed \\"minor\\" Faulkner, and available only as a cheap, hard to read paperback or as a part of an expensive anthology.As Faulkner is my favorite writer, and as I am, by nature, a completist, I read A Fable (a library copy that was easier to read than the pulp paperback) a few years back, despite the warnings that it was difficult - even impossible -to read, despite the cautions that slogging through it was not worth the effort...and I loved it.Now that Vintage International has re-released it (along with most of Faulkner's other novels) in a beautiful new paperback edition, I decided to reread it, apprehensive that I might have overestimated the novel's strengths, having been 26 when I first read it - but I had not. If anything, I found the novel even more brilliant and illuminating on second reading.This is not your typical Faulkner (as another reviewer pointed out) but it is far from \\"minor\\" Faulkner. This book is, at times, difficult, but what Faulkner isn't? - and who would even consider reading any Faulkner if they didn't want to be challenged? And, when compared to some of his other masterworks (The Sound and the Fury or Absalom, Absalom! for example) it is actually a quick, surprisingly easy read.A Fable has much in common with the aforementioned Absalom, Absalom! in that it focuses more on the human condition and the various aspects of human nature than on character-driven narrative. The characters here, as in Absalom, Absalom! are allegorical representations of diverse facets of humanity, playing out, in their myriad interactions, the eternal struggles we have faced for millennia (the endeavoring for peace in uncertain times, the concepts of forgiveness, and bravery, and heroism, and love, the striving to find meaning and redemption in the world). The lack of traditional characterization in no way undermines A Fable's emotional impact, for we can see, as a result, expressions of ourselves - and our world and history - within these characters.While A Fable essentially tells (allegorically) the story of Christ and his Apostles, culminating in his \\"crucifixion\\" and eventual \\"resurrection\\" in the French trenches of World War I, it is not really a religious novel; it never gets bogged down in religious theology, never seems heavy-handed, never becomes either preachy or blasphemous. So too with its anti-war themes: it makes its case by focusing on war as a curse of mankind (and a product of our species' ongoing internal conflict), not by politicizing it or proselytizing upon it. As a result, A Fable achieves a universality found only in the best works of literature, speaking to that that is good - and not so good - in all of us.The rewards of reading this book cannot be overstated: this is vast, inspired, passionate and virtuosic writing. (Consider the following description: \\"Her face [was] quite empty for the moment but with something incipient and tranquilly promising about it like a clean though not-yet-lighted lamp on the kitchen bureau.\\") A Fable is Faulkner at his best, and that is really saying something. Hopefully, now that Vintage International has brought it out in an edition worthy of its merits, it will continue to receive, on a larger and larger scale, the attention and commendation that is deserves. For A Fable is not just a Faulkner masterpiece; it is a literary masterpiece, a masterpiece of all time."},{"Title":"A Guide for Using Across Five Aprils in the Classroom (Literature Units)","review":"I am sorry to hear that several readers who have written reviews of this book consider it a difficult book or, as one reviewer stated, a novel that only a \\"genius\\" could understand. Perhaps those readers mistakenly chose this book for a 5th grade U.S. history reading level instead of an 8th grade U.S. history reading level. It is not appropriate for a 5th grader unless the student is a very advanced and sophisticated reader. There are many details about the Civil War era discussed in this book in such a way that it seems the author expects the reader to be familiar with the topic--at least the basics! I don't think it is an appropriate novel for a student to read unless he or she has received some basic instruction in and understanding of the timeline and political events from 1860 to 1865. I doubt that such political and historical material is covered in the standard 5th grade U.S. History curriculum. However, such material should definitely be covered in most textbooks and curricular materials for 8th grade U.S. History, the grade level for which this novel seems to be appropriate. Irene Hunt's novel, Across Five Aprils, takes place in Illinois, a state that considered itself a \\"free state\\" in the pre-Civil War period. However, the Creighton family (the characters who are the focus of the novel) includes some members who are staunch defenders of the North and others who are less sure of the moral high ground of the free states and therefore choose to fight with the Rebel cause instead. The book does an excellent job of illustrating the impact of such a decision on a family whose sons turned against the North no matter how many other sons they had fighting for and giving their lives for the Union cause. This is a complex book that encourages readers to ask questions about which side (North or South) was right and which was wrong during the Civil War. Across Five Aprils is essentially a coming of age story combined with a historical consideration of the main themes and events of the Civil War--a brutal war that brought out the most heroic as well as the basest instincts in people. Many tragic events befall the Creighton family, but their courage and endurance in the face of four years of horrible war is admirable. I really liked the members of the Creighton family. All of them change--some for the better, some not. The emotional lives of the characters are believably depicted so that their actions are understandable. A bonus in my opinion is the consistent attention that the author pays to the setting with her great descriptive language about seasons, the surroundings, and the weather. All in all, a fine book for an 8th grade U.S. History curriculum or for someone familiar with the Civil War and its cultural/historical significance."},{"Title":"A Guide for Using Across Five Aprils in the Classroom (Literature Units)","review":"There was a wide selection of differentiated projects and integrated the historical fiction aspect of the novel with facts from the Civil War. It helped the students to understand the war more thoroughly and relate to the way of life in the era. I did not like the tests in the book. There were mostly facts and rote memory and provided little higher level application or analysis of the novel. Overall, it helped to save me time, which is why I purchased it.

The first 100 pages are unbelievably good; as I began reading this book I really felt like I had hit the jackpot, and I quickly concluded I would attempt to read all of Maslow's works. As I got further into the book I was singing quite a different tune. I believe anyone with any interest in psychology whatsoever should buy this book and read the first 100 pages. This section alone is easily worth the price of the book - don't let me scare you away from exploring the ideas of this great man. However, the dropoff in quality after this first section is rather precipitous, and while pages 100-200 were OK, the final 100 pages are an absolute chore to get through and I had to force myself along to finish the book.Keep in mind that Abraham Maslow died before he was able to make a final edit of this book, and it shows. The second half of the book is almost a verbatim repetition of the earlier sections, and Maslow tends to harp on the same concepts endlessly. Some of it comes across as a very generic self help book designed to be consumed by the masses. In other sections, he seems to start over right from square one, as if some of the essays were meant to stand alone and were not meant to follow other essays that were extremely similar. I would say nearly half of this book should have been relegated to an expanded appendix - but I guess it would be strange to have a book where full half of it consisted of an appendix. I'm sure that Maslow would have fixed these problems had he lived long enough, but we will just have to accept this book for what it is and try as best we can to extrapolate something useful from it.To conclude, I must still vehemently stress the importance of at least the first half of this book. If you grow bored with it, just stop reading. The editors of this book obviously elected to take a throw-it-all-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach, and I suppose there is no harm in that. Just remember that the original author was not around to oversee the final editing, and the result is a large dose of disjecta and detritus towards the end of the book. Nevertheless, do not let this minor disclaimer prevent you from exploring the wonderful ideas of this brilliant man."},{"Title":"The farther reaches of human nature (Esalen book)","review":"i could not put down this book. the only vague idea i had from Maslow was the classic pyramid of needs, of which i did not think much.

He clearly outlines the need of self-actualizers to devote themselves to a cause greater than self. No surprise here, but in my judgment, what he would describe in \\"Religions, Values and Peak Experiences\\" as perhaps his \\"most important finding\\" has yet to be fully appreciated and understood. Dr. Maslow professes that the highest values, being values, or metavalues, are not grandiose platitudes but rather inner realities that are not made up but discovered. Moreover, metavalues are active agents that configure and inspire the motivations of self-actualizing personalities. Much as a contemporary fellow genius, Viktor Frankl, would observe, the True, the Beautiful and the Good are universal realities that are potential in all human beings. This finding flies in the face of Freud and Skinner, who insisted that human nature is virtually completely malleable by environment. Once Abraham Maslow's premise regarding values is entertained, the reader will discover the later sections of the book, especially the \\"Metamotivation\\" section, of supreme importance. When we understand and embrace Dr. Maslow's insights into supreme values, we will better understand his pronouncement that humankind has been sold short.

The first part of the book is a philosophically profound book about human nature, that answered many ontological and epistemological questions for me.The first part of the book was extremely well written, and it contained truly revolutionary ideas. Most of us think of Maslow's contribution as \\"the pyramid of the hierarchy of needs\\", since that is probably what is usually taught about him. But this book is much more than that, and it delves insightfully into the realization of the full human potential, including knowing, perceiving, being, needs, metaneeds, aesthetics, etc.Because the book is an unedited, unfinished draft of a book, the second part reads like it. It is difficult to enjoy the last half of the book because it reads as the personal notes of a writer planning his essay. Despite its \\"annotated outline\\" format, one can still get glimpses of sheer genius in those notes, and it truly is a shame and a loss for our intellectual inheritance that the book wasn't finished. Of course, as unedited notes often do, these contain material that is deleterious to the overall quality of Maslows well-thought ideas. The editors (or perhaps un-editors) failed in this respect.It is remarkable how timeless, elegant, and structured the first finished part of the book is, in contrast with some of the \\"culturally dated\\" second part of the book.None-the-less, this book is well worth the time to read it.

His work can be scientifically replicated and verified according to the most rigorous scientific methods of the 19th century.

In it Maslow sums up his life work and theories about the perfectability of man, and the need for the rigid, quantifiable \\"science of psychology\\" to incorporate more spiritual, humanities-based elements.Maslow grew up in a Jewish immigrant family in Brooklyn, New York. Stories of pogroms and the Russian mass destruction of Jews were the reality of his childhood. His mother's instability may have been associated with her related experiences. German extermination of the Jews in the 1940s extended these horrors into his early adult years.\\"Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\\" (developed at the peak of WW2) is still studied by every psychology and sociology student in America. For Maslow, that theory became a building block; a tool he used to construct his treatises on the nature of creativity, peak experiences, and self-actualization. Twenty-five years later, in 1968, still puzzling over the nature of good and evil, and the need to develop kind, good and thoughtful world citizens, Maslow wrote:\\"My study of most Utopian efforts has taught me to ask the basic questions themselves in a more practicable and researchable way. \\"how good a society does human nature permit?\\" and \\"How good a human nature does society permit?\\"\\"What if the [human] organism is seen as having \\"biological wisdom\\"?

But rather an overview of the important events of the Cold War and the root cause of it. However, contrary to what the title suggests, this book doesn't provide any new insights or information about the Cold War. (The author states that his research is based mostly on previous works and not on new sources.)Gaddis follows a chronological order while analyzing the important issues of the Cold War. Due to the shortness of the book (only 270 pages not including the footnotes), important events such as: the Suez Crisis, Watergate, Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs receive a few mere pages. Having said that, Gaddis did a great job of providing the reader with a basic understanding of the events that shaped the Cold War and the mindset of the world leaders who were running the show.All in all, this is a fine book for people who are looking for a quick and enjoyable read on the Cold War. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Gaddis is brilliant on the Cold War, and his ability to tie things together is masterful. But this review is on the audio book. Overall, the reading is fine. The main reader, however, didn't seem to bother to find out how certain Russian and other foreign names are pronounced. OK, so Sverdlovsk with an \\"SH\\" beginning isn't too bad, but putting the \\"SH\\" in Gorbachev (Gohr-bah-SHOFF) is an obvious and manifestly avoidable mistake. Ceausescu's name is pronounced correctly in some instances, bungled in others (Chee-ow-ess-koo). Distracting stuff, but ultimately it doesn't mar the genius of Gaddis's achievement."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"You would think such a sweetened condensed version of the Cold War as this book proclaims itself to be might answer even just one simple basic question, such as \\"When did the Cold War begin?\\" You would be wrong: there is no serious discussion of Yalta. S. M. Plokhy's 2011Yalta: The Price of Peacemakes it eminently clear that the Cold War took shape at Yalta. The Cold War was indeed the price to be paid for the Second World War. As Plokhy relates, at Yalta FDR set only a goal of a fifty year peace rather than the liquidation of war forever. That really is the yardstick we should use in considering the Cold War rather than the hagiographic approach Gaddis has mistakenly selected instead.I completely object to Professor Gaddis's stupid interjection of the fantasy nuking of Korea with which we begins his Chapter 2. My immediate reaction was to wonder what other artistic license had been taken previously (in Chapter 1) that I may have missed because I was not familiar with the works of Vonnegut or any other favorite novelist of the author. Is this how they teach History at Yale these days? Imagine the pain I feel as one of Eli's wayward sons, having to recommend the Harvard guy's book as a better choice! I don't object to consideration of literature in regard to the Cold War. Juan Goytisolo, for example, addresses this question as a novelist (inForbidden Territory and Realms of Strife: The Memoirs of Juan Goytisolo) asking why the Soviet Union or Communism generally have failed to produce even one great piece of art.Like many of his age cohort, Gaddis refuses to take seriously the issue of communism in America before, during and immediately after WW2. He introduces the Hiss case in a discussion about the late 40s -- as if the Hiss case were the product of Cold War hysteria -- rather than explaining that the espionage of Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White and others was one of the main reasons for the McCarran Act as well as the Administration's own loyalty investigations. (Maybe Professor Gaddis should have studied hisVenona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America (Yale Nota Bene)more closely.)There is a reason he stays mum: John Lewis Gaddis asserts that, after the Second World War, the Soviets looked like they had history on their side. He tries to blame this on Reinhold Niebuhr, but it is really just American liberalism's pathethic excuse for 'thinking pink' in the 30s, the 40s & then (briefly) in the 50s. After all, Whittaker Chambers (as recounted in his autobiographyWitness) also believed that the Communists had history on their side precisely when he went AWOL from the GRU and Communist underground. The point is not what you believe to be \\"inevitable\\" but what you believe to be moral. Gaddis praises this moral approach in discussing Karol Woytila and Ronald Reagan in the 80s. If the Hiss/Chambers match up was about anything, it was about contending moral approaches. It wasn't about hysteria.For all the above reasons I conclude that this \\"New\\" Cold War history is useless: Professor Plokhy's book on Yalta will be the best grounding in Cold War history you will ever find because it deals with all these messy moral and ethical issues encountered by the victorious allies on the cusp of peace. If you need detail, choose Norman Friedman'sFifty-Year War: Conflict and Strategy in the Cold War. The US Naval Institute Press does not let their authors engage in Fellini moments in works of serious history, as Professor Gaddis was allowed to do by his publisher. It's OK to have been a little pink or even to have been a communist for a while. But it is morally and ethically wrong to have done so just because you thought they were the \\"winning\\" side. We would have lost the Cold War if the West had reasoned and acted upon such thinking as Professor Gaddis suggests was \\"natural\\" rather than standing up for individual freedom and against totalitarianism whatever the cost as was in fact done by our Western leaders in concert."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Here is the Cold War in 50,000 words.

What he does not offer us is a \\"new\\" history, as the title promises. This book helped fill in some blanks about the most dangerous period of our history, but I didn't set the book down thinking I had a strongly different view on the event then I could have got from other sources.I liked how the book allowed you to get in the heads of the various U.S. presidents, and see how they thought about the war--sometimes counterintuitively. However, it seemed like there were things left out. Cambodia is mentioned only in passing on the last page, even though communism hit that country harder than any other, arguably.The book does seem titled to the idea that the U.S. was the morally superior of the two sides, though Gaddis does not shy away from the darker moments of U.S. geopolitics in the Cold War.Oddly enough, I walked away hoping that there would be more, not less, retrospective analysis. Just how close was the Soviet Union to collapsing before Reagan took office? Just what might have happened if the United States had not \\"faught\\" the Cold War and let the Soviet Union expand and collapse on its own? Normally, scholars tend to get too far out on hypotheticals, but here I find myself wishing he would have spent a little more time on them."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Gaddis has written a concise history of the Cold War which began shortly after World War II ended in 1945 and ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.No book of this brief length can capture all the events of these momentous years. What Gaddis attempts is to describe the conflict of ideas and ideologies: on the one hand a less than monolithic capitalist West and on the other an increasingly less than monolithic communist East. Gaddis doesn't really emphasize the fear and paranoia I recall in the 1950s of the Soviet Union, communism, and the atomic bomb. The fear of terrorism that overcame the US after 9/11 had some of the same qualities but was far less intense and short-lived.Gaddis describes the ways and means by which the United States and the Soviet Union learned to co-exist over time. He gives a good summary of the U.S. MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) policy as a way of avoiding nuclear war by not defending against it. He tells of the perfidious allies of both the USSR and the USA and how they manipulated the superpowers. The best part of the book is about the icon breakers of the 1980s: Pope John Paul, Lech Walesa, Maggie Thatcher, and especially Ronald Reagan who broke with the conventional wisdom of co-existence and sought to topple the Soviet Union. They, along with figures such as George Kennan and Mikhail Gorbachev -- who truly deserved his Nobel Peace Prize -- are the heroes of the story. (The Bush Administration is said to admire Gaddis, but it should keep in mind that the defeat of the Soviet Union was accomplished by a triumph of merit rather than a war.)As the Cold War becomes misty in old memories, some may want more detail and more background than this book gives, but for a quick summary of a tumultuous 45 years when mankind came to the brink of destroying itself more than once this is an excellent account by a noted scholar.Smallchief"},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and thought it was very well written. Too many books covering the Cold War are either too simplistic or too thesis-driven and therefore narrowly focused. This book, more than any other I've read of the Cold War, allows the reader to grasp the key events, people, and most importantly, concepts that underlay this period in 20th century history. The Cold War was an epic 40 year political conflict that is \\"accessibly distilled\\" by Gaddis in this book.I would reccomend this book to anybody seeking to understand what the Cold War was beyond the simplistic narrations in history books, any others looking to brush up on their history and anybody looking for additional perspective in the Cold War."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John L. Gaddis is one of the best Cold War historians in the world. He covers all the geopolitical factors and alliances in the tense standoff between the United states and the Soviet Union. Conservative-minded people love his books because he gives Ronald Reagan a lot of credit for bringing the Cold War to an end. Left-leaning historians see him as a \\"triumphalist\\" who does not focus on the decline of America, the growing national debt, or \\"imperial overreach\\" of the nation.Gaddis is a good scholar who uses the most relevant sources such as the VENONA files. These are transmissions between the KGB, spies, and the Kremlin. These records were released in the aftermath of the Cold War. The records provide proof that Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs engaged in espionage. The records show that the Soviet Union was deeply troubled by American investment in SDI (Star Wars.) The missile-defense system conceptualized by the Reagan administration put a lot of pressure on the Soviets to keep up with technologial and military spending. As a result, reformers like Gorbachev had to make fundamental changes to the Soviet model of government. People gained the courage to speak out and Communist governments were quick to fall in Eastern Europe.Gaddis is a credible and respected historian. Those who are interested in a different perspective can read Melvyn Lefler's works. He grudgingly gives Reagan some credit for putting pressure on the Soviet Union, but he is very critical of American foreign policy during the Cold War. His history is credible and well-researched.

At times the book reads like an expanded outline but that is understandable considering the massive amount of information to be covered from the end of WW-2 to the fall of communism in 1991. For readers of American history on the watch for events and individuals worthy of additional study this book is a gold mine. The ample footnotes, extensive bibliography and index add to the usefulness of this book."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis has devoted his entire career to studying the Cold War and this book represents an impressive distillation of a career. In clear, well-written, and accessible prose, he covers 44 years of international history. This broad scope means that certain events must receive only brief mention, but he keeps his main focus on the U.S.-Soviet diplomatic confrontation that was at the heart of what we commonly call the Cold War.Unlike many historians, Gaddis has throughout his career shown a willingness to revise himself. In this book, we see Gaddis advancing arguments that he first made in the early 1970s with new ones in addition to slightly revised views. He puts ideas rather than power at the center of this confrontation. He also puts most of the blame on the highly ideological Soviet Union, an argument that most Russians would have little problem accepting today. He argues that d&eacute;tente had to die for the Cold War to end. A number of people were important in challenge the authority of Communist parties, including Pope John Paul II, Margaret Thatcher, Andrei Sakharov, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and Vaclav Havel. Gaddis gives President Ronald Reagan high marks for his handling of U.S. foreign policy. Reagan was not one for the details, but he understood his job was not to pay attention to how many rivets there were on the B-1 bomber, but rather to provide direction at the strategic level. Reagan, in other words, was good at understanding the big ideas and let others deal with the details. Mikhail Gorbachev gets sympathetic treatment for eventually letting the ghost go without restoring to violence.This book is provocative, easy to read, and informative. It is a good place for beginners to begin and for experts to look for new ideas."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"In a straight forward analysis that is easy to read and comprehend, Gaddis' study is the definitive literature of the Cold War.

After a critical analysis of the research, it is agreed that Gaddis is the foremost historian of the Cold War era."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This book accomplishes the goal that it sets for itself. Gaddis sets out to write a concise history of the Cold War and manages to do it in 267 pages. The book is fascinating. While it doesn't get too deep into any details (hence the concise part) it covers the overall strategies and themes of the Cold War in sharp detail. One of the most interesting elements of the book is that he describes well the personalities that make things tick. In one of the final sections of the book he makes clear that the Cold War ends the way that it does because of the unique personalities that were influential at the time. The book does a very good job of conveying the sense of hope and wonder at the mostly peaceful dissolution of a conflict that some people thought would end the world. The book is clearly written and accessible, event to those whose historical knowledge of the period is mostly basic. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"In the introduction, Gaddis sets the context for this book: the topic is not familiar to young people, and various students and others familiar with his scholarship wished for a much shorter, more easily digestible work on the entire subject of the Cold War.Given this framework, the author arguably does a decent job. No-one could take on such an enormous topic and boil it down to so few pages without its resulting in a certain degree of superficiality and selectivity (to the point of excluding what many will believe is important information).As someone who heard about these events when I was very young, Gaddis' approach results in a narrative that sounds very familiar and hence strikes me as fairly conventional. I personally disagreed with the author's assessment of some major figures, finding his appreciation of Ronald Reagan reminiscent of the characters in the film _Being There_, who thought they perceived genius in the strategic simplicity of someone who really *was*, well, simple. However, since one of the Amazon reader-reviewers I sampled found the book much too liberal and *politically correct,* obviously Gaddis did not take the most arch-conservative approach possible. If one of my children were getting his/her overview of the Cold War from this book, I would wish that the author offered a bit of commentary on the potentially negative outcomes (e.g., violent fundamentalist zealotry) that could arise from labeling one or another political system as biblically evil (instead of implying, as I think he does, that this was just a great PR strategy for the propagation of Democracy). However, it's easy to see how trying to be so inclusive could easily blow the book up to multi-volume size.Would I personally pick other details to offer in such a short book on a long topic? Probably. However, Gaddis' book is a reasonably good survey and entry point for a person new to learning about the Cold War."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis does an excellent job providing a readable overview of a very complicated period in modern history. This book is equally enlightening for those of us who grew up under the persistent threat of nuclear warfare and younger readers for whom the Cold War might as well have been the Peloponnesian War. The author asserts that the Cold War was a necessary conflict to settle fundamental issues that arose during the first half of the century.The root cause of the Cold War was the differing ideologies of communism and capitalism. At the end of World War II, economically ruined Europe took center stage of the nascent conflict. The US completed its renunciation of its erstwhile isolationist tendencies with the ambitious Marshall Plan to assist in Europe's recovery and preclude its fall to communism. Stalin, the only battle tested world leader with the passing of FDR and Churchill's defeat, sought reparations for the disproportional losses faced by Russia during the war and wanted to extend his influence. He actively undermined the Marshall Plan by delaying the proceedings and escalated the contention with the formation of the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Blockade.The Soviets expeditious development of an atomic bomb was a radical paradigm shift. The US had been content to have a relatively smaller military with the advantage of the bomb. Now resources had to shift from economic development to military security. After nuclear brinkmanship during the Cuban Missile conflict and the Offshore Islands crisis and further rhetoric, the concept of detente took hold leading to a stagnant and entrenched stalemate. Both sides followed relatively reactive strategies with the US seeking to contain Communism in its current boundaries and the Soviets seeking to support any potential revolutionaries. The results lead to the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as the Soviet invasions of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan. Other countries such as China, Egypt, Yugoslavia, and some African colonies took advantage of these reactionary strategies and and achieved successes leveraging the superpowers against each other.Ronald Reagan lead a troupe of pivotal actors including Pope John Paul II, Lech Walesa, Margaret Thatcher, Deng Xioping, and Mikhail Gorbachev propounding a radical vision that there could be an end to the Cold War. He jettisoned detente and boldly stated the communism was failing and a transient phenomenon. Communism's failure compared to Capitalism was clear (but previously unspoken) with the dramatic recovery of Western Europe's economy under the Marshall Plan, the stark contrast of Eastern Europe's continued plight, and Deng's successful market reforms. Gorbachev refused to use military might to support the failing ideals and allowed the Polish Solidarity movement and the dissolution of physical containment in Hungary and ultimately the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War itself."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Gaddis has written an excellent and accessible history of the Cold War. His descriptions and comments about the Cold War through the mid-1960s were thoroughly enjoyable, though I have to agree with the Washington Post Review that his description of the latter period of the Cold War felt too abreviated - a necessary restriction for such a condensed work.Many people have experienced some or all of the events described in this book. Perhaps Mr. Gaddis's best achievement with this book is that it allows the reader to integrate personal memories of the events described in order to see how they fit into the larger context of the movement of history of the era."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"The title to the New York Times book review of \\"The Cold War: A New History\\" is called \\"Look Back in Relief\\" written by Michael Beschloss.That title indeed is what one could say at the end of this rather long odyssey called the Cold War. What Gaddis has done in this rather easy to read and gripping dialogue is to give a great general outline as to the cause and effects of the Cold War. Mr. Gaddis can utilize this work to write a definitive history which indeed would go into greater depth and detail.To this time frame of World historical crisis would be an historical narrative on the order of the works of both the \\"World Crisis\\" and the \\"Second World War\\" written by Winston Churchill.Gaddis gives the basic background and takes of the major political players such as Stalin, Mao Zedong, Harry Truman, Winston Churchill, Dwight Eisenhower, JFK, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Pope John Paul II.All the major conflicts and incidents such as the Berlin Wall, the Korean War, the Hungarian invasion etc. are all described here. Gaddis indeed gives mention and explanation to all these major events.For the young students that Mr. Gaddis described in his Preface he does state this indeed may be like studying about the Carthaginians. However, I myself grew up and lived in this era throughout my childhood and into adulthood unto fatherhood. It was indeed a way of life.How these political leaders dealt with each other and reacted to each other, determined the difference from living a normal life or facing utter annihilation.What Gaddis has done here is excellent. It does need to be expounded and enhanced. At one point of his narrative I did have to laugh at his analysis. On page 33 he states \\"Meanwhile, Stalin had a blockade of Berlin. His reasons, even now, are not clear.\\" Oh really, Gaddis is confused? Stalin has no clear reasons?? Stalin was no fool, he was pressing the Allies to determine their resolve. At this time he was testing the theory of the Communist proxy that the Allies would indeed separate and not be united in their efforts against the Soviet block. Indeed Stalin's ruse was foiled.Outside of that particular diatribe, I concur with Gaddis' work. Good job 5 Stars."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Gaddis has put together the most well written, concise history of the Cold War to date. In 266 pages, he surveys the personalities and events which dominated much our lives for 50 years. Stalin's rule of terror and the migration to a failed economy run by bureaucrats, Eisenhower's wisdom about how to deal with the threat of nuclear war, Reagan's reshaping of that paradigm and Gorbachev's noble, but flawed effort to change the Soviet Union, are just a few of the threads woven so incisively into this story of how the Cold War started, evolved, and came to an end.Steve Pease"},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I bought this book because I was interested in a quick overview of the Cold War, from which I could choose other books to fill in the gaps on topics that I find interest me. In that respect, it is a decent book, and I have purchased two other books to continue learning ('The Making of a Counter Culture' by Theodore Roszak and 'Blacked Out' by Alasdair Roberts).The problem with this book is that it has far too much of a 'good vs evil' theme. I would have liked to have seen more of a 'ideology vs ideology' or 'imperialist vs imperialist' theme, which would have helped go beyond simple caricatures of the two nations.I was quite disappointed to see how much the book portrayed Gorbachev as an enlightened hero while only casually mentioning that he was quite hated in Russia. Also, there was almost no mention of Solzhenitsyn - how is that possible?If you do decide to read this book, I suggest you supplement it with the following to help balance things out:'Overthrow' by Stephen Kinzer'The Two Souls of Socialism' by Hal Draper (available free online)The US has undertaken many unethical and brutal endeavors over the past 100+ years. Also, there's strong elements of 'socialism' in nearly all industrialized nations, but without despotic regimes and popular oppression. The term 'socialism' is actually quite broad and has dramatically different meanings depending on which model you read - modern social democracy and democratic socialism have proven to provide a substantially better standard of living than what you'll find in the US."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I play and love a board game on the Cold War (GMT Games' Twilight Struggle) and thought a quick read on the theme would give me some extra insight into some of the events contained in the game.Pretty happy with the 300 page overview that Gaddis presents here. Nearly all the 60+ events in the game are mentioned, even if it is in one or two throwaway lines. Some of the events, such as the U2 spy plane incident and Castro was dealt a little too briefly, but covering 45 years of history doesn't give too much room to maneouvre. Was Albania even mentioned once?The prose is accessible, tense and removed from the academic text books I was deliberately avoiding, and the book is definitely recommended for someone like me looking for an overview of the defeat of 'An Evil Empire'.Gaddis' politics is fairly clear; he seems a bit besotted with the Cold War Warriors (Reagan, Churchill, Thatcher...even Mao) rather than those who didn't push to end the Iron Curtain. That didn't bother me, I was after a good, readable overview and that is what I got. While the Soviet Union had been tettering on collapse for a decade or more, it is still obvious that the collapse was a shock to many...and could have easily dragged out for another few decades.Overall, the US win an automatic victory on turn 9 with 20 VP after the Soviets looked the goods around turn 7 (mid 70s), and I got some additonal insight into a fascinating period of history."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Got what i wanted and in the expected time zone.

This is not it. Covering the 40+ years in less than 300 pages implies some superficiality, but Gaddis' approach makes the effort essentially worthless. He also has to take the obligatory slap at McCarthy without bothering to admit that \\"we now know\\" (the title of another Gaddis work) that declassified material has largely shown that he told the truth and his detractors consistently lied. He then digresses into a ludricrous analysis of nuclear strategy that coincides with no known theory. He has dumbed the entire process down to a horrible degree and the entire enterprise is awash in political correctness."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis presents an establishment view of The Cold War in this abbreviated book. Gaddis states that he wrote the book because his students at Yale were beginning to see this period as ancient history. But this book is not a college text despite the plethora of references. It is a simplified retelling from a decidedly American perspective of a period of time in history where the world hung by a nuclear thread. For those of us who were alive during this period the book is mostly old hat. It does provide a few insights and some esoteric information, but there are no startling revelations. The viewpoint is clearly American and thus this work lacks the objectivity that would be provided by a more neutral observer.Gaddis largely glosses over the immoral acts committed by the American side. In fact with chapter five (The Recovery of Equity) he implies that America was a moral country that just temporarily went wrong (for good reason) and then after Nixon recovered its moral compass. This, of course, is nonsense. America has a long history of immoral and violent acts including the stealing of the land from the native people and their virtual imprisonment in desolate areas (read Dee Brown's book, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee for the truth here), the enslavement of an entire race of people which was ended only by a violent Civil War, the wars of aggression against Mexico and Spain, etc. For a more critical (and accurate) view of American history read A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn.Gaddis fails to understand that history is a continuum and by focusing on one short period of American history he fails to portray the country in an accurate light. He also whitewashes President Truman for his decision to drop atomic bombs on two Japanese cities. There is ample evidence at this time that the Japanese had largely agreed to the eventual surrender terms prior to this heinous act. He also claims that the Cold War can be symbolized by the ideological differences between Wilson and Lenin. At the beginning Lenin seemed to be winning, Gaddis states, but in the end Wilsonian principles prevailed. We have only to look at the rise of China and the current financial crisis in the democratic west to see how wrong this perspective is.In sum, for most people reading this book will be a waste of time for anyone but the most ignorant, pro-America readers."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Though Gaddis perceives the corruption of the Soviet system due to Stalin, he misses the second, even-deeper cause of the failure of the Soviet System and the rise of the Cold War: how the West tried to systematically destroy the Russian revolution in its early days, leading to its eventual self-corruption. For its encroachment, Nature returned with a fury and set Russia -- which had in its earliest days, positive revolutionary new social values, (that ironically America is adopting in large part within capitalism) -- on a course of fifty years of opposing America.The USA and Europe helped initiate the Cold War through its early actions, even as the Soviet system was corrupted from within by a brutal man who had 30 million of his people shot, thus cementing the Cold War.Another cause is the brutality of some of revolutionaries, who forgot their ideal in the name of harshly implementing them. It (this violent tendency) is perhaps something that has been there in the psyche of the Russians people in the 20th century, which they are now beginning to shed.On the other hand the values that were raised during the revolution still resonate with the problems that confront the world such as poverty, justice, the dignity of man, the raising up and concern for the well-being of the individual, etc. Though the Russians might not have had all of the answers they at least raised the questions. Unfortunately, the West would not hear of it at the time, tried to crush it, ushering in a monster like Stalin and then the Cold War."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"The Cold War: A New HistoryThe subtitle of this book is a bit misleading. More appropriate titles would include 'The Cold War: Blame America Last' and 'The Cold War: America Knows Best'. Gaddis claims that this book is a \`new history' because he uses historical evidence from archives that were previously closed to the public. One can only wonder what powers would allow this male cheerleader of the U.S. access to these. The ideological tone of this book is nothing new as it is similar to various news media interpretations of cold war politics. The plot structure is not much different than an episode of G.I. Joe or a Chuck Norris movie. The cast is the same, Truman, Ike, Kennedy, Mao, Stalin, Khrushchev, etc. The dichotomies are set up early on and stay the same throughout- west/east, capitalist/communist, good/evil, free/authoritarian, rational/non-rational, pragmatic/ideological, and productive/stagnant among others. Can you say 'reductionism'? Without a doubt, some of these labels serve as useful analytical tools. Unfortunately, coming from an \`expert of legitimation' in a \`culture of systematic denial', these dichotomies sound like the captain of the football team making fun of the lower-class kid who has trouble with life in general. Does might make right? If the subjects were anything but international political leaders, readers would recognize that such simplistic psychological profiles do not exist in real life. Only in fairy tales. Like the Star Wars movies.Historians at Yale, like Gaddis, have a tremendous influence on the ruling elites who make foreign policy. A country the size of the United States needs 'philosopher kings'. Otherwise, we get Manichaean rhetoric and policy like our current president's. When we go to war, it should not be on account of lies and fairy tales. How can we live in a democratic society when our intellectuals write accounts of history that sound more like Chuck Norris movies than to previous historical works by people such as Will Durant, Garry Wills, Charles Beard and Henry Adams? There have been some great historians produced by the United States. Gaddis is not one of them. The tone of this book reminds one of Fox News and Sylvester Stallone movies. What is even more hilarious is the nationalist rhetoric that equates these ideologies with 'manliness'. Masculinity consumed from the privacy of your couch.Gaddis suppresses a mountain of evidence when examining international relations in the Cold War. Small countries, which western superpowers fondly refer to as the 'Third World' are depicted as benefitting greatly from the competition between the Soviet Union and the United States. The most salient example of a world leader taking advantage of this presented by Gaddis is in the form of Nasser. He never takes into account the possibility that both sides were manipulating Egypt. No, 'third world' countries benefited greatly from the Cold War. Try telling that to the Vietnamese. The most conspicuous evidence suppressed comes in the form of the Bretton Woods Conference and the hegemonic economic instituitions it gave rise to- the IMF and the various reincarnations and cognates of the World Bank.An examination of the religious right in the United States, and its propoganda outlet Fox News, reveals that power lies in making majority demographics and sentiments appear to be persecuted minorities. It is almost funny that some intellectuals in academia probably consider Gaddis to be iconoclastic because of his views, when in fact they are not all that much different than those embedded within United States popular culture. More than anything else, this book is an expression of the white, middle-class, male status quo. Perhaps if Gaddis were to have experienced poverty and/or war, he may have been more sympathetic to those who have. It is almost hard to believe that a widely awarded professor from Yale would write a children's book. Future historians will most likely laugh at this book. Any country or world leader who chooses to side with the United States is assigned with the more positive pairing of the dichotomy. De Gaul, Zedong, Stalin, Kruschev, any world leader who does not confirm with the mandates of United States foreign policy is assigned with pejorative terms to their psychological make-up. They are unstable, egoistic and, in short, the exact opposite of United States presidents and their advisors who are selfless 'philosopher kings' who are spreading freedom and democracy to the world in the form of capitalism. To top it all off, Gaddis tries to argue that the congress has become more powerful than the executive office in the late 20th century. What about the 'imperial' or 'bureacratic' presidency? With about thirty offices appointed by the president, it is not hard to imagine Madison and other 'founding fathers' rolling in their graves at this moment in history. Gaddis just wants to justify the current abuses (and future abuses) of executive privilige. Lies, lies, lies. Does the United States Constitution begin with the words, 'I the President' or 'We the People...'?This book is a big joke. You would have to be ridiculously gullible or brainwashed by nationalist ideology to take this book as containing objective facts. Rarely ever does an account of history have such a political agenda. Their is no ambiguity in Gaddis's accounts. Just good and evil. Like Sunday School. Oh, where are you my friend Pangloss!"},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"If only Professor Gaddis had been able to completely clear his mind of leftist biases, this would have been a true classic. Unfortunately, Gaddis was unable to bring true objectivity to his otherwise excellent concise history of the Cold War.Gaddis repeats the false claim that Mao achieved his takeover of China without significant assistance from the Soviet Union. This is not true. The Soviet Union financed the Chinese Communist Party from its inception. Stalin's minions through the years trained many of the CCP cadres in the Soviet Union. When the Japanese surrendered, the Soviets turned over many tons of armaments to the CCP. This bit of dishonesty of Prof. Gaddis' part is not small.With regard to Reagan, Gaddis is honest enough to give partial credit to President Reagan for the collapse of the Soviet Union, but he minimizes his part, preferring to credit Pope John Paul for providing the main impetus. Likewise Gaddis takes up the leftist cant that the Soviet Union was ready to expire as if it were a pile of sand that needed only a few grains more on top to make it topple. This petulant refusal to grant credit where credit is due detracts from an otherwise fine historical study.Gaddis shows himself to be as much a slave to the left as was any of Stalin's minions. He blatantly states that \\"once the liberation of [Kuwait] began early in 1991, Saddam Hussein found his military deployments so visible, and therefore so exposed to attack, that he had no choice but to withdraw.\\" This is one of the leftwing rationales intended to deny credit to George H.W. Bush, Margaret Thatcher and the other leaders who were brave enough to confront those who supported the tyrant Hussein. Hussein kept his troops in place until they were practically surrounded at which point the troops panicked and tried to run. This kind of distortion should have been beneath Gaddis; alas, it was not.Finally, without exhausting the list, Gaddis waves his politically correct credentials when referring to a comment by Karl Marx. Gaddis is at pains to refer to Marx's use of the \\"sexist terminology of 1852\\" when he said that \\"[m]en make their own history.\\" Of what relevance to anything except doctrinaire left-wing political correctness is Gaddis' comment?There are numerous other tinged comments in Gaddis' work. It is a pity they exist, because The Cold War could have been a truly excellent history. As it is, it does provide a concise history of how the Cold War came to be, how the struggle was fought and ultimately, if inaccurately, how the Soviet Union and some of its satellites threw off Communism. But The Cold War must be read with wariness because of its author's tendency to subtly shade the truth.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Couldn't believe how distorted the author's view is. How can anybody say Stalin who killed brutally over 80 millions of their own innocent people in communist regime \\"A democratic leader?\\" We pay for the expensive tuition at college for our children and our naive youngsters get brainwashed by these kind or distorted propaganda? I have a idea. Send all these extreme liberal college teacher to china or Cuba, north Korea to live there 5 years. Let them to be live like their citizen, not be protected as American visiting citizen to really live with true communist government. That's it. And let me see what kind of book they will write after the real experience with the real communism. Then they will wake up from these idle- ideology. 1989, Tinamen square, a million chines college students marched to protest against their communist government of oppression: it was broadcasted all over the world, they were asking communist government to give them ;freedom for speech, media, business, religion, true-democracy( not like few communist party people controlling) by election. Sooner the communist government sent them tanks and guns and indiscriminately shoot them and ran over with tank. Whole world watched through television broadcast. There is no \\"equal Justice\\" like the communist ideologist deceives people. Only \\"Elite Party Comrades\\" have the privileges of special health care, food market for themselves only, supply stores for them only, but the rest of the citizens live in dirt poor situation deprived from basic human rights. It's just a power shift from have to have not. Maybe somebody to arrange some \\"exchange living tourism\\" between these communist countries and America, Send those \\"Deceived communism lovers\\" to live in those communist countries for a year or two years by themselves without any privileges as American, but just as like their citizen, then maybe all these communism, socialism, totalitarian movement in American will learn the true lessons of the reality, and waken up. Also, reading the books by real defects form those communist countries will give real ideas, not just full of bologna, lying ideology (theory) booksNow some ignorant Americans already forgot about this just 20 years ago's brutality that we watched with our own eyes, want to change this great nation into communist?Please study the real history. I mean the \\"real history\\" not just that stupid \\"ideology of communist\\". In a word, if you study the true history, communist repeatedly failed last 150 years.and it's the most evil regime in the history. Why?: Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.( By the way, if America didn't intervene Japanese brutal colonization from 1900-1945( gave one week warning to retreat, didn't listen, so got bombed a week later), the map of the whole Asia would be totally different now, also England, France, won't be here on the map now either.Men can't govern themselves. History always proved to be failed again and again throughout the history. Collect the real facts, separate from the author's propaganda. Lineup the real facts, then you see the history more accurately. Always develop the \\"reasoning power\\" of your own this way , not swayed by many false propagandas in most books out there. If you don't have your own reasoning power, you will be always vulnerable and get deceived.It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this nation into one-world government, communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly proved to be failed. In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to \\"concentration camp\\" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them. From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp! Several millions who stand for their freedom were killed brutally in early 20th century, during the communism overturn.If USA turned into communism, the power will shift to only those who hate the existing American system. They secretly controlling medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth by distorted facts in textbooks last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up their schemes, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scenes of the head members. They are not normal mind, full of hatred, and causing always divisions, manipulations w lies. Sadly this government & Geroge Soro' socialic, communistic union party people hired many \\"paid bloggers from 4 years ago intensively promoting hatreds & division. Real sad thing is most American publics are so ignorant, not knowing the behind scenes, get brain washed step by step through facebook, twitters, googles' net traffic, youtube...so on.Many good people's web site had been already blocked from public access from 2010. Do u know who r the major donors to all the ivy league schools in America? Middle Eastern Islamic terrorists sponsoring extremists. We pour our oil money into these middle eastern countries, these islamic extremists trains terrorists w our oil money, sending back to USA to brain wash college kids, funding mosques, also from 1960' pouring into American textbook committees to distort our history, fanning the Anti-america propaganda w socialists, communism together to destroy this great nation. But Americans are sleeping. While these trillion's forein oil money are eating up our nation, last prolong Democratic congress, present government prohibit our own oil production saying \\"environmental protection\\". No wonder our debt is no more controllable. To this nation to be strong, we have to have our own provision of power sources. Get it? Can't go on with debts like this, Though we fully develop all forms of green energy, it is still less than 40% of our total energy sources. Before polar bears or dolphins' eyes, we are getting total broke, can't even protect them from international slaughters. Please think people & wake up from those hired bloggers & medias who were own by few extreme liberal bosses. Research the communism nations' history. All the nations turned into communism fall into worst human rights and economic state from their establishment. Any communist countries in the history ever get better as decades go by?China is the only seemingly doing well now. Why? because from 10 years ago, they realized communism was failed with extreme poverty, started to adapting the partial capitalism into their system-free competitive capitalism. They are actually hybrid with communism with partial democratic system, but still, anyone speak against party: labor camp w/o fair trail, all medias have to only report what government want:can't. They lie that they have religious freedom, even has a yellow page church lists,but if you go those address, they are all locked. If you openly have church meeting: Another concentration camp trip! That's the reality people. If USA turned into communism, the power will shift to only those who hate the existing American system. They secretly controlling communicast-medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted facts in textbooks last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scene head members:They are mostly angry people with extreme hatred. Before you get associate with these kinds, study the actual communism history and the result of those countries over last 100 years. then you might understand why people escape from those communist countries despite the danger of their lives, come to USA. Americans seem so ignorant , don't even know what kind of freedom or dreams that anyone can pursue if they want. I can't believe how americans are lazy and stupid (sorry for my expression) not protecting their precious freedom and the wealth that whole world envy. Pretty sad to see this great nation is stumbling by the smooth, deceitful talking, present government and together with mostly blinded, deceivedmajority. My last word: America wake up and protect what your forefathers gave to you. Don't get robbed by those haters of your wealth and power. If America had been the most wealthy and liberal nation in the whole world so far, doesn't it already proved what you have is the best national system already?Do you have to be a rocket scientist to see this simple truth? Don't be deceived. Though there are some defectiveness of the free-market -capitalism, still when it comes to human dignity and god given , basic human freedom, communism and socialism are the evil, and total failures!"},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I received the book and it appeared to be in good order. Not until I was far into the book did I realize it was missing over 30 pages. I didn't realize one needed to count the pages in a book to make sure they were all there."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Gaddis has done an excellent job of telling an extremely complicated history in a tight and well-written volume. The importance of his story is contrasted by his reminding the reader that his college students today have almost no living memory of the Cold War or just how serious a historical epic it was between two great powers.As the world has changed dramatically over the past 16 years since the fall of the Soviet Union, this book will be an excellent resource to remember just what a huge struggle the Western bloc vs. the Soviet Union and its satellites was. This is not an ideaological book from the Yale professor Gaddis, but he gives credit to the end of the Cold War to three individuals and a people group: Ronald Reagan, Margeret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II and the people of eastern Europe who contiually stood up to the Soviet and local communist leaders.A weak point of this book, which admittedly does not have time to explore the vast and complicated expressions of every part of the Cold War is Gaddis explanation for why the anti-war movements of the 1960's and 70's in the West erupted with as much fury as they did, and subsided almost as quickly. His explanation, that it was largely caused by baby boom young adults, coming of age, with lots of time on their hands seems like a short answer. Comparing and contrasting the reaction of the West to the Korean War vs. Vietnam might have made a better use of the text.Gaddis presentation of how the Cold War started at the end of World War II is another excellent section, especially how the West, making practical concessions to the Soviets that they could never hope to bargain for at the end of the war, quickly turned European opinion against the Soviets by forcing the Soviets into the position of being the ones who built wall, established border police and shut themselves off because they had to keep people in.The explanation of proxy conflicts, especially in the Middle East, is another highlight of the work. Seeing the Israeli and Palestinian conflict as rump to the Cold War, and the Soviets inability to deal with their Egyptian allies in Nasser further showed the weakness of the Soviet state.While ultimatley Gaddis presents the end of the Cold War as being led by the four main actors mentioned earlier, his treatment of Gorbachev as a man who managed the end of the failure of the Soviet Empire and the inability of the Soviets to have a sustainable economic future - the very reason for its existence is told with great clarity.Gaddis warns throughout the book that choosing an ends justifying the means approach got the West into more dificulty than anything else. The attempt by the West, especially between John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, to manage a stable world delayed the inevitable end of the Cold War and more than likely created greater human misery of the likes the world has rarely scene. Ronald Reagan, and Thatcher and John Paul, were in a sense revolutionaries, for they sought to win the Cold War by calling for total peace and not half measures of agreements and stability."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This book is a masterpiece of what Gaddis once termed \\"lumping,\\" or the search for overall themes and trends in history. The only negative thing that could possibly be said is that The Cold War is not an in-depth look at a conflict full of details to explore. But those who are reading this book for such an account are missing the point entirely. Gaddis explicitly set out to write a short, thematic, but still informative book on his area of expertise, and he has done so without fault.Both style and substance are well treated, which is fairly rare for brief history books. Gaddis admits right off the bat to taking liberties with the timeline, which alarmed me when I read it. But instead of running rampant through decades with no purpose, the focus on themes over dates runs smoothly and in a natural harmony with the subject matter. Gaddis ties together each individual chapter with a theme well enough that the time deviations are unnoticable. Even better, the themes, though light on specific dates, do not sacrifice important facts to brevity or lyricism.The quibbles about focusing on US-Soviet relations or Europe seem to me to be fairly ridiculous. There is plenty of information on US-China-Soviet relations, Cuba, even interesting asides on Angola and other third world battlegrounds. The fact that Gaddis perhaps breezes through them reflects their relative weight in the wide sweep of the Cold War, and the shortness of such sections does not mean they are uninformative fluff. Every page in this book has use and information; it is truly a must-read for beginners to Cold War history, and a fantastic addition to the libraries of history and Gaddis fans."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I promise, no pontification in this review! I am certainly no authority as to the subject of the cold war and am certainly willing to admit it. That being said, I did find this work quite informative. For my purposes, it fit the bill and my needs. The author gives us a work of popular history (no text bookish stuff here) and gives mere folk like myself, with an interest in history, a very readable and, I feel, insightful look at a very important period of our time. I do suppose there are works out there that go into the subject with greater depth and I suppose not everyone will agree as to the author's opinions and conclusions, but this, to my mind, is a good thing. The more opinions we have, the better off we are. For those interested, they have ample opportunity to further research the subject for themselves. I personally was in agreement with much of what the author stated (having lived through all of it) and personally was and am motivated to do some further reading into this subject, given the time to do so. This, in my opinion, is what is so nice about works such as this...they act as \\"ticklers,\\" prompting those who want, to go ahead and read further. In this small a volume, I highly doubt if the author even vaguely felt he was covering all there is to cover over this time period. I seriously doubt if that was his intention. To be frank, anyone picking up this book of a little over 300 pages expecting that sort of thing, probably should go back to school and take a few more of those survey type courses. Anyway, I was delighted with this book, am glad I added it to my collection, and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"The year Ronald Reagan died my mom commented to me, \\"What is all the fuss about Reagan? What did he ever do?\\" After I wiped the blood from my eyes, I asked her, \\"You don't speak Russian do you? If nothing else, you can thank him and men like him for that.\\" People tend to forget what a formidable foe the USSR was and how close they came to winning the Cold War. Todays youth have even made the old Russian flag a fashion statement, wearing it on tee-shirts hoping to gain cool points from their hip socialist brainwashed friends. But the fact of the matter is that the Russian Empire was a threat. John Gaddis does an excellent job reminding us of this fact. Although the book is not an in depth study of the cold war, it is useful as a reminder to subsequent generations that the Communist threat was real, in American and throughout the rest of the world."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"A very concise view of the developments that lead up to and through the Cold War. It is a book designed for those of us interested in the period without a need for the depth that academics or professional historians would need."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Although John Gaddis wrote this book primarily for an American undergraduate audience it should have a much wider appeal. It will though, discomfort those who still retain a lingering affection for Stalin and the old Soviet Union. Gaddis places a primary responsibility for the Cold War at Stalin's feet, or more appropriately at his throat. It is a masterly survey of the Cold War from its origins through to the collapse of the Soviet Union and 'the end of History'. Those who want to place a moral equivalence for the continuation of the Cold War upon the shoulders of both the USA and USSR will also be discomforted by Gaddis's blunt assessment of the virus of suspicion and even paranoia that infected the Soviet leadership, until Gorbachev; and which far surpassed any comparable symptoms in the USA. The Cold War: A New History is an excellent introduction which should encourage wider reading on this subject."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Schabowski? More on him later. Author Gaddis has written an outstanding book for the average reader. He teaches a course on this, and one day a student of his suggested he write a summary of the Cold War for the general reader. After all a person has to be over 60 to have lived through most of it. This book is the result, and Gaddis makes every word count.I've been amused by reviews that says the book is too long, or too short, or it is opinionated. It's just the right length, going into enough detail to tie together all the elements of a 45 year period in which the concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD) was the operating policy of the USSR and the United States. It is opinionated, no doubt, but it is fascinating to read the author's take on the whys and wherefores of everything that happened.Initially the goal was d&eacute;tente, two major powers beefing themselves up to insure that war between them would be an absurd death sentence. All the time, however, the superpowers were struggling somehow to lessen the dangers of this sort of coexistence. Sadly their efforts were frequently set back by governmental acts of folly. We were making some progress when we decided to invade Vietnam. The Russians were infuriated. Not that they cared a whit about Vietnam. It was just that our engagement in this war set back the negotiating process. Another setback was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.Then some key people came on the scene. John Paul II aroused millions when he visited Poland; Lech Walesa created a groundswell of hope among the Poles. Thatcher came on the scene and declared socialism a failure in Britain, and then Reagan decided that d&eacute;tente wasn't something we could live with for the rest of human life on the planet. Gaddis feels that certain people arriving at the right time helped end the Cold War. Russia's total control of its people was based on promises of a better way of life, and keeping them in fear of outside forces like the U.S. These means of control began to fail.Oh yes, then there is Schabowski, a minion of the East German government who, in late 1989, was told to hold a press conference reading a statement that the government was going to relax somewhat the restrictions on citizens leaving the country. Schabowski hadn't read the document carefully, got on stage, fumbled with his papers, and told the world that from now on East Germans could leave the country whenever they wanted to. And that's when the wall came tumbling down.I did live through this entire period, and was glad to read this excellent memory refresher. I learned new things, and appreciated Mr. Gaddis's take on the governments and people involved in this long deadly battle to achieve a greater peace in the world. I'm not sure I agreed with everything he said, but that's fine. I read books to learn things and to get other people's perspective on what's happened in the history of this troubled world. In my opinion no one can write a history of this subject and give just the \\"facts.\\""},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Gaddis is able to take a sort of Owl of Minerva approach to the Cold War in this slim, engaging book. It is now nearly 25 years since the convulsions in Eastern Europe swiftly ended the USSR, and the Cold War with it. What wisdom now enlightens this period, still within the living memory of many people, yet fast receding into the realms of 'proper' history?Plenty, as it turns out.This is not a dry narrative description of facts. It is an overview jam packed with insight and opinion. You may agree, you may disagree with much of it. No matter. It is far harder (as a reviewer of Hobsbawm's 'Age of Extremes' pointed out) to condense and scintillate than expand and complicate.The origins of the Cold War are dealt with briskly (Yalta is only given a few pages). The meat of the analysis comes in Gaddis's considerations on strategy vis a vis containment, nuclear weapons, detente (in the 70s) and, ultimately, bold confrontation (in the 80s) leading to the unravelling of the USSR under Gorbachev.It is an excellent volume to introduce students to the Cold War if their existing knowledge is minimal. The roles of the major figures (Stalin, Truman, Kennedy, Kruschev, Nixon, Mao, Kissinger, Reagan, Gorbachev etc.) are introduced deftly into the account. But there is space, especially towards the end, for a consideration of the role of ordinary people, such as the Hungarians who cut down their barbed wire, and the Polish voters who swept solidarity into power in the first Post War Democratic Elections held in 1989 (much to the surprise of Walsea, their leader).It is very much a pro-US history of the Cold War, especially towards the end. Reagan comes out as a bold hero, using his actor's timing to produce brave and game changing speeches to undermine the Soviet Union. But Gorbachev is given his due - Gaddis paints him as an intellectually muddled leader, lacking the direction of other powerful and influential leaders such as Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping. It was naive of him in the extreme to expect to liberate and still be able to hold on to socialism. But to his credit he backed off using force, accepted his fall when Yeltsin ousted him in a coup, and retired, like so many people have done since, to contemplate the significance of it all."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis is one of the &#8220;deans&#8221; of Cold War historical studies, and this book provides an excellent, high-level narrative of the unfolding of the Cold War and what brought it to its conclusion with the fall of the Soviet Union. It&#8217;s a quick read, providing a superb summary of how the Cold War began, the critical events as the conflict heated up in the late 1940&#8217;s, the 1950&#8217;s and early 1960&#8217;s, and then the long process of &#8220;stabilizing&#8221; the conflict and moving towards its conclusion.Even in summary form, Gaddis provides a number of illuminating interpretations of the key events of the Cold War &#8211; how the parallel struggle against colonialism was shaped by the Cold War, and how &#8220;Third World&#8221; nations were able to use the Cold War antagonisms to strengthen their new nations&#8217; positioning in the world; how the Cold War antagonists shared a perception that nuclear weapons made another global conflict completely impossible; how the stalemate in Europe in the late 1940&#8217;s caused the Cold War conflict to shift towards Asia; and other topics. Each of these is dealt with at a very high level, but Gaddis conveys very persuasively his own views of how each of these developments fit into the overall Cold War struggle and how each influenced it.Gaddis argues that efforts in the late 1960&#8217;s to implement &#8220;d&eacute;tente&#8221; as a strategy to contain the possibility of conflict between the two main Cold War antagonists had the effect of &#8220;freezing&#8221; the conflict in place, sustaining the Soviet Union&#8217;s position in the world and leaving the globe at the mercy of massively armed nuclear superpowers. Figures such as Pope John Paul II, President Reagan, Prime Minister Thatcher and others were key to challenging this implicit consensus on stability and this implied deference to the Soviet Union&#8217;s authority, causing the weaknesses of communism as a system and the Soviet Union&#8217;s dominance of eastern Europe to surface and eventually cause the final collapse in the late 1980&#8217;s/early 1990&#8217;s. His description of John Paul&#8217;s first visit as Pope to Poland in 1979 is particularly moving.The book provides an excellent overview of the Cold War and, for those wanting more, is a good place to start an exploration of this period."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"great work. my students actually introduced it to me in their bibliographies when writing about the atomic bomb. the first page will prove its worth in serious but readable historiography."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Definatly worth your time. I lived during the tail end of the Cold War, but my father lived through all of it. The war is sometimes over/mis-refferenced by right-wingers and since no direct military conflict was exchanged between the two super-powers, it was easy for me to overlook this war in my youth. Now I see how important it was. My father is a military man and a Democrat so my political identity was hard for me to discover and impossible for others to pigeon-hole. JFK adopted Eisenhowers ill-planned Bay of Pigs invasion and took all the blame. He also won the Cold War by keeping a cool head and keeping communication lines open with Soviets. Strength and wisdon are not mutually opposing values. JFK won the war and the following decades saw the decline of a failed political ideology running its course helped along by great orators. The author correctly refers to those like John-Paul II and Reagan as \\"actor-leaders\\", orators who put the conflict into perspective for the world but who did not participate on the level that JFK did. The author puts Reagan in a good light, but not to the almost messianic level today's conservatives place him. As far as slants or bias, I can find little fault with the author. Gaddis does a childish nit-pick of JFK's Mutualy Assured Distruction policy, quibbling over whether or not Eisenhower came up with it first. He also refferences a possibly apocryphal conversation between Mao and Nixon were Mao praises \\"rightists\\" and disparages \\"leftists\\". Another blantantly BS stance Gaddis takes is that anti-Vietnam War protests had no effect on government policy. We fought a war of independence against the British for the freedom of assembly and speech and Gaddis dismisses the protests like he was whistling past the graveyard. If the protestors had so little power, why did Nixon have that famous meeting with protesters at the Lincon Monuement? Kudos, though, for refferencing a Polish labor leader as a hero in the company of Reagan and John-Paul II. This Polish workers story illistrates the great depths and nuance of Cold War issues and shows how an ordinary man can shake things up on a global scale. All-in-all a great and important read for history-buffs. Concise and grand-in-scale at the same time."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This book about the cold war is great for many reasons. It is a concise history of the many events that made up this war that never got hot; which was a good thing for all humanity. Between two ideoligies and economic systems, between two great military powers and in the begining between two big egos.One of the things that make this book great is the way it is written. The author is a History proffesor and like any good proffesor he tells a good story every time he recites a lesson. Mr. Gaddis makes very good observations on the situation at hand and the way it relates to world politics at the time. He also slices open the deficiencies of the Communist system and how it is inadequate for man kind. The main reason he gives for this is that in Communism living stanarts drop off instead rise and the lack of freedom that himan beings desire.The ending is also well written. He details the Soviet Premier's choices that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. The communist system just could no longer hold off the vast expenses it had. The premier had no choice but to let its satelites weaken themselves by allowing its peoples more and more freedom. To get more details on the events that encompas the long History of the Cold War read this book as it is a great review of its many events written in a very good manner."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Prof. Gaddis has done a great service to the reading public by condensing the complicated, 45-year Cold War into a highly readable, 267-page history. Were key events given short shrift? Sure. But Gaddis nails all the high points. For example, he astutely observes -- I cannot believe how many people still deny this -- that it was impossible for the Cold War to end until detente broke down. The Soviet system was failing; detente was a lifeline -- a gift from the West. An entire generation, Gaddis observes, had grown up believing \\"the absurdities of superpower stalemate\\" (a divided Berlin inside a divided Germany inside a divided Europe) were the natural order, and that the Cold War would go on indefinitely. It took \\"actors\\" -- in Gaddis' term; some would prefer to call them \\"visionaries\\" -- to envision an endgame. John Paul II, Walesa, Havel, Reagan and Thatcher were some of these \\"actors.\\" \\"They had destinations in mind, and a map for reaching them,\\" Gaddis writes. The \\"destination\\" was, in Reagan's word, to \\"transcend\\" Communism, not just contain it. Gorbachev was not an actor, never a visionary leader, according to Gaddis. He \\"dithered in contradictions,\\" Gaddis says, wanting to save socialism, but declining to use force to do so. Gorbachev chose to be loved rather than feared --ignoring Machiavelli's advice. It cost him the Communist empire, but earned him the world's eternal gratitude and a Nobel Peace Prize. Gaddis says he's written this compact history for his college-age students who have no memory of the Cold War -- members of the Class of 2005 were only five years old when the Berlin Wall came down -- but readers of all ages will benefit from this excellent work."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis has done the general reader a service by writing a relatively short book about the entire Cold War period. Serious students and scholars will probably find themselves saying \\"I am familiar with these events and Gaddis's take on them, so why did I buy the book?\\" That is a fair question, but the book does encapsulate the key points of Gaddis's interpretations of major issues, so if one is seeking such an overview of the 1946-1991 era with a conservative tilt, one could certainly do worse than The Cold War: A New History."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I frankly find myself scratching my head reading the positive reviews after having read this book. I unfortunately agree more with Mr. Desmond's negative assessment. I can't be quite as harsh as him though and do give the book two stars.One star is for attempting to write a book of such ambitious design, a one stop overview of the entire cold war. The second is for the fact that the author is at least a very good writer (fluid prose, vivid descriptions, etc.), but for reasons I'll explain shortly this does not mean I think he's a good historian.There are many, many flaws in this book. First, as a history of the entire Cold War, it is 256 pages of actual text or so. To say depth is lost and superficiality is necessary to try to cover so large an event over such a long period of time in so short an amount of space would be a drastic understatement. It fails however to make up for this lack of depth by pulling out new or innovative insights by virtue of its tremendous breadth. The author clearly knows a lot of facts of the cold war, and repeats some of them, but his insights are just terrible, if not completely sophmoric. Many of his insights are along the lines of declaring that Moscow and Washington \\"really did think alike\\" because both believed thermonuclear weapons could destroy civilization if used. You could also conclude that Catholic priests and atheists think alike because both believe the sky is blue. This completely glosses over the extreme and salient differences in ideologies and paradigms with which the west and the communists saw and interpreted the world. He seems to conclude that capitalism won simply because it was hopeful (as opposed to communism's autocratic and fearful nature) and because it just so happened to be better at allocating resources, a further symptom of what seems to be a gross misunderstanding of what both systems were truly about and their fundamentally irreconcible moral / philosophical foundations. (A misunderstanding that astonishingly leads him to declare China a capitalist country after Deng Xiaoping comes to power, although this sloppy and unrealistic assessment of China is unfortunately rampant today and continues to obfuscate the true natures of capitalism and communism). He also claims that human nature actually physically changed as evidenced by the fact that mankind did not use nuclear weapons, and that it changed as a result of leaders like Harry Truman. These assertions are not only strikingly rare for a book of this nature, but seem alarmingly obtuse when offered.The book also suffers from being very poorly organized. It is not chronological, which is fine, but neither is it theme driven, divided instead into pseudo-thematic chapters. However, with titles like \\"Lifeboats and Deathboats,\\" the themes of these chapters are not only vague, but hard to actually see shining through in the content of the chapter or in any analysis of said content. As a result it's 250+ pages of randomly jumping about datapoints from the cold war that progresses chronologically only on average. The near random agglomeration of facts in each chapter seems connected to the title only through clumsily crafted analogies to pop culture references. Often these analogies came off as both forced fit and unconvincing. For example the Lifeboats and Deathboats chapter ties into a reference to the once popular book Life of Pi, but not really in any meaningful way. One gets the sense of the author just liking the book and being proud of himself for plugging it in his own, or thinking that proving to the world he read it makes him come off as smart or cultured.Another major flaw with the book is that you are better off reading it with overview knowledge about the cold war already, and I would not recommend it to someone who lacks this knowledge - ostensibly the book's target audience. Completely lacking in organization, major themes of the Cold War, particularly Detente, usually just appear in mid stream of other thoughts as references. They are barely explained, let alone even introduced. And due to the short nature of the book are given equally short shrift, undeserving of their importance to the world we now live in.This book is not even light history, it's history lite. No calories, no steak, not even the sizzle. If Mr. Gaddis is the pre-eminent American historian of the Cold War I weep for the state of American historians.This book is quick and easy to read, and has some interesting information, but I can't really recommend it."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Simply spectacular. I only wish the book were twice as large and twice as detailed. There is so much to cover, for example, that the Cuban Missile Crisis receives only one page.Gaddis has written much on the cold war, and this was, for all intents and purposes, his attempt to \\"dumb it down\\" to a more accessible survey. In this he has succeeded, and from here I will turn to his other, more detailed writing on the period."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This book is a masterpiece! It is concise and easy-to-read, yet authoritative. Yale professor John Lewis Gaddis has been a distinguished scholar of the Cold War for decades, and this book received great reviews from George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft, and experts on the former USSR, such as William Taubman (Pulitzer Prize author of \\"Khrushchev\\") and Anne Applebaum (Pulitzer Prize author of \\"Gulag\\"). I highly recommend it!Gaddis correctly begins the story of the Cold War during World War Two, and even before. The Allies kept their alliance together long enough to destroy Hitler, but USA and USSR emerged from WWII as superpower rivals. The Cold War was inevitable. Stalin wanted big gains from WWII because of the tremendous sacrifices that USSR suffered. He first wanted a buffer zone in Eastern Europe, and then he wanted Communist influence around the world. In contrast, Roosevelt wanted security and a better world - not selfish gains. FDR and Churchill issued their war aims through the Atlantic Charter: Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Fear, Freedom from Want, the right to self-determination, etc. (The Russian generals, by the way, allowed their soldiers to rape 2 million German women).Stalin distrusted USA and Britain because he suspected that Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill repeatedly postponed a second-front so that the Soviets would suffer maximum casualties fighting Nazi Germany. 20 million Soviets died in WWII, while 400,000 Americans died. In return, USA and Britain were distrustful of USSR. As FDR said two weeks before he died, \\"Stalin has broken every one of the promises he made at Yalta!\\"USSR was founded on authoritarianism and hatred towards capitalism. In contrast, America was founded on the principle of restrained government and the individual's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, but nuclear weapons now existed and could annihilate the world. WWII had killed 55 million people. Could World War Three be avoided?FDR tried to put in place a post-war system of international relations, such as the UN, to prevent WWIII. After FDR's death, Eleanor Roosevelt worked to achieve the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Leading up to WWII, FDR had tactfully pulled America from isolationism to destroy Hitler. Would America stay engaged in world affairs as FDR had planned or slip back into isolationism? Would Stalin get what he wanted?Stalin had the advantage in the early years of the Cold War, but he blundered. USSR had massive armies in Eastern Europe, and Communism was popular in parts of Europe. (Stalin's mass murders were not yet known). Stalin calculated that capitalism would falter as it had during the Great Depression, that capitalist countries would squabble with greed, and that Communists would then legally gain power through elections.Stalin dominated Poland by refusing to allow free elections as promised in writing at Yalta. Harry Truman gave a \\"tongue lashing\\" to USSR foreign minister Molotov to honor the promise, but nothing could be done. (Read David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize-winning \\"Truman\\"). The much larger Soviet armies were initially checked by America's monopoly on the bomb, but then the Soviets tested their own atomic bomb. That's when George Kennan and George Marshall devised the strategy called containment. To win-over the Europeans, the Americans launched the Marshall Plan, which offered massive aid to ANY country that wanted it.Stalin's response to the Marshall Plan was a diplomatic disaster for USSR. He refused Marshall Plan aid to Eastern European countries, and then he blockaded Berlin. This appeared to be a setback for USA, but it actually reduced Stalin's influence. Stalin himself brought down the Iron Curtain. Truman then proclaimed his Truman Doctrine and formed the NATO alliance.One president who is often overlooked, but receives recognition in this book, is Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower rejected the idea that nuclear weapons could be used in limited combat, setting an important precedent to never use them. He understood the panic of combat and that an escalating nuclear response would result. According to Eisenhower's official biographer, Stephen Ambrose, Eisenhower was pressured to launch a first strike against USSR \\"many times - at least four times\\" but he would not do it. (Read \\"American Heritage Great Minds of History: Interviews by Roger Mudd,\\" available at Amazon.com).After the Soviets ruthlessly crushed the rebellions in Eastern Europe, killing tens of thousands, Eisenhower refused to help because he believed that a direct clash with USSR could destroy the world. His credentials as Supreme Allied Commander during WWII allowed him to pull this off as nobody else could. (In contrast, Lyndon Johnson felt he could not avoid Vietnam). Eisenhower instead emphasized the importance of avoiding a hot war and talked about the brutal concept of total war.The Kennedy administration devised the strategy called MAD - mutually assured destruction. John Kennedy then gave his legendary \\"I am a Berliner\\" speech after the Soviets built the Berlin Wall, and he skillfully handled the Cuban Missile Crisis.After the Watergate scandal, America's Cold War policies came under scrutiny. Containment required making alliances with brutal regimes, such as the Shaw of Iran. The CIA occasionally used controversial tactics, such as the Eisenhower administration overthrowing the democratic (but socialist) government of Guatemala, the Nixon administration undermining the democracy of Chile (inadvertently bringing the tyrant Pinochet to power), and the Reagan administration supporting the El Salvador regime that utilized death squads. Detente also was scrutinized.According to Gaddis, the 1975 Helsinki accord was a landmark event: \\"Brezhnev and the Kremlin leadership proposed a \`conference on security and cooperation in Europe' ...[which] would require the United States and its allies to state publicly and in writing that they accepted the postwar division of Europe. The Kremlin leader was almost capitalist in the importance he attached to this contractual obligation, which he believed would discourage future \`Prague springs'... and he was willing to make extraordinary concessions to get this commitment... most surprisingly, recognizing \`the universal significance of human rights and fundamental freedoms... in conformance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.'\\"...Liberals and conservatives alike denounced [the Helsinki accord]... Pursuing detente was hardly worth it if it meant perpetuating injustice by recognizing Soviet control in Eastern Europe... These episodes made Helsinki a liability to [Gerald] Ford during the 1976 presidential campaign... Helsinki's effects inside the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, however, were equally unexpected, and far more significant. Brezhnev had looked forward, Dobrynin recalls, to the \`publicity he would gain... when the Soviet public learned of the final settlement of the postwar boundaries for which they had sacrificed so much'... [Instead,] \`it gradually became a manifesto of the dissident and liberal movement'... Brezhnev could hardly repudiate what he had agreed to... human rights... What this meant was that the people who lived under these systems - at least the more courageous - could claim official permission to say what they thought.\\"The fall of the Soviet empire eventually came when Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power. Unlike his hard-line Communist predecessors, Gorbachev refused to ruthlessly crush the rebellions that broke-out under his watch, and the Soviet empire unraveled. Gorbachev won the Nobel Peace Prize and the first Ronald Reagan Freedom Award.When Gorbachev first took power, the USSR economy was a shambles, because Communism is an inferior economic system. The Soviets also lost the Afghanistan war. Gorbachev felt he had to do something bold, so he implemented Perestroika and Glasnost reforms to try and revive USSR. Those freedoms allowed rebellion to take root, such as the Solidarity movement in Poland led by Lech Walesa. According to Gaddis, \\"When John Paul II kissed the ground at the Warsaw airport on June 2, 1979, he began the process by which Communism in Poland - and ultimately everywhere else in Europe - would come to an end.\\" John Paul II was a worldwide celebrity and openly condemned Communism.According to Gaddis, \\"The Cold War itself was a kind of theater in which distinctions between illusions and reality were not always obvious. It presented great opportunities for great actors to play great roles.\\" With his good acting skills, Ronald Reagan at first applied the pressure, calling USSR \\"the evil empire.\\" Reagan modeled his presidential role after his idol FDR. (Reagan voted for FDR four times). He was deeply inspired by FDR's supremely-confident bashing of Nazi Germany and spirited defense of democracy. (Read Douglas Brinkley's \\"Boys of Pointe du Hoc\\" and Lou Cannon's \\"President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime\\"). Now Reagan would turn that role against USSR. Reagan restored America's strength.But once Gorbachev came to power, Reagan changed his position and welcomed Gorbachev as a good friend. The Cold War peacefully ended in 1987. (Read \\"Reagan and Gorbachev\\" by Jack Matlock, Reagan's top advisor and ambassador to USSR). Then Reagan applied his charm through diplomacy, urging Gorbachev to go further with reform: \\"We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness... General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization... Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\\"Gaddis writes, \\"Secretary of State Shultz, a former economics professor at Stanford, took it upon himself to educate... Gorbachev, as early as 1985, on the impossibility of a closed society being prosperous... Over the next several years, he used his trips to [Moscow] to run tutorials for Gorbachev and his advisors, even bringing pie charts... When Reagan visited the Soviet Union in May, 1988, Gorbachev arranged for him to lecture at Moscow University on the virtues of market capitalization.\\" Gorbachev's reforms failed to revive the USSR economy. Instead, they unleashed Pandora's Box of freedom. Once the door was opened, it could not be put back.The Berlin Wall was decreed open on November 9, 1989. Gaddis writes, \\"The border guards at Bornholmer Strasse took it upon themselves to open the gates... Soon Germans from both sides were sitting, standing and even dancing on the wall.\\"In his autobiography called \\"An American Life,\\" Reagan shared his warm feelings for Gorbachev and his fear that Gorbachev might be ousted by Communist hardliners: \\"I was concerned for his safety... I've still worried about him: How hard and fast can he push reforms without risking his life?\\" Eventually the hardliners in USSR finally got fed-up with Gorbachev's liberal reforms and tried to oust Gorbachev with a coup, but the coup failed. Then everything unraveled, with Boris Yeltsin leading the resistance in the streets of Moscow. Yeltsin became leader of the new Russia and USSR ceased to exist.By the way, Gaddis states that Reagan had long wished to abolish all nuclear weapons. At the Reykjavik summit, Reagan proposed abolishing all nukes and sharing SDI technology, which Reagan thought would make nukes obsolete, but Gorbachev declined. (Read Paul Lettow's \\"Ronald Reagan and his Quest to Abolish Nuclear Weapons\\").Finally, I am in a unique position to recommend this book because I had the opportunity to witness the unraveling of the Soviet empire. In college I studied the Cold War and took a trip to USSR with my university when Gorbachev was in power and Bush senior was president. I saw firsthand that the Russian economy was languishing. I view Communism as a despicable aberration of history.Rebellion was stirring in USSR in many places. I observed a vigorous rebellion in Lithuania. There was a huge demonstration, and Soviet helicopters dropped leaflets warning the Lithuanians to immediately stop the rebellion. I have one of the leaflets as a priceless memorabilia of the Cold War. Soviet tanks rumbled through the capital. But Gorbachev, unlike his predecessors, would not brutally crack down.I also recommend the Pulitzer-Prize winning book about the collapse of USSR called \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" by David Remnick."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"The Cold War: A New HistoryJohn Lewis GaddisEven though the book presents the stereotype versions of America and the Soviet Union (i.e. Russia) it is a very informative chronology of the events presented logically of the Cold War from World War II until the collapse of the USSR.But...Mr. Gaddis either ignores or excuses many of the faults of the USA. Certainly as a historian he must be aware of them and is intentionally presenting a sterilized view of America. Thus the book is pure propaganda.For instance in one passage he slides over the virtual genocide of the Native Americans implying the clich&eacute; that it was caused by the unfortunate and unintentional epidemic of small pox.The author pretends not to know that the USA was not a nave freedom loving humanitarian democratic paradise until confronted with the Cold War evils of Russia, China and Cuba at which time the USA had to \\"learn to be bad\\" in order to fight the evil of communism.Hopefully readers of the book are not highly impressionable and have read other versions of American history, in particular Howard Zinn's \\"A Peoples History of the United States\\" and Churchill Ward's: \\"A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas 1492 to the Present\\" as well as some critical history of slavery and American colonialism such as in Cuba and the Philippines.In summary Mr. Gaddis' book is an excellent comic book version of American history complete with white hats and black hats; good vs. evil; and all the other common myths such as America has \\"never taken a square inch of territory\\"."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Excellent coverage of the issues surrounding the cold war. Could have used more detail. It is very good at highlighting the contribution of certain key individuals in bringing down the Soviet Union.It scrimps on economic issues.Overall a very good read."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Well written book I ever read. Highly recommended for people interested in modern 20th century."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I bought this book with the expectation that it would provide a comprehensive overview of the events, episodes, personalities, motivations, and results of the Cold War. A reader looking for something similar might be disappointed. This book does not really attempt to be a comprehensive history of the Cold War, but is rather a collection of chapters, each devoted to a particular thematic aspect of the war. It reads as though Gaddis has a particular thesis about the Cold War that he wants to flesh out in each chapter, rather than telling the whole story in an orderly narrative.As examples: there is a chapter about the \\"logic\\" of Mutual Assured Destruction, and how mankind's survival depended on two superpowers maneuvering their way through that system's pitfalls. There is another chapter contrasting the Leninist vision of authoritarianism with the Wilsonian vision of self-determination. There is a chapter about how the superpowers' respective allies eventually refused to do their bidding. There is a chapter about the moral paradoxes at the heart of American Cold War international policy. There is another about the key individual actors who forced the Cold War to a successful resolution. And there is one, sort of a \\"people power\\" chapter, about how the Cold War ended (Gaddis argues) largely because the internal contradictions of communism, the gap between its promises and its reality, would no longer be tolerated by its subjects.I found many of these chapters to be thought-provoking, and often found them persuasive. At first, I resisted Gaddis's thesis about the spillover of amorality from the international sphere to the American domestic sphere, and how this precipitated the fall of Richard Nixon. It seemed a weak thesis to me at first, but upon reflection, I agree with Gaddis that there was a fundamental discomfort, a paradox, in how America waged the Cold War. We cozied up to various dictators who violated American values re individual rights, so long as they sided with us in the conflict. And we countenanced actions abroad that we would not have at home. Eventually, Gaddis argues, the roof fell in on those contradictions, when President Nixon started to practice the sort of statecraft domestically that had previously only been tolerated internationally. Gaddis seems to suggest that it was only a matter of time before something like this happened, that this inconsistency was unsustainable.In other places, though, I found Gaddis to be less convincing. Certainly the demonstrations of \\"people power\\" that brought down the communist regimes were courageous and consequential. But it is equally true that it could have come out quite differently, if a Stalin had still been in power. Gaddis argues that the people in the communist regimes had finally come to fully appreciate the vast gulf between communism's promises and its reality, and while that is no doubt true, many a similarly-cognizant subject of these regimes was crushed by them in earlier decades. Many other factors coalesced to bring down the governments behind the Iron Curtain, including the steady economic and military pressure brought to bear by a more prosperous west.Perhaps the best chapter in the Gaddis book is the one that is devoted to \\"actors\\" -- the singular figures whose insights and vision succeeded in changing the world. Gaddis is clearly an admirer of John Paul II, and he also credits Ronald Reagan with a lofty vision beyond what most other statesmen of his time could see. Reagan, according to Gaddis, was critical to ending the uneasy, dangerous \\"peace\\" of Mutual Assured Destruction.Another of Gaddis's finer chapters is one wherein he details the events in Hungary and East Germany that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Gaddis presents more details and insights than I have found in other histories of those wondrous events of 1989.Some of Gaddis's pronouncements struck me as simply curious. He states in one chapter that never so much misery and suffering has been borne from good intentions as under the communist regimes. Whose good intentions, I wondered? Stalin? Lenin? Marx? Mao? It really stretches the definition of \\"good intentions\\" to ascribe such to the architects of 20th century authoritarian communism. By this malleable definition, most any dictator could be said to have \\"good intentions.\\"Gaddis also provides a much loftier portrait of Woodrow Wilson than I believe most historians would share. Gaddis indicates that Wilson is highly respected today, but I would suggest that at least as many historians regard Wilson as an impractical romantic, in the arena of international relations.I would recommend Gaddis's book as a second or third book on the Cold War, but not the first source. It is not the best source as to the \\"what,\\" though Gaddis's pronouncements on \\"why\\" are often convincing."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Yale history professor John Lewis Gaddis is America's foremost historian of the Cold War. Since the publication of \\"The United States and the Origins of the Cold War\\" in 1972, he has written a half dozen more books on the subject, each time finding a new perspective on the superpower standoff that took place between 1946 and 1991.Prior to the 1970's, American historians, for the most part, put the blame of the origins of the Cold War on the Soviet system in general and on Josef Stalin in particular. Gaddis' early work was original insofar as it gave a more balanced perspective on the American/Soviet confrontation. After World War II, both superpowers acted rationally to protect their interests, having sacrificed many lives in hard-fought battles. Each side was protecting a way of life they thought morally superior.In the current work under review, Gaddis' views seem to be evolving. Looking back at the Cold War in light of events since 1991, he concludes that it was primarily the power of ideas that won, since nuclear weapons had made military confrontation unthinkable. The liberal democracies and market economies of the West were better able to provide for their citizens than the command economies of the totalitarian system. The West offered their citizens hope while the Soviets instilled theirs with fear. Gaddis now believes it was the Soviets who were primarily responsible for starting the Cold War.But why did the Cold War last so many years? Why didn't people rise up earlier? One reason, of course, was nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons prolonged the Cold War. The West had few options other than detente and containment. Gaddis has few kind words for the Nixon-Kissinger detente that left hundreds of thousands of disillusioned people behind the Iron Curtain without hope. He recounts in this book how certain key individuals facilitated change. Among these \\"saboteurs of the status quo\\" were Ronald Reagan, Margret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, and Lech Walesa. According to Gaddis, when Pope John Paul II went to Poland and kissed the ground, it marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Also, when Ronald Reagan sought to exploit the weaknesses of the Soviet Union by building an antimissle shield that he knew the Soviets couldn't match, he helped bring about the demise of the system. Also, adding to the slipstream of the demise was the unwitting assistance of Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev was different from previous Soviet leaders - and the world is forever in his debt - in that he realized the arms race could not continue and that the Soviet Union could no longer maintain control over the populations of Eastern Europe.Although Gaddis' work has been used by the Bush Administration as an endorsement of spreading democracy in the Middle East, it should be noted that the saboteurs of the status quo - and Bush sees himself as such - can only facilitate change. The real change, Gaddis argues, must come from the bottom up. Ronald Reagan did not end the Cold War - though he contributed greatly to its conclusion. The Hungarians, the Poles, and the East Germans ended the Cold War as they faced down the repressive Soviet system. This is all very illuminating with our present involvement in the Middle East.This is an excellent, well-written and well-argued one-volume history of the Cold War, written by one of its most diligent historians. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This book is a sweeping summary of what the author believes to be the principal events of the over forty year long confrontation between Communism and Capitalism called the Cold War. Gaddis is in every sense of the word an expert on the Cold War phenomenon and has used his expertise to write a concise, readable, and accurate summary of it. He correctly gives the late George F. Kennan credit for crafting the confrontation strategy of dynamic containment that in end allowed the Capitalist West to prevail over the Soviet Union and its client states. He also provides fascinating glimpses of how American Presidents from Truman to George H. W. Bush applied this strategy and how the Soviet leadership reacted to its application. Not all historians agree that Gaddis has interpreted many aspects of this period correctly, but most would acknowledge his knowledge of the period.So is this the definitive book on the Cold War? The short answer is, no it is not. It is an excellent summary and introduction to the complex political, diplomatic, and military activity that produced, perpetuated, and ended the Cold War. It is an invitation to the reader to make a serious study of the Cold War era and discover in detail what a unique period it was in the history of the world."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis, arguably the preeminent Cold War historian, provides a very readable and lucid account of the central issues, themes and events of the Cold War. Synthesizing the vast scholarship he conducted over the year into a single volume, Gaddis tries to provide an introduction to this defining conflict - especially to those who know little of it. While the book doesn't often go into the interesting details and intricacies as much as I would have liked, it does a superb job at outlining and analyzing the central issues of the Cold War. Only someone with such a tremendous understanding of the conflict as Gaddis would be able to do it properly with such a discerning eye.Even for those who have read extensively on the Cold War, this book puts the important currents of the war into a compelling framework. It not only reinforces one's own knowledge but provides an amazing focus on what is most important for proper understanding and analysis of the war."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"The Good:- Gaddis' 'Cold War' more than fulfills that basic requirement of all good books: style. The author never dwells on trifles, the book never gets dull, and you are more likely than not to be left wanting more when you finish it.- More importantly though, the analysis is simply brilliant. Gaddis seems to have made it his purpose in this text to tackle the big 'whys' of the cold war: why the major events played out the way they did, why the major actors did what they did, why it all started, and why it ended.- Another strong point is the author's encyclopedic knowledge of his sources. Gaddis is able to deploy the 'perfect quote' with unerring skill, and his evident familiarity with recently opened archives gives this book a distinct edge over older works on the same topic.The Bad:- The flip side of my second point above is that with so much analysis in a book which is so short to begin with, there is fairly little of the traditional historical narrative in this book. While that is probably a good thing for those who are already familiar with the major events of the conflict, it does detract somewhat from the ability of this book to function as an introduction to the cold war (which is the purpose Gaddis states in the preface).- Otherwise, my only actual complaint about the book (and really, it's more of a quibble) is that the commendable objectivity which the author uses to describe the opening and middle events of the cold war seems to fade somewhat as we draw near to its close. Descriptions of Reagan, for example, are positively fawning, while those of Thatcher are only somewhat less exuberant.In Summary:-This is one of the most gripping works of non-fiction of any kind, and far and away the best single book about the cold war I have yet read. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in the history of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis' book \\"The Cold War, A New History\\" accomplishes what it sets out to do very nicely- provide a general overview of the events, personalities, and issues at stake in the US-USSR confrontation. Gaddis expertly traces the evolution of relations between the two powers, their allies, and neutral nations during the period in which nuclear annihilation was an ever present fact of life.One of the final chapters, which Lewis dubbed 'Actors' deals with those personalities who, whether intentionally or not, contributed to the Soviet Union's demise. These figures obviously include Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, but Gaddis provides wonderful insights into the roles of Pope John Paul II, Lech Wa''sa, Deng Xiaoping, and others whose actions helped to topple the \\"Dark and Evil Empire\\" of the USSR.The virtue of this work, its brevity, is also its greatest weakness. Certain events are glossed over rather quickly leaving the reader not fully appreciating their effects upon the larger stage of the Cold War. Watergate, the Suez Crisis, the Bay of Pigs, and even the Cuban Missile Crisis to name a few, simply don't get the time and consideration that they require for a truly thorough history. Gaddis uses just under 270 pages of text to tell an international history of over 45 years.That said, if you are new to studying this era you will find a good overview here. Also, serious students will still be amazed at Gaddis' analysis of key points in the conflict, and his take on the Cold War as whole. I enjoyed and learned a lot from this book, I only wish it had been longer."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Given that this is a rather slim book (266 pages) to cover the Soviet/American rivalry that defined the world from 1945 to 1989, I suppose one could expect that it skims the surface rather than covers any aspect of the Cold War in depth.I just finished it, and I feel like I read the Cliffs Notes version of a larger, more complex book. Gaddis is reported to be working on a biography of George Kennan. Perhaps his energies are being put into that book. This certainly is not the definitive history of the Cold War. We're still waiting on that, and the time for it may be about right.Several other reviewers commented on the truly wierd section in Chapter II where the book veers off into alternative history and I was certainly stunned and puzzled by it, because it was so out of character with the rest of the book. But I wonder if more of that approach, if it were better labeled, would have actually helped. After all, what was remarkable about the Cold War was what did NOT happen."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"When reading a work of history, one should always read the author's preface. With luck, the author has done more than merely thank the dozens of vital souls who helped make the book possible but do not share in the royalties. The author will tell you the purpose behind the book's writing -- \\"this is the book I wanted to write.\\"John Lewis Gaddis's preface to \\"The Cold War: A New History\\" does just that. Gaddis, a professor of Cold War history at Yale, wrote this book because he now has students who were 4 years old when the Berlin Wall came down. No longer are his students intimately familiar with Cold Warriors or with its unusual jargon (MAD, SALT I, \\"the Breznev Doctrine,\\" etc.). His students had asked him point blank for an introduction to the Cold War that \\"didn't use so many words.\\"Based on this experience, Gaddis set out to write a thematic introduction to the Cold War, and a brief one at that. In this goal, he succeeded admirably. The text to \\"Cold War\\" is less than 270 pages, with dozens of pages of endnotes. The book tracks more or less in chronological order, but is organized by broad themes and ideas. As a result, \\"Cold War\\" does not delve deeply into either events or ideas -- this is pure \\"broad strokes\\" history.Gaddis' over-arching theme is that the Cold War represents a failure of dizzying proportions, but the men and women who dominated the Cold War successfully avoided a much worse fate - the breakout of a \\"hot war\\" that would have destroyed human civilization. Gaddis notes that historians have calculated that approximately 21 million people, both civilian and military, died as the result of military conflicts during the decades of the Cold War. While not denying that is a tragedy, Gaddis points out that over 80 million people died in the shorter period from 1914 to 1945, and that was largely a pre-nuclear age. Early on, Gaddis writes a chilling passage about how easily world history could have been forever altered if the Korean War had gone nuclear. Based on this yardstick, Gaddis writes, we should judge (some of) our former leaders bit more gently.If you want a Cold War version of Winston Churchill's multi-volume World War II series, look elsewhere. If you want an entertaining, comprehensive, brief overview of the Cold War -- backed with undeniable scholarship and judiciousness -- Gaddis's latest work is for you. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This is a well written book that unfortunately is not the book I hoped it would be. If, like me, you are looking for a book that retells the history and events of the cold war then you will be disappointed. If you already possess a knowledge or vivid memory of those events and are looking for an opinion on the thoughts of individuals and the ideology that led to those events then you will be delighted. For example, I would expect a book on the Cold War to spend 10+ pages on the Berlin airlift. There was one sentence that mentioned it occurred. Checkpoint Charlie and the stories associated with it - not mentioned. Gary Powers and the U2 plane - one paragraph. Etc. Etc. Again, this is a well written book and the author didn't fail to deliver so much as I failed to buy the right book. I offer this review so that others looking for the same book I was aren't disappointed."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Gaddis is a noted scholar who has written an extraordinarily concise and compelling history of the Cold War. His writing is brilliant. The prologue about Orwell and Reagan provides just the right touch, and his ability to weave it into his ultimate thesis is remarkable.Gaddis is able to answer some old questions by digging through the recently available Soviet sources. I would have liked to have seen more detail in this regard. Also missing is any discussion of the revisionists' critique of the Cold War and why Gaddis does or does not (presumably the latter) agree with the Williams/Kolko/Gardner/LaFeber school of thought. I don't think those criticisms can be breezily dismissed, and any history of the Cold War should grapple with them.It's difficult to stomach anything positive written about Reagan, though Gaddis' portrayal of Reagan as providing a useful rejection of Detente policy is quite compelling and persuasive.Nobody writes history this short anymore, and the beauty and conciseness of the writing is to be admired."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I just finished John Lewis Gaddis' The Cold War and wanted to pass on a recommendation for it. It was enlightening start to finish. Not just about the whos, whats, and wheres, but Mr. Gaddis also touches on quite a bit of political and military theory that I had not really thought about before in this context.I thought it was a great book, albeit a bit short, but that was the point. Mr. Gaddis wanted to put togethor a shorter version of a very complex story. In doing so, he was able to touch on a variety of topics and how they fit into the grander theme of geopolitical history in the latter half of the 20th century without getting bogged down in the details.I think this would be a very good book for beginners but theres something in there for everyone.

The book is a distillation of Gaddis' other works, a sort of condensed version of a lifetime of scholarship.

He writes very well and tells the events in an engaging way that kept my attention throughout. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to study the Cold War."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This is not your traditional, linear account of events, as we have come to know most other history books. This is a variety of asynchronos snapshots of key figures during the cold war, and the people and events surrouding them.This format is interesting, but not quite what I expected. There are a number of omitted events, details, background events that add color to the current story. Each chapter is a story unto itself, so do not feel compelled to read this book in long sittings - here and there will get you through. Good commuting reading.I liked this book, but I felt that Gaddis (or his editors) held back in the interest of selling more books. This is dissappointing. It is never fun seeing a great mind pander to the lowest common denominator in order to sell more books.Who wrote this book; Gaddis, or the marketing department?"},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis' \\"The Cold War: A New History\\" is an excellent, easily readable, and concise history of the cold war. Gaddis, a professor at Yale and expert on the Cold War, displays his true grasp of this period in history in this work.The Cold War began at the close of World War II as the wartime alliance between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. quickly transformed into a competition for security and influence in Europe and soon the rest of the world. Gaddis explains the early years of this struggle as the U.S. and U.S.S.R. entered the nuclear age, struggled to find the boundaries of their rivalry during the Korean War, erection of the Berlin Wall, Cuban Missile Crisis, and other incidents - all under the threat of an escalation into an unwinnable nuclear war. Then came the d&eacute;tente of the 1970s when the Cold War entered a steady state and apparent permanence, until the failure of communist societies coupled with the \\"great actors\\" of the 1980s - Reagan, Thatcher, and Pope John Paul II - brought about the unexpected end to the Cold War.Gaddis tells this story thematically, focusing on the big picture without getting bogged down into narrative details or spending much time on any once incident. Even the Vietnam War and Afghanistan only merit a couple of pages. This approach is fantastic in keeping the story well under 300 pages, but it certainly leaves the reader wanting to read more about so many of these incidents.Although the book drags somewhat in the middle Gaddis' telling of the climactic 1980s is outstanding. Focusing on the important personalities of Reagan, Thatcher, the Pope, Lech Walesa, and Gorbachev, Gaddis leans much more toward the \\"great man\\" theory of history and credits these people with ending the Cold War when most other leaders in the world had accepted the status quo of a continued Cold War - in stark contrast to Stephen Kotkin, who in \\"Armageddon Averted\\" blames the Soviet collapse almost entirely on internal problems and dismisses any impact by the Western visionaries and their pressure on the U.S.S.R. However, in addition to crediting the Western visionaries, Gaddis also credits the people of Eastern Europe who seized the opportunities they had, especially in 1989, to push the Eastern Bloc past the point of criticality.As these events fade into history, Gaddis' work does an excellent job placing the Cold War in historical context. This is especially important for those of us who were children of the Cold War, because we need to remember how much the world has changed in our lifetimes. Gaddis has written an excellent book that anyone interested in the history of the 20th century should read."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I found this book to be an extremely well organized survey of the Cold War. Professor Gaddis eloquently explains the sources of the conflict. He goes on to describe the escalation; and then points out how, somewhere in the middle, many of its actors came to view the conflict as permanent, and even desirable. He explains how it took men and women of vision to see the landscape of the future without the conflict as a permanent fixture, and then relentlessly pursue that vision.The inclusion of the Soviet perspective from recently available sources makes this book especially interesting. The Soviets were pursuing global communism, which proved to be an unworkable solution to the ills of unbridled capitalism. But, we may never have had such crystal clear historical evidence of its unworkability if the Soviets hadn't undertaken their experiment."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I read this book, here in Brazil.This book is concise and unbiased.If you want to read a book, about Cold War or World War III, this is the best option I ever read.This book is an introduction, not a long and sometimes boring essay, about Cold War(1945-1991).If you want many details, there's better options.If you, like me, want to read something concise, correct and unbiased, this is an excellent option."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"The Cold War, by John Lewis Gaddis, is a terrifically researched, footnoted and marvelously written historical account of the Cold War. In the book's preface, Professor Gaddis explains concisely what he set out to do with this project and one, if in doubt about reading this account, should simply read these three plus pages. Gaddis speaks of the need for a \\"short, comprehensive, and accessible book\\" on the period that passes the test of his late Yale colleague and historian's litmus test of \\"So what?\\". The author answers both needs with aplomb.Gaddis writes on the origins of the Cold War dating beyond the Soviet and United States' respective war aims in the Second World War and into the competing ideologies, both political and economic. He writes on the inevitability of it, the terror, the geopolitics, the blunders. Gaddis misses nothing of consequence. Interestingly, he takes events, sometimes even \\"failures\\" in policy and shows the consequences to be quite different than originally interpreted by historians who, Gaddis maintains, might have been hindered by a lens of history too close to the event(s) itself. Certainly an interesting viewpoint.A Cold War should be thought of as required reading for all students of 20th Century geopolitical history. Gaddis is perhaps a bit effacing in his comment that the book is \\"not a work of original scholarship\\" but rather a synthesizing narrative of much research already completed. While there is much truth to this, the reality is that Gaddis is the source of a mountain of research and America's leading authority of the period. One might think, quite incorrectly, that he would be the wrong one to pull it all together in a fascinating and readable account. He does a splendid job on all accounts. One could only hope that future historical authors and editors one read this and learn his technique of focusing on \\"each chapter on a significant theme\\" rather than a straight chronological report. As a result \\"they overlap in time and move across space\\". Quite simply his writing works and produces a very readable and highly interesting account of The Cold War."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"The 'dean of American cold war historians', John Gaddis, opens the second chapter of his book with a surreal scenario. Even history buffs like me disbelievingly read the first few lines with consternation, and then the fiction begins to sink in. It's 1950. In response to South Korean and American troops' buildup near the Korean demilitarized zone, the Soviets drop two atomic bombs on two South Korean cities. In response, General Douglas MacArthur takes matters in his own hands and orders the atomic bombing of two equivalent Soviet cities. Escalating the horror, the Chinese prepare to arm themselves with more atomic bombs and answer a blow with a blow...Fortunately, we know that this did not happen. The Yale historian's point is that it could have, and it's all too easy for us, ensconced as we are in 2006, to look back on those days and underestimate the colours of a very different world from today's. Gaddis's superb and succint cold war history should (finally?) convince us why capitalism is not just about inivisble hands, profit making, and competition. With his lucid prose and authentic historical passages, Gaddis makes it clear that the cold war was not a fight between communism and capitalism, but surely one between democracy and totalitarianism. One of the big questions we ask today is if capitalism and true democracy necessarily go hand in hand. Although a black and white answer to this question is probably still not possible (especially with China always threatening to be a nice exception to the rule), history makes it clear that they mostly have to. The reason is that only free expression and free actions can encourage competitions between every citizen of a country. In case of China, I get the feeling that the world should bide its time...The cold war, then, was a competition between the wielders of power whose anchor was historical infallibility, and those who learnt from their fallibility.The first part of Gaddis's book is an eloquent account of 1940s and 50s US-Soviet relations (that inevitably involved the rest of the world). Based on the latest declassified US, Soviet, and Chinese archives, Gaddis narrates the political aspirations, misunderstandings, and convictions of all the major players that defined the era. In doing so, he dispels many illusions that persisted for a long time in the minds of both historians and the lay public alike. These revelations serve as painful reminders of a time when decisions were taken based on ignorance, ignorance that has begat the world in its current state of affairs, and that will resonate in political and social undercurrents for a long time to come. For example, it is now almost a proven, known fact that Joseph Stalin had neither the conviction nor the resources to wage in any significant conflict with the US. In Europe as well as in Southeast Asia, the Tsar of the proletariat deftly played on the many misunderstandings about the Soviet Union and its policies that US officials harboured. Many times these misunderstanding bordered on paranoia about Soviet nuclear attacks. However, these also gave plenty of opportunities and excuses for the Soviets to build more nuclear weapons and advance the cause of Marxist-Leninist principles. Stalin could not have engaged in any conflict during the 1940s and 1950s, simply because his country had fought the most brutal and exhausting war in its history, leading to unbelievable losses of about 10 million lives, both civilian and military (US losses in comparison, numbered a 'mere' 300,000). Much of the Soviet industrial capacity had been destroyed, compared to the then thriving US economy. The morale of the people was still recovering from its nadir, and at such a time, even an iron-handed tyrant like the Soviet premier could not have exercised his will according to whim. At the same time, Stalin was hardly one to shirk from exploiting any opportunity for expanding the sphere of his noble communist principles. Everytime, the shrewd dictator offered the US the bait of imminent communist takeover. Everytime they took it. Of course, there was some justification for the US in doing this, given its fear of communism. What Stalin understood was that he could use satellite communist states for creating a false facade of the so-called 'domino effect'- the belief that once one state is overrun by communists, every state nearby will continue to do so, until an entire continent becomes submerged under the Kremlin's boot. This was not really true. As Gaddis propounds, Stalin found the opportunity to use the aspiring communists Mao Zedong (China), Kim Jong (North Korea), and the tenacious Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam) to further his communist interests. Even if their particular communist interests were not simply in being cronies of Stalin, still they were worshippers of the leader of the greatest communist country in the world, and Stalin knew better than not to use their influence to at least project a threat of world communist domination. However, the US kept on misunderstanding motives of these leaders that led to increasing and uncalled for American presence in Korea, Africa, and finally the debacle in Vietnam.The concept of threat leads naturally to that of non-alignment. Any able military leader knows that psychology plays a pivotal role in influencing the 'enemy's' choices and actions. Stalin understood this better than anyone else at the time, and was a master geopolitical thinker. It is not conflict but the threat of perceived conflict that sculpts international relations. Whereas the US fell for the threat of communist domination, the Soviets fell for that of acute nuclear retaliation. They also used this threat to develop more nuclear weapons of their own. Both powers were kept in check by MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction- wonderfully epitomized in Kubrick's outrageous and all too realistic Dr. Strangelove). After Stalin however, the US seems to have understood this concept only too well, and they implemented it in the form of the well known detente and containment principles which they applied to US-Soviet relations. As for non-alignment, Gaddis lucidly explains how every state from Yugoslavia (Tito) to Taiwan (Chiang Kai Sheikh) to Egypt (Gamal Abdel Nasser) to India (Nehru) exploited and even abused this preorogative to project a different kind of threat; the threat of succumbing to occupation or influence by the other side. I chuckled when I read how this principle enabled these small nations to force the great powers to do a balancing act. It was really simple. What these small states were saying was, if you don't strengthen our economy/give us military aid/quell our political unrest, we may defect to the other side, or at the least, we may get embroiled in civil war which will lead to the other side occupying us anyway. Compelling examples, as Gaddis notes, of \\"tails wagging the dogs\\"!Is is also heartening to see that in many ways, democracy does seem essential to capitalism, at least the 'American kind' of capitalism that we are accustomed to. Give people more choices, allow dissent and constant improvement in the polity, and then only can competition lead to a thriving free market with maximum incentives. It is one of the greatest ironies of history that the very people that communism aspired to free and empower were its greatest and most brutally oppressed victims. The mother seems to have found it necessary to murder her own children to apparently 'empower' them. In the list of genocidal dictators, Marshall Stalin definitely tops the list, surpassing even Adolf Hitler in purging the state of the maximum number of its own citizens and dissidents. Stalin's angel of death was the infamous sadist and rapist Lavrenti Beria, a brilliant operative nonetheless, under whose supervision, something like 10 million 'dissidents' were murdered in the Soviet Union (As much of a monster as he was, credit must be given to Beria for being the administrative architect of the Soviet bomb. See Rhodes). This single fact should convince anyone of the sheer maniacal idiocy of the kind of communism that prevailed during the time. However, it seems that communist leaders have always been in an informal competition with each other to top each other's deeds in mass murder. Where Stalin executed millions in his gulags, his somewhat unwilling protege Chairman Mao gladly implemented an 'experiment' that led to the single greatest humanitarian tragedy of the century; the starvation to death of almost 30 million citizens as a result of Mao's warped execution of collectivized agriculture. I believe that this is the most compelling case against communism; that in every instance, its practioners have had to resort to outright violence and mass murder of citizens in order to 'empower' them. What better demonstration of a failed philosophy than one that needs to actually and paradoxically contradict itself in order to secure itself. Reductio ad absurdum. The very fact that a wall had to be put up in Berlin indicates the inherent dissatisfaction with communism that abounded in people's minds. Unfortunately, the world failed to stop the gory debacle, at least not before the literal factory-like butchering of millions.There is much in Gaddis's book that is revealing, and I can touch on only a few tidbits here. The revelations stride across well-established notions about well-known events. The Cuban missile crisis for example; contrary to universal belief that the attempt was part of a direct threat to the US by the Russians, Gaddis recounts how it was first and foremost, an attempt by the Russians to provide support for Castro's government, a government in which they first did not believe in, but which they later ecstatically supported with the hope that Castro would set an example and bring communism to Latin America. It is also instructive to note again, how the US and the Soviet Union got embroiled in Castro's grievances in Angola and Ethiopia where they had no business in the first place, and whose sovereignties did not even interest them too much (and apparently don't ever since then). It was not a case of eating the cake, but simply being too terrified of letting the other person eat it. This pattern of preventive (preemptive?) conflict continued into the 70s, in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.Nuclear weapons continued to be an ugly motive and part of decision making during the cold war. Even today, we lament how, in the face of these apparent Soviet threats, the US constructed a nuclear arsenal of absurd proportions; meaninglessly more than what it would need to effect deterrence. Some credit must be given to people like George Kennan (containment) and Kissinger (detente) who saw political diplomacy as being more effective than shows of military might. In retrospect, one can only note with irony, that in spite of the US lead in nuclear weaponry and all the hullabaloo about being first in the arms race, it was the USSR which made the first H-bomb that could be delivered by air, and also developed the first ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear warhead in 1958, events which massively upped the ante. This made treaties outlawing some or the other aspect of nuclear weapons only partially successful, since because of asymmetry in weapons arsenals or delivery systems, no treaty could bring complete security to either side. And yet the efforts of scientists and politicians who strove to implement these treaties, no matter that they were born out of rightly inculcated fear of nuclear war, should be applauded.Gaddis also devotes a section to how Americans kept on reinforcing their faith in the rule of law even when their leaders sought it fit to trangress constitutional principles abroad in the name of 'national security'. After all, every president upto and including George W. has been doing it. But the history of cold war America still provides hope that ordinary people's convictions for the overarching importance of constitutional principles over law will finally prevail. Gaddis narrates how Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, all undertook to give explicit or tacit approval for all kinds of covert actions, especially by the CIA. As is known now, this involved everything from government coups to surveillance to assasination attempts. The Bay of Pigs invasion was an embarrassing attempt at toppling Castro's government. In the beginning, people actually supported presidential decisions like these. The apologetic phrase was 'plausible denial', a phrase that I am sure makes the rounds of the administration everyday now. But gradually, and especially when Johnson authorized large-scale Vietnam bombings that escalated the war, people began to take notice and protest. Gaddis notes how Nixon carried the principle to the extreme, when he began to engage in covert action against his own people. That was too much to take for the egalitarian Americans, and Watergate is now history. It is heartening to read this part of American history, where people constantly reminded even the most powerful man in the world, that he is not above the rule of law, that subversive and damaging actions even in foreign lands cannot be justified in the name of national security. Where are those people now?Interestingly, it is precisely these passages of Gaddis's book that lead me to question his apparent neutrality as a historian in some instances, when he finally comes to the Reagan administration. Gaddis praises this period as the period when common men turned the tables on authoritarian regimes. Gaddis calls these men as unusually proficient- not surprisingly- actors...Gaddis's list of leading men (and the sole woman) includes Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and a host of popular rising leaders from Eastern Europe, whose views were first suppressed, then mildly neglected, and then grudgingly approved by the Kremlin. The reasons for the Kremlin's astonishing transition is mainly, according to Gaddis, the result of a single man's conviction and efforts- Mikhail Gorbachev. Gaddis thinks Gorbachev was the single greatest deserving recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. He cites his constant struggles with the Reagan administration, he cites Reagan's cocktail party humour that served to mitigate tensions more than once, and he cites the contribution of all his other actors noted above, all of whom began as common men and women. It's of course encouraging to see that it was the common man who brought about the eventual downfall of Stalin's once brutal regime. The regime had since been gradually but surely made more tolerant by every successive Soviet leader, either because of genuine concern, or mostly because of accomdations with the West that became necessary for diplomatic and economic purposes. But it was Gorbachev who finally drove the nail into the coffin, or at least handed over the nails to his successor Boris Yeltsin. It seems that many times, he did this simply through inaction. In 1989, the Chinese were the sole officials to use brutal force to suppress the Tiananmen square protests. No such thing on a comparable scale happened during that decade in Eastern Europe, although opportunities were plenty. Everywhere, people were destroying once venerated symbols, breaking down barriers, and cutting through barbed wires. For the Soviet Union, it had become both infeasible and too costly, to keep on maintaining its sphere of influence. Reagan and Bush took full advantage of this. In witty, idealistic, even religious speeches, Reagan denounced the 'evil empire'. But what about Reagan's own evil actions in Latin America, where he was following the tradition of his predecessors to suppress left-wing uprisings and install right-wing governments, no matter how oppressive? What about the Iran contra deal? I was struck by the fact that Gaddis does not devote much space to these discussions. And then it struck me that maybe I was expecting too much from the man, when I found out that he is an active supporter of George W. Bush's war in Iraq. Since history has repeated itself, there is no reason, I suppose, for Gaddis to change his views.The most striking insight to come out of Gaddis's book was the reasons he explores for assesing capitalism's success. Granted that democracy was more successful than domination. But after all, everybody since Marx had believed that capitalism would end up causing conflicts between capitalists, and that collapse and revolution would have to take place sooner or later because of inequality between the rulers and the ruled. And we do have to admit that the twentieth century was much more of a century of totalitarian regimes. What happened then?What no communist visionary had banked on was the self-correcting, progressive nature of modern capitalism. The real difference between the two systems is that of dogma versus flexibility, what Gaddis calls 'spontaneity'. As a scientist, I appreciate this eternal skepticism and lack of deference to authority. Communist nations have justified their actions and dreams mainly on the basis of anecdotal evidence from history and historical infallibility. Capitalist nations have always learnt from their mistakes and have never tried to assume systems as being foolproof. They have made concessions to workers, the poor and the oppressed, and have strived to raise living standards for the unfortunate. When capitalism realised the macabre circumstances which impossible war reparations enforced upon Germany in the aftermath of the first world war- an experiment that finally went horribly wrong- it learnt from its mistake and implemented the Marshall Plan for the restoration of Europe. Capitalism, in this guise, is hardly the capitalism Marx, Lenin, or Stalin imagined and opposed. In fact, we get the feeling that Karl Marx would have been profoundly disappointed with the communism of Lenin and Stalin. The very fluidity of capitalism ensures its constant self-appraisal and development. And that again reinforces the connection between capitalism and democracy that has been noted. Without freedom of expression and the power to make choices, without agreeing to disagree with each other, how can there be progress? Finally, it simply does not seem that communism is compatible with human nature. How can someone ever have the incentive to progress if the state is confiscating part of their wealth everytime they earn it, in the name of bringing about 'equality'? Growth needs incentives, and those incentives lie in unlimited possibilities, not unyielding consequences. Modern day capitalism may not have great equality to begin with. But it does have equal opportunities; equality exists at least as a realistic goal. Freedom only cements this edifice.Gaddis says that even as late as 1950, writers were questioning the apt definition of democracy; is it freedom without equality, or equality without freedom? In the communist bloc, it seemed that leaders were prepared to sacrifice freedom for the proverbial equality that their philosophical fathers advocated. But in reality, not even equality remained in the end. No freedom, and still no equality. Only the shrads of textbooks and manifestos that propounded lofty principles. A grotesquely failed enterprise indeed.Gaddis says in his preface that many American students today have scant knowledge of, and interest in, the struggles that underpinned the existence of two superpowers for almost fifty years. Gaddis rightly says that instruction in this history is important, because it illustrates how flimsy even assured perspectives and predictions can be. I believe it is important for another reason. Twentieth century history has shown that democracy with all its merits, is neither infallible nor inherently strong and influential. Why else would the century have been dominated by Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and Pol Pot? The self-appraisal of capitalist states that Gaddis expounds on is probably not just a key feature, but an essential one. Democracy seems to be like a tightrope walker. You have to keep balancing, keep asking, keep doubting and progressing, simply to stay in the act. Excelling takes even more efforts. Bad democracies are as prone to totalitarian takeovers as completely devastated nations. Progress does not ensure stability. No matter what percentage of the population is educated, no matter how modern thinking is, no matter how generously wealth is distributed, war and collapse can be surprisingly close for any nation (look at Germany in the twentieth century). Democracy in principle faces the same danger of succumbing to a notion of historical infallibility that communism did. And the more democracy succeeds, the more this danger actually becomes realistic. The message of self-improvement and 'spontaneity' is the one that seems be the most enduring in Gaddis's book. In current circumstances, I believe it has become even more timely, because we longer live in a world that is divided more or less unambiguously between 'bad' communists and 'good' capitalists. The demons we fight today seem to be the ones from within. These would be the toughest to identify in the first place, which is all the more reason to keep the message in mind. History should help us to do that."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"One of the great debates in American foreign policy is how do you deal with repressive regimes. There are several schools of thought on how to proceed. The first is isolation (this has been the U.S. policy towards Iran and N. Korea). The second is confrontation (Iraq is the obvious example) and the third is communication (this would be the tactic used by Nixon in China and the policy of d&eacute;tente with the Soviet Union). Each policy has its advocates and detractors and each its plusses and minuses. Embracing China has worked out fairly well for its citizenry although there is much room for improvement. On the other hand supporting the Saudi monarchy has caused some serious headaches for the U.S. and Saudi citizens. Isolation and sanctions have a very poor track record and generally makes repressed citizenry even worse off. Confrontation can have unpredictable results that often exasperate the situation. Military confrontation can lead to considerable misery and verbal confrontation generally fails because one of the maxims of maintaining a dictatorship is demonstrating strength. The Bush administrations threats towards Iran and North Korea have fallen flat.The ethos of \`do no harm' fails when deciding how to deal with stable but brutal dictatorships or failing regimes. I was watching Hotel Rwanda with my girlfriend when she asked why the United Nations hadn't done more to protect the Tutsis from genocide. But what could the U.N. do? Slaughter the Hutus? The Tutsis had blood on their own hands. In the case of Bosnia the U.N. and U.S. bombed the hell out of the Serbians but again the Albanians were no angels and had in fact sided with the Axis during WWII. While trying to arrest Somali warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid 18 American soldiers died but so did an estimated 1,000 and 1,500 Somali militiamen with an upwards of 4,000 injured Somali. So when does a humanitarian mission become a slaughter?In the case of the Soviet Union the people were clearly suffering under a crushingly repressive dictatorship. Despite its claim to being a system of the working man, Communism was an intellectual farce and an economic disaster. It was also a system bent on spreading its message and extending its influence. So the debate in the West was between confrontation and isolation. In the end a compromise of sorts was formed ending in confrontation through proxies. The author gave several examples of countries playing the two superpowers off one another. By not explicitly siding with one or the other smaller countries could manipulate for their own benefit or \\"wag the dog\\".\`The Cold War' by John Lewis Gaddis is rather brief for a subject spanning over 40 years of history. The author spends a considerable amount of time discussing the changing nature of war after the invention of the atomic bomb. We all owe a debt of gratitude to leaders on both sides of the iron curtain for showing the wisdom and restraint to not use these horrifying weapons. \`The Cold War' chronicles the history of the Soviet Union from Stalin to Yeltzin. In the Soviet Union there was no position high enough that one could be free from danger of removal. There will always be a debate on whether containment was the best solution or whether it was Reagan's confrontation that was the final nail in the coffin. The author clearly favors the style Reagan and Thatcher and pretty much omits the sections on U.S. meddling in South America and the Middle East in the name of containment. Reagan's refusal to use the nonworking SDI as a bargaining chip seems silly in retrospect but it was on his watch that the Soviet Union collapsed and since the world wasn't irradiated I figure he must have done SOMETHING right."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This book is written for laymen, not specialists, as explicitly state in the book's preface. Hence the question to ask, does it succeed in this regard? The answer is in a very average way.

No new insights, analyses or facts are offered that can break this book out from its myriad competition. Hence the average rating.

I grew up in the eighties, so most of my memories are confined to the Reagan-Gorbachev era. I knew of the Berlin Wall, Cuban Missile Crisis, Korean War, etc., but I didn't have a clear idea of the details surrounding these important events.Unfortunately, while Gaddis' book is an easy read and provides fascinating analysis, he seems to assume that the reader is already familiar with the events of the Cold War. For example, the Cuban Missile Crisis is covered in about five pages, and while the events are alluded to, I still have no idea exactly what happened, or when it happened, how people reacted at the time, etc. The author mentions the event, and proceeds directly to the analysis.I have not finished the book yet, and will probably not pick it up again until I read a more factually in-depth work on the Cold War. This is disappointing because the author states in the introduction that he wrote this book as a self-contained work on the Cold War, intended for beginners. In that respect, I think he has failed."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Coming from someone who was only 2 months old when the Berlin Wall fell, this book serves to recreate the tension, fear, and insecurity that was rampant during the Cold War era. His presentation reads like a compelling narrative; after all, what historical era would have better characterization, plot twists, and conflict.Overall, an excellent, comprehensive, comprehensible and powerful retelling of the Cold War."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"The book has a promising pedigree. Gaddis is a leading scholar on the Cold War, known well for his effective teaching, and the author of a very good general book on the first half of the Cold War. This book, unfortunately, comes nowhere near satisfying the expectations raised by its provenance. A significant problem with the book is its organization and length. The Cold War is structured as a series of roughly chronological essays on important aspects of the Cold War. Gaddis sometimes cuts back and forth chronologically and the amount of actual narrative history is relatively modest. Putting the essential narrative and analytic overview into a book of this length (slightly over 250 pages)would be difficult, perhaps impossible, and Gaddis has not even tried. The result, consequently, is that this book can be read easily only by people who already have some familiarity with the basic history of the Cold War. This is a major defect in what is supposed to be an introductory book. A somewhat longer book incoporating more narrative, perhaps with summary devices like time-line charts, would really be necessary for an introductory book.Perhaps because of the brevity of the book, The Cold War suffers also from an overly restricted focus. What Gaddis presents is largely an account and analysis of US-Soviet relations, particularly emphaszing the Washington end. There is no doubting the importance of this feature of the Cold War. But, Gaddis leaves too schematic an impression of how events unfolded during the Cold War. A comparison with his prior general work, We Know Now, is instructive. In that volume, he emphasized not only the importance of the US-Soviet relationship but also the crucial roles and relative autonomy of many other actors. To be fair, its not that Gaddis doesn't mention this phenomena, but it gets short shrift in this account. For example, the crucial European role in initiating and nurturing the establishment of NATO, which he discusses nicely in We Know Now, receives one sentence in The Cold War. In another example of the excessive focus on Washington and Moscow, Gaddis does discuss how the nature of Cold War allegiances often allowed secondary or minor powers to manipulate their relationships with the US or the Soviet Union but his emphasis in on how these actors affected the behavior of the US and Soviet Union, rather than how their overall impact on events.The restricted focus of the book probably reflects also Gaddis' prior scholarly interests in the origins of the Cold War, the nature of US policy, and the US-Soviet relationship. Gaddis clearly drew from his prior books and while this probably made this book easier to write, it has come with some cost. The best parts of The Cold War are the sections dealing with the earlier phases of the Cold War and the second half of the book is not nearly as good.Gaddis doesn't deal at all with one of the major features of the Cold War, its often devastating effects in the Third World. Our (unavoidable) rivalry with the Soviets and the entanglement with proxy conflicts in many parts of the world often transformed localized, low level conflicts, into disastrous events. This is one of the major legacies of the Cold War and hardly dealt with in this book. Gaddis writes at some length (relative to the rest of the book) about the US support of democratic institutions as a key feature of the eventual triumph of the West. This applies with considerable justice to our policies in Europe and East Asia, but in many other regions, this was hardly true. Gaddis's discussion of these issues is shallow to non-existent.Probably the most controversial chapter will be the discussion of the end of the Cold War. I found this section somewhat superficial and overemphasizing the role of Western leaders like Reagan and Thatcher. To be fair, Gaddis does not indulge in the triumphalist rhetoric of many American conservatives who see the Soviet Union bludgeoned into submission by Reagan but his treatment of Reagan is considerably more positive than some others. Raymond Garthoff's The Great Transition, for example, is a detailed analysis of US-Soviet diplomacy in this period and contains a considerably more negative assessment of Reagan.A good overview of the Cold War would be valuable but this book is not that volume."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I picked up \\"The Cold War: a New History\\" on my way to an airport and read it over several days and several flights. As I tend to do, immediately after purchasing it I put a privacy cover over the book such that I couldn't myself see the title or the author's name or his biography or other stuff printed on the cover. I figured it was more or less a standard historical potboiler and indeed to those expectations the book was marginally passable as something to pass the time. The story of Cold War as presented is overall competent but unnuanced. I'm too young to remember nearly all of the events presented in the book and am not particularly fascinated by cold war topics, but, frankly, I found very little historical material that wasn't general knowledge in the book.The analysis presented is mundane and the writing at times is something that I'd expect from those historic but not particularly intellectual pocket books on tanks and battles. At one point, I was particularly annoyed with the writing of the book (how, exactly, does a supposed expert in the field who is trying to write a history justify the term 'Russian' in so many places where the term 'Soviet' is actually meant? How out of touch does one have to be to still be using the politically, linguistically, and historically incorrect term 'The Ukraine'?), thinking to myself wondering when the hack would stoop to quoting Clausewitz, only to find him doing so on the next page.I was therefore shocked, shocked to later find that this was a book by a pre-eminent Yale historian. It made me feel like taking my Yale degrees off the wall.To be fair, it seems that he wrote this book for first year undergraduates who need simple stories told to them, preferably without footnotes. However, to then foist this upon the general reading public as a 'history of the cold war' is disingenuous. I'm smarter than the level of discourse of this book, and I'm guessing you are too.

An interplanetary visitor reading this book would be led to believe that all humans living in capitalist societies enjoy freedom, justice, equal opportunities and unlimited possibilities of material and intellectual growth. Nothing could be further form the truth. I wonder if the author has ever had a chance to travel to, for example, Latin America (or even to areas of the U.S. less prosperous than the ones with which he may be more familiar), and experience first hand the many social and economic injustices bred by the capitalist system.

Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Silly, jingoistic, pulp history shot through with half truths, unsupported and unsupportable claims and distortions. John Lewis Gaddis is a history professor at Yale University but how he can draw so many stupid conclusions from the Cold War is beyond me. Nobody in their right mind would say that Stalin was a nice, democratic leader, nor would they be likely to say his successors were freedom loving liberals either but the standard neo-con treatment these days is to score points with heavy handed jingoism rather than presenting history as it happened. I'm sorely tempted to call it propaganda.The layout of the book is extremely poor and jumps from one thing to another without any real semblance of method. You will find yourself reading about Stalin one minute, then Kruschev the next and finally back to Stalin again. Very confusing and giving the appearance that he has something of an obsession with Stalin.His assertion that the US achieved its amazing industrial power due to a lack of Government intervention is a neo-con line which is not supported in fact. Most US Government war contracts were designed to fulfil Government specifications. His claim that Americans in 1945 lived in the freest society on the planet is unsupportable. Obviously he has never been to Australia, New Zealand or Eire. When he said nobody knows how the Berlin Blockade started, I couldn't believe my eyes! Both Hilton and Taylor explain it in their respective books on the Berlin Wall.He spends barely a page on the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and scarcely bothers to explain that the missiles were installed because of fears that the US would invade after the attempted Bay of Pigs invasion the year before. Asserting that this information has only just been released from Soviet archives does nothing for the argument. Blind Freddy could have seen that.When the Soviets or the Chinese cracked down on insurgencies in their own territories or those of a client state, Gaddis digs deep for another triumphant assertion that the US never did this but does not concede that the states they supported most certainly did, especially the dictatorships they cheerfully installed in Central and South America. Later in the book he does point out the activities undertaken by the CIA in South America but it's scarcely relevant.All the US leaders were great: all the Communist leaders were murderers. Nobody would deny the issues but a better explanation of their reasons goes begging for the duration of the book. I am most decidedly a Kennedy fan but he oversimplifies the margins between western and communist leaders to the point that it is no longer representative of reality. A decided point of view can be a strong point of a book but when there is no clear, clinical analysis (devoid of political agendas), the real issues go missing from a book where they should be paramount and people simply end up misinformed. How he could write a book like this and barely mention the UK and especially the role of MI6, is truly a wonder of the world.This is junk. How it got such rave reviews I haven't the faintest idea. Both Christopher HiltonThe Wall: The People's Storyand Frederick TaylorThe Berlin Wall: A World Divided, 1961-1989wrote better Cold War history in their books on the Berlin Wall. So did David Stafford in his book \\"Spies Beneath Berlin\\". All these authors point out the shortcomings of the Eastern Bloc system, Stalinism and the murderous repression of democratic principles.

In this concise book, Gaddis succeeds in painting a portrait of the Cold War while addressing the staples of Cold War policy like \\"containment\\" and \\"detente.\\"The book is extremely balanced and honest in mentioning the misteps the U.S made in her pursuit to rid the world of communism. Among these policies included: Supporting a coup in Chile which enabled Augusto Pinochet to ascend to power; tolerating Soviet abuses of human rights for generations; and our ill concieved forrays into Korea and Vietnam. Additionally, our attempts to limit the ambit of the Soviet influence led us into Afghanistan (which some may argue fostered the rise of Al Queda). This fair interpretation of the Cold War enables the reader to understand the consequences of previous decisions that U.S policy makers pursued.In presenting these facts Mr. Gaddis refrains from injecting his own personal opinions into the discussion, enabling the reader to draw her own conclusions in light of the evidence.Today's \\"war on terror\\" does not exist in a vaccuum.

Easy to understand and right to the point."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis's The Cold War: A New History (2005) is an example of counter post-revisionism. The subtitle to Gaddis's work is misleading; stating his work is a new history carries an implication that there are new sources that change the interpretation of the Cold War. Gaddis restates traditionalist arguments in the wake of post-revisionism. Gaddis clearly reveals his bias in the preface, \\"The world, I am quite sure, is a better place for that conflict having been fought in the way that it was and won by the side that won it.\\" Central to Gaddis's argument is the perception Stalin wanted to dominate Europe. The domination of Europe would appease Stalin's need for self-security, which Gaddis argues was more important to Stalin than Marxism-Leninism. He argues Stalin's megalomania and determination to secure his own position placed the United States on the defensive, and created \\"Machiavellians\\" of U.S. political leaders, which undermined the democratic traditions and morality leading to operations such as the Bay of Pigs and Watergate. Gaddis justifies the actions of the U.S. by juxtaposing them with the overtly aggressive nature of the Soviet Union. The Cold War is a successor to traditionalists, and a counter to revisionists and post-revisionists who are apt to view the Cold War without the lens of early U.S. foreign policy, and more inclined to support their work with new archival material in Russian and English. Gaddis regurgitates Cold War biases that have been disproved by new sources in the former Soviet Union. Tony Judt best sums up Gaddis's treatment of the Cold War: \\"Gaddis's version is perfectly adapted for contemporary America: an anxious country curiously detached from its own past as well as from the rest of the world and hungry for 'a fireside fairytale with a happy ending'\\" (Reappraisals, 381)."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I was not taught Cold War history in school because it had not happened yet and I did not learn much about it when it happened because I busy with other things. Now that I have read John Lewis Gaddis' Cold War, I am amazed at how many events were going on all over the world that had a direct bearing on me and the lives of my generation. When I was in the Army, I thought being sent to Germany was lucky brake. Little did I realize just how close I came to being part of the first wave in a war with Russia over the occupation of Germany. There was nothing between us but a mad man and a wire fence.The Cold War is about a piece of important history that is expertly examined from all sides. The author steps back to create the big picture then present's a scholarly analysis of the Cold War period. It fits well with Tony Judt's Post War: A History of Europe Since 1945, which is another great book about historical events that included the Cold War.Cold War is a 5-star book to read and remember."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Professor Gaddis wrote this book for Yale students who don't like to read long books. It is a well written, persuasive effort, but ultimately is not convincing. For readers who didn't go to Yale and can read somewhat longer books a better choice is Professor Gaddis's \\"We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History.\\"Douglas Wilson"},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis has written a comprehensive general history of the Cold War that fulfills his stated purpose of acquainting a post-Cold War generation with the history of that era. It also allows the longtime history buff a comprehensive perspective with which to assess his own conclusions to date.For my part, I have few differences to register. Let me mention three of them:1) In the early 70s, when the Christian Science Monitor was a major newspaper, I found an article detailing the quality of the arms being sent by the Russians to the North Vietnamese in contrast to those being sent to the Egyptians under Anwar Sadat. Item by item, the article authenticated that the former were consistently second rate and the latter first rate, firm grounding for the the Vietnamese's belief that the Soviet Union was concerned to assist them only enough to keep them and the Americans engaged, but not to win.When Ronald Reagan sent Stinger missiles to the Afghan rebels, I was very concerned that we might try something like that with them in order to stick it to the Soviets. My predilections run that way. Failing to find any evidence to that effect, I was consciously glib in my speculation that since no Communist regime had ever been permanently overthrown, the administration might not know how to calibrate the flow of Stingers for such an effect. Sheer glibness, I knew and I had to accept the administration's innocence.Though refusing to be ruled by my predilection, I retained it. Then after 9/11, I found out about the interview in the domestic edition of Le Nouvel Observateur for the second week of January, 1998 with Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's foreign policy adviser (see Brzezinski / Afghanistan / Le Nouvel Observateur). He said that contrary to CW, our aid to anti-Communist rebels began six months BEFORE the Soviet invasion and was given in the hope of luring them into Afghanistan as a Vietnam quagmire of their own. Professor Gaddis sees the invasion as Soviet retaliation for checks suffered in Europe, as I recall. No indication that he is even aware of the Brzezinski interview. But the reader will note that it sustains my predilection.2.He seems to think that the Cold War taught our leaders to lie in a way they had not done before. I specifically remember that sometime between 1993-1996, network news hastily reported for one night only that President Clinton had agreed to accede to a Freedom of Information Act request by authorizing the release of documents proving that President Truman okayed experiments exposing American citizens, specifically pregnant women, to nuclear radiation without their knowledge and consent. Not surprisingly the network newscast did not identify, much less interview the party making the request but it must have been Eileen Welsome who would win a Pulitzer Prize for her book on the subject, THE PLUTONIUM FILES. Professor Gaddis gives his full support to the myth of \\"honest\\" Harry Truman, Truman the Good. Not a small point when we recall that he led a progressive political party in the fight against fascists whose atrocities included fiendish medical experiments on Jews, Chinese and Koreans. This in turn suggests a deeper and broader perspective that Professor Gaddis might have brought to the work, particularly as he entered his conclusion: the Cold War's belligerents were part of the larger horror of sinister tendancies paralleled THROUGHOUT the fabric of secretive, bureaucratic technological society no doubt EVERYWHERE. In this regard, this fine historian allowed himself to be outclassed by the old X-Files series' very rare Ivy League best.3. A more respectful difference I have with Professor Gaddis stems from my adherence to the Leninist theory of capitalist imperialism as applied to U.S. foreign policy by the democratic socialist historian, William Appleman Williams and Walter LaFeber of Cornell. We've been in the eastern Pacific Ocean for about a century-and-a-half and we've always found some reason to be there, all of which boil down to markets -- the need for them acknowledged in public statements (ALL of them vintage Leninism) by a virtually unbroken succession of U.S. presidents, key senators and recognized architects of our foreign policy -- and natural resources (See the Asian section in George F. Kennan's 1948 memorandum on the internet.). No mention of them.But for the rest, a solid read. Powerful."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Although I lived through most of the events described in this book, and followed them quite closely, Gaddis still offers valuable insights that I'd never quite focused on before. For instance, his discussion of the way in which both the U.S. and the Soviet Union were themselves captives of their allies and clients.The book is lucidly written, well organised and packed with content. As an overall view of the Cold War, it would be hard to beat. And it's good to see an establishment historian of Gaddis's stature give Ronald Reagan his due."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This is the best book on the Cold War I have read. It takes you from the end of WWII using the most recent data from the Soviet archives to provide perspective on prior events. It's written in a fast-moving way that really pulls you along. As a \\"baby boomer\\" this provides a wonderful review of events that I lived through. It should also give younger people an important understanding of a critical era in our history."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"It is not possible for any historian to write a definitive history of the cold war. We are still involved in it to some degree. John Lewis Gaddis provides one of the first attempts to create an overview of the subject. In many ways it is a good straight forward introduction to the topic and it provides fresh prespective on it.Gaddis does not resolve some key questions: Did the neo- conservative policies of Reagan cause the disintegration of the soviet union or was the destruction an inevitable collapse of a moribund society. This is a vital historical and political question as it was the supposed success of the war in Afghanistan became one the prime drivers of the neo-conservative move to invade Iraq.Gaddis gives some good analysis, but history is more than critical observation, it inevitably forms a commentary on today's politics.Gaddis is a good historian, but I would have liked some more commentary on the continuing impact of the cold war."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"I was looking for a book to give me some valuable, less known information about the Cold War, a concisely presented retelling of it and an evaluation of its main themes. I have a history class starting this year in which all of these things are valued greatly and for which this is perfect wider reading."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"As a child of the 70's, the Cold War (US/Soviet/Chinese relations) was the primary geo-political issue of the era in which I grew up. I remember the nightly newscasts of Nixon's visit to China, the manuevers of the USSR in Eastern Europe along the Iron Curtain, and the always at the back of your mind threat of nuclear war. In order to revisit this time in history and to learn more of what it really was about, I located and read this book, \\"The Cold War\\" by John Lewis Gaddis. This book is an excellent and concise summary of the events from the end of World War II to the present day. While concise, the content is abundant and the presentation of the Cold War story is engaging to say the least. I'm a moderate student of history (I know enough about general events without getting too scholarly), but I learned a great deal more from this book, particularly how the evolution of the Cold War had it's antecedents in the conclusion of the first World War. Another great thing about this book is that it contains details, accounts and information from the persepective of the American enemies in the Cold War. Lastly, the book does a good job covering the final breakdown of the Soviet Union, including the contributions of Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. Overall, this is just the type of history I like to read. While I've read other history texts (the Oxford History of the US series for example), this book was just fun to read."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"Anyone interested in the Cold War should definitely get this book from their local library.

In less than 300 pages the author gives a general overview of the events that took place from the end of the WW2 until the golpe that Eltsin made fail in the ex Urss on 1991. It summarizes many facts in a few pages and makes clear who were the main actors that contributed to feed and ultimately to end the cold war.

Both myself (a history buff) and my wife (decidedly not a history buff) found it a comprehensive and yet very readiable survey of the Cold War. Its both informative and entertaining. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"John Lewis Gaddis has certainly shown his expertise on the history of the Cold War in this accessible read. This is a relatively brief book that nonetheless covers a lot of territory in providing the background behind the developments that occurred after World War II, which created the standoff between the 2 major superpowers (the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.) in that war's aftermath. The competing ideologies, the world leaders and the parts they played, and the effects of their decisions and others are all discussed in this book, an ideal book for those who are just getting acquainted with this subject.The author traces each successive U.S. president, from Truman to Bush Sr., and how they confronted their Russian counterparts. Likewise, the leaders of the U.S.S.R., from Stalin to Gorbachev, and their legacies are given a substantial amount of attention. Gaddis also looks at other nations that were impacted or became involved, such as China under Mao Zedong, and how they played roles in the course of this uncertain time. The author makes some revealing points when he examines, for example, how other nations played off this conflict between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to advance their own interests and to demonstrate their own importance in the game of chess that seemed to characterize the Cold War.Without going into all the actions taken by the nations involved, e.g. the policy of containment or the development of detente which was defined as a way of soothing tensions through talks, diplomacy, compromise, etc., I found it comforting when Gaddis stated in the end that when it was all said and done, it was the ordinary man that led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The madness behind the arms race, the influence of the MAD theory, the general mood of fear and distrust that all marked this era made it an extremely regrettable period.Gaddis seems to be a very fair-minded historian who can look at both sides of an issue. He's also good at pointing out strengths and flaws, contradictions and inconsistencies of leaders, governments and ideologies, both here and abroad. Perhaps some topics were a bit too abbreviated or not fleshed out fully enough, but considering this is a relatively brief book, that's not too surprising. I would highly recommend this very readable book as a solid introduction to understanding the nature of the Cold War."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This is the definitive assessment of the Cold War written by the dean of America's Cold War historians. On such a subject, it is far more difficult to write a brief rather than a 1000+ page chronicle. Professor Gaddis has previously written exhaustively on diverse phases and aspects of the Cold War. Here he succinctly distills what he has learned within an analytical context that well serves both Cold War experts as well as those with but a casual knowledge.What I find especially valuable is Gaddis's ability to describe and analyze the rationale behind the often failed policies of the protagonists. He highlights the ignorance, misunderstandings, and complexities on both sides. Just as Ulbricht and the East Germans held the Soviets 'captive' with their parochial needs, so too did the Koreans and others confound American policymakers. Vietnam is an example where both the Soviets and the Americans were hoisted on their own petards.De Gaulle was a 'cross of Lorraine' borne by the West, while Mao, especially after Khrushchev's anti-Stalin speech, continually shafted the less ideological Soviets.Tony Judt was highly critical of Gaddis's casual treatment of the Third World, which Judt considered critical to the Cold War struggle in the 1960s-1970s. As a career diplomat who served in various Third World countries during this period, I heartily support Gaddis's view that the Third World sorties were peripheral to the key elements of the Cold War contest. Indeed, both the Soviets and the Americans behaved badly in these Third World encounters. Top Soviets reflected that they were held 'hostage' by some peripheral situations as Angola and Ethiopia.Gaddis focuses on the basic fallacies of the communist ideology: economically, Marxist (or central planning) economics were doomed to fail, and denying people liberty and a decent standard of living was ultimately a losing hand.Over the coming years, scholars will, with further archival materials, will be able to dot some of Gaddis's historical \\"i\\"s and cross some of his \\"t\\"s. I doubt that all but the most determined revisionists will significantly alter the basic thrust of Gaddis's seminal assessment."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"As many have already stated this book is a strange combination of being too basic and assuming to much. While reading I kept wishing it was longer since there was very little substance to each segment it covered. I also think that the fact that it goes considerably forward and backward in time pointless and creates some repetition in a book that already covers too little ground. A history of the Cold War is just too complicated to have even an abbreviated version in about 250 pages. The author is brave to try but he ends up being at the same time too obscure for beginners since he won't explain the context (or even the events) in any depth while at the same time too simplistic for those more educated on the subject who will find frustrating that he never elaborates some incredibly bold assertions.I will give an example, in page 204 (hardcover edition) he mentions how Sadat expected to lose the 1973 war but gain a political victory from it. Really... wow that's really amazing... I wish it had been more than just MENTIONED! This \\"fact\\" lacks even a reference! (yep, no mention of a bibliographical reference at all). I'm sure Sadat must have been really surprised at his near victory then. Knowing the level of the average Yale professor I don't doubt that Dr Gaddis has a good (or at least some) foundation for this claim, what I find unbelievable is that he would mention things like this throughout the book without an explanation or source. That is just lazy writing.Therefore this book falls below the mark for a good history book, since it lacks any contexts, descriptions, and often even source; and is more accurately described as a commentary (in this case of the Cold War in general), however it fails to be a good commentary for being incredibly shallow and diffuse to the point that it hardly adds anything to the subject.It is a good idea to write a single volume history of the Cold War, this one however will only please a very narrow audience that doesn't need contextualization and description and yet accepts superficial (and frequently non-cited) commentary."},{"Title":"The Cold War: A New History","review":"This is one of the few books I was required to read for a class, yet still loved reading every page. However, this is not a history textbook. Although factual, it's designed to be entertaining rather than necessarily present a complete Cold War history. If you don't know much about the Cold War and are looking for a place to start, this book might be a good choice.

The title caught my attention so I checked it out, and I am so glad I did! This book is very unlike any other relationship book I have read thus far, (from the Christian perspective anyhow, some of Dr. Crabb's sentiments about gender differences are echoed by Dr. Laura, John Gray, and others). His approach to explaining differences is both humble and enticing. For women who struggle to overcome a very feminist background in which the term \\"submission\\" causes the hair on our neck to rise, his book is palpable and invites one to examine his or her motives.Dr. Crabb's explanations are such that your mind and heart remain open to receiving something profound. This book is beneficial not just for individuals struggling in relationships, but singles as well, the premise being one that reminds us that our main enemy in life is selfishness and the only freedom from a life lived in a self-centered prison is one which focuses on other-centered living: how true, and how simple. As the Word says, \\"the truth will set you free,\\" indeed, the truth as it is presented in this book, if humbly embraced, has the capacity to do just that."},{"Title":"Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference","review":"This book is a must read for everybody, whether you plan to get married or stay single all your life.

And several things I can wholeheartedly agree with:1. A lot of marital unhappiness can come from being too self-centered and not other-centered enough.2. A person's needs for security and significance are ultimately met in his or her personal relationship to God through Jesus Christ, and this is the most important part of life to nurture and build.Beyond that, though, I have a problem with a basic idea in Dr. Crabb's thinking. He asserts that a man's main need is \\"significance\\" and a woman's main need is \\"security.\\" And I think that he makes this into too much of a system. While he will say that men need security and women need significance, I think he arbitrarily names men's desires \\"significance\\" and a woman's desires \\"security\\" when they may not be. I've always been leery of stereotyping people.Now I must admit that as a woman I like security -- especially financial! And I like the \\"security\\" of being loved by my husband. But I still want to make some accomplishments in life apart from who I'm married to. I'm a writer, musician and teacher, and those make up as much of my life as my domestic side, and recognition in these areas will probably be more important to my SIGNIFICANCE desire than my SECURITY desire -- unless, of course, I receive a large cash award and that will make me feel more SECURE! (Hmmm -- maybe that will bolster Dr. Crabb's theory a bit more.)Take the good that you can out of this book -- and there's a lot of it. But I would say to both men and women: don't let anyone stereotype you because of your gender."},{"Title":"Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference","review":"This is an amazing book, using the term \\"amazing\\" without necessarily meaning anything either positive or negative.Crabb promotes a Biblical idea of the difference in gender roles. He supports his points by scriptural reference, by referring to his counseling, and to common sense.If you don't like his goal, if you have the modern view of such things, this book will make your teeth hurt. Not only will his goals set your hair on fire, he is, above all, plausible. He is not slick-plausible. He is a good writer and organizer of his material.For those who disagree, even vehemently disagree, with his views, it would be an educational experience to deal with his book using logic and reason. Ripping it to shreds and jumping up and down on the scraps while screaming obscenities--which passes for scholarship in some fields--is not what I'm talking about. Deal with this book, whatever your position, with reason, logic, and fact, and you will know more about, among other things, what you think and why you think it.I was particularly struck by his extensive investigation into how a wife's regard for her husband can build him up or ruin him. The same is mentioned in passing by other writers in the fiels, but Crabb goes into some detail.Crabb spends the bulk of his time exploring marital issues. It appears to me that, if men and women are to take gender-separate roles, the manifestations of such differences would be in the workplace, or in other groups. Crabb doesn't get into this. I expect that telling a woman to be a helpmate and to accept husband's decisions with a joyful and grateful heart is going to create some confusion when a woman is an equal colleague of a man at work, or a supervisor. Then what?As I say, worth reading if it doesn't change your mind in the slightest, or if it does."},{"Title":"Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference","review":"The book was written quite a while ago, and I don't believe it's been reprinted... so pick it up while you can.

If your mind is open to extreme possibilities, give this text a read. It is short, barely 75 pages, but give yourself time to pore over and make notes, as Freud moves very quickly.In &quot;Beyond the Pleasure Principle,&quot; Freud seeks to discover the causes and effects of our drives. To this end, he begins with the pleasure principle, which basically holds that the job of our 'mental apparatus' is to lower tension and move us towards pleasure and stability. Working against the pleasure principle are our baser instincts, which must be repressed by a vigilant brain. The pleasure principle can also be interrupted by the reality principle, which operates in moments when basic life functions are threatened - to wit, when maintaining life is more important than pleasure.Examining the pleasure principle, Freud looks at scenarios which may shed light on mental processes that seem to challenge it. These include repetition compulsion, wherein adults seem to fixate and reenact moments of trauma. Seeking a more primal cause for repetition instinct, Freud analyses children's games. Interestingly, the further Freud regresses, the more speculative and intense he gets - from childhood, Freud talks about the brain itself, moving back to simple multicellular organisms, unicellular organisms, and ultimately inorganic matter - all the time looking for an explanation of the origin of instincts themselves.Freud's queries on instinct and repetition compulsion lead him to the darkest possible places - the revelation of the death instinct. Freud posits that the repetition compulsion manifests itself in all conscious beings in the desire to return to the earliest state, total inactivity. The remainder of his treatise is spent developing the conditions of the death instinct, and trying to find a way out of this shocking thesis. Taking up Hesiodic Eros as symbolic of the life instinct, Freud attempts to argue out of the seemingly inescapable conclusion.Freud's writing style is direct and fluid, but not necessarily straightforward. If you're not paying attention, Freud can go over your head quickly. For example, on page 50 of this standard edition, his line of argument dismisses Darwin, Marx, and Nietzsche in a matter of two paragraphs to astounding effect. His language is highly figurative, drawing on philosophy, literature, biology, and anecdote to make and illustrate his points. A critical text for anyone interested in psychoanalysis and its figurehead author."},{"Title":"Beyond the pleasure principle","review":"This little book is indubitable proof of the breadth and depth of Freud's thinking. It is a fascinating and multi-faceted read, containing elements of psychoanalysis, philosophy, poetry, biology, and the literary theory. You will not believe how quickly Freud is able to move from topic to topic and the absurd range within which he is able to speculate. This is also an extraordinarily challenging read, it requires patience and many re-readings. Freud discusses the compulsion to repeat, transference neurosis, life and death drives, and a number of other cognitive and behavioral topics.Here is a curious quote I adore: \\"In the last resort, what has left its mark on the development of organisms must be the history of the earth we live in and its relation to the sun\\" (pg. 45).Beyond the Pleasure Principle is a seminal component of his expansive corpus, and should be standard reading for psychologists."},{"Title":"Beyond the pleasure principle","review":"....but a daring example of the willingness of a thinker to make fundamental changes to his theoretical framework very late in his career.

Ukrainian artist Katya Krenina's illustrations are delightful and Lisa McCourt's tale of a boy and his dog seemed particularly relevant to our family's own adoption story."},{"Title":"When the Moon is Full: A Lunar Year","review":"&quot;Full moons come,/full moons go,/softening nights/with their silver glow./They pass in silence,/all untamed,/but as they travel,/they are named.&quot; Native Americans named each full moon after a special characteristic that the month brought. For instance, January was the Wolf Moon, because they believed wolves became restless in January, May was the Flower Moon, because that is when many flowers bloom, and October was the Hunter's Moon, because the moon rises early adding to the light of the setting sun and giving hunters extra time to hunt. Penny Pollack and Mary Azarian have authored a beautiful yearful of poetry, detailing the wonders and glories of the moon. Ms Pollacks gentle, quiet, original verses are eloquent and lyrical, and include the name of the month, the unique Native American moon name, and a simple explanation of the moon name. Ms Azarian's hand-painted woodcut illustrations of gorgeous nature scenes bathed in moonlight are evocative and offer a feast for the eyes. Perfect for youngsters 4-8, When The Moon Is Full includes an informative and entertaining two page spread of questions and answers about the moon, and is a lovely bedtime book the entire family can share and enjoy together."},{"Title":"When the Moon is Full: A Lunar Year","review":"Each two page spread has a picture, the moon's name (Native American), a short poem and a short fact about the moon.

It's educational, learning about Native American lore, and is very beautifully illustrated, capturing his attention easily.

The American Indian, Native American, terminology for the 12 full moons of the year, are used as a framework for this educational children's poetry book. While the book's framework is based on the Native American terminology, the illustrations are simply of the natural beauty found in non-developed America, as would have been the case when Native Americans or early American settlers were here.A questions and answers section in the back provides some very basic facts about the moon for children, as well as a couple of questions about the blue moon... who knew? a blue moon is considered to be when the year has an extra full moon, or 4 full moons in one season, which takes place only once every 2 years and 9 months (the blue moon is not blue, though, but silvery grey, even as the other moons)."},{"Title":"When the Moon is Full: A Lunar Year","review":"This book was in great shape and I love reading it to my little boy.

However, many of his first literary efforts were of an all-together different sort. Emil Petaja wrote poetry - fantastical, dream-filled, brooding verse. Early on, he won a \\"couple of minor regional poetry contests,\\" and his work appeared in publications like Weird Tales, The Californian, and Stirring Science Stories. Petaja's two published books of poetry are \\"Brief Candle\\" (a mimeograph chapbook dating from around 1935), and \\"As Dream and Shadow\\" (an edition of 1000 hardback copies was published in 1972). This latter book - a sort of selected poems - collects work written largely in the 1930's and 1940's. (Other differently themed poetry - dating from the 1950's - remains unpublished.)Science fiction and poetry may seem a strange mix, but the history of fantastic verse goes way back. Two of its significant 20th century practitioners include Clark Ashton Smith (a longtime friend of Petaja), and H. P. Lovecraft (with whom Petaja corresponded). Both influenced Petaja's efforts as a poet. The great illustrator Hannes Bok, whose friendship inspired some of these works, admired Petaja's verse enough that he drew four illustrations for a long narrative work, \\"Dark Roads.\\" This book-length work, begun in 1931 when Petaja was 16, is excerpted in \\"As Dream and Shadow.\\" (Also included are Bok's original illustrations, along with many other black and white works by this noted artist.)Petaja is by no means a great poet. His work is, at times, somewhat old-fashioned or even \\"tame\\" - as the author himself suggests in the introduction. Who were his other influences? This Montana-born writer lists Shakespeare's sonnets, Edith Sitwell and Edna St. Vincent Millay, as well as Coleridge, Yeats, Crane and Dickinson. At a time of revolutionary upheaval in American poetry, Petaja turned to past forms and idiosyncratic individuals for inspiration.Petaja's notable poems include sonnets dedicated to Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, both of whom expressed their admiration. Lovecraft said of \\"Lost Dream,\\" \\"It has a genuine and pervasive grace, and a series of eminently powerful and appropriate images.\\" Howard, commenting on \\"The Warrior,\\" said, \\"I feel deeply honored that a poem of such fine merit should be dedicated to me. You seem to grasp the motif of my stories . . . more completely than any one I have yet encountered. This fine sonnet reveals your understanding of the abstractions I have tried to embody in these tales.\\"Included in \\"As Dream and Shadow\\" is the Lovecraft-derived \\"Cthulhu Done It,\\" as well as fine poems of personal feeling, such as \\"And Having Seen\\" and \\"Nova.\\" Also of note is the seven sonnet sequence that comprises \\"On Listening to the Music of Jean Sibelius.\\" This great Finnish composer, another artist who resisted the forces of change that swept the arts during the 20th century, is kindly served by these quiet homages."},{"Title":"The Poll-ette Hostess Cookbook","review":"I bought several of these vintage cookbooks for Christmas gifts since they include several of my grandparents recipes and long time family friends recipes."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"A collection of stories about people who are carried beyond the boundaries by their amorous passions, ending with a story of a simple, sweet infraction."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I am a freshman in college and Bloom's book was really a different type of text for me to read.

She hated it there and transferred the next year to Wesleyan, and was extremely influential in getting me to go to Paris on study abroad program. We had our dramas. Many years later, in the 90s, I was surprised to discover my name and somewhat truthful story in the allegedly fictional Sempre Fidelis. The story was based on whatever fiction her boyfriend, Oz, had cooked up to get back at her for rejecting him.When I called her after the book was published, she said the name was based on another Eren Goknar she had met in New York, a Turkish woman on a business trip. Wrong. My name is usually a masculine one and Goknar is completely invented. I let it go, she said we should get together sometime, and of course, we never did. Seeing that my name is still in this book really makes me wonder what kind of a therapist Amy ever was. She certainly found her metier in fiction writing.Eren Goknar"},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I'm very picky about fiction, and when I read that this collection of stories had been a finalist for the NBA, I was expecting something more than what I got. Bloom is good at writing a certain type of story -- it starts off with an interesting hook that grabs your attention; proceeds in a very conversational tone about characters who are usually confused (in one story VERY confused); and sort of peters out without any real climax or deepened insight. I found these stories very agreeable and sometimes provocative (the woman who sleeps with her stepson, in particular.) But all in all, even thoush some of these stories are interrelated and examine the same characters from different vantage points, the characters still lacked richness. Nevertheless, as I said at top, I'm very picky about fiction and would still recommend this book to someone who wants to read a short story collection."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"really a 9 out of 10...

One would expect great prose from a National Book Award winner, yet Bloom's stories all sound vaguely the same. Her character's lack personality, the reader is left alone in this book with nothing but the character's actions for companionship. The dialogue sounds forced and I had a hard time believing that real people actually say the things that Ms. Bloom has them saying.After reading a little bit at night, I would find myself forgetting in the morning whether the story was something I read or something I watched on cheap tabloid TV."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I threw this book in the trash, I was so very disappointed.

Nothing is taken for granted, including the way she carefully chooses each word, each turn in the story.Enter the beginning story with Ellen at her mother's funeral in \\"Love is Not a Pie.\\" Watch as Henry and Marie contemplate monogamy and negotiate the confines of their relationship in \\"Faultlines\\" and \\"Only You.\\" Follow Violet as she watches her sister fall apart in \\"Silver Water.\\"The endings of Amy Bloom's stories are surprising not because of shocking leaps in logic or tumultuous events, but because the world in each story unfolds so gently, envelopingly, and it is a jolt when each closes up again, leaving you with the imprint of a world gone as quickly as it unfolded."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I've lost count of how many times I've loaned this book to friends (plus how many times I've read it).

Not truth as in non-fiction. But truth as in, \\"This is what dark beauty resides in the human heart.\\" Truth as in, \\"This is what it means to be alive.\\" Truth as in, \\"This is how we are all broken and go on despite the damage.\\"After reading \\"Come to Me,\\" I knew I didn't want to write (or read) anything trivial or untrue again. I craved the language of the blood, the music of a heart breaking, the sigh of the dying. \\"Come to Me\\" delivers all of this and more. Bloom's use of language, her understanding of human nature, and her ability to create characters who are completely broken and still functional move these stories far beyond pedestrian into the realm of the sublime.Silver Water, a story told from a woman and her mentally handicapped sister, contains one of the best opening paragraphs I've ever read:\\"My sister's voice was like mountain water in a silver pitcher; the clear blue beauty of it cools you and lifts you up beyond your heat, beyond your body. After we went to see La Traviata, when she was fourteen and I was twelve, she elbowed me in the parking lot and said, 'Check this out' And she opened her mouth unnaturally wide and her voice came out, so crystalline and bright that all the departing operagoers stood frozen by their cars, unable to take out their keys or open their doors until she had finished, and then they cheered like hell.\\"The stories here are not easy. They're never easy. They are tales of troubled characters in troubled relationships, friendships, familyships. Difficult topics like polyamory, gender confusion, the aftermath of grief, mental illness, adultery, aging and death are all handled with such beautiful language and such true respect and care that it is impossible to look away.A Bloom writes in Faultlines, \\"A perfect kiss, like a perfect beach, or a perfect diamond, is not so common in our lives that it can be ignored.\\"This is true also of a perfect collection of stories."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"Originally posted on my blog, The Reader's Commute.Amy Bloom is a storyteller I turn to again and again; whether it's because I want a good cry or I want sentences so beautiful that they make me cry, Bloom does not disappoint. This summer I had the opportunity to read her 1993 short story collection, Come to Me.The winning story in this collection was certainly \\"Silver Water,\\" a piece that explores that relationship between a girl and her mentally-handicapped sister. As the narrator struggles to remember how her sister once was, her family tries to deal with the challenges that come along with caring for someone who is mentally ill. The opening of the story is beautiful, as the narrator reminisces about her sister's singing voice:\\"My sister's voice was like mountain water in a silver pitcher; the clear blue beauty of it cools you and lifts you up beyond your heat, beyond your body. After we went to see La Traviata, when she was fourteen and I was twelve, she elbowed me in the parking lot and said, 'Check this out' And she opened her mouth unnaturally wide and her voice came out, so crystalline and bright that all the departing operagoers stood frozen by their cars, unable to take out their keys or open their doors until she had finished, and then they cheered like hell.\\"Bloom has been trained in psychotherapy, and this adds a refreshing depth to her writing. She clearly understands the motives and desires of the characters she creates, and the way these characters interact with each other is so true to life that it's almost frightening.Bloom's stories often focus on love and complicated relationships, such as the relationship between a widow and her stepson in \\"Sleepwalking.\\" The subjects in these stories are often troubled and their problems can be emotionally-draining to the reader, which is why I think I love the fact that these are short stories and not longer works. That way, I can have a little bit of sadness that lasts ten or twenty pages, and then I can go about my day.That's the beauty of a short story collection. You get complete, fulfilling stories on a smaller scale. Short story collections are especially great for commuting because you can finish a story or two on a train and not feel like you're missing out (and not worry about \\"what will happen next?\\" when you're at work all day).For anyone who has not read Amy Bloom before, or for anyone who is looking to delve into the world of the short story, I highly recommend reading Come to Me."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"Readers looking for characters they can \\"relate to\\" or clones of people they know in their own lives should probably move along. Bloom doesn't simply create believable characters; instead, she re-imagines real, messed-up people. These are everyday folks with anything but everyday lives. (Somehow I missed the fact--even though it's emblazoned right on the back cover--that Amy Bloom used to be a social worker practicing as a psychotherapist. Which explains a lot, actually, including the prevalence of therapists in the collection.) Some readers might argue--and some have--that the men and women in this collection are too extreme in their actions and reactions. Yet, as the dying mother of the opening story, \\"Love Is Not a Pie,\\" explains her own acceptance of unconventional behavior, \\"People think it can't be that way but it can. You just have to find the right people.\\"And Bloom finds the right people. (The larger challenge, one supposes, is finding the right readers for these bleak, dark-humored stories.) Even the lesser stories here would be standouts in many other authors' collections. But four stories in particular are among the best I've read in years. The aforementioned \\"Love Is Not a Pie\\" portrays two daughters at their mother's funeral, when they discover uncomfortable truths about their parents' relationship. Death is often a catalyst in the stories: \\"Sleepwalking\\" also occurs after funeral, when a stepmother deals--poorly--with her stepson's sexual attraction for her.The other two are from a trio of stories involving various generations of the same family. \\"Hyacinths\\" portrays an accidental childhood death, a young boy's guilt, a father's religious intransigence--all leading to the boy's rescue and redemption as an adult. But the real treat arrives in the justly famous \\"Silver Water,\\" which depicts the horrible descent into insanity by a young woman and the act of mercy performed by her sister.I came to these stories cold--knowing none of the \\"shocking\\" revelations and virtually nothing about the author other than her well-known name. Reading them was an unforgettable experience, and I've deliberately concealed much about these stories so that other readers can experience the same weird mixture of disquiet in response to the stories' subject matter, admiration of Bloom's understanding of personal tragedies, and elation for her consistently impeccable style."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I find myself rereading this book from time to time, and i can say every time it has something new to say. Amy Bloom does an amazing job with a majority of the stories in this book, some i enjoy more then others (but that happens with everyone). The story Silver Water is a must read, it is truly a masterful piece of writing."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I am transfixed by Amy Blooms writing. Why because I feel the attention she gives to every word.In this particular collection of short stories it is not only her choice of protagonist which Ms. Bloomdraws so emphatically but her choice of setting that each character inhabits with all the pitfalls that must beabsorbed and acted upon. Decisions, choices, involving people who in real life would sadly smile with you and then disappear but not in Ms. Blooms stories you get the moment to moment thoughts if friends would gather round and tell you their intimate heart breaking moments. If tears and smiles are what you like experiencing you found the right book."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I could not put this book down. I usually don't care for short stories. This book had a real sweet flowing quality to it. All of Amy Bloom's stories in this book are about very human, imperfect people in relationships with each other.

These stories are quite beautiful"},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"The people in each story of Amy Bloom's &#34;Come to Me&#34; cross a line they shouldn't. Nonetheless, the author helps us understand and sometimes sympathize with her all too human cast of characters. The last story, &#34;Psychoanalysis Changed My Life,&#34; is simply delicious. The details add up to professional malpractice at the same time that they lead to successful therapy and an utterly satisfying outcome.The psychoanalyst is conniving and endearing beyond measure. I want to be Amy Bloom's client, but short of that I look forward to reading everything she writes."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"This is one of the most disappointing book of short stories I have read in a long time. The characters are shallow, boring and forgettable. The book has a section called &quot;Three Stories&quot;, describing different times in the lives of the same characters. The character development, however, was so shallow, that I didn't realize I was reading about the same people until I noticed that I was seeing the same (unusual) name, Galen, so many times. Ms. Bloom tries to add surprises to each story. Since I couldn't identify or empathize with the characters, the surprises were just an author trying to add oomph to an otherwise dull story."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I came to know Amy Bloom in my early twenties as a subscriber to Glamour Magazine. Her column was always witty. Always insightful. Imagine my delight, when I heard her interviewed on NPR. Listening to her talk about Come to Me had me severly intrigued and I purchased it that afternoon. What a fascinating look at relationship dynamics -- I read it in a few hours. Her stories offer no apologies, only unflinching honesty. You often feel like you have happened upon people you shouldn't be overhearing as they work through their grief, anomisity, anger and fear. If you can read it with the open-mindedness Ms. Bloom intended, you will have read one of the best short story collections out there."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"Amy Bloom offers an insightful perspective into peoples' lives with this collection of short stories. She gives readers realistic &amp; beautiful characters, unique plot lines, and lyrical writing. What amazed me most about this book was Ms. Bloom's willingness to expose her characters' emotions and flaws without explanation or apology. Through her wonderfully provocative writing style, Ms. Bloom allows readers to have their own reactions to her stories, and does so without judgment. Readers will appreciate the humanity in each of her characters."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I found this collection by accident and didn't know what to expect. Short stories can be so good, or so bad. These stories are very good, consistently good. These are stories of people searching for something missing in their lives, well told stories with heart, soul and humor. Amy Bloom has quite a unique voice. The stories center on romantic love and family woes, but Bloom adds a spark of originality to otherwise common subject matters. My favorite stories are \\"Sleepwalking,\\" \\"Henry and Marie,\\" \\"The Sight of You,\\" and \\"Semper Fidelis.\\" If you're as enthusiastic about memorable, literary short stories as I am, then I recommend Come to Me most highly. Enjoy this collection."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I have never read Amy Bloom's books before, but I have always been drawn to them on the shelf. Thirteen stories, some woven together, some not connected at all. But, all of them kept me reading. Many of the stories ended with a quiet sadness.My favorites were:Love is not a Pie--a woman thinks back to when her mom was alive, and when she figured out that she had a lover and a husband--who shared her.Sleepwalking--This one was like a car crash, I wanted to look away, but I had to keep reading. About a stepmothers worry that she ruined her stepsons life, in a single moment.The Sight of You--A woman thinks of, and contemplates whether she should stay with her lover or her husband.Faultlines--A man \\"befriends\\" another woman, while her husband and his wife look the other way.When the Year Grows Old--A teenaged girl comes home one day and finds her mother's look and personality completely different from when she last saw her.I liked some of the other ones as well, but these stood out to me the most. I will definitely read more of Amy Bloom in the future."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed every single story as varied as they were, the author does not judge the characters and the different psychological aspects of each personality added alot of dimension to what could have been ordinary stories of love, passion and loss instead they are fascinating stories of LIFE!

I will order her novel next &quot;Love Invents Us&quot;..."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I bought this book because it's always interesting to see what type of literary fiction psychoanalysts come up with. I wasn't too impressed with the first half of the collection. I found the characters rather dull and flat and the dialog a bit forced (\\"Love is Not a Pie\\" is the exception). For example, \\"Song of Solomon\\" is awful -- don't bother reading it. However, \\"Silver Water\\" in the Three Stories section is beautifully written, very realistic, and hits you exactly where a story of this nature should. As the collection progresses, the writing and weaving of Amy Bloom's stories get better. Skip the first section and this book is a delight."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"This is a superb collection of short stories, a genre of which I'm not usually very fond. But each story is a gem of one or more aspects of the human condition, which Bloom recounts with humor, understanding, and, most importantly, without judgement. Her voice is authentic and never disappoints."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"I love reading stories in which the characters seem like they could be just a phone call away. It wasn't one story or another that touched me, it was the small and beautiful details that Bloom weaved through each one that made this collectin a pleasure to read. Sometimes connecting with other humans is hard, but the characters Bloom has created bring out such a realness and vulnerablity that we can miss in our daily lives."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"This is a quiet little collection that is at once poignant and hilarious. It's about people like us, fragile, loving, caring, jealous, neat, messy, and most of all, human. Each story is a peek into someone else's living room window. This is a fine collection, especially for short story lovers."},{"Title":"Come to Me","review":"Amy Bloom surpasses the majority of modern and postmodern writers in her ability to walk us along the thin line between bliss and sorrow, hope and despair, often tempting us to jump or fall, but ultimately maintaining her course and bringing us to the end where the line dissolves. Her language is sensual decadence for the reader, but her control and neutrality towards beauty enable her to escape the pitfall of sentimentality._Love Invents Us_, a novel which she developed out of one of the stories found here (&quot;Light Breaks Where No Sun Shines&quot;), is certainly worth the read, particularly for fans of this book."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"After the war German Generals were de-briefed at length over a range of subjects. These included their fighting techniques use of weapons and their war with the Soviets. The aim of these sessions was to be able to improve the efficiency of the United States Army and to get some idea of the fighting strength of the Russians. This book is a collection of the interviews with German Generals. They are a series of essays on a range of topics. The major problem with them is that during the war the Germans themselves has little real idea of why they lost the war.This comes through in these essays. There is an impression of somehow having lost against the mongol hoards but little real understanding of the relative strengths of the forces and why the Soviets were able to resist the Germans and to then achieve a numerical preponderance. The essays also reflect the prejudices of the time with lots of discussion of the Asiatic mind and an approach that led to thinking being based on race.The book is thus disappointing as it is fragmented bound by its time and lacking in any real insight.

Don't bother. From the title, you'd think the book has interesting information from high-level commanders. It doesn't. It's mostly just a bunch of ramblings, often contradictory.

I think the only useful information in the whole book otherwise was the information on the number of snow-plows per mile that were needed to keep roads clear.

It is very dry, technical and at least half of its pages are spent discussing logistics and reviewing the predator-prey evolution of Russian-German tactics. It also references obscure battles, fronts and events with little to no context.Quote: \\"The two divisions on the right took Dorogobuszh on 6 and 7 June, and the elements of Force Belov around Chaschi were left to army group troops...\\"Pretty dry and obscure stuff. Who knows where Dorogobuszh is and what Force Belov is? Not me and probably not you.What makes this book worthy of 5 stars is that it is a compelling look into the deepest mechanisms of how war is fought. \\"Fighting in Hell\\" are the lightly edited and translated memoirs of senior German officers reflecting on fighting the Red Army. If that fact alone excites you (as it excited me), then get this book. If you want to know the nuts and bolts of how WWII was fought on WWII's main stage, then its a great book. Also, if you want insight into what all those officers below the strategic level (~3 star level) think about during wars, this is your answer.Here is a quick test. If you are interested in the answer to these questions, then you should read the book. If not, stay away.- What is the best way to incorporate swamps into defensive operations? How does this change depending on the season?- When is the ideal time to envelope partisan strong-holds?- How did German ground troops respond to Russia air superiority?"},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"The book itself is very good. It gives an detailed account of the military peculiarities of the Russians and the hellish conditions which the Germans were forced to endure. On a more negative note, the hype that the book recieves from its back cover is uncalled for. &quot;It is not a tale for the squeamish&quot; is not an acurate review of the book. I personally would have enjoyed a more personal account on the part of the German troops, rather than their commanders, but it was still quite an interesting story. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys World War II non-fiction or anyone who likes to hear the Russians get bashed. :o)"},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"Not for effete literati or maudlin communist sympathizers, but filled with a wealth of information, problem-solving, and advice that could some day be quite useful to members of the US Armed Forces, (or even the FRG or Finland?). Quite detailed in its descriptions of corduroy roads, field fortifications, winter-proofing, and other subjects useful to ground combat operations in the former USSR or similar primitive locations, such as North Korea or China."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"This book is a series of training tools based on German Generals being interviewed after WWII. If you want to know what the General Staff thought about the Eastern Front, go for it. If not, pass this one up."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"Many here disliked the book. I found it fascinating. Certainly it gave more about the intellectual side of the craft of arms then it did of \\"real life accounts\\". But staffies are people too, even German ones. And in any case that was what I was interested in. Those that do not take an interest in such things need not do so.Many complaints have been made about the bias. Well in the first place bias was admitted in the introduction; the army felt it best to publish it straight out. In the second place, if one eliminates bias from the study of military theory one has to eliminate Xenophon, Sun Tzu and Caesar's Commentaries. In fact I sometimes found the bias amusing in a rather macabre way(\\"The godless Bolsheviks had no respect for life, not like us civilized Aryans\\").I found the technical detail about tactics and the environment most interesting. And while it is highly likely to say the least that the writers had racist opinions about the Russians, the fact is that their description of the Russians makes them sound more \\"macho\\" then the Germans-they are pictured as hardy frontier folk and Germans as city slickers. That may not have been the intention but that is how it comes across.One does not have to love Nazis, or love the Wehrmacht, or even love Germany to read this book. The fact that your enemy has something to teach you about the craft of war does not mean that you agree with the rest of his worldview. That would be like hating Volkswagens because Hitler approved of them."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"The book title and the trailer on the back cover (&quot;this is not a tale for the squeamish&quot;) is not appropriate at all. Fighting in Hell is just a collection of Germans generals' recollections written in a way a military tactician would relate to, but not for the average reader, who may have thought &quot;Fighting in Hell&quot; would relate personal, vivid accounts of the German foot soldier. And there was nothing that was &quot;not for the squeamish&quot; in the book at all. This was not a &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; on the Eastern Front by any stretch."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"This book incorporates the writings of German commanders written only a couple of years after World War II ended. It was refreshing to read something of substance presented by German commanders who were decision makers serving on the Eastern Front, as opposed to college educated writers cobbling together and interpreting with modern-day prejudices excerpts from autobiographies. These Generals provide you with non-sanitized opinions of their Russian foe and the performance of German troops against tremendous odds, citing the strengths and shortcomings of each. Unlike Russian accounts, these studies were written by military professionals, without the use of juvenile braggadocio. These U.S. Army pamphlets contribute splendidly to the understanding of military science as it was practiced on the Eastern Front."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"A very dull and dry book. Not engaging in the descriptions of the actions or events. A book with maps and simple listing of the dates and actions would have been far more entertaining and informational.Had a really hard time trying to read this book. Infantry and Panzer Aces by Kurowski, both provide better detail and information on the fighting on the Eastern Front. An even better book on the upper command situation in WW2 is Panzer Battles, by von Mellenthin.Recommendation, borrow it from the library instead if you really want to read it. You are not missing anything."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"Fighting In Hell at some pionts was like \\"Reading In ****\\" The book is on Personal passages of four German Commanders in the Eastern Front.

One of the great mysteries in history is how the Germans were unable to defeat the Soviet Union when in 1941 they had captured, wounded or killed approximately 3 M troops. You would be correct to assume that these Russian troops were their best ones and and they were lost to the \\"Motherland\\". So how did Stalin and the Soviet Union hang on to defeat the Axis by 1945 ?After Operation Typhoon was stalled in front of Moscow in Dec of 1941 the German army regrouped and won even more victories in 1942 up until their debacle at Stalingrad. The German victories in 1942 were almost as devastating as those attained in 1941 such asthe 2nd battle of Kharvov, the destruction of 2nd Shock Army near Leningrad, Eric Manstein's capture of Sevastapol and the capture of 200,000 troops in the Kerch Penensula. These were devastating blows that would have cause any \\"normal\\" nation to collapse.But the Soviet Union was not a typical nation. It could sustain blows no other nation could sustain and still fight. Stalin had started industrialization in 1927 and their dominant focus was the building of tanks, artillery and other weapons. They had the best tanks T34, KV-1 and the KV-2, large calibre cannons and a huge fleets of fighter aircraft. Stalin though miscalculated. He placed most of his airforce close to his western borders and these were lost while on the ground to the Germans in the first week of Operation Barbarossa. After the Soviets lost 90 % of their air force the Germans were able to use their Stukas to annilate superior Soviet Tanks as they approached the Germans. Even though the Soviets had 30,000 tanks to the Germans 3000 tanks the Soviets did not mass their tanks properly nor did they have protection against the Stukas and other German bombers. The Soviets were only taught to attack and methods for defense were not deemed important as the Soviets were not initially flexible.But the Soviets had a resource the Germans did not have. It was a nation led by fanatical russian commisars mostly from the Soviet cities who would shoot any non-compliant soldier without reservation. It was a nation led by fear with a threat to a bullit to the head to anyone who disobeyed orders to do what they thought was required. The commisars were the nerve centers and means to motivate the Soviets to make human wave attacks which were dependent upon the Germans running out of ammunition. Hence the Soviets would grab any man from 16 - 70 in age to take bullits in front of their main troops who came after. They were totally ruthless. Also the Soviets had NKVD \\"blocking troops\\" who would fire on the Soviet soldiers who turned back from horrendous German machine gun fire with their M34 and M42 machine guns. The Soviets would sometimes charge the Germans while under the influence of huge amounts of Vodka. Yes, the Soviets eventually broke the German East armies but at a horrendous cost. Stalin owns the credit for this victory which destroyed flower of this Soviet generation. It was a Pyric victory for the them which some experts say lead to the collapse of this \\"evil\\" empire in 1991.This is what \\"Fighting in Hell\\" describes. The way the Soviet Union fought under Stalin who had no care one whether his troops died or lived. Because of the massive surrenders in the summer of 1941 Order No. 270 was issued by Stalin who decided that if any Soviet surrendered then they were a traitor and if they came back to the Soviet Union they would be sent to the Gulags to join their families. So the Soviets surrendered in hundreds and thousands and many of these joined the Germans to fight against their fellow countrymen. Even a Lt. General Vsalov, Hero of the defense of Kiev and Moscow went to the German side. Vsalov betrayed his Soviet homeland after being betrayed by Stalin in the defeat of the 2nd Shock Army in the summer of 1942 near Leningrad. I cannot ever recall a similar case of a large mass of soldiers and officers turning on their homeland in any other war. Their hate for Stalin overrode their fear of him because they knew because of Order 270 they would go to the Gulags if captured by the Soviets. The captured Soviets choice was either starvation or collaboration for the Germans. When these unfortunates were recaptured by the Soviets in 1944 and 1945 they were either killed outright or sent to the Gulags. Stalin had no mercy. Fascinating and horrifying reading at the same time.The Germans were well-trained and for the most part well-led by their officers. They kept their heads thru most of the war and inflicted unimaginable casualities. However Stalin was able to overcome superior German tactics and command of the air by using more and more soldiers. Eventually he would mobilize 18 M soldiers to overwhelm the Reich. The Germans felt even in 1944 if they could just keep killing the enough Soviets they would eventually run out of soldiers. Not quite. But after losing 27 - 30 M people because of the ruthless ineptitude of Stalin it is possible to argue that in the long run the Germans won and prevented Western Europe from becoming Sovietized. Today Germany is a strong nation and the Soviet Union which collapsed in 1991 has the weaker economy. You could argue that Stalin in his zeal to spread the Soviet way of life and bring happiness to all people miscalculated. This book and former Soviet GRU agent Victor Suvorov 's book \\"The Chief Culprit\\" go hand-in-hand in explaining how Stalin destroyed his country in profligate attacks of his citizens in human wave attacks against German well entrenched positions. Fascinating reading and yet unimaginable reading for the committed Soviet German conflict reader."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"I continue in my quest to find a good book from German side that is fair about a such topic like East Front. When I say fair I mean not touched by Cold War's blinders :)Well... again a failure. I understand that the book was written using defeated German (or still Nazi :) ) Generals during the 50s, but.... NOWADAYS I'd like to read a book without the cliche about the Russian Winter, Asian menthality (this is a bit racistic IMHO) and so on.However, if you like books with a strong German bias, and continue to believe to German General's tales you can buy it. But remember here you don't find real insight"},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"The book itself is an anthology of racialistic Nazi apologia as recorded by and for the benefit of the US military.Except for being a testimony to the unshakable prejudices of defeated Nazis (like the description of peculiarities of Russian war mentality, Asiatic stuff and other bizarre, outrageously obscene Nazi falsehoods), the material contains no relevant historic data; neither it provides any answers to anything nor asks any meaningful questions.No one questions how did the \\"valiant\\" German army and the Nazis' faithful, enthusiastic and willing allies like the Finns manage to lose the war so completely - despite all their recorded bestiality, savagery, looting and mass murder of (Soviet and other) civilian population - the only things they apparently excelled in (and which they conveniently prefer not to mention) -- aside from the regular, boring fare of cold temperature and other esoteric \\"explanations\\" (a fallacy - since Russians \\"suffered\\" from the cold weather as much as the Nazis and their allies) and other racist irrelevancies - or how and why did they find themselves in Russia in the first place."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"As noted in other reviews, this book, contrary to the back cover hype, is NOT a dramatic &quot;you are there&quot; narrative of East Front horrors. It IS a selection from the so-called German Reports Series. This collection was produced for the education of US Army officers in the late 1940s and early 1950s and drew on the selective memories of German officers. The authors were debriefed by US military historians while the former were still POWs. The idea was for the Army to tap into the Wehrmacht's experiences in fighting the Russians -- a big American concern at that time. As such, the pieces are tailored to a &quot;lessons learned&quot; presentation. Some German bias shines through the staff college lecture style of the writing. The authors did not really have much insight into the quality of the Russian soldier or leadership.They did appreciate the tactics used against them and the countermeasures that they had to improvise in daunting circumstances. But amidst all this fragmentary military ephemera, there is no real insight as to how and why they were defeated along the Don and the Dnepr River basins.Many of these selections are available from the US Government Printing office as reprints of the original US Army Pamphlets (then classified &quot;restricted&quot;) from 45+ years ago. The value of this book is that it makes the material available to a wider reading public under a cheap single cover. However, the value would be enhanced by annotations or commentary pointing out the biases of the German authors and bringing in information available since then from the gradually opening ex-Soviet war archives."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"This book is split into 4 segments of German officers talking about: (1) colder than expected winters (2) Numerically superior Russian forces thrown against the Germans (3) Russian haphazard ability to use terrain to its advantage. Each &quot;General&quot; says the same thing - giving a repetitive feeling to the book. (It was difficult to stay attentive after section 2).NO personal account of action by anyone (save one or two anecdotes in entire book).NO general explanation of the locations of battle (how about 1 or 2 geographical maps).NO feeling of what the German or Russian soldier went through on the Eastern Front.Believe previous reviewers: this is NOT what you would expect by the title. Better title: Review of German Difficulties Fighting in Russia: A General's Perspective (Yeah, a boring title for a repetitive book).I rated 1.5 stars because I was disappointed with the lost opportunity for a great review of what the German (or Russian) soldier went through on the eastern front."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"This book just has to be the best literary buy I've ever made. The price tag on Fighting In Hell could be several times higher and I'd still buy it. It is not a concise dictionary on fighting on the Eastern Front, but rather contains reports on different topics written by german generals after the war. The way these are written convey the cold reality of war, as well as the pride of the author's in the quality of german armed forces. Included are excellent descriptions of the differences of german and russian soldiers and combat methods. The first hand descriptions of Soviet combat tactics and battles fought couldn't come from better sources than from the people that fought the russians. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"An interesting premise for a WWII history book - this is a compilation of the writings of various German soldiers in Allied captivity who wrote about thier experiences on the Russian front - unfortunately most, if not all, of the personal experiences and anecdotes have been left out. It reads like a fairly dry battle manual, describing Russian tacticts, the 'personality' and leadership style of the Russians, etc. very little in the way of interesting anecdotes. This is a valuable piece of researh - useful for a historian doing specific research on tacticts on the Russian front, but is little more than a dry overview. If you are looking for an interesting narative, this is NOT it. If you are looking for battle tacticts and examinations of the russian way of combat - possibly as research material for a book or research paper, this may be for you, otherwise, you may want to avoid this."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"This isn't an Allied version of history but rather a military analysis of a theater of conflict at a more practical level, as told by select Generals in the German Army. It is built upon personal experiences and perceptions of actual participants, not the scripts of Hollywood movie moguls. If you pick up this book without having an interest in learning, then this book is not for you. Keep in mind that this was edited and compiled by the U.S. Army for instructional purposes. In spite of that, it is an interesting and quick read at a very reasonable price."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"This book is window-dressed to look like a new piece of literature on the Eastern Front. It is not, it is a series of post-war reviews by German Officers, no doubt to provide data to the US Army for what it considered an upcoming or inevitable war with the USSR. It is technically useful however it is boring. So if you're writing a thesis on this topic then perhaps it's a good buy -if you just have an interest (or obsession) in WWII topics then spend your money a bit more fruitfully - The Forgotten Soldier, I Flew for the Fuehrer, Stuka Commander, Panzergrenadier etc. etc. are good passionate books written from the German side.To summarise, this is a textbook."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"I have to admit that I liked this book contrary to what other reviewers thought of it. It is only for the reader who is very knowlegeable about combat on the Eastern Front.The book was written after the war by German Generals for the American army just in case the U.S. went to war with the Soviet Union.The book is not exciteing reading, and it took a while to read, but it helps to understand, and put together the various problems the German army faced. If you read any of the personal accounts written about the war, this will ad to those accounts with a larger picture. The book will explain what the Generals had to deal with, and rarely looks at a situation from less than division level.Many people criticize the book for not talking about the average soldier, but the Generals have to deal with the avaerage soldiers inability to perform under situations that they were not able, or prepared to deal with. This book does well to decribe those problems. One good example is a chapter about the tank tracks. They had to use the wide battle tracks to move in the mud, but upon comming to a bridge at night during an attack, the entire armored group had to remove their battle tracks once they got to the bridge, then replace them with the regular tracks,cross the bridge, then put the battle tracks on again. All of this at night without light that would give away their position. The attack went off 8 hours late.Frustration for the common soldier, frustration for the Generals."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"From the title, I expected more personal-type war stories, but it was fascinating all the same, if you read between the lines. What I really enjoyed were the chapters on the Finnish-Russian conflict (what the Finns call the Continuation War). This is valuable because there isn't a whole lot of this material available in English.The Germans were allied with the Finns in this effort and it was interesting to note the affection and respect that the German General Erfurth has for the Finns. I especially enjoyed the details on how the Finns operated in the harsh Arctic north."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"This book was certainly interesting (admittedly a matter of personal taste) and would probably be recommended for the military specialist, rather than the general reader or even WWII buff. The book is essentially a description of German tactics and the tactical situation in the east. It's not really a general history of the eastern war nor an organized, thematic presentation. It is a compilation of essays by Colonel General Erhard Raus (1889-1956), Infantry General Waldemar Erfurth (1879-1971) and Infantry General Hans von Greiffenberg (1893-1951). The essays cover topics of specific military interest on the eastern front, eg. climate, partisan tactics, mud, terrain, reconaissance etc. The book would only be of interest to those with a knowledge, or an interest in the most specific details of combat."},{"Title":"Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front","review":"The book takes the form of a staff study, conducted by two German Army officers who had commands on this front, and prepared as a primer for those who would face the Russians again (presumably in the Cold War). This makes for some dry reading at points, if one expects a historical narrative, as in William Craig's 'Enemy at the Gates' or any of the David M. Glantz volumes. If, however, your interest is in an appraisal of the German Army and their experience as a whole on the Eastern Front, this book will keep you hooked. No epic stories of battles, no abundance of personal antedotes, but rather the nitty-gritty of company and regimental encounters, analyzed for their tactical importance. Less attention is given to overall background detail (such as strategic and sometimes unit) in these episodes, but in no other work have I seen this kind of overall assessment of the Red Army vs. the German, in all seasons, in all climates. From the Red Army tactic in forest combat of setting fires to the methods of aircraft maintainace in different climates, this book has it. The book does tend at times to downplay the Russian combat methods through professional military bias, but overall it is not serious. Lastly, it is likely it would succeed in its aim as a primer for combat in Russia, and should merit some serious attention on that score."},{"Title":"Maybe a second spring: The story of the Missionary Sisters of St. Columban in China","review":"Irish Missionary Sisters arrive in China and encounter a country plagued by bandits, civil war and Red Revolutionaries.

There's no science in it and little else of interest."},{"Title":"Muktuk Wolfsbreath, hard-boiled shaman (Vertigo)","review":"This is the collected three-issue mini series of Muktuk Wolfsbreath: Hard-boiled Shaman from DC/Vertigo. Muktuk is a Siberian shaman that walks the worlds to protect his people. Indeed, he comes across as a combination of a classic shaman and film noir detective in his efforts to uncover the supernatural causes of people's problems. He does this with the help of Weasel- his spirit guide/wisecracking sidekick.The writer really did his research on the nature of classical shamanism in this remarkable series. Everything from spirit guides, riding the drum, power songs, dreams, the World Tree, enemy ghosts, the Great mother, crossing over into the Land of the Dead to rescue a spirit, etc.- there is a wealth of authentic detail woven into the story line. The art work also shares this same strong sense of authenticity.And of course you get the sense that however useful and helpful a shaman might be- they are always outsiders and they make people nervous while they are around. At the end of the day, the people are always relieved to see them ride into the sunset on their reindeer sleigh. This even applies to other shamans...."},{"Title":"Muktuk Wolfsbreath, hard-boiled shaman (Vertigo)","review":"This collects Laban's original Muktuk comics from Cud and his recent web comic storyline, but not the Muktuk stories from the Vertigo series. They maintain his eclectic mix of nomadic cultures, shamanic tales, and hard boiled detective noir into an absurd but gripping narrative which has a comfortable rhythm and voice, a mix of humor and compelling story that drew me in. I was glad to see Laban revive this character from his scattered appearances and get him back on his feet with a real story that goes beyond being just a gag and becomes something truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Muktuk Wolfsbreath, hard-boiled shaman (Vertigo)","review":"\\"Muktuk Wolfsbreath: Hard Boiled Shaman\\" was a happy surprise discovered online. When the \\"The Spirit of Boo\\" ended last year I waited eagerly for the hard copy book to be released. My patience was reward when I learned that Terry LaBan's earlier shaman stories were also included! SNAP!!! went my purchase!The story is intriguing: Muktuk Wolfsbreath, a Siberian shaman, is called in to help a stricken boy. But it's a twisted case of deceit and evil with more than lives are at risk! You don't have to be a cultural anthropologist to understand what's going on. Exotic elements are handled so they're made self-evident or put in modern context, like Muktuk's magical GPS. There's a beautiful damsel in distress, ghost, zombie, evil sorcerer, and smart-aleck animals, so pick your passion! A word of caution: this book isn't for kids. There are acts of procreation and some of the nastier aspects of death.The main story's artwork is just right for the story and its pacing. Too complicated would slow the reader down, too simple wouldn't do justice to the richness of the story. Two different colors are used besides the black and white to make very effective shading and to emphasize the transition between worlds in one case. In the earlier stories the artwork is not color shaded and reminds me of the work of Robert Crumb."},{"Title":"Muktuk Wolfsbreath, hard-boiled shaman (Vertigo)","review":"I wish I could remember the sequence of events and internet links that led me to Terry LaBan's webcomic, \\"Muktuk Wolfsbreath: Hard-boiled Shaman,\\" because I'd love to send thank-you notes. Muktuk turned out to be my favorite webcomic of 2011, as it deftly blended disparate genres into a cohesive, engaging and suspenseful story that rewards re-reading.While there's a complex, layered mystery at the heart of the story, what really lured me to the webcomic is my weakness for anything of a \\"shamanic\\" flavor. Still, I was surprised and delighted by the amount of research LaBan invested in this story. Small, seemingly throw-away details add a richness to Muktuk's actions as the story unfolds, even as the protagonist ventures beyond the physical world to confront long-time adversaries and to seek the help of great and powerful spirits in his efforts to heal a dying child, make peace with his own past and secure the resources he needs to survive the winter. And that's what makes the story so compelling: The reader empathizes with Muktuk's vulnerability and humanity because LaBan juggles the physical, metaphysical and ethical facets of Muktuk's character without dropping a single detail.So don't be fooled by LaBan's \\"cartoony\\" style. There are adult themes that thread through the tale (after all, it wouldn't be a hard-boiled detective story without a femme fatale [or two]), and LaBan addresses those elements in his work, though it isn't of the in-your-face or too-graphic variety. With some minimalist line work and judicious spot color, LaBan capably conjures the sometimes bleak Siberian tiaga and its many inhabitants (both human and nonhuman), and he includes just enough details to make the time and place--including its otherworldly elements and the driving interpersonal conflicts--thoroughly believable.So much so that I tried to track down Muktuk's earlier adventures (which, beyond the DC Comics/Vertigo limited series, are almost impossible to locate). For other completists out there, take heart: LaBan collected the first three, long-out-of-print adventures and added them to this collection. The original stories share many of the themes and plot elements explored in the 2011 version, but their inclusion here allows the reader an opportunity to see how a creator refines his vision AND his craft over time. They are well worth the read.And, on an even geekier note, can I tell you how much I love the cover of this collection and admire LaBan's abilities? From the seductress in the smoke to Muktuk's earnest and determined expression, LaBan's composition and style perfectly evokes the tone to carry the reader into and through \\"The Spirit of Boo.\\" Bravo!If you're into solid, hard-boiled mysteries with occult elements and a dash of anthropological scholarship, you'll love this book. If you're interested in seeing how a webcomic translates to the print medium, you'll be intrigued by this book. And if you're a fan of smart comics, this book clearly signals that LaBan has raised the bar.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Liberating Paul: The Justice of God and the Politics of the Apostle (Bible & Liberation)","review":"This book makes many good points about how Paul has been misinterpreted in the past partly because interpreters (often starting with Luther) applied a specific theological agenda to their reading of him. However, the book itself tends to make Paul serve the author's own political agenda, which means the reader must wade through some political propaganda and strained interpretations. \\"Liberating Paul\\" here means \\"re-interpreting Paul as the patron saint of liberation theology.\\" The interpretive focus is evident in these quotes from the beginning and end of the book:\\"For centuries the apostle's legacy has been systematically manipulated by human structures of domination and oppression, from the conservative interpreters of Paul who found their way into the New Testament itself, down to the legitimation of the 'New World Order' or the sonorous waves of antifeminist backlash in our own time.\\" (p.x)Elliott offers Haiti as an example of \\"the continuing deadliness of my nation's global war against the poor ... U.S. policy toward Haiti seems crystal clear: to deter the threat of real democracy at any cost, and thus to guarantee ever higher profits for U.S. businessmen. ... Aware of the war waged, in our name and for our sake, against the poor, we must yield to his [Paul's] appeal for solidarity with the oppressed.\\" (pp.228-230)Some of the more convincing arguments include the following:- 1 Cor 7:21 has been misinterpreted to suggest Paul advised slaves to remain slaves even if they had a chance for freedom. This has bolstered the \\"Paul is a social conservative\\" viewpoint.- Terminology and themes in pseudo-Pauline epistles have adversely affected interpretation of genuine Pauline epistles. Even if there was a \\"Pauline school\\" that doesn't mean every voice in it was in agreement. (While this makes sense, the argument would have been stronger if more attention had been paid to explaining the context and arguments of the pseudo-Paulines themselves; the text is thin here. )- Too much emphasis has been laid on passages in Paul for which there is strong evidence that they are interpolations (such as Paul's prohibition against female leadership in church in 1 Cor 14:34-35).- Interpretation of Romans has been skewed by seeing it as a compendium of theological thought. It is really, like all of Paul's writing, parenesis (exhortation) with a theological prologue. \\"Paul's gospel\\" is about action, not thought or belief.- Paul's epistles are addressed to Gentile communities and what he says in them about the Jewish Law is expressly about how Gentiles should relate to it, not necessarily about how Jews should relate to it.- Many of the standard explanations for why Paul persecuted Christians before his conversion do not make sense. Elliott offers a political interpretation that does make sense, even if it is speculation.Some of the cases where it seems that Elliott tends to see what he wants to see:- Elliott tries to debunk any interpretations that would validate use of force at the national level. He criticizes the \\"Christian realism\\" of Niebuhr who asserted that \\"'the conscious choices of evil for the sake of good' was the essence of \`the Pauline doctrine.'\\" It is easy to criticize this \\"end justifies the means\\" attitude but making Paul disagree with it in principle requires focusing on some passages and ignoring others.- Elliott asserts that Paul's real opponents were among Gentiles and were not pious Jews. This too requires selective emphasis on choice biblical texts. The fact that he was writing to Gentiles does not mean that his opponents had to be exclusively among the Gentiles. For an extended discussion about Paul's opponents seeGalatians: A Commentary (Orthodox Biblical Studies).- It is quite a stretch to interpret \\"freedperson of the lord\\" in 1 Cor 7:22 to mean a slave who was manumitted by his church.- Elliott's assertion that Paul's collection for \\"the poor\\" shows he had similar goals to liberation theologians is one among several instances where Paul's phrase \\"the poor\\" appears to be assumed to mean the same thing as Elliot's phrase \\"the poor\\". This is questionable at best.- Elliott assumes as virtually self-evident that Jesus was crucified by Rome \\"as the consequence of his [Jesus'] own struggle against social and political injustice,\\" and the gospels deliberately misrepresented the story by blaming it on the Jews. Rome did crucify for political reasons, but we certainly don't know what they were specifically in this case.- To support his view of a politically-oriented Paul, Elliott must put extreme emphasis on a single passage (1 Cor 2:8 blaming the crucifixion on the \\"powers of this age\\"), just as he argued that \\"social conservatism\\" interpretations all hark back to a single misinterpreted passage (1 Cor 7:21).Any specialist in Pauline studies should look at this book, but the general reader is likely to find it a difficult and at times not very interesting read."},{"Title":"Liberating Paul: The Justice of God and the Politics of the Apostle (Bible & Liberation)","review":"Dr. Elliott makes a wonderful argument for a new reading of Paul. He looks past the screen of history (especially Luther's views on Paul) and allows the context of the 1st century Mediterean world shape the possible intentions of the Apostle. While this book presents solid arguments of history and language criticism, Elliot's conclusions are liberal and might upset people with closed minds."},{"Title":"Liberating Paul: The Justice of God and the Politics of the Apostle (Bible & Liberation)","review":"This is a well researched and written book on a subject that has received too little attention over the centuries. Congratulations to the author, Neil Elliott, for his scholarship, courage and insight into what the real messages of St. Paul are and more so into the machinations of those who would tamper with his writings for the sake of empire. The lessons should be well learned because the same machinations of empire has not forsaken the earth's societies and particularly the ecclesiastical organizations that should be protecting these writings and particularly so against redactions of any kind. This author is to be commended because of his treatment of the writings of St. Paul and also the manipulations of empire in all its forms. The timeliness of this book is unquestioned. How is it that little in the way of liberation has been done since the time of St. Paul, if not for the continuation of empire? One aspect of the book that did not receive sufficient coverage is that of application of the lessons of 'liberation' to present forms of empire. The reason is that readers of the Bible still need to be liberated from the disinformation and redactions that would obfuscate and manipulate the unwitting populace and congregations in the pews. Nevertheless, for this purpose alone the author has done us all a big favor. Well done!"},{"Title":"The naked society","review":"I am suprised that no one had commented on this book.I know it's a little out dated but the words still ring true even for today.Let's get started:The forces allied against the individual have never been greater.Totalitarianism typically begins when a would be tyrant-whether a Hitler or a Castro play's upon the anxieties of the majority to institute repressive measures against despised or troublesome minorities.The same society that breeds criminals by the millions demands that it's police catch the criminals,even if they must trample on constitutional rights and existing laws to do so.Please, read this book if you want to know what was going on in this country back in the 50's and 60's.It is packed full of information.Here is a little information from the contents.Are we conditioning students to police state tactics,The right to a private unfettered life,The right to be free of bureaucratic harassment,The right to be free of mind manipulation."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"Book received and in great shape.

It was particularly interesting to learn about his relationships with other artists."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"Ansel Adams poured his soul into writing this book and after reading it I better appreciate his beautiful and awe inspiring photography. Adams was a masterful photographer and a lifelong conservationist. Born in 1902, he grew up in San Francisco as an only child. By age 12 he loved playing piano and developed an interest in photography while also enjoying exploring the outdoors and taking long walks. He left formal schooling after grade eight. Although he spent a large part of his career in commercial photography, he is popular for his landscape photography.In the 1920s Adams was spending a lot of time in the Sierra Nevada, hiking, exploring, and taking photographs, where he befriended leaders of the Sierra Club and became involved with the conservation movement. During his time at Yosemite, he met his future wife Virginia and they were married in 1928 and had two children. In the early years of marriage he juggled two professions, music and photography and talks at length about his decision to pursue his photography career.Besides his chapters describing Yosemite, The Sierra, and other National Parks, I especially enjoyed the chapters he dedicated to describing his relationships with a diverse group of friends such as Alfred Steiglitz, Georgia O'Keefe, David McAlpin, Beaumont Newhall, Edward Weston, Edwin Land , etc. Besides spending a majority of his time out West, he also tell stories of time spent in New York City and the east coast. He led an interesting life.This 385 page oversize book (9\\"x10\\"), is an easy read filled with glossy black and white photos with every turn of the page. If you love his photography, you'll want to have a copy of this book in your library."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"Ansel Adams work is a treasure. I am a descendent of the original Indians of Yosemite and there is a problem. The defintion \\"Some of them are killers\\" for Yosemite was fabricated in 1978 and is not the original meaning of Yosemite. The real meaning was \\"The Killers\\" or \\"The Grizzlies\\" because the Miwoks were afraid of the Ahwahnees. It was Chief Bautista and Russio, who were helping the Mariposa Battalion, who coined that term \\"Yosemite\\" for the Indians in Yosemite Valley which they were afraid to enter. It is because the Miwoks were once enemies of Chief Tenaya and the Ahwahnees. 30 years Yosemite National Park Service hired a person named Craig Bates who was married to a Miwok woman and had a 1/2 Miwok son who created that new defintion. So it is increble that ONE person changed the meaning and defintion of one of the most important and well known parks in the whold world...and no one noticed."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"If you're looking for a great bio on Ansel Adams, this is the book for you. It is a great, fact-filled book."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"Mary Street Alinder presents a very personal look at many parts of Adams' life and career. Though most know some of his work, we don't know the early struggles to bring photography into the stuffy artistic world, the environmental activist, and his development and refinement of the photographic medium that Alinder brings to life. A great read for anyone who has marveled at his photos and wants some perspective on the personal side of this artist."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"Perhaps I missed the point. As anyone who reads a book about Ansel Adams, I am also a great fan of his work, and like many others too, a photographer with no claim to fame.The amount of interesting information in this book regarding the life of Ansel Adams is wonderful. The people he knew, the places he's been, and the struggles he's undertaken are all part of a dazzling portrait of the man we do not know simply from looking at his work. It is a book which provides historicaly interesting snapshots from his life (literally, and figuratively), and lets us see glimpses of the lives of other great artists too.What I found unpleasant was getting to know someone I may not have liked as a colleague or friend. The opinions or thoughts which flow from the pages of this this autobiographical are not always as polished as the photos we have come to know and love. In fairness, the man is not his work, and the work, likewise, is not who he is as a person. I have seen them both now, and prefer the work over the man (at least as he presented himself to me). I also thought that many of the events or persons which Adams spoke of where ALMOST done so by way of 'name dropping' in order to gain attention for himself (i.e. 'see who I know'). This was unnecasary I thought, and only made me wonder why he felt a need to do it that way, if indeed it was intentional.I was particularly troubled by one of his closing observations on the value of photography as a fine art form, and how a photograph is, beyond all others, the most difficult form of art there is to create. I should think Michael Angelo, Monet, Picaso, or hundreds of other amazing artists through the ages may be inclined to a different viewpoint, even if they wouldn't admit to it.Matt Lang"},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"I think that Ansel Adams was a great photographer, I personally love photography, and would love to see more professional photographers."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"First of all, the reproductions of Adams' photographs in the hardcover edition are excellent. The text is designed to relate to the photos, directly or indirectly, without distracting too much from the photos. Adams does tend to lean towards the philosophical towards the end of some chapters, perhaps with a well-founded basis.However, I think it is fair to say that Adams has &quot;visualized&quot; himself in a stylized and abstract manner, not unlike his photographs of the wilderness, cropping any rough edges of his life and ultimately contributing to (even propagating?) the myth surrounding his life.After reading his autobiography, I am now looking forward to reading his biography, written by Mary Street Alinder, his editor in the present effort. I hope that she reveals some of the driving tensions and flaws in his life, much in the same way James Gleick filled in the more sombre details of Richard Feynman's life that he glossed over in his autobiographies."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"While this book is about Ansel Adams, it is also about the struggle to make photography a recognized form of art. If you have any interest at all about the non-technical history of photography, I would highly recommend this book.There is much more here than just the thoughts and ideas of one man. Each of the people that influenced Adams are described in detail, and in doing so, Adams provides a much needed background for the modern history of photography. Adams was fortunate enough to be able to work with a diverse and creative group of people at a time when the art world was expanding into new mediums. He worked with many now-famous photographers, painters, philanthropists, and institutions, and his experiences with them give the reader a very strong base from which to asses these very important ideas and movements. In reading this book, I was able to greatly improve the depth of my understanding of photography as art, as well as improve my understanding of the contributions of a number of other photographers. I was both inspired and encouraged by reading how much hard work and unending effort these photographers went through to ensure that photography would be recognized as an art form.Another poster questioned whether Adams worked with the content of this book to cast himself in the best light. While this is quite possible, what is included does no so much focus on Ansel Adams the man as it does on his main goal in life, making photography a recognized art form. Everyone has personal issues to some degree, and I am sure that Ansel, being human, was no exception. But those problems are just that, personal, and would be tangental to what Ansel saw as the focus of his life. Everyone has faults so there is really no reason to enumerate them in print unless you are attempting to make yourself feel better by highlighting the faults of others.I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who appreciates photography, history, and the arts, as well as those that would like to gain a better understanding of a very creative photographer. Of all the books about, or by, Ansel Adams that I have read, this is the one book that I would put at the top of the required reading list. It is also one of the best books about the modern history of photography I have read to date. I really cannot recommend it strongly enough."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"This is one of the only books I have ever read where I limited myself to three pages of text a night; it was so good, I wanted to savor it as long as possible.The photos speak for themselves; far beyond what words can express, some of these images capture the deepest truths about the American landscape.Ansel is a good writer and a great thinker. His love for nature and music is profound, and reading of his many successful battles for the preservation of some of the world's finest places makes you just love the guy.Whatever personal details may be missing are more than compensated for by the endless beauty within these pages. I would read three pages and then spend half an hour just falling into two or three photos. Adams' eye for light and composition and meaning is incomparable. These photos are sensual delights, with deep love attached.Ansel also inspired me to spend serious time in Big Sur and Yosemite; for that I will always love him, and especially for his tireless work in protecting both of these most amazing of places.What a special man.If you can, get the first edition hardcover, it's well worth the extra bucks. The prints are as good as any fine art book you've ever seen. Later editions and the paperback are excellent, but are a step down from the first edition. You'll revisit this book many times and want to pass it on to your kids; get the best version you can."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"I have learned so much from this book about Ansel as well as many other notable photographers as well.Very well written - easy to read - hard to put away..."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"As an aspiring photography this is a great read. I was unaware of all of the environmental works Adams performed and the struggles he endured to make photography a recognized art form. I found that the last page of most chapters provided some of the most insight from Adams, and perhaps the editor formed the back that way. Hearing his philosophies on life and the various people he admired and appreciated (Albert Bender) was enjoyable to read. What seemed to be a glaring omission, or maybe not, was discussion about his family. There is almost no mention of his children and I think no mention of his feelings for them or his wife. Maybe the intent of the book was to focus on photography."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"Unlike most books on photography or photographers, this focuses more on the thoughts and relationships of Adams rather than an actual narrative of his life. The result is unexpected enlightenment: the core of the man including his attitudes, politics, and relationships.

It is very easy to come a point where one attains the feeling he actually knows Adams although relatively little is actually stated in straight terms about him."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"Ansel Adams was a photographer.

More than just a story of his life, Adams gives an interesting and well-written insight into the creative process that made him one of the world's most famous photographers and one of the earliest leaders of the environmental movement. Adams doesn't only talk about himself, but he introduces the reader to many of the people who influenced him along the way: Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Edward Weston, Alfred Stiegleitz, and Edwin Land (inventor of the Polaroid camera) to name a few. I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in photography or the outdoors."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"This is the life of Ansel Adams told through his own words. He divides his book into sections, telling the reader about mistakes he's made in his career, his inspiration to photography, and more importantly, his relationship with other people - his wife, business partners, close friends, etc.One thing that did impress me was the transformation of his own self over time. In the beginning of the book he describes himself as \\"agnostic\\" and \\"hyperactive.\\" However, toward the end, he seems tranquil and content. He also seems on the verge of believing in God. He suggests the existance of supernatural beings that help us through life. He tells of when he stopped abruptly while walking down the street, only to have a large amount of brick fall on the sidewalk infront of him."},{"Title":"Ansel Adams an Autobiography","review":"Sorry for the inconvienince- I submitted the followig review for the wrong book.

In length, it's comparable with other standard Land Law texts such as Kevin &amp; Susan Gray's tome, and certainly much more detailed than introductory texts like Cursley &amp; Green's Land Law (Palgrave Law Masters). The second edition is repackaged and updated, with references in the text being to paragraph rather than page numbers.Having studied under the great man, it is apparent that Professor Sparkes brings a levity to what is traditionally a dull and turgid subject - compulsory for all undergraduate Law degrees in England and Wales. From his comments about red squirrels to his apposite use of diagrams to demonstrate the structure of trusts, overall Sparkes has written a brilliant book on Land Law - and that probably takes some doing. If students take the time to read the relevant parts, they will easily find it a useful tool in their first year studies."},{"Title":"The divine androgyne: Adventures in cosmic erotic ecstasy and androgyne bodyconsciousness","review":"This is an expression of ECSTASY through Valuation of self.

This plane does not acknowledge gender via the expressed genitalia however excepts the blending of the spiritual expression of established dualities via consciousness. This is a great read for anyone attempting to value themselves first and move beyond the box closer to the of God within themselves.

I give it a billion stars."},{"Title":"Grasping God's Word","review":"Grasping God's Word is a mammoth of a book. It's used as a textbook for seminarians and other students of the bible. Me, I'm just a Sunday School teacher and a lover of the Word. So why did I read it? I was looking around on NetGalley and found an ARC for the third edition* of the book. I thought it could be helpful for Sunday School, sent the request to Zondervan, and soon I had the ARC on my Kindle.On the down side, I've rarely had good luck with sending ARCs to my Kindle via NetGalley. Most of the time, the things are shoddy and formatted to a point where I either can't read at all or I would have to exude great effort to do so. This is to be expected some, as the books are ARCs, but they still need to be read-able. In this case, Grasping God's Word is read-able, but there are plenty of graphics that are impossible to decipher. Also, quotes and footnotes don't display correctly.Besides this, and this stuff really won't affect the final product, I rather enjoyed Duvall and Hays' textbook. Up front, I didn't read the entire thing, but I did read a large chunk of it. For Sunday School my class is doing a \\"how to read and study the bible\\" study. Through this we are going through the various types of books (poetry, prophecy, epistles, etc.) found in the bible, and this book is a perfect tool for what my class is doing. I read the first few introductory chapters, setting up the book and how to use it.I like the authors approach to interpreting scripture. Imagine a biblical city, all walled and dusty. There's a river flowing next to the city. On the other side is a modern city, skyscrapers and all. Connecting these two cities is a bridge. The method describes taking the message from the bible (a la the old city) and applying it to life (a la the new city). Doing this requires understanding the culture of the Old, crossing the bridge, and understanding the New. (There's more to it than that, but this is a simplified preview.)In particular I enjoyed the chapter on epistles. It was very informative of how letters worked back in biblical times, how Paul's letters are much, much longer than an average letter of the times, and how letters were written, going so far as to break down the mechanics and structure. I personally feign interest in most of history, but this stuff was kind of interesting.Overall, I felt that Duvall and Hays offer a great resource for reading and understanding the bible. They are passionate about correct interpretation, and they stress context very seriously. There are many different methods for reading and interpreting Scripture, and Grasping God's Word offers tools for applying the bible to our own lives. While the book goes through a somewhat repetitive approach, if you're in any way interested in getting a little deeper in the Word, then it is still a book I'd recommend checking out.*I'm not sure what changes were made from the previous editions. Product info is available here.-----FTC Thingy: Zondervan graciously supplied me with an Advanced Readers Copy of this book.

There were those written more at the popular level (ie. Kay Arthur's Inductive method, Tim LaHaye's How to Study the Bible, etc...); or those that were more technical (Osborne's Hermeneutical Spiral, Vanhoozer's Is There a Meaning in this Text, etc...). However, there has been no real attempt to weave these two types together; an easily readable text that doesn't betray the Spiritual aspect of Bible Study, while at the same time teaching the standard methods of interpretation. Fee and Stuart took a huge step that way with How to Read the Bible for All it's Worth; I submit that their intentions were perfected by Duvall and Hays in this book. Here is a book that can teach college students, seminarians, and even laypeople the correct methods of hermeneutics for every genre in the Bible.

While I felt sufficiently challenged to think as I read the book, I never felt like they were talking above my ability to understand.To their credit, Hays and Duvall selected their particular analogy to describe the process of interpreting the Bible, and they constantly referred back to that approach throughout the text. Though somewhat repetitive, this writing style allowed their technique to really resonate with the reader. By the end of the text, I certainly wasn't struggling to remember their approach to hermeneutics, as it had become clear to me.Hays and Duvall write from an unashamedly evangelical perspective, and they are willing to suggest that the biblical texts do not and cannot mean whatever the reader wants them to mean. Though more liberal interpretative approaches would be alarmed by the certainty of their proposition, I found it to be refreshing. Without ever reaching a point of arrogance (a problem of which some evangelicals are rightfully accused), Duvall and Hays suggest that the human authors had a particular meaning intended when they wrote the Bible, and God has given us the necessary tools to get at that meaning.The reason I'm only giving this book four stars is because many of my seminary classmates were less enthusiastic about it. I have never read a hermeneutics book before, so I had no point of comparison. However, many of my better informed classmates referred to other hermeneutics texts that they liked much better.In any case, I found this book to be challenging and accessible. I would recommend it for anyone interested in a thoughtful analysis of the process of interpreting the Bible."},{"Title":"Grasping God's Word","review":"Grasping God's Word has great structure with easy-to-follow, step-by-step outlines and repetitive themes to reinforce what is being taught, such as the four steps of interpretive journey (which become five steps to dealing with the Old Testament) referred to throughout the book. Grasping the text in their town, measuring the width of the river to cross, crossing the principlizing bridge and grasping the text in our town provide readers with excellent illustrations of steps for the interpretive journey. Numerous passages of Scripture are explored using these steps in various places in the book. The authors provide numerous Bible examples of these. The reader is given a review at the end of many of the chapters to further drive home the valuable concepts being taught.Duvall and Hays offer good examples of how different episodes in the gospels connect with each other (p. 67-8) along with interpretive principles to determine what the smaller stories tell us about Jesus and what the authors of the individual gospels are saying by the way the shorter stories are put together (p. 239). Contrasting characters in the biblical text is another literary device that Duvall and Hays encourage readers to look for as they study the gospels. They illustrate this concept well with numerous biblical characters. Duvall and Hays give readers insight into how to make observations and pick up clues dropped by the writer of the biblical narrative (p. 302).Duvall and Hays make the point that biblical interpretation needs to be approached within the framework of the Historical-Cultural context, because this is how God gave the Bible (p. 96). This is logical because if interpretation of a passage does not make sense in the context of the time of the writing, it is a misinterpretation.Unfortunately, the authors' understanding of the Old Covenant is flawed. One of the ways this manifests itself is in their writing about the Old Covenant. Duvall and Hays believe the Old Testament saints main focus was the Law, whereas New Testament saints are saved by grace (p. 366). Scripture teaches, though, that God's people under the Old Covenant were saved by grace through faith (Gen. 15.6; Ex. 14.31; Jonah 3.5; Hab. 2.4), just like those under the New Covenant (Eph. 2.8).Duvall and Hays have a flawed understanding of certain aspects of the New Covenant as well. They caution readers not to be Judaizers in the application of the Old Testament prophets. They believe that the message of judgment does not apply to Christians because they are under the New Covenant. They believe that when a Christian is unfaithful it hurts God emotionally, and it damages the relationship with Him, though judgment is only for unbelievers (p. 366). But according to the New Testament, judgment begins with believers (1 Peter 4.17), and God will chastise His people living in sin (1 Cor. 5.5, 11.29-31; Heb. 12.3-11).Even though readers may disagree with Duvall & Hays' theological prospectives, particularly pertaining to the Old Covenant, Grasping God's Word is well written and provides a useful tool for interpreting Scripture. Readers might desire more information about certain topics but, for the most part, Grasping God's Word is quite extensive."},{"Title":"Grasping God's Word","review":"So far, this is the best book available on the subject of Biblical exegesis. We use this as a textbook in our hermeneutics class at Andrews Univ.Unfortunately, we disagree with the theology of the old and new covenants being different. This theology is reflected throughout the book.I happen to believe that people have always been saved by faith. The old covenant was anticipatory, a shadow of things to come. The new covenant is based on the historical reality of Christ, and writes God's laws on our hearts as a result.Despite our theological differences, there is no better book that teaches proper exegesis in easy to understand language. My denomination has a \\"Handbook of Bible Study\\" but it is too technical for beginning students because it explores textual criticism and the original languages. \\"Grasping God's Word\\" is easy enough to be understood by lay people, though I wouldn't want to use it with new members who could be confused by different theology."},{"Title":"Grasping God's Word","review":"This is an excellent book to help the Bible student learn how to interpret the Scriptures after crossing the river of time, culture, language, situation, convenant, etc. It is practical and easy to read.I used this book in college and have taught from it in the church.

Our teacher started us out with page 85 which is the story of a missionary in Ethiopia who witnesses a play by the locals about the birth of Christ. In their depiction, Joseph and Mary are accompanied by midwives which I initially had a negative reaction too but as I read it on, I discovered the authors brought out extremely valid points which enabled me to consider the possibilities of seeing the text differently.I feel the authors have done a wonderful job with this book. The book is easy to read but still holds up to technical and academic integrity. The stories and narratives make reading absolutely enjoyable and break up the more technical aspects of the book. The examples are excellent and it is written simple yet eloquent. There are so many parts of the book that hit you such as \\"When you truly grasp God's word you will find God's word grasping you\\". My only complaint so far is that I wish they made the vocabulary words stand out more. They are italicized. I think for us as students, it would grab our attention more if it was bolded or in a different color. However, that is such a minor point and there are so many good things going on with this book.

It's all well and good if we focus on the touchy-feely parts of the bible and come away with that same warm and fuzzy feeling that drives the sale of Christian books and stupefies the simple minded into filling the collection plates.If the bible was divinely inspired, then every bit of it should conform to all known facts in nature. Every bit of it should uplifting, useful, and good. Every bit of it should be true. Yet we find vile and repugnant things that are commanded, condoned, or personally carried out by old Yahweh himself. Over the years, mankind is left with the task of smoothing over, reinterpreting and in most cases outright ignoring some of the more despicable and ridiculous parts of the bible.Is it any wonder Scott Duvall did not explain too well:Deuteronomy 21: 1-8 ....... If you find a dead body and don't know the cause of death, then get all the elders together, cut off the head of a heifer, wash your hands over its body, and say our hands have not shed this blood.Did Mr. Duvall grasp God's word when he (God) commanded:Exodus 35: 2-3Whoever works, or even kindles a fire, on the Sabbath \\"shall be put to death.\\"Leviticus 24: 10-23A man curses and blasphemes while disputing with another man. Moses asks God what to do about it. God says that the whole community must stone him to death. \\"And the children of Israel did as the Lord and Moses commanded.\\"Deuteronomy 13: 6-10If your brother, son, daughter, wife, or friend tries to get you to worship another god, \\"thou shalt surely kill him, thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death.\\"Forgiveness, love, compassion is all well and good but Scott Duvall was not willing to grasp and apply God's word in Numbers 31: 1-54Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They kill all the adult males, but take the women and children captive. When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: \\"Have you saved all the women alive? Kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.\\" So they went back and did as Moses (and presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins.Readers, you would be better off taking a secular humanistic approach to a better life than having someone reinterpret and repackage accent tribal nonsense."},{"Title":"Grasping God's Word","review":"I am in the middle of my second semester of teaching Hermeneutics and I am using this as my primary text.

Grasping God's Word: A Hands-On Approach to Reading, Interpreting, and Applying the Bible. 2nd ed. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2005. 462 pp. $39.99.Interpreting the Bible is a topic of no small importance for readers of Scripture. It might even be said that this is everything. Without getting derailed into complicated discussions of methodology, the authors of Grasping God's Word present a procedure that is both successful in the sufficiency of its cause, and at being 'earthen' in its strategy. J. Scott Duvall and J. Daniel Hays both received PhD's at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and hold teaching positions at Ouachita Baptist University.SummaryIn chapter one the author, building on the hermeneutics of John Goldingay, qualifies his method for interpreting Scripture as grasping \\"the meaning of the text God has intended\\" (21). The Bible was not written in the 21st century, western world. It was, instead, written during a history and within a culture which in many ways is incongruous with our own. Bridging these two contexts can be difficult. However, if a theological principle can be observed within the text, then - by virtue of being a principle - a bridge between the two worlds is permissible. So, a theological principle \\"functions as a bridge spanning the river of differences\\" (21). This bridge is called the \\"principlizing bridge\\" and is the chief element of the author's methodology.The methodology itself is both economical and sufficient. There are four steps. Step one is to understand what the text meant to the biblical audience (22). Step two is understanding the differences between the biblical audience and the reader (22). The third step is to understand the theological principle of the text - perhaps the most crucial step (23). And the final step, four, is applying this theological principle to the life of the reader (24). The author labels this methodology \\"the Interpretive Journey.\\"Grasping God's Word is divided into five sections each of which discusses or uses the methodology presented in chapter one. The first section, which is about reading the Bible, includes four chapters (chs. 1-4). Chapter one, \\"The Interpretive Journey,\\" has already been addressed. Chapter two explains textual observations at the sentence level. Chapters three and four develop upon the practice of chapter two but broaden the context - chapter three deals with paragraphs and four with discourses (the author defines 'discourse' as any textual piece greater than one paragraph in length; 65).The second section is five chapters in length (chs. 5-9). Chapter five discusses presuppositions which will be discussed later. Chapter six explains the importance of respecting the historical and cultural climate of the Bible. Chapter seven deals with literary genre and context. Chapter eight offers instruction on doing word studies - rightly coming after the chapter on context! And finally, chapter nine surveys different translations.Section Three is four chapters in length (chs. 10-13), and discusses meaning and application. Key hermeneutical definitions and relevant discussions on hermeneutics is the focus of chapters ten through twelve, leaving the last chapter, thirteen, to deal with application.With the completion of the first three sections, the reader is now well-versed in the methodology and thus equipped to work with the text. Consequently, the fourth and fifth sections deal respectively with interpreting the New Testament and the Old Testament.3 The NT section is four chapters in length (chs. 14-17) and covers (in correct ordering) the epistles, the gospels, Acts, and Revelation. The OT section is five chapters in length (chs. 18-22) covering narrative, law, poetry, the prophets, and wisdom literature.Critical EvaluationThe basis for much of Duvall and Hays' work is that, while the reader is removed from the original context of Scripture both historically and culturally, the reader is able to bridge this gap by carefully discovering the theological implications of the passage, and with these implications a bridge over the river of difference can be made.While this is a simple methodology it should not be thought that no labor is asked of the interpreter. The author makes it certain that to correctly interpret Scripture labor is to be had. This first becomes evident in chapter three where observing and studying the text is not the same as simply reading it a couple of times - neither does it entail the expertise of a study Bible footnote. It is slow, thoughtful, careful, and objective reading. And the reader must read the text again, and again, and again (cf. the stories on pp. 45-47 and 66-67). Of course there are textual markers that give clue as to the meaning of the text, and the author does address these clues in detail (30-37, 47-54, 57, and 67-78), but the point of careful reading should not be missed. It should also be remembered that the clues are not always a shortcut to meaning. Some require careful work and alertness to find (e.g., chiasms). Observations of these literary clues should be detailed on paper, preferably a photocopy of the Scripture passage in question (58).The relevant meaning of a passage can sometimes run a paragraph in length or more (i.e., a discourse; 65) and this consequently increases the amount of work necessary to uncover meaning. There are several layers to this literary context which the responsible interpreter will consider. These include the immediate context (i.e., local verses) and the surrounding context (perhaps the book in its entirety; 121-122). Context must also be qualified. How do the parts unite to form the whole (126)? What is each units purpose (127)? Why does the author form his argument the way he does (127)? What happens to the whole if a particular unit is omitted (126)? Reviewing outlines of the text and creating an outline of one's own is necessary (128). Identification of conjunctions, literary genres, topical changes, and other grammatical clues is necessary (128-129). A written summary of each unit is also necessary - which should include how the passage relates to the surrounding context (129).Literary context is not only breadth but depth. How are the individual words to be qualified (ch. 8)? That the discussion of word studies follows the chapters on context is no mistake. The details of performing a word study are too great to be reproduced for this assignment - the author spends more than ten pages explaining this discipline (139-149).Literary context is not the only context. There is the matter of grasping the historical and cultural context - it is the original meaning of the text that should interest the modern reader (100). The labor involved in this step should not be missed. Indeed the author discusses in no less than nine pages the tools which are necessary for researching the historical and cultural context of Scripture (107-115). Page 107 also offers a lengthy list of questions which must be considered, and while space does not permit a reproduction of the entire list some of them should be mentioned: Who was the biblical audience? What was happening at the time the book was written? And, Why was the author writing? These questions are - looking back to chapter one - intended to be answered on paper (22, 215). Of course, anytime one is working with the text, there is also the added concern their presuppositions influencing their research. While carefully reading Scripture the author cautions the interpreter to guard against \\"interpretational reflex,\\" which is said to be the subconscious workings of our presuppositions (92). Hermeneutics is no walk in the park. The author does not have in mind a pushover student.With the fruits of this labor in hand, the interpreter is now equipped to cross the bridge over the river of differences by studying the theological principles of the passage (216). After examining how these principles were administered to the contemporary situation at the time of writing, parallels can then be made to more contemporary times (216-217). Next, only application remains.With all four steps of the Interpretive Journey examined the next two sections of Grasping God's Word (i.e., 4 and 5) discuss how to apply this method to both the NT and OT. The author will also coach the interpreter on other hermeneutical concerns encountered throughout Scripture. It is within these last two sections of the book that general hermeneutics is (perhaps) more key and the author's methodology more sideline. To be sure, each chapter does conclude with the methodology as well as an example of how to use it on the biblical material.In the chapter on NT epistles the author does discuss the nature of ancient letters (232-234) in addition to their method of writing and delivery (230-231). In the chapter covering the gospels an explanation of parables, exaggeration, and metaphor is necessary (256-260). Historical context and literary genre are key to interpreting Revelation, another chapter.For the OT section, in the chapter on the law, the author espouses a narrative reading of the Pentateuch (329-336). An examination of Hebrew poetry merits its own chapter, as well as the many elements of it (349-360). In the chapter on prophecy broad principles of prophetic literature are surveyed. The points here are threefold and include (1) the prophetic indictments against Israel, (2) the warning of judgment if she does not repent, and (3) the promise of restoration (373-377). The historical-cultural context is also important to this chapter (372-373). Ending the OT section is a chapter on correctly observing wisdom literature.The coherence of the book is remarkable. The methodology, which is purposed not only for hermeneutics but also application, works well when \\"the rubber hits the road.\\" But the book does feel a bit burdensome functionally: its a textbook in one sense; it teaches hermeneutics; it teaches application; and it covers a lot of material.Conclusion.In closing, the greatest advantage of Grasping God's Word is that it is packed with information. No stone is left unturned. It is consequently well worth the price. Its concentration on application is refreshing and shepherd-like. Although the Interpretive Journey might seem elementary in the early chapters, this review should evidence that the author does not have in mind a pushover reader. It raises the bar for undergraduates and is a wise choice for supplementing undergraduate, hermeneutical curriculum. It might be prudent to purchase a separate notepad to go with it in light of all the interpretive labor."},{"Title":"Grasping God's Word","review":"This book with the work book is outstanding.I have only been able to cover the first 3 chapters but have received a new understanding in the word of God.It is not easy and one must work hard to understand but in the end it will be will worth the time and effort.I have sent as must a 4 hours working out the assignments but each time I am blessed with new insights from God's word.LRK"},{"Title":"Grasping God's Word","review":"This is an excellent book that will show you how to get more out of the Bible than the average Christian ever will.

At the other extreme you will find a number of excellent graduate-level hermeneutics texts (e.g., Walter Kaiser Jr. and Mois&eacute;s Silva, Biblical Hermeneutics; William Klein, Craig Blomberg, and Robert Hubbard,Introduction to Biblical Interpretation, Revised Edition; Grant Osborne,The Hermeneutical Spiral: A Comprehensive Introduction to Biblical Interpretation). But there is not much in between. Earlier editions of Grasping God's Word have proven itself in classrooms across the US as usefeul help to students who want to learn how to read, interpret, and apply the Bible for themselves.In this third edition bibliographies, illustrations, cultural references, and appendices are updated in light of what has been published since 2005. In the first two editions, Old Testament scholar J. Daniel Hays and New Testament expert J. Scott Duvall had a four-step process for the New Testament and then added a fifth step when interpreting the Old Testament.Now they integrated this fifth step into a new Interpretive Journey applicable for all biblical genres:1. Summarize the original situation and the meaning of the text for the biblical audience.2. Measure the width of the river (i.e., the differences and similarities between the biblical situation and our situation).3. List the theological principles communicated by the passage.4. Consult the biblical map (i.e., see how our theological principle fits with the rest of the Bible).5. Grasp the text in our town (i.e., how individual Chris tians may live out the theological principles).This book has three basic components:1. The authors give serious attention to reading the Bible carefully. Much of the hands-on flavor comes through in the opening chapters as they lay a foundation of thoughtful reading. This section may look a lot like the inductive Bible-study approach promoted by Robert Traina and Howard Hendricks.2. They address general hermeneutical issues that confront every interpreter (e.g., preunderstanding, the role of the Holy Spirit).3. They offer guidelines for interpreting and applying every major literary genre in both the Old and New Testament.In Part One, first an introduction on Bible translations and the path original manuscripts had to become the Bible you hold in your hands, is given. The Interpretative Journey is explained and applied to sentences, paragraphs, discourses. Part Two takes a closer look at historical-cultural context or background of the Bible. But students are warned, that just because background information makes a great sermon illustration doesn't mean it's accurate. So, check your sources. Lists of Bible Handbooks and commentaries are available.The next question is what we bring to the text. What are our preunderstandings, motives, cultural backgrounds, paradigms and foundational beliefs? Can we be objective? However, total objectivity isn't the authors' goal. The literary context, surrounding context and the dangers of disregarding literary context are explained. Every Bible translation makes other choices regarding literary context, e.g. the division into paragraphs or sections. Word studies and common word study fallacies and decisions on meanings deserve your attention. Chapters are written on colours, allegories, Bible codes and the question who decides what means what.A whole chapter is devoted to the role of the Holy Spirit. Can we grasp God's Word apart from the Spirit? Is the Spirit the Divine Author? Can we live by the Spirit without grasping God's Word?In Part Three application of all the stuff learned is done. In Part Four the Interpretive Journey takes you to the New Testament, its letters, gospels, Acts and Revelation. Part Five leads us back to the Old Testament and its narratives, laws, poetry, prophets and wisdom. Appendix 1 shares thoughts on inspiration and canon. No deuterocanonical or apocryphical books are included in Part Four or Five. And if you want to exercise even more than all the assignments at the end of each chapter, Appendix 2 gives you the opportunity to write an exegetical paper. Appendix 3 gives you hints to build or enlarge your personal library. Unfortunately no money is offeredA website for professors offers extensive teaching materials, and an accompanying revised workbook gives students additional practice in reading and interpreting the Bible."},{"Title":"Grasping God's Word","review":"Grasping God's Word is a 460-page book with 22 chapters consisting of five parts.

It is a very easy to read book, but not one to be read casually. The authors desire for readers to attain objective meaning of God's Word in order to actually use it. They understand that this is a matter of life and death and not merely an intellectual pursuit. A big emphasis is placed on observing the small details and overall design of biblical texts in order to understand Jesus Christ and how to live for the glory of God.If you drop $45 for this Zondervan published book, you are either taking a college course or you are serious about understanding Scripture.

This book sets up 5 worthy steps needed to make accurate sense of Scripture. You will be given many needed tools for the indispensable work of studying your Scripture herein. One cannot simply read the Old Testament (poetry, narratives, dialogues, prophecies...) with our modern eyes and culture with hopes of truly making the best sense of it. We must take time and effort to be deliberate in our study!You will find with many examples, how to determine the culture at the time of writing - the original audience and their particular issues. Next you will look for that main Theological principle in each verse, paragraph of book of the Bible. But we are still far removed from the original audience and need now to filter this information through the New Testament to see if it reiterated, translated, supported or no longer valid. Of particular importance are those doctrines that are restated by Jesus himself.Now that we have spent the time examining particular words, cultural idioms, figures of speech and events - we can look to make a proper application for our present day and under the grace of Christ's new covenant.A book for all those who have wondered at verses and statements found in Scripture. A book for those who wonder what parts are applicable to us today, and why certain items are included if not directly pertinent.The Bible must be studied, and studied again - not simply read as you would some passing best-seller."},{"Title":"Trees of the West","review":"This is one of the first books I checked out of the library to use for tree identification.

They are relevant today as they were in the 1890s.The nineteenth century John Gabriel Borkman, like the twenty-first century's Bernie Madoff, bilked his friends of their life savings. Both were highly respected until they were caught and sent to jail, and both had lived well. Ibsen examines the impact that Borkman's nefarious acts have upon him, his wife, her sister, his son, and his friends.Borkman spent three years in detention, then five years in jail, then, after his release, eight years in the upper story of his sister-in-law's house, for he had no money any more. For eight years he walked back and forth in his room, like a caged rat, waiting for the day that he was certain would come when he would rise again.Ibsen focuses especially on three episodes. Borkman wanted so strongly to obtain wealth and power that he gave up what was important to him. Without realizing what he was doing, in a Faustian fashion, he gained power and wealth, but destroyed his own life and the life of another. What prompted his need for power? What did he give up? Who was involved? Who did he especially hurt?Borkman's wife hates him. During the eight post-prison years, she refuses to meet with him although they live in the same house. Why?Borkman's sister-in-law helps him for Borkman did not squander her funds. Why? Why also did she raise his son? What affect did all of this have on her and his son?"},{"Title":"Moskau","review":"The subject of John Gabriel Borkman (1896) makes it seem like a companion piece to some of the writer's earlier dramas The Pillars of Society or Enemy of the People, dealing with the subject of corruption, or at least an act of guilt in the past on the part of an individual that is to have a profound effect on the wider community. It's the aftermath of such a situation that is viewed here but, as one of Ibsen's latter plays, the subtext of John Gabriel Borkman is that of an act of corruption by an artist, who has forsaken the truth and love for more material gains, a theme that is borne out by Ibsen's next and final drama, When We Dead Awaken (1899), where the subject is made even more explicit.In the case of John Gabriel Borkman, the figure at the centre of the intrigue is a disgraced bank manager who has served five years in prison for financial irregularities that brought about the collapse of the bank and the savings of many people in the community. Borkman has served a further three years locked in the upstairs apartment of the house leased to the disgraced family by his sister-on-law Ella Rentheim. Borkman's failings however go deeper than his mere failing as a banker - in the past he renounced his love for Ella in order to become a successful and powerful businessman. Now, both his wife and her twin sister are seeking restitution for the losses they have suffered and hope to achieve it through his son, Erhart. Erhart however is unwilling to join in the \\"Danse Macabre\\" that has erupted around him and wants to take off and find happiness for himself.The hints that there is a rather more autobiographical context to the drama are found to some extent in the suffering of most of the characters associated with Borkman. Nearly all of them however have to share responsibility for their own failings - a complication that makes the role they play rather richer and more complex - but the purity of the artistic endeavour that has been lost or corrupted can be seen in Borkman's former assistant Fodal, an aspiring writer who doesn't have self-belief, or who has rather sacrificed his art for the people around him, perhaps foolishly. Borkman doesn't lack in confidence, aware that the keys to the kingdom were once in his grasp, but that his ability to retain them has long since passed and he is now \\"dead\\" to the world. The question that arises is whether the dead can awaken and redemption be achieved, a subject that Ibsen also approaches in his last drama, and to which the answer here would seem to be an equally bleak and dispiriting one."},{"Title":"Moskau","review":"The publisher created this book utilizing OCR software.

It takes place in an icy Scandinavian winter, in an icy Scandinavian house, filled with people whose emotions are anything but cold.

The author had a lot of information that many people may or may not have known about Joan of Arc. He had also brought up many interesting questions. Many of them were on what her physical appearance was really like and also some of whether God or the Devil sent her.Unfortunately there were several things I disliked. For one, throughout the whole book he would occasionally slip in his own personal opinion, I didn't like that. Two, in some of the chapters he wouldn't even mention Joan of Arc, or her relevance to the chapter, till the very end. Third, he would have a lot of French words and sentences in the book. He never would write in English what they meant or said. For some people who didn't take French, in school, would become very confused as I did. Fourth, throughout the book, he would jump around in years a lot and I would get confused on which year he was talking about. Lastly, the author would also add in or mention quit a few people. When mentioning them, he wouldn't say, on some cases, their relevancy to Joan of Arc or why they were so important to mention in the first place.I did enjoy reading about Joan of Arc and her, seemingly, fascinating life. I wish I were able to fully understand it all. As I had said earlier, I feel that if the author had skipped around so much on the dates it would be a little more understandable. There were a couple of parts, in the book, where he mentioned another book for getting his information instead of saying, \\"through my research.\\" Reading this book makes me want to go out and read other books about Joan of Arc to see if they have the same information or if I would learn something new."},{"Title":"Saint Joan of Arc: Born January 6th, 1412, burned as a heretic, May 30th, 1431, canonised as a saint, May 16th, 1920 (Modern continental library)","review":"Prof. Bonnie Wheeler of the International Joan of Arc Society has labeled this book \\"dead wrong\\" (a position which she rarely takes), and other researchers, myself included, tend to agree. More precisely: certain subjects are handled in an entirely fraudulent manner, as the author had a talent for misquoting or selectively citing the evidence, misinterpreting the original language to reflect her theories, and taking things out of context in order to make \\"hints\\" about Joan which happen to suit the author's inclinations (some of these will be dealt with in detail below). Even worse, more recent (and less honest) authors have taken some of the above innuendoes and extrapolated claims which Vita herself knew better than to make, and this has further muddled the subject.In fairness, at least the author genuinely read a wide selection of the documents, and was honest enough to refrain from the more outrageous claims. But the numerous distortions in this book include:- A persistent effort to remake Joan into a large, masculine, \\"sexually-unappealing\\" androgyne (in direct contradiction to eyewitness accounts describing her as \\"beautiful and shapely\\", \\"short\\", with \\"beautiful eyes\\", a \\"sweet girl's voice\\", etc). The author often manipulates such testimony until it becomes the opposite of what the eyewitnesses actually said. This is especially true with regards to the comments made by some of the men who had served in her army: what these fellows actually said (in summary) is that although they did find her attractive, they were amazed to find that their normal sexual desire (for all women) was suppressed when she was around. At no point did they say that they found her ugly or unappealing (as the author sometimes claims about this testimony), but precisely the reverse. The author admits that this was the case with the testimony from the Duke of Alencon, but characteristically sensationalizes it into something which the Duke never said, and which would be at odds with the other sources who are all agreed that Joan always slept in full clothing when with the army and never \\"undressed\\" in front of the troops, for heaven's sake. Alencon never claimed otherwise.- Worse, the author cites - sometimes out of context - some of the testimony given by a group of women (namely Charlotte Boucher (who had been only 9 years old when she \\"slept with\\" Joan at Orleans), Hauviette de Sionne (apparently under 13 at the time), and Marguerite La Touroulde) who described a common medieval practice whereby whenever Joan and the men in her group were billeted for the night in a house in which there weren't enough beds for everyone, they placed Joan with the little girls of the house or the hostess rather than the men (her male bodyguard, Jean d'Aulon, frequently slept in the same room with her, and so the hostess or a little girl was also placed in the room for propriety's sake, and sometimes in the same bed if there weren't enough to go around). The author admits that this was \\"the custom\\", and at least never goes so far as to claim that Joan was having sex with these women (which would contradict their own testimony that she was \\"chaste\\"), but nevertheless makes enough innuendoes to prompt a few modern playwrights and others to cite this book as alleged \\"proof\\" that such was the case. An author should not make careless comments on such a subject when she knows full well what the facts of the matter were.- Aside from the above, there are frequent misinterpretations: just to pick one random example, the author claims that Martin Ladvenu testified that Joan was raped, which is false: he said that there had been an _attempted_ rape after she agreed to give up her soldiers' clothing (which had \\"laces and points\\" by which the pants and tunic could be securely fastened together, thereby providing some protection against such assaults), and Ladvenu cites this attempted assault as one of the reasons she resumed her soldiers' clothing after the above-mentioned incident, to try to prevent another attempt from going even farther.- There are some anachronisms, such as when the author interprets Joan as a \\"feminist\\" while ignoring certain of her recorded statements which sound like precisely the opposite (such as the comment: \\"I would rather stay home with my poor mother and spin wool [rather than lead an army]\\", or her statement to Catherine de la Rochelle to \\"go home to your husband and tend your household\\", etc). Feminism is a modern movement which really had no counterpart in the 15th century.On the plus side, however, the author has faithfully mentioned many of the eyewitness accounts which are so often ignored, such as the testimony regarding the other reason for her return to \\"male clothing\\" (i.e., Massieu's statement that her guards had finally left her nothing else to wear, as a way to entrap her into a \\"relapse\\"); and most of the basic material on other subjects is generally accurate enough and detailed. The writing style is often engaging, and Vita Sackville-West, an aristocrat in early-20th century England, brings an almost Victorian-style flavor to the subject (which is a bit odd, but a welcome departure from most other modern books on this topic). Nevertheless, it's still a little sad to see this book in yet another reprint. Its previous popularity seems to have been due entirely to the fact that it was well-written (if not always factual), and the author did enough research to give it the illusion of being authoritative despite the fact that historians have rejected so many of the author's interpretations. The only accepted authority on Joan during the last half-century was the great French medievalist Regine Pernoud (founder of the Centre Jeanne d'Arc at Orleans, France); two of her books can be purchased here at Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Saint Joan of Arc: Born January 6th, 1412, burned as a heretic, May 30th, 1431, canonised as a saint, May 16th, 1920 (Modern continental library)","review":"Historians have rejected this book as erroneous on many points. While the material is relatively balanced, it nevertheless makes far too many baseless claims which have given rise to several profound falsifications of the subject.In some cases, the book misquotes or misrepresents 15th century documents. For example, eyewitness accounts describing Joan as \\"beautiful and shapely\\", very feminine, and \\"short\\", are here distorted or glossed over to make precisely the opposite claims about her appearance. The book also seems to have been responsible for inventing the absurd notion that Joan undressed in front of her troops, again by distorting or misinterpreting the accounts. Likewise, it gave rise to another falsehood by indirectly implying that Joan was a lesbian. This was achieved by irresponsibly citing out of context - while nevertheless simultaneously admitting the genuine facts of the matter - the testimony concerning the 9-year old Charlotte Boucher, the (then) 12 or 13-year old Hauviette de Sionne, and Marguerite La Touroulde, with whom Joan was sometimes placed in bed for various reasons, usually as a then-common means of coping with a lack of adequate bedspace in a household. The author admits that this was in fact the custom and does not imply lesbian sexual activity (or pedophilia, in the case of the young girls), but the book nevertheless delights in making sly innuendoes to the contrary which later authors then adopted in order to make more direct claims.Other errors are numerous. Martin Ladvenu's testimony was misquoted by alleging that she was raped by her English guards, although Ladvenu instead described only attempted rape, as did the other eyewitnesses. Several scurrilous allegations about her family are invented or repeated, without basis. Modern political ideology is introduced by misinterpreting Joan of Arc's role: she was given a position in the army after being accepted as a genuine mystic or visionary by the theologians at Poitiers; her role had nothing to do with feminism, as many feminists themselves have pointed out.In summary, this book cannot be recommended as a reliable history of Joan of Arc. The only general biographies on the subject widely accepted by historians are those by Regine Pernoud (a prominent medieval historian and founder of the Centre Jeanne d'Arc at Orleans, France)."},{"Title":"Saint Joan of Arc: Born January 6th, 1412, burned as a heretic, May 30th, 1431, canonised as a saint, May 16th, 1920 (Modern continental library)","review":"This book, while well-written, is fatally marred by the author's biases and selective view of the evidence.

This book about her, written in the thirties, covers as much of her life as was known at the time (there haven't been many changes to the record since) in beautiful prose, with sympathy and understanding. Vita Sackville-West was a prominent member of society in Britain, and Catholic, so she understood some of the things that were going on in Joan's head as history unfolded around this strange young woman.Sackville-West's book is very literary, and if there's one flaw it's that it doesn't show, sufficiently, how successful and revolutionary a soldier Joan was. She was much more aggressive than other French soldiers of the day, who had been conditioned to defend cautiously by the advent of the English longbow. How Joan overcame this isn't discussed (I suspect in part because this remains a mystery of sorts) though the remarkable fact of her becoming a soldier in this era where women didn't fight is commented on at great length. Joan's abilities as a prophet are also examined at great length, and analyzed carefully.This book is a good starting point for anyone wishing to know more about Joan of Arc. There's nothing on the market since (at least not that I'm aware of) as well-written, and the scholarship is good, as far as it goes."},{"Title":"Saint Joan of Arc: Born January 6th, 1412, burned as a heretic, May 30th, 1431, canonised as a saint, May 16th, 1920 (Modern continental library)","review":"This is a must read for anyone who is interested in the real Joan of Arc.

Vita Sackville-West's voice informs the reader and highlights the facts without interfering with the reader's ability to judge the events discussed on his\\\\her own. The author's style is witty, respectful of her subject, and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Power of a Good Fight","review":"This book has helped me make signficant changes in both my personal and professional life. Ms. Eisaguirre does an excellent job of explaining to the reader in a practical and straight forward manner why we should embrace conflict and the steps we need to take to be clear about our goals and to use conflict in a positive way to achieve our goals. Whether the conflict is at work or at home, Ms. Eisaguirre's insights in using conflict in a creative way is invaluable.I only wish I read this book sooner instead of sweeping most of my conflicts \\"under the carpet\\" and pretending they didn't exist or worse - reacting out of fear and anger and NOT getting what I wanted in the first place. THIS BOOK IS A MUST! I consult it now before I choose how I will deal with any given situation that deals with conflict. Very very empowering!!!"},{"Title":"The Power of a Good Fight","review":"This writer knows her stuff. Her insights into what it takes to approach the reality of conflict and deal with it in a constructive manner are, indeed, powerful.Eisaguirre writes in a clear and easy-to-read manner, making her advice both practical and accessible.If you experience nonproductive conflict in the work setting, or anywhere, Eisaguirre's suggestions will lead you toward a positive outcome.Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"The Power of a Good Fight","review":"Can you imagine &quot;welcoming conflict as a precursor to change and creativity&quot;? That is what Lynne Eisaguirre helps us learn to do in this book. She helps us understand how avoiding a good fight deprives us of rich and rewarding experinces. If you find yourself seeking a third party or higher authority to assist in conflict resolution, you may be missing an important opportunity to enrich your life.

I only wish I had read a book like this 50 years ago."},{"Title":"The Power of a Good Fight","review":"Every woman in the work world should read the Power Of A Good Fight.

I am glad she did.Lynne Eisaguirre explains why actually starting a fight can be the best way to improve your work environment. Eisaguirre's advice is right on target. I tried out her suggestions and have had a great response. From now on, I plan to address work place issues as they come up, just as I always have in my personal life."},{"Title":"The Power of a Good Fight","review":"Lynne's book arrived at the perfect time! As hospitals deal with nursing shortages as well as other shortages of healthcare workers in the U.S., managers need to make the most of the staff we have. We owe it to our patients and the physicians we serve to be the best we can be each day. The attempt to stretch ourselves to cover all the requirements of safe patient care with overwhelming budget cuts have led to short fuses and easy frustrations on a daily basis in acute healthcare.The Power of a Good Fight brings hope and ease to managers in what often seems to be an unmanageable work world, by simply and powerfully taking us step by step through all the What-ifs we face. Ahhh...It feels like having a coach at my side. I liked the book and plan to pass it around!"},{"Title":"The Power of a Good Fight","review":"If I had known years ago what Lynne Eisaguirre writes about the various conflict styles in her book, The Power Of A Good Fight, my career and life would have moved along a less rocky road. I now understand that one partner I worked for had a 'roadrunner' approach to conflict resolution; the other a 'pitbull' approach. Although I realize possessing this information would not have changed the way my bosses approached conflict resolution, I'm certain what would have changed, was my approach to them and their conflicts. The Power Of A Good Fight offers valuable knowledge and skills about effectively dealing with different approaches to conflict resolution. This would have improved my career and life had I known then what Lynne tells me now in The Power Of A Good Fight."},{"Title":"The Power of a Good Fight","review":"Lynn Eisaguirre knows the real world of work.

Companies should buy this book for thier employees and leave in the office lounge for EVERYONE to read! It's a great way to improve the atmosphere and environment of every office!"},{"Title":"The Power of a Good Fight","review":"This book makes a compelling case for constructive conflict and reminds us all why disagreement is a critical element in our lives. The author leaves no doubt that nurturing eclectic opinions and cultivating diveristy foster an atmosphere of creative discovery that separates the dyunamic, successful organizations from the rest of the pack. Ms. Eisaguirre is also a pragmatist and recognizes that many people do not cope with conflict well. She delivers a potent 1-2 combination by artfully identifying the five main styles of dealing with conflict and giving the reader practical tools for dealing with each style. It's a hands-on field guide for people in every industry, at every level who would like to get better performance, increased morale, bigger bottom-lines and thriving organizations.

The Power of a Good Fight cuts right to the source of workplace conlict, exploring different ways of communicating, and different personality types.The book isn't just theoretical, but rich with Eisaguirre's in-the-trenches experience as a consultant and workshop presenter. It's a highly readable, insightful compendium that has changed the way I think about my job. My thanks to the author! I never thought about whether I'm more like a pit bull, golden retriever, roadrunner, cobra, or eagle in my work style, but this book makes things a lot more clear, because I understand the psychological dynamics much better.I'd recommend this book as a company-wide discussion book, a management trainee text, or a personal/personnel resource to figure out what's really happening in a given skirmish -- or better yet, to transform the skirmish into a productive resolution.I'm betting this book will prevent a lot of road rage and sleepless nights!"},{"Title":"The Power of a Good Fight","review":"A practical book for anybody who works for a snapping shark boss or has subordinates who seem to disappear into the carpet whenever there's a disagreement.

Horses,email, shyness, the feeling of not belonging, the political system, standing up for what you believe in, trust, absent parent and Scottish dance. Whoa, did I forget dealing with a chronic medical condition and ecology? But the book doesn't zigzag all over the place - in fact , all the themes tie together in a way to demonstrate that people aren't always what they seem and that confidence can be created."},{"Title":"Fair Bay,","review":"This is a book I remember from my childhood. I checked it out of the library many times. I've been searching for it for several years now and was so delighted to finally find an affordable copy. It is just as I remember.

This book is served as enclyclopedia for Tabla which describes everything in great details to build a good basic foundation for all the students for classical music. However, If one has a teacher, one can make use this book much more efficient. This is the best talba book I have ever seen. I await next volumes to come! kongm@loxinfo.co.th"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"I had to wait a couple of months for it to arrive but when it turned up it was more than worth the wait. I'm a beginner who spent some time with a teacher but hasn't been for a lesson in quite a while now and I found it very easy to read. Having done a quick read through it once I found that I've picked up a lot of information and got a structure to build on. David Courtney's explainations for the inconsistancies of Bols for example suddenly made sense of whole areas that I hadn't previously managed to get my head around.On a first read through I found this book excellent and I look forward to using it both as a source of information and reference and a place to go for excerises to improve my playing."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"This book is an excellent source of tabla information by a scholar on tabla. I agree with most of the comments of the first reviewer. However, I want to caution the beginner who expects to learn tabla solely from this book without the guidance of a good teacher. Tabla is an art best taught under the teacher/pupil relationship (guru-shishya parampara). The trouble with a how-to book on tabla is that it creates the illusion that one can learn tabla on one's own, much like one learns Visual Basic from a book entitled &quot;VB in 24 hours&quot;. The temptations (and pitfalls) are to try more advanced material when one is not ready. To make matters worse, the author does not always indicate what is advanced material. For example, in a chapter on Purbi Baj, the author lists a few simple mukhadas in teental. Some of these should not be essayed by a student with less than two years experience with the instrument.Aside from the above caveats, the author must be commended for his efforts. I eagerly await his forthcoming works."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"Beautiful book. Bulk of the material is laid out in Appendices - making for easy reference. Examples and illustrations are plenty and the author's approach is very objective. There is a section that contains the actual examination papers for years 1 through 4 of a certificate program in Tabla at a University in India - what a brilliant idea ! Whether you are a beginner or a &quot;tablachi extra ordinaire&quot; - the book has enough material to make you come back to it time and again."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"I have had 1 year of 1 day a week tabla lessons.I found the book excellent. Lots of material to practice . I would recommend it to anyone. One exception, The correct drum strokes cannot be correctly learnt from a book, a beginner who did not have acess to a teacher would have to get a video so they could see and hear it i.e Ashwin Batish Tabla Bols Video very good or perhaps David Courtneys Video, although I haven't seen that. Buy it and drive your neighbours mad."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"This is an ideal book for beginners. It has excellent reference points and is really in depth with the history and evolution of the tabla. This is a must have for anyone who plays or is very interested in listening to the tabla. For instance my uncle is obsessed with the tabla and he found this book fascinating in teaching him new tips and methods. For the beginner this is the real look into Indian folk music. I strongly recommend that you read this book if you appreciate indian folk music"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},E={key:1};function B(n,a,s,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",C,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const G=d(H,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-16efec16"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/49.md","filePath":"guide/49.md"}'),q={name:"guide/49.md"},P=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(G)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
