Guilbault captures in loving detail the sensations and smells of the scorching desert of Sonora, Mexico, her birthplace and the land most unrelenting yet comforting in her memory. She writes also about the tumultuous era of her high school years in California, where patriotism clashed with antiwar activism surrounding Vietnam and where the tensions within a small, rural community's stance on Cesar Chavez's farm labor movement were less explicit yet equally strong and divisive. FARMWORKER'S DAUGHTER presents an intimate view of the immigrant experience from a distinctly female and bicultural perspective.

The present volume aims simply to show the type-character of the Western trapper, and to sketch in a series of pictures the checkered life of this adventurer of the wilderness. The trapper of the early West was a composite figure. From the Northeast came a splendid succession of French explorers like La Verendrye, with coureurs des hois, and a multitude of daring trappers and traders pushing west and south. From the south the Spaniard, illustrated in figures like Garces and others, held out hands which rarely grasped the waiting commerce. From the north and northeast there was the steady advance of the sturdy Scotch and English, typified in the deeds of the Henrys, Thompson, Mackenzie, and the leaders of the organized fur trade, explorers, traders, captains of industry, carrying the flags of the Hudson's Bay and North-West Fur companies across Northern America to the Pacific. On the far Northwestern coast the Russian appeared as fur trader in the middle of the eighteenth century, and the close of the century 6aw the merchants of Boston claiming their share of the fur traffic of that coast. The American trapper becomes a conspicuous figure in the early years of the nineteenth century. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Often lost in the statistics, however, is the dynamic of what happens when ordinary, law-abiding citizens are assaulted. What thoughts and feelings go through their minds as the events unfold? How do they react when suddenly thrust into life-or-death situations? The Best Defense is a collection of fascinating human interest stories of people who successfully used firearms to defend themselves and others against violent assaults. From Ohio, Florida, and Virginia to Missouri, Texas, Mississippi, and Montana, here is a dramatic portrait of what is at stake in the fight against crime at the level it occurs: victim vs. perpetrator. Here is living proof--thankfully living--that citizens do not have to be helpless in the face of crime and that in many cases self-defense proves to be law-abiding citizens' only opportunity to save themselves and their loved ones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=R5cOAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Best+Defense:+True+Stories+of+Intended+Victims+Who+Defended+Themselves+with+a+Firearm&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicago Aviation: An Illustrated History","description":"From the dawn of flight, Chicago has played a vital role in the development of aviation. Favored by geography and a superb network of railroads, the Windy City rapidly became the nation's crossroad. Young's richly illustrated history portrays the inventors, entrepreneurs, and aviators who conquered the skies and made Chicago the nation's premier hub for air travel and transport. Aviation's colorful figures come to life as Young recounts tales of the pilots, patrons, and passengers who sparked public interest in the early days of flight. Beginning with Chicago's first aviation event--a balloon ascension on July 4, 1855--Young traces the local personalities and technologies that helped make the dream of flight a reality. He offers the most complete account to date of pioneer Chicago aviator Octave Chanute, whose series of daring glider experiments led to international attention and a friendship with the Wright brothers, who sought his advice before their landmark flight at Kitty Hawk. The Windy City's golden age of aviation began in 1910, when a group of wealthy flying enthusiasts formed the Aero Club of Illinois. Fascinated audiences flocked to see the club's spectacular aviation shows and to visit Cicero Field, the place where many of America's first aviators learned to fly. Prominent public figures of the day included Harold McCormick, the millionaire patron of early aviation; Charles \\"Pop\\" Dickinson, who gained fame as the nation's oldest pilot; and Katherine Stinson, who at Cicero Field became the first woman to perform the loop-the-loop maneuver. Dozens of devastating air crashes over the years fueled America's early fear of flying. Chicago witnessed its share of air tragedies, from the Wingfoot blimp disaster of 1919 that caused the city to consider a ban on flying over its borders to the 1979 crash of a DC-10 jumbo jet at O'Hare that helped doom the career of that airplane. As Young investigates these crashes--as well as the mysterious legend of the \\"Great Lakes Triangle\\"--he sheds light on the evolution of airline safety. Aviation progress in a major city inevitably involves the continuous, often contentious, campaign for bigger and better airports. Young analyzes Midway's birth, death, and rebirth as well as the city's decision in the late 1960s to build a new runway at O'Hare, which caused a political furor over noise in the suburbs. At the end of the twentieth century, statewide controversy erupted again over the decision to reconfigure O'Hare, renewing the debate over airport expansion. Engagingly written and strikingly illustrated, Chicago Aviation is the only comprehensive history of the city's crucial contributions to the first century of powered flight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=56WFQgAACAAJ&dq=Chicago+Aviation:+An+Illustrated+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Russian revolution","description":"Looks at the decay of the Czarist regime and the causes of the Revolution, discusses the aims of the Bolshevik party, and recounts the major events of the conflict.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Bc_1qkobMOwC&dq=The+Russian+revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hidden Half of the Family: A Sourcebook for Women's Genealogy","description":"Offers information on finding female ancestors in each state, highlighting those laws, both federal and state, that indicate when a woman could own real estate in her own name, devise a will, and enter into contracts.

Set in the 1920s in the Sea Islands off the Carolina coast where the Gullah-Geechee people have preserved much of their African heritage and language, Daughters of the Dust chronicles the lives of the Peazants, a large, proud family who trace their origins to the Ibo, who were enslaved and brought to the islands more than one hundred years earlier. Native New Yorker and anthropology student Amelia Peazant has always known about her grandmother and mother s homeland of Dawtuh Island, though she s never understood why her family remains there, cut off from modern society. But when an opportunity arises for Amelia to head to the island to study her ancestry for her thesis, she is surprised by what she discovers. From her multigenerational clan she gathers colorful stories, learning about \\"the first man and woman,\\" the slaves who walked across the water back home to Africa, the ways men and women need each other, and the intermingling of African and Native American cultures. The more she learns, the more Amelia comes to treasure her family and their traditions, discovering an especially strong kinship with her fiercely independent cousin, Elizabeth. Eyes opened to an entirely new world, Amelia must decide what s next for her and find her role in the powerful legacy of her people. Daughters of the Dust is a vivid novel that blends folktales, history, and anthropology to tell a powerful and emotional story of homecoming, the reclamation of cultural heritage, and the enduring bonds of family.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AB0oEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The roots of healing: A woman's book of herbs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pQX4pwAACAAJ&dq=The+roots+of+healing:+A+woman%27s+book+of+herbs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rosmersholm","description":"Duncan Macmillan's stunning and resonant adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's Rosmersholm.

Liebling of the New Yorker","description":"The restaurants of the Latin Quarter and the city rooms of midtown Manhattan; the beachhead of Normandy and the boxing gyms of Times Square; the trackside haunts of bookmakers and the shadowy redoubts of Southern politicians--these are the places that A.J. Liebling shows to us in his unforgettable New Yorker articles, brought together here so that a new generation of readers might discover Liebling as if for the first time. Born a hundred years ago, Abbott Joseph \\"Joe\\" Liebling was the first of the great New Yorker writers, a colorful and tireless figure who helped set the magazine's urbane style. Today, he is best known as a celebrant of the \\"sweet science\\" of boxing or as a \\"feeder\\" who ravishes the reader with his descriptions of food and wine. But as David Remnick, a Liebling devotee, suggests in his fond and insightful introduction, Liebling was a writer bounded only by his intelligence, taste, and ardor for life. Like his nemesis William Randolph Hearst, he changed the rules of modern journalism, banishing the distinctions between reporting and storytelling, between news and art. Whatever his role, Liebling is a most companionable figure, and to read the pieces in this grand and generous book is to be swept along on a thrilling adventure in a world of confidence men, rogues, press barons and political cronies, with an inimitable writer as one's guide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bcWsgYoMCagC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grand Central Winter - Stories From The Street","description":"A New York Times Notable Book Whether Lee Stringer is describing \\"God's corner\\" as he calls 42nd Street, or his friend Suzy, a hooker and \\"past due tourist\\" whose infant child he sometimes babysits, whether he is recounting his experiences at Street News, where he began hawking the newspaper for a living wage, then wrote articles, and served for a time as muckraking senior editor, whether it is his adventures in New York's infamous Tombs jail, or performing community service, or sleeping in the tunnels below Grand Central Station by night and collecting cans by day, this is a book rich with small acts of kindness, humor and even heroism alongside the expected violence and desperation of life on the street. There is always room, Stringer writes, \\"amid the costume\\" jewel glitter...for one more diamond in the rough.\\" Two events rise over Grand Central Winter like sentinels: Stringer's discovery of crack cocaine and his catching the writing bug. Between these two very different yet oddly similar activities, Lee's life unwound itself, during the 1980s, and took the shape of an odyssey, an epic struggle to find meaning and happiness in arid times. He eventually beat the first addiction with help from a treatment program. The second addiction, writing, has hold of him still. Among the many accomplishments of this book is that Stringer is able to convey something of the vitality and complexity of a down and out life. The reader walks away from it humming its melody, one that is more wise than despairing, less about the shame we feel when confronted with a picture of those less fortunate, and more about the joy we feel when we experience our shared humanity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LrBWbrWg61EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's Christian Heritage","description":"Contrary to popular teaching, America was founded by Christians, and not by atheists and deists. The original documents prove that our Founding Fathers believed in the Supreme God and Lord of their lives as they undertook the enormous task of creating a new nation, based on Godly principles. This book uses direct quotes and annotations to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that America was created as a Christian nation, and that our form of government is totally inadequate for any other type of belief system. Without the morals and principles set forth in the Bible, our nation will not stand; however, we can return to those Godly principles as outlined in 2 Chronicles 7:14 \\"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BwQHOAAACAAJ&dq=America%27s+Christian+Heritage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE FRAGMENTED DREAM:MULTICULTURAL CALIFORNIA","description":"The Fragmented Dream: Multicultural California","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m2Rf5zOX5VgC&dq=THE+FRAGMENTED+DREAM:MULTICULTURAL+CALIFORNIA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden Rules","description":"In Five Golden Rules, John L. Casti serves as curator to a brilliant collection of 20th-century mathematical theories, leading us on a fascinating journey of discovery and insight. Probing the frontiers of modern mathematics, Casti examines the origins of some of the most important findings of this century. This is a tale of mystery and logic, elegance and reason; it is the story of five monumental mathematical breakthroughs and how they shape our lives. All those intrigued by the mathematical process, nonacademics and professionals alike, will find this an enlightening, eye-opening, and entertaining work. High school algebra or geometry - and enthusiasm - are the only prerequisites. From the theorem that provided the impetus for modern computers to the calculations that sent the first men to the Moon, these breakthroughs have transformed our lives. Casti illustrates each theorem with a dazzling array of real-world problems it has helped solve - how to calculate the shape of space, optimize investment returns, even chart the course of the development of organisms. Along the way, we meet the leading thinkers of the day: John von Neumann, L. E. J. Brouwer, Marston Morse, and Alan Turing, among others. And we come to understand the combination of circumstances that led each to such revolutionary discoveries as the Minimax Theorem, which spawned the exciting field of game theory, and the Simplex Method, which underpins the powerful tools of optimization theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lvHuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Golden+Rules&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Experiencing America's Past: A Travel Guide to Museum Villages","description":"This guide will help readers journey back in time by visiting historic outdoor museums that offer opportunities to see, taste, & fell America's heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OcLQwAEACAAJ&dq=Experiencing+America%27s+Past:+A+Travel+Guide+to+Museum+Villages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Virgile's Vineyard: A Year in the Languedoc Wine Country","description":"How did a region, so long notorious for mere quantity, transform itself into one of the world s most exciting vineyards?And what does it take to make a great wine  even on a shoestring?In Virgile s Vineyard, Patrick Moon explores the world of Languedoc wine.

If her Ohio novels are more melancholy and compassionate, her Manhattan novels, exuberant and incisive, sparkle with a cast of writers, show people, businessmen, and hustling hangers-on. All show rich characterization and a flair for the gist of complex social situations. A playful satirist, an unsentimental observer of failed hopes and misguided longings, Dawn Powell is a literary rediscovery of rare importance. In this, one of two volumes collecting nine novels, The Library of America presents the best of Powell s fiction. Dance Night (1930), Powell s own favorite among her works, is a surprisingly frank treatment of obsessive longing set in an Ohio factory town during the 1920s. Come Back to Sorrento (1932; originally published as The Tenth Moon), a compelling study of frustrated aspirations, tells the story of a woman whose friendship with a music teacher awakens her sense of her life s wasted potential. With Turn, Magic, Wheel (1936), a whirlwind tour of Manhattan s literary world, Powell reinvented herself as a satirical writer. Her treatment of the  city of perpetual distraction  captures the allure of Manhattan with a lightness and wit to be found in all her New York novels. Angels on Toast (1940), whose farcical pace recalls screwball comedy, is a shrewd portrait of the adulterous misadventures of two salesmen. In A Time To Be Born (1942), set during the months before America s entry into World War II, Powell portrays the monstrously egotistical Amanda Keeler Evans one of her most wickedly barbed creations. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=36hNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Dawn+Powell:+Novels+1930-1942+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preparatory exercises in score-reading =: Vorbereitende Ubungen im Partiturlesen","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UQERzQEACAAJ&dq=Preparatory+exercises+in+score-reading+%3D:+Vorbereitende+Ubungen+im+Partiturlesen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Cena Secreta (Spanish Edition)","description":"Descubre las razones y misterios que llevaron a Javier Sierra a escribir La cena secreta.

This book tells the story of how the enslavement of Africans by Berbers, Arabs, and other Africans became institutionalized and legitimized throughout Muslim Africa. A classic, pioneering study, first published in 1971 and extensively updated in this revised edition, Slavery in the History of Black Muslim Africa provides an expansive portrait of domestic slavery from the tenth to the nineteenth century in the context of the religious, social, and economic conditions of the African Islamic world. Drawing on a host of accounts from contemporary observers such as Leo Africanus and Ibn Battuta, Fisher and Fisher describe the status and rights of slaves in Africa, and their various roles as currency, goods, eunuchs, soldiers, and statesmen, as well as the jarring historical interruption brought on by slave raiders and traders in West and North Africa.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=77kUCgAAQBAJ&dq=A+Critical+Introduction+to+Queer+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"He Who Hesitates","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1WT7MgEACAAJ&dq=He+Who+Hesitates&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Survival Poaching","description":"Tells the survivalist how to collect wild game under any circumstances, using Indian secrets.

Yet for decades after her death, Powell s work was out of print, cherished by a small band of admirers. Only recently has there been a rediscovery of the writer Gore Vidal calls  our best comic novelist,  and whom Edmund Wilson considered to be  on a level with Anthony Powell, Evelyn Waugh, and Muriel Spark.  In this, one of two volumes collecting nine novels, The Library of America presents the best of Powell s quirky, often hilarious, sometimes deeply moving fiction. My Home Is Far Away (1944), the last of Powell s novels set in Ohio, is a fictionalized memoir of Powell s difficult childhood. With The Locusts Have No King (1948), the story of a scholar s unexpected brush with the temptations of celebrity and riches, Powell resumed her lifelong dissection of New York s pretensions and glamour. The first of three brilliant postwar satires, it was followed by The Wicked Pavilion (1954), a novel that lays bare its characters  illusions about love and success against the backdrop of the Caf  Julien, a relic of a bygone era in the history of Greenwich Village. The volume concludes with Powell s final novel, The Golden Spur (1962), in which she drew on her time spent among painters at the famed Cedar Tavern for an affectionate if pointed satire on Manhattan s art world. Dawn Powell s New York novels are exactly what she wanted them to be:  crystal in quality, sharp as the skyline, and relentlessly true.

Four decades later, she was revered as their leader by thousands of churches in the U.S. and Europe, had founded a national newspaper, and had become probably the most powerful woman in America.Who was this astonishing woman, the mother of the Mother Church? How did she prepare for her illustrious career during her years of obscurity, and what was her inspiration for the healing practices and doctrine of Christian Science? Gillian Gill, a non-Christian Science Scientist scholar, who managed to win unparalleled access to the Church archives, offers here an entirely new look at Mary Baker Eddy.For the first time readers will see the extraordinary leadership skills exercised by Mrs. Eddy despite the repressive forces facing women in her time. For the first time we learn the full story of the bizarre attack on Mrs. Eddy by Joseph Pulitzer and his New York World alleging that she was at least senile and possibly not even alive. In this enthralling biography, we rediscover Mary Baker Eddy as a radical Christian thinker, pioneer in the recognition of mind/body connections, survivor of scandal, and target of both admiration and scorn from such eminent contemporaries as Mark Twain. Gillian Gill's sense of drama, her critical acumen, and her delicious wit bring to life a brilliant religious leader whose message has new meaning in our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3s6n4Z-I0sUC&dq=Mary+Baker+Eddy+(Radcliffe+Biography+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pregnant Fathers: Entering Parenthood Together","description":"Covers the father's side of parenthood from pregnancy to infancy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SFe1sWowZu0C&dq=Pregnant+Fathers:+Entering+Parenthood+Together&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Sentence Patterns (Kodansha Dictionaries)","description":"A comprehensive, communicative, and practical guide to using Japanese, Kodansha's Furigana Japanese Dictionary is an invaluable tool for anyone with an interest in the Japanese language. It has been edited with the needs of English-speaking users in mind, whether students, teachers, business people, or casual linguists, and special care has been taken at each stage of its compilation including the selection of entry words and their equivalents, the wording of the detailed explanations of Japanese words, the choice of example sentences, and even its functional page design to maximize its usefulness. What is furigana and why is it so important? Furigana refers to the small kana that are printed above or alongside kanji to show their pronunciation. With furigana superscripts, the beginner who is familiar with hiragana and katakana is able to read even the most difficult and obscure kanji at a glance. Other dictionaries either provide little or no guide to kanji readings or romanize some or all of the Japanese words and sentences. In the past, romanized dictionaries were of some value to students using textbooks that contained no Japanese script. Now, however, an increasing number of influential curricula around the world are based on a rationale and methodology that demands the introduction of hiragana and katakana from the earliest stages. Learners and their teachers using such curricula will inevitably feel more comfortable with a dictionary such as Kodansha s Furigana Japanese Dictionary, one that shows the pronunciation of kanji with a familiar and authentic kana script. Combining Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary (1995) and Kodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary (1996) in one portable. affordable, and user-friendly volume, this dictionary has the following unique features: ? A basic vocabulary of 30,000 entries covers the most frequently used English and Japanese words ? Special treatment has been given to hundreds of words, names, and phrases of special relevance to English-speaking students of Japanese ? Semantic and usage differences between Japanese words and expressions are explained in clear English ? Thousands of example sentences and phrases illustrate how Japanese words are used in context ? Special information is provided on verb conjugations, formality, and other aspects of Japanese grammar and usage","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3aJNEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Dictionary+of+Basic+Japanese+Sentence+Patterns+(Kodansha+Dictionaries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spongebob Squarepants Flip Book","description":"With the use of animation art, kids can flip through two different stories and watch Bob hop into his pants and do the famous bubble dance.

Consistently refusing to tie himself down to any trade, place, or person, he even deserts the companion who might be considered Hermann Hesse himself the summer they go tramping together. Knulp's exile is blissful, gentle, self-absorbed. But hidden beneath the light surface of these \\"Tales from the Life of Knulp\\" is the conscience of an artist who suspects that his liberation is worthless, even immoral. As he lies dying in a snowstorm, Knulp has an interview with God in which he reproaches himself for his wasted life. But it is revealed to Knulp that the whole purpose of his life has been to bring \\"a little homseickness for freedom\\" into the lives of ordinary men.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DFEUgsZGracC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World Does Move","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ieLXnAAACAAJ&dq=The+World+Does+Move&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jack and the Beanstalk: How a Small Fellow Solved a Big Problem","description":"A boy climbs to the top of a giant beanstalk, where he uses his quick wits to outsmart an ogre and make his and his mother's fortune.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8oSgNwAACAAJ&dq=Jack+and+the+Beanstalk:+How+a+Small+Fellow+Solved+a+Big+Problem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician","description":"Chronicles Nixon's rise to political prominence, from his pre-World War II government service to his under-the-table stab at the vice-presidency in 1952, in the first of a projected three-volume biography","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Uw8_HAAACAAJ&dq=Richard+Milhous+Nixon:+The+Rise+of+an+American+Politician&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FATHER AND CHILD REUNION","description":"Debunking common myths about fatherhood, the author of Why Men Are the Way They Are reveals the subtly corrosive effects of negative media, government, and the legal system on the role that fathers once enjoyed in society and with their children. 15,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QE4DAAAACAAJ&dq=FATHER+AND+CHILD+REUNION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ferrari formula 1 cars, 1948-1976","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Sl8oAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Ferrari+formula+1+cars,+1948-1976&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motor Control & Learning: A Behavioral Emphasis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xy3EsgEACAAJ&dq=Motor+Control&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Etheric Double: The Health Aura of Man (Theosophical Classics Series)","description":"First published in 1925, this classic text has long been used as a resouce by students and scholars of astral phenomena.

So why do we also seem more confused, divided and foolish than ever before? Some pundits criticize the news media for political bias. Other analysts worry that up-to-the-minute news reports on radio and television oversimplify complex realities. Still more critics point out that today's reporters can't possibly be experts on the wide variety of subjects they cover. Historian C. John Sommerville thinks the problem with news is more basic. Focusing his critique on the news at its best, he concludes that even at its best it is beyond repair. Sommerville argues that news began to make us dumber when we insisted on having it daily. Now millions of column inches and airtime hours must be filled with information--every day, every hour, every minute. The news, Sommerville says, becomes the driving force for much of our public culture. News schedules turn politics into a perpetual campaign. News packaging influences the timing, content and perception of government initiatives. News frenzies make a superstition out of scientific and medical research. News polls and statistics create opinion as much as they gauge it. Lost in the tidal wave of information is our ability to discern truly significant news--and our ability to recognize and participate in true community. This eye-opening book is for everyone dissatisfied with the state of the news media, but especially for those who think the news really informs them about and connects them with the real world. Read it and you may never again know the tyranny of the daily newspaper or the nightly news broadcast.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=98FNN5VxvjQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exams 70-290, 70-291, 70-293, 70-294): Microsoft Windows Server(TM) 2003 Core Requirements, Second Edition","description":"Provides information on the tuning and optimization features of SQL server 2005, covering such topics as query execution, plan caching, and concurrency problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_YEpAQAAMAAJ&dq=MCSE+Self-Paced+Training+Kit+(Exams+70-290,+70-291,+70-293,+70-294):+Microsoft+Windows+Server(TM)+2003+Core+Requirements,+Second+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What is a family?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=M2F3IsjoGHsC&dq=What+is+a+family%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under the Bridge","description":" A swift, harrowing classic perfect for these unnerving times.

Rev. Zugger tells of the faithful men and women shackled by dictatorship, doomed to deportation, and abandoned by their own church in the west. Soviet Russia was an empire born of atheism with religion viewed as a threat to the state s notion of individualism. By 1932, dictator Joseph Stalin firmly declared that religion would be extinct in the USSR within five years. In this compelling volume, Zugger details the Soviet campaign against Catholicism among many ethnic groups and worshippers whose devotion would not be shaken. He shows how they kept faith alive in prison camps, in remote villages, in monastery prisons, and in the secrecy of their homes, where the light of faith continued to burn brightly while churches crumbled or became dance halls and office buildings. This is the first book in English to recount the fate of Catholic Russia and the church in the various lands conquered by Soviet rule. It is at once a memorial to those who perished, a tribute to those who survived, and a testament to the enduring power of faith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HnUnJ7X10BMC&dq=The+Forgotten:+Catholics+of+the+Soviet+Empire+from+Lenin+Through+Stalin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"25 years with the Fighting Hawkeyes: Fourth quarter, 1964-1988","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qXG-HAAACAAJ&dq=25+years+with+the+Fighting+Hawkeyes:+Fourth+quarter,+1964-1988&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cee Dub's Dutch Oven and Other Camp Cookin'","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F9DwAAAACAAJ&dq=Cee+Dub%27s+Dutch+Oven+and+Other+Camp+Cookin%27&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smiling Wolf","description":"Investigating the mysterious disappearance of a reporter, a former detective finds himself drawn into the dark underground world of blood-drinking cultists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LSseLA0VkJMC&dq=Smiling+Wolf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When All Roads Led to Tombstone: A Memoir","description":"In 1940, Gray wrote this manuscript containing reminiscences about the Gray family's settlement in Arizona and New Mexico in the 1880s and 1890s.

Although there is an element of self-justification, Conservative von Papen lays bare the machinations of the German politicians that led to Hitler to supreme power in Germany. Born into a wealthy, but not aristocratic, family in 1879 von Papen he started his career in the Imperial German Army rising to the General Staff and a diplomatic posting in America by 1914. He was involved in some very murky dealings as an intriguer behind the scenes in America, Canada before he was sent back to Germany, setting a precedent for later backroom dealings. After the close of the First World War he entered politics, as a Conservative Monarchist member of the Centre party, in the political chaos of the period he advanced swiftly owing to shrewd interparty dealings. He was eventually appointed Chancellor in 1932 mainly due to political friendships rather than his own political acumen; beset by huge political problems he sought to appease the vocal right wing parties. Without serious support in the Reichstag, von Papen governed by decree undermining Democracy, starting a process mastered later by Hitler himself. Outmaneuvered by Hitler and the Nazis he was forced from power, and by his foolish machinations set Hitler set up as Chancellor. Cast out of power von Papen was a broken reed, but as a still high-ranking observer to the Second World his memoirs are of vital importance in understanding Hitler s war-mongering advances into Austria, Poland and France. He was captured by U.S. forces in 1945, he was put on trial for war crimes but was acquitted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LtRvCwAAQBAJ&dq=Franz+Von+Papen+Memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jericho Sanction (International Intrigue Trilogy #2)","description":"Wanneer een Russische fascist met goede kansen bij de verkiezingen in 1999 plannen heeft om vele minderheidsgroepen uit te roeien, probeert een Amerikaanse agent daar een stokje voor te steken.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CuWrvgEACAAJ&dq=The+Jericho+Sanction+(International+Intrigue+Trilogy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Analog Science Fact-Fiction Oct. 1960: The Lost Kafoozalum; Combat; Satellite System","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hNEsAQAAIAAJ&dq=Analog+Science+Fact-Fiction+Oct.+1960:+The+Lost+Kafoozalum%3B+Combat%3B+Satellite+System&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Equilibrium statistical mechanics (Prentice;Hall International series in engineering of the physical sciences)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lP9QAAAAMAAJ&dq=Equilibrium+statistical+mechanics+(Prentice%3BHall+International+series+in+engineering+of+the+physical+sciences)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Aran Keening","description":"In November 1968, at the age of 22, Andrew McNellie left his job and his girlfriend in Wales and travelled to Inuishmore.

H., Auden, C. Day Lewis, Isaiah Berlin, and Anthony Blunt. Like many liberals of his generation, he was shocked by the effects of the Depression and correspondingly sympathetic to the Communist regime in Russia. Guy Burgess, of the Cambridge spies--Burgess, Maclean, Philby, and Blunt, admitted his espionage to Rees. His association with Burgess was to blight the rest of Rees's life. When Burgess defected in 1951, and Rees denounced him to MI5, Rees was viewed more as a spy out to save his own skin than as an honorable citizen. His anonymous, sensationalist articles in The People, denouncing Burgess's political activities and all but naming names, condemned him with the British intellectual community--not for his politics but for his betrayal of a friend. Colleagues and acquaintances accused him of trying to initiate a McCarthyite witch-hunt. He lost his job. His academic career was ruined. In Looking for Mr. Nobody, Jenny Rees deals with many of the old charges made against her father in her search for the answer to her own question, \\"Was he, too, a spy?\\" Had he joined up with Burgess and Blunt and passed secrets to the Soviet Union? Her quest for the truth reveals a fascinating portrait of a brilliant but flawed man of letters, handsome and seductively charming, caught up in the radical, political commitments of the 1930s, Communist Party membership, and his tortured relationship with the notorious Cambridge spies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xCNHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night of the Dragons: Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Vol. 2 (Dragonlance Chronicles, Part 2)","description":"Adapting the mega-popular first novel in the Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy by Margaret Weis.

The early burst of excitement which was spawned by the development and successful applications of linear programming to problems in both the public and private sectors has challenged researchers to develop even more sophisticated methods to deal with the complex nature of decision making. Sophistication, however, does not always trans 1 ate into more complex mathematics. Professor Thomas L. Saaty was working for the U. S. Defense Department and for the U. S. Department of State in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In these positions, Professor Saaty was exposed to some of the most complex decisions facing the world: arms control, the Middle East problem, and the development of a transport system for a Third World country. While having made major contributions to numerous areas of mathematics and the theory of operations research, he soon realized that one did not need complex mathematics to come to grips with these decision problems, just the right mathematics! Thus, Professor Saaty set out to develop a mathematically-based technique for analyzing complex situations which was sophisticated in its simplicity. This technique became known as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and has become very successful in helping decision makers to structure and analyze a wide range of problems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EbEjCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perils of Paul","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kRq6AAAACAAJ&dq=Perils+of+Paul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recipe for Murder (Patrick & Grace #2)","description":"Patrick O?Malley, retired New York City cop, and Grace Johnson, Jill-of-all-trades at the homeless shelter where she escaped in the first Patrick and Grace Mystery, take flight to Nebraska when they hear that Walter Schmidt, Grace's cohort from the kitchen at the shelter was found hanging in the apple shed.

According to the Marxologist David McLellan, \\"the book had its origin in Lenin's argument with Bukharin in the summer of 1916 over the existence of the state after a proletarian revolution. Bukharin had emphasised the 'withering' aspect, whereas Lenin insisted on the necessity of the state machinery to expropriate the expropriators. In fact, it was Lenin who changed his mind, and many of the ideas of State and Revolution, composed in the summer of 1917 - and particularly the anti-Statist theme - were those of Bukharin\\" .Lenin's direct and simple definition of the State is that \\"the State is a special organisation of force: it is an organisation of violence for the suppression of some class.\\" Hence his denigration even of parliamentary democracy, which was influenced by what Lenin saw as the recent increase of bureaucratic and military influences: \\"To decide once every few years which member of the ruling class is to repress and crush the people through parliament - this is the real essence of bourgeois parliamentarism, not only in parliamentary-constitutional monarchies, but also in the most democratic republics\\".Citing Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx, Lenin investigates theoretical questions about the existence of the State after the proletarian revolution, addressing the arguments of anti-authoritarians, anarchists, social democrats, and reformists, in describing the progressive stages of societal change -- the revolution, establishing \\"the lower stage of communist society\\" (the socialist commune), and the \\"higher stage of communist society\\" that will yield a stable society where personal freedom might be fully expressed.Lenin especially defends Marx's theory of Communism, and Marxism generally; to wit, when old revolutionaries die, the bourgeoisie are not content with labelling them \\"enemies of the state\\", because that would attract political radicals, so they attack the revolutionaries' theoretic writings by ascribing to them an (anti-revolutionary) social-democratic mediocrity contrary to \\"the revolutionary nature of Marx\\"; such bourgeois intellectuals are the \\"revisionists\\" who transform a human being into an abstraction:During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred, and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their deaths, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonize them, so to say, and to hallow their names, to a certain extent, for the 'consolation' of the oppressed classes, and with the object of duping the latter, while, at the same time, robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge, and vulgarizing it. Today, the bourgeoisie and the opportunists within the labour movement concur in this doctoring of Marxism. They omit, obscure, or distort the revolutionary side of this theory, its revolutionary soul. They push to the foreground and extol what is, or seems, acceptable to the bourgeoisie. All the social-chauvinists are now 'Marxists' (don't laugh!). And more and more frequently, German bourgeois scholars, only yesterday specialists in the annihilation of Marxism, are speaking of the 'national-German' Marx, who, they claim, educated the labour unions, which are so splendidly organised for the purpose of waging a predatory war!","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sxlyswEACAAJ&dq=The+state+and+revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange But True Stories from Japan","description":"Strange but True Stories from Japan is a fascinating collection of vignettes, ranging from historical to the personal.

Also included are thirty rarely seen photographs and five maps and diagrams. Images feature things such as uniformed Luftwaffe officers, close-up shots of fighter planes, and the areas where the planes were authorized to carry out their missions. This unique volume was compiled by acclaimed military historian David C. Isby and is extraordinarily comprehensive. To make it, Isby poured over accounts of the war given by members of the Luftwaffe shortly after the events they describe. Much of the information in the book has been shared for the first time, and, after a limited run, is finally back in print.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uEJ1EAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Luftwaffe+Fighter+Force:+The+View+from+the+Cockpit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragon's Treasure","description":"A half-human half-dragon liege struggles to control his inner beast and preserve a kingdom in this masterful tale from a two-time World Fantasy Award winner.

In Power: The Hidden Instinct, author David Bleviss reshapes the definition of this complex, yet often overused word. Bleviss asserts that the desire for power is instinctual and that anyone with will and desire can possess it. Bleviss began developing his ideas about power from an early age. As a young adult, he traveled to Palestine in 1947 to participate in the formation of the new state of Israel. Moving from a society invested in socialist idealism to capitalism helped to form many of Bleviss's ideas about power and its uses. In uncovering the meaning and uses of power, Bleviss explains power as both a science and an art. He believes that in the desire for power to make things happen, men and women seldom fully understand the underlying processes. Power: The Hidden Instinct assists readers to develop a richer appreciation of the use of language and a more specific understanding of individual motivations and behaviors related to \\"the art of powering.\\" Bleviss takes the reader beyond such clich s as \\"power lunch\\" to a level that reveals how we fit into the social, economic, and political power forces of a larger society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZSGYl9MkVm0C&dq=Power:+The+Hidden+Instinct&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disconnecting from the Workplace","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5WRvHNcYN9MC&dq=Disconnecting+from+the+Workplace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ninety-Three","description":"Ninety-Three (Quatrevingt-treize) is the last novel by the French writer Victor Hugo.

He shows how the insights of modern evolutionary theory, particularly on the evolution of cooperation, can help the left attain its social and political goals. Singer explains why the left originally rejected Darwinian thought and why these reasons are no longer viable. He discusses how twentieth-century thinking has transformed our understanding of Darwinian evolution, showing that it is compatible with cooperation as well as competition, and that the left can draw on this modern understanding to foster cooperation for socially desirable ends. A Darwinian left, says Singer, would still be on the side of the weak, poor, and oppressed, but it would have a better understanding of what social and economic changes would really work to benefit them. It would also work toward a higher moral status for nonhuman animals and a less anthropocentric view of our dominance over nature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8oXyAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wireless Game Development in C/C++ with BREW (Wordware Game Developer's Library)","description":"Designed for game programmers interested in developing mobile phone applications, Wireless Game Development in C/C++ with BREWTM uses QUALCOMM? s BREW development environment to illustrate a variety of techniques in the field of wireless phone games.

The written biblical text records at length, and in minute detail, the religious and national history of the Jewish people. Yet it only affords us a mere glimpse of the private and intimate lives of these strong and prophetic women. On the surface, these women--the biblical matriarchs--lived difficult and flawed lives. They endured childlessness, abduction, wearisome marriages, envy of the other woman, and difficult children. We are left wondering what they thought and how they felt, as they lived their personal lives and built a nation. This book, for the first time ever, answers these questions by drawing extensively upon classical biblical commentaries and Talmudic and Rabbinic writings which reveal the underlying emotions of the matriarchs. The reader enters the world of the matriarchs, experiencing the agony of infertility, the ecstasy of passionate love, and the pain of being unloved. Their thoughts, feelings, words and actions are fleshed out, and the women emerge not as one-dimensional figures, but as complex women possessing an array of universal passions. At the same time, these women remain grounded in Godliness, building the House of Israel as partners with the patriarchs. The Passions of the Matriarchs is a riveting and readable book that tells the story behind the passions that ruled the lives of these laudable women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ozDS55z_ciIC&dq=The+Passions+Of+The+Matriarchs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illustrated Elements of Alexander Technique (The Illustrated Elements of...)","description":"This is a practical programme for health, poise and fitness.

The novels that followed established her as a master of Southern Gothic. This Library of America volume collects McCullers s complete novels for the first time in a single-volume edition that reveals the power and breadth of her haunting vision.  McCullers s gift,  writes Joyce Carol Oates,  was to evoke, through an accumulation of images and musically repeated phrases, the singularity of experience, not to pass judgment on it.  McCullers effortlessly conveyed the raw anguish of her characters and the weird beauty of their perceptions. Set in small Georgia towns that are at once precisely observed and mythically resonant, McCullers s novels explore the strange, sometimes grotesque inner lives of characters who are often marginal and misunderstood. Above all, McCullers possessed an unmatched ability to capture the bewilderment and fragile wonder of adolescence. In The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1940), one of the most extraordinary debuts in modern American literature, an enigmatic deaf-mute draws out the haunted confessions of an itinerant worker, a young girl, a doctor, and a widowed owner of a small-town caf . The disfiguring violence of desire is explored with shocking intensity in two shorter works, Reflections in a Golden Eye (1941) and The Ballad of the Sad Caf  (1943). The Member of the Wedding (1946), thought by many to be McCullers s masterpiece, hauntingly depicts a young girl s fascination with her brother s wedding. In 13-year-old Frankie Addams, confused, easily wounded, yet determined to survive, McCullers created her most indelible protagonist. Clock Without Hands (1960), her final novel, was completed against great odds in the midst of tremendous physical suffering. Set against the background of court-ordered school integration, it contains some of McCullers s most forceful social criticism.

The catalogue presents the collection of Egyptian provincial coins, collected by ing. Lubo? Kr l, a long-standing member of the Czech Numismatic Society. In total, 584 coins is represented in this volume including a small quantity of duplicates (always stuck from different dies). The core of the collection consists of Alexandrian issues; coins of the Egyptian nomes, which are quite rare, are represented by mere two specimens (nos. 583584). The collection documents the coin production in Egypt from the time of Augustus till the end of the provincial mint in 295/6. The basic criteria for incorporation into the collection have been the quality and good state of preservation of the numismatic material allowing its further classification. The presence of coins of particular rulers reflects their occurrence on the numismatic market as well as different volume of mint production. It is most apparent in the case of coinage from Augustus to Caligula and later of Marcus Aurelius and especially Septimius Severus and Caracalla, showing considerable decline. The core of the collection (almost 65%) consists of 3rd century coins from Elagabal till the rulers of the first Tetrarchy.

A Clean, Well-Lighted Place  is about an old Spanish Beggar.  Homage to Switzerland  concerns various conversations at a Swiss railway-station restaurant.  The Gambler, the Nun, and the Radio  is laid in the accident ward of a hospital in Western United States, and so on. Ernest Hemingway made his literary start as a short-story writer.

Beeton wrote,  As with the commander of an army, or the leader of any enterprise, so is it with the mistress of a house.  Running an extravagant household was a monumental task and a responsibility not to be taken lightly. It meant supervising every employee, from the butler to the laundry-maid to the footman and the wet nurse. It meant managing the safety, happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family. In addition to offering advice on a wide range of domestic topics, this abridged edition of Mrs. Beeton s Book of Household Management contains hundreds of original recipes. A compendium of practical information about everything from animal husbandry to child care, this Victorian classic is both fascinating and still useful. Sarah A. Chrisman, author of Victorian Secrets and This Victorian Life provides the foreword, reflecting on how she uses Mrs. Beeton s advice on a daily basis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cjyFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The keeper of the door,","description":"This book is part of the TREDITION CLASSICS series.

The short answer is it's not what teachers do, it's what they understand. Lesson plans and lecture notes matter less than the special way teachers comprehend the subject and value human learning. Whether historians or physicists, in El Paso or St. Paul, the best teachers know their subjects inside and out but they also know how to engage and challenge students and to provoke impassioned responses. Most of all, they believe two things fervently: that teaching matters and that students can learn.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=noPWDwAAQBAJ&dq=What+the+Best+College+Teachers+Do&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Messerschmitt Bf 109 (Combat Legends)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lt4JAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visual Basic Professional 3.0 Programming (Wiley-Qed Enterprise Computing)","description":"A book for BASICA and GW-Basic programmers who want to make Windows applications, and for users who have used Windows programs and want to write their own programs.

Each of us will face some loss, sorrow and disappointment in our lives, and The Courage to Grieve provides the specific help we need to enable us to face our grief fully and to recover and grow from the experience. Although the book emphasizes the response to the death of a loved one, The Courage to Grieve can help with every kind of loss and grief. Judy Tatelbaum gives us a fresh look at understanding grief, showing us that grief is a natural, inevitable human experience, including all the unexpected, intense and uncomfortable emotions like sorrow, guilt, loneliness, resentment, confusion, or even the temporary loss of the will to live. The emphasis is to clarify and offer help, and the tone is spiritual, optimistic, creative and easy to understand. Judy Tatelbaum provides excellent advice on how to help oneself and others get through the immediate experience of death and the grief that follows, as well as how to understand the special grief of children. Particularly useful are the techniques for completing or \\"finishing\\" grief--counteracting the popular misconception that grief never ends. The Courage to Grieve shows us how to live life with the ultimate courage: not fearing death. This book is about so much more than death and grieving it is about life and joy and growth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fjq4ioo3_wcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Parenting Bible New International Version","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ykMpAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Parenting+Bible+New+International+Version&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little less -","description":"After his father s sudden death, a college student seeks revenge Ladd Cunningham never felt comfortable in his father s office.

The Rock from Mars is the story of how two planets and the spheres of politics and science all collided at the end of the twentieth century. It began sixteen million years ago. An asteroid crashing into Mars sent fragments flying into space and, eons later, one was pulled by the Earth s gravity onto an icy wilderness near the southern pole. There, in 1984, a geologist named Roberta Score spotted it, launching it on a roundabout path to fame and controversy. In its new home at NASA s Johnson Space Center in Houston, the rock languished on a shelf for nine years, a victim of mistaken identity. Then, in 1993, the geochemist Donald  Duck  Mittlefehldt, unmasked the rock as a Martian meteorite. Before long, specialist Chris Romanek detected signs of once-living organisms on the meteorite. And the obscure rock became a rock star. But how did nine respected investigators come to make such startling claims about the rock that they triggered one of the most venomous scientific battles in modern memory? The narrative traces the steps that led to this risky move and follows the rippling impact on the scientists  lives, the future of space exploration, the search for life on Mars, and the struggle to understand the origins of life on Earth. From the second the story broke in Science magazine in 1996, it spawned waves of excitement, envy, competitive zeal, and calculation. In academia, in government agencies, in laboratories around the world, and even in the Oval Officewhere an inquisitive President Clinton had received the news in secret players of all kinds plotted their next moves. Among them: David McKay, the dynamic geologist associated with the first moon landing, who labored to achieve at long last a second success; Bill Schopf of UCLA, a researcher determined to remain at the top of his field and the first to challenge McKay s claims; Dan Goldin, the boss of NASA; and Dick Morris, the controversial presidential adviser who wanted to use the story for Clinton s reelection and unfortunately made sure it ended up in the diary of a $200-an-hour call girl. Impeccably researched and thrillingly involving, Kathy Sawyer s The Rock from Mars is an exemplary work of modern nonfiction, a vivid account of the all-too-human high-stakes drive to learn our true place in the cosmic scheme.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nQzR6MBmG7AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Princess: A True Story Of Life Behind The Veil In Saudi Arabia (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"Historische analyse van de oorzaken van de westerse superioriteit ten opzichte van de rest van de wereld op uiteenlopende gebieden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b4n1ygAACAAJ&dq=Princess:+A+True+Story+Of+Life+Behind+The+Veil+In+Saudi+Arabia+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Light for My Love (SIGNED)","description":"Reproduction of the original: Signing the Contract and What It Cost by Martha Finley","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xfn0DwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Light+for+My+Love+(SIGNED)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Guide Biology Concepts /Campbell","description":"Students can master key concepts and earn a better grade with the thought-provoking exercises found in this study guide.

Space tourism is not science fiction anymore, Michel van Pelt tells us, but merely a logical step in the evolution of space flight. Space is about to be opened up to more and more people, and the drive behind this is one of the most powerful economic forces: tourism. Van Pelt describes what recreational space travel might look like, and explains the required space technology, the medical issues, astronaut training, and the possibilities of holidays to destinations far, far away. This is a book for everyone who has ever dreamed of traveling to space: a dream which, according to van Pelt, may not be so far from becoming a reality.

He is given minimal aid by the governor of the vast territory that is proudly named New France but is in reality still ruled by the Huron, Iroquois, and Algonkin tribes who have roamed it since the dawn of time and whom the French call Savages. His mission is to reach and bring salvation to an isolatied Huron tribe decimated by disease in the far north before incoming winter closes off his path to them. His guides are a group of Savages who mock his faith and their pledges even as they accept muskets as their payment. Father Laforgue is about to enter a world of pagan power and sexual license, awesome courage and terrible cruelty, that will test him to the breaking point as both a man and a priest, and alter him in ways he cannot dream. In weaving a tautly suspenseful tale of physical and spiritual adventure in a wilderness frontier on the cusp of change, Brian Moore has written a novel that rivals Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness in its exploration of the confrontation between Western ideology and native peoples, and its meditation upon Good and Evil in the human heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5qBPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Black+Robe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Remember Pasta: A Celebration of Food, Family and Friends","description":"The author shares memories from her stage career and family life and provides recipes for breakfasts, lunches, pasta dishes, sauces, salads, and desserts","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bPSn-0-p4dUC&dq=I+Remember+Pasta:+A+Celebration+of+Food,+Family+and+Friends&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pistols for Two","description":"\\"In eleven charming short stories, the Queen of Regency romance presents an exquisite romp through affairs of honor and affairs of the heart.

Henry Carleton's Prairie Logbooks describe two different military expeditions into the barely explored territories of the West. The first expedition, involving fourteen officers, five companies of cavalry, fifteen supply wagons and teamsters, and two brass howitzers, went deep into Nebraska Territory to put down warfare between the Pawnees and the Sioux. The second, under the command of Stephen Watts Kearny, was sent to escort emigrants on the Oregon Trail as far as South Pass and to reconnoitre the Santa Fe Trail, the key land of commerce between Mexico and the United States. Carleton (well known for his later campaign against the Navajos and Mescalero Apaches) wished to \\"take his reader along on the campaign\\" and did so meticulously describing every important detail, and by sticking to the facts.

Nora Kelly, a young curator at the Santa Fe Institute of Archaeology, is approached by historian Clive Benton with a once-in-a-lifetime proposal: to lead a team in search of the so-called 'Lost Camp' of the tragic Donner Party. This was a group of pioneers who earned a terrible place in American history when they became snow-bound in the California mountains in 1847, their fate unknown until the first skeletonized survivors stumbled out of the wilderness, raving about starvation, murder-and cannibalism. Benton tells Kelly he has stumbled upon an amazing find: the long-sought diary of one of the victims, which has an enigmatic description of the Lost Camp. Nora agrees to lead an expedition to locate and excavate it  to reveal its long-buried secrets. Once in the mountains, however, they learn that discovering the camp is only the first step in a mounting journey of fear. For as they uncover old bones, they expose the real truth of what happened, one that is far more shocking and bizarre than mere cannibalism. And when those ancient horrors lead to present-day violence on a grand scale, rookie FBI agent Corrie Swanson is assigned the case... only to find that her first investigation might very well be her last.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ESadDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jean-Honore Fragonard (Masters of Art)","description":"The leading exponent of the Rococo style, Jean-Honor  Fragonard s paintings are characterised by remarkable facility, exuberance and frivolous hedonism.

One of the most vivid, influential, and controversial figures of the founding of America, Hamilton was an unusually prolific and vigorous writer. As a military aide to George Washington, critic of the Articles of Confederation, proponent of ratification of the Constitution, first Secretary of the Treasury, and leader of the Federalist Party, Hamilton devoted himself to the creation of a militarily and economically powerful American nation guided by a strong, energetic republican government. His public and private writings demonstrate the perceptive intelligence, confident advocacy, driving ambition, and profound concern for honor and reputation that contributed both to his astonishing rise to fame and to his tragic early death. Arranged chronologically, this volume contains more than 170 letters, speeches, pamphlets, essays, reports, and memoranda written between 1769 and 1804. Included are all fifty-one of Hamilton s contributions to The Federalist, as well as subsequent writings calling for a broad construction of federal power; his famous speech to the Constitutional Convention, which gave rise to accusations that he favored monarchy; and early writings supporting the Revolutionary cause and a stronger central government. His detailed reports as Secretary of the Treasury on the public credit, a national bank, and the encouragement of manufactures present a forward-looking vision of a country transformed by the power of financial markets, centralized banking, and industrial development. Hamilton s sometimes flawed political judgment is revealed in the  Reynolds Pamphlet,  in which he confessed to adultery in order to defend himself against accusations of corrupt conduct, as well as in his self-destructive pamphlet attack on John Adams during the 1800 presidential campaign. An extensive selection of private letters illuminates Hamilton s complex relationship with George Washington, his deep affection for his wife and children, his mounting fears during the 1790s regarding the Jeffersonian opposition and the French Revolution, and his profound distrust of Aaron Burr.

In fact, it can be more conservative than simply owning stocks alone. And the good news is that this strategy works best during slow growth, flat or even slightly declining markets.This book fully stands on its own merits, but it can also be viewed as a companion text to ?Covered Call Writing Demystified? (see the book description on Amazon.com for more information). Hence the similarity in name. These are the reasons:* Put option writing and covered call writing have essentially the same reward and risk characteristics?When used as outlined in the book, they are very conservative (unlike other uses of options)* Investors using covered call writing will find opportunities to use put option writing to achieve similar double-digit investment results, but also to have the opportunity to purchase stocks or Exchange Traded Funds at a discount from their present value.* The put option writing and covered call writing strategies can both be used within the same portfolio to achieve similar results by differing means, depending on the investor?s objectives regarding the individual stock or ETF in question.What is put option writing? Have you been tempted at times to buy a particular stock, but decided not to take the plunge because you thought it might be overpriced?or, just on a hunch, you thought you might be able to pick up the shares at a lower price? Not only might it be possible for you to buy that stock for less, but what if someone were willing to pay you cash today at a double-digit return rate and also give you the opportunity to buy it at a lower price later? Does that sound too good to be true? It?s not. It?s called ?put option writing,? and it?s available to you on literally thousands of stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Put option writing can be compared with placing a limit order to buy the stock or ETF of your choice at a lower price that you set?and then being paid for it. And, you get paid whether the stock falls to your price or not!?Put Option Writing Demystified? is totally focused on providing (1) the education you need to fully understand the concepts behind put option writing and (2) a unique easy-to-follow program so that you can implement the strategy yourself without the help of a full-service broker or investment manager.The book delves deeply into the subject of how to obtain double-digit returns from both out-of-the-money puts and in-the-money puts, with out-of-the money puts being the principal recommended strategy both for realizing the opportunity to achieve consistent double-digit investment returns while you wait to acquire stocks or ETFs of your choice at a discount to their present market value. It also provides short-term technical analysis tools to assist in guiding market forecasts and making even more profitable put writing decisions.On May 3, 2003 after the annual meeting of his company, Warren Buffett (Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway) said to Maria Bartiromo of CNBC: ?If you own equities, over the next twenty or thirty years you?ll get a reasonable return?maybe its 6%, maybe its 7%. People who expect 15% a year are doomed to disappointment.? If you believe that ?The Oracle of Omaha? is right about a slow-growth market for decades to come, then everything that you need as an investor is here for you in this book to develop and implement a put option writing program that will help you achieve double-digit returns.In addition to presenting everything you need to know about put option writing and how to implement your own personal put writing program the book provides:* Use of a uniquely designed Microsoft? Excel spreadsheet for put writing to assist in reviewing writing selection alternatives so that the best decisions for you are reached to achieve your investment return goal.* Details about brokerage accounts, with special emphasis on the use of online discount brokerages for quick, very low cost execution of trades. Web sites for brokerages, charting sources and other technical information are provided.* Tax information you need for understanding and administering the income tax aspects of put option writing.

They have \\"contextual intelligence\\" a profound ability to understand the Zeitgeist of their times and harness it to create successful organizations. Based on a comprehensive Harvard Business School Leadership Initiative study, Anthony J. Mayo and Nitin Nohria present a fascinating collection of stories of the 20th century's greatest leaders, from unsung heroes to legends like Sam Walton and Bill Gates. The book identifies three distinct paths these individuals followed to greatness: entrepreneurial innovation, savvy management, and transformational leadership. Through engaging stories of leaders in each category, the authors show how, by \\"reading\\" the context they operated in and embracing the opportunities their times presented, these individuals created, grew, or revitalized outstanding American enterprises. A canon of leadership success from the last century, In Their Time reveals insights for contemporary leaders hoping to build lasting legacies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VkkxCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Have Capture","description":"What an amazing career. Tom Stafford attained the highest speed ever reached by a test pilot (28,547 mph), carried a cosmonaut s coffin with Soviet Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, led the team that designed the sequence of missions leading to the original lunar landing, and drafted the original specifications for the B-2 stealth bomber on a piece of hotel stationery. But his crowning achievement was surely his role as America s unofficial space ambassador to the Soviet Union during the darkest days of the Cold War. In this lively memoir written with Michael Cassutt, Stafford begins by recounting his early successes as a test pilot, Gemini and Apollo astronaut, and USAF general. As President Nixon's stand-in at the 1971 Soviet funeral for three cosmonauts, he opened the door to the possibility of cooperation in space between Russians and Americans. Stafford's Apollo-Soyuz team was the first group of Americans to work at the cosmonaut training center, and also the first to visit Baikonur, the top-secret Soviet launch center, in 1974. His 17 July 1975  handshake in space  with Soviet commander Alexei Leonov (who became a lifelong friend) proved to the world that the two opposing countries could indeed work successfully together. Stafford has continued in this leadership role right up to the present, participating in designing and evaluating the Space Shuttle, Mir, and the International Space Station. He is truly an American hero who personifies the broadest spirit of exploration and cooperation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BqdqBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Putsch!","description":"The rudimentary facts of the Beer Hall Putsch are well known.

In twenty years of raw and raucous celebrity profiles Irreverently bold journalist Bill Zehme has long been celebrated for his ability to get under the skins of our most elusive icons, from the evasive Warren Beatty to the ever-unpredictable Madonna to the much misunderstood Barry Manilow. Now his most provocative work is collected for the first time, with over twenty-five landmark profiles, including Frank Sinatra, Tom Hanks, Jerry Seinfeld, Liberace, Howard Stern, Eddie Murphy, and Woody Allen. Zehme witnesses Hugh Hefner withstanding the single blow that never entered into an adolescent boy s dreams--losing his fantasy woman. He gets a nude massage with Sharon Stone, and an earful about men, sex, and the shotgun she keeps under her bed. Included, too, is Zehme s exclusive firsthand coverage of David Letterman and Jay Leno, before and throughout their late-night feud. Here is entertainment history through the eyes of a man the Chicago Tribune called  one of the most successful and prolific magazine writers in the country.

Everything that the text has to offer can only be understood and appreciated to the full, and its interpretation can only lay claim to full validity by means of an integral view. Therefore the author has developed a textual model which regards and covers the composition of the Samuel books as a hierarchy of twelve levels. This is the fourth and final volume of the author's integrative reading of the Samuel material in its entirety. Vow and Desire turns to the beginning of First Samuel and describes chapters 1-12. They contain the thematic basis of the whole composition by relating the crucial transition between two periods. The Judges period, represented by Eli and Samuel, is drawing to a close and the new order shows us the prophet Samuel who finds himself forced to anoint Saul as king, and thus to inaugurate the monarchy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yKOODwAAQBAJ&dq=Narrative+Art+and+Poetry+in+the+Books+of+Samuel:+Vow+and+Desire+:+(Narrative+Art+and+Poetry+in+the+Books+of+Samuel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beginning Your Family History in Great Britain 7th ed.","description":"Ancestry magazine focuses on genealogy for today s family historian, with tips for using Ancestry.com, advice from family history experts, and success stories from genealogists across the globe.

Dubbed  Silicon Wadi,  Israel ranks third in the World Economic Forum Innovation Rating. Despite its small size, it attracts more venture capital per capita than any other country on the planet. What factors have led to these remarkable achievements, and what secrets do Israeli tech entrepreneurs know that others can learn? Tech insider Inbal Arieli goes against the common belief that Israel s outstanding economic accomplishments are the byproduct of its technologically advanced military or the result of long-standing Jewish traditions of study and questioning. Rather, Arieli gives credit to the unique way Israelis are raised in a culture that supports creative thinking and risk taking. Growing up within a tribal-like community, Israelis experience childhoods purposely shaped by challenges and risks in a culture that encourages and rewards chutzpah. This has helped Israelis develop the courage to pursue unorthodox, and often revolutionary, approaches to change and innovation and is the secret behind the country s economic success. While chutzpah has given generations of Israelis the courage to break away from conventional thinking, the Israeli concept balagan messiness in Hebrew is at the root of how Israelis are taught to interact with the world. Instead of following strict rules, balagan fosters ambiguity, encouraging the development of the skills necessary for dealing with the unpredictability of life and business. Living with balagan provides Israelis with the opportunity to constantly practice the soft skills defined by the World Economic Forum as the Skills for the Future, as balagan promotes creativity, problem-solving, and independence key characteristics of successful entrepreneurs. By revealing the unique ways in which Israelis parent, educate and acculturate, Chutzpah offers invaluable insights and proven strategies for success to aspiring entrepreneurs, parents, executives, innovators, and policymakers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vb16DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jane Austen and her times,","description":"With scant information available on their hero, Jane Austen's devoted fans have a bottomless hunger for details about the woman behind the work.

Rubbing two sticks together produces heat and light; one stick alone is just a stick. In both cases, it is friction that produces movement, action, effect. Challenging the widespread view that globalization invariably signifies a \\"clash\\" of cultures, anthropologist Anna Tsing here develops friction in its place as a metaphor for the diverse and conflicting social interactions that make up our contemporary world. She focuses on one particular \\"zone of awkward engagement\\"--the rainforests of Indonesia--where in the 1980s and the 1990s capitalist interests increasingly reshaped the landscape not so much through corporate design as through awkward chains of legal and illegal entrepreneurs that wrested the land from previous claimants, creating resources for distant markets. In response, environmental movements arose to defend the rainforests and the communities of people who live in them. Not confined to a village, a province, or a nation, the social drama of the Indonesian rainforest includes local and national environmentalists, international science, North American investors, advocates for Brazilian rubber tappers, UN funding agencies, mountaineers, village elders, and urban students, among others--all combining in unpredictable, messy misunderstandings, but misunderstandings that sometimes work out. Providing a portfolio of methods to study global interconnections, Tsing shows how curious and creative cultural differences are in the grip of worldly encounter, and how much is overlooked in contemporary theories of the global.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pCwEA1A_XPcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winter Poems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S-D1xX2AHxYC&dq=Winter+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harmonic analysis and the theory of probability (California monographs in mathematical sciences)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LfhvAAAAIAAJ&dq=Harmonic+analysis+and+the+theory+of+probability+(California+monographs+in+mathematical+sciences)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ask Somebody","description":"Schuyler Sweet is anything but.

Liv, a Canadian filmmaker, is writing from a Tahitian jail, piecing together her troubled past and her family's buried history for the unknown daughter she gave up at birth. The search for her own father, a pilot missing since the Korean War, has brought her to the South Seas and landed her behind bars on a trumped-up murder charge. In the stillness of her cell, Liv ponders the secret journal of her ancestor Frank Henderson, who came to these same waters a century before on an extraordinary three-year voyage with Queen Victoria's grandsons--Prince George (later George V) and Prince Eddy, who would die young and disgraced, linked by the gutter press to the Ripper killings and many other scandals. Through unforgettable characters and a mesmerizing story, Henderson's Spear traces two tales of obsession, intrigue, and loss--from the 1890s and the 1990s. These stories reach around the world from Africa, England, and North America to converge with compelling effect in the Polynesian islands. With a deep understanding of the landscape and culture of the South Sea Islands, Ronald Wright's Henderson's Spear explores the patterns of history and the accidents of love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cx84AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"the day the teacher went bananas","description":"A class's new teacher, who leads the children in a number of very popular activities, turns out to be a gorilla.

In The Beginnings of Western Science, David C. Lindberg provides a rich chronicle of the development of scientific ideas, practices, and institutions from the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers to the late-medieval scholastics. Lindberg surveys all the most important themes in the history of ancient and medieval science, including developments in cosmology, astronomy, mechanics, optics, alchemy, natural history, and medicine. He synthesizes a wealth of information in superbly organized, clearly written chapters designed to serve students, scholars, and nonspecialists alike. In addition, Lindberg offers an illuminating account of the transmission of Greek science to medieval Islam and subsequently to medieval Europe. And throughout the book he pays close attention to the cultural and institutional contexts within which scientific knowledge was created and disseminated and to the ways in which the content and practice of science were influenced by interaction with philosophy and religion. Carefully selected maps, drawings, and photographs complement the text. Lindberg's story rests on a large body of important scholarship produced by historians of science, philosophy, and religion over the past few decades. However, Lindberg does not hesitate to offer new interpretations and to hazard fresh judgments aimed at resolving long-standing historical disputes. Addressed to the general educated reader as well as to students, his book will also appeal to any scholar whose interests touch on the history of the scientific enterprise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fevstAEACAAJ&dq=Beginnings+of+Western+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Festival in My Heart: Poems by Japanese Children","description":"A illustrated collection of poetry written by Japanese elementary school children that provides a portrait of an often mysterious and elusive culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MDsNAQAAMAAJ&dq=Festival+in+My+Heart:+Poems+by+Japanese+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood-Red Rivers","description":"Pierre Niemans and Karim Abdouf, two highly uncoventional policmen, join forces to solve murders in the French Alps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NQesAAAACAAJ&dq=Blood-Red+Rivers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peacock Pie","description":"The perfect gift for children aged 8+, this stunning classic collection of poetry will delight a new generation of readers of the Faber Children's Classics list.

In addition, the name John Ford was practically synonymous with the great Westerns that came out of Hollywood for many years-- Stagecoach (1939), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), Rio Grande (1950), The Searchers (1956), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), for example. After his death a European newspaper mourned ford as \\"the creator of the Western,\\" although many of his finest films were far removed from that genre. Combining interviews with John Ford with his own reflections, director Peter Bogdanovich captures both the artist and the man in a highly readable, compact book that will please film lovers and Ford admirers alike.

In the 1940s, children huddled to glean from their elders tales of woe and whimsy, and breathless were they who listened, gleaning what they could and learning what they chose from mistakes made long ago. Judas in Kilkenny is the true story of one woman's coming of age in the Marble City. A young Theresa Lennon must put aside her childhood dreams in order to strive for peace in her tumultuous home life, and fight for her own independence, while trying to hide the secrets of a family headed for destruction.

In Adult Bullying, psychologist Peter Randall uses the voices of both bullies and victims to reveal the misery that many adults endure. He describes the processes that turn child bullies into adult bullies, often aware of their behaviour but unable to stop it. The workplace and the neighbourhood replace the playground, but the tactics and patterns of reward remain the same. The adult victim has little or no more power than the child counterpart, often changing jobs to escape the attentions of the bully. Similarly, managers like teachers, often fail to tackle the complaints of the victim with the seriousness the problem deserves, preferring to believe that the fuss is unwarranted. Adult Bullying will be welcomed by managers, counsellors, social workers and anyone who has experienced personal harrassment.

And how did their anger affect the quality of the democratic systems that have emerged? Poland offers a particularly provocative case, for it was here where workers most famously seemed to have won, thanks to the role of the Solidarity trade union. And yet, within a few short years, they had clearly lost. An oppressive communist regime gave way to a capitalist society that embraced economic and political inequality, leaving many workers frustrated and angry. Their leaders first ignored them, then began to fear them, and finally tried to marginalize them. In turn, workers rejected their liberal leaders, opening the way for right-wing nationalists to take control of Solidarity. Ost tells a fascinating story about the evolution of postcommunist society in Eastern Europe. Informed by years of fieldwork in Polish factory towns, scores of interviews with workers, labor activists, and politicians, and an exhaustive reading of primary sources, his new book gives voice to those who have not been heard. But even more, Ost proposes a novel theory about the role of anger in politics to show why such voices matter, and how they profoundly affect political outcomes. Drawing on Poland's experiences, Ost describes lessons relevant to democratization throughout Eastern Europe and to democratic theory in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b6JhDwAAQBAJ&dq=Defeat+of+Solidarity:+Anger+and+Politics+in+Postcommunist+Europe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Word Origins - A History of the Words, Expressions, and Cliches We Use","description":"This dictionary gives the intriguing origins of hundreds of everyday words and expressions.

S. Eliot's bold claim. John Scott offers readers at all levels a critical overview of Dante's writings: five chapters deal with his New Life of love and poetry (Vita Nova), the Banquet of knowledge (Convivio), his Latin treatise on language and poetics (De Vulgari Eloquentia), Italian lyrics (Rime), and his blueprint for world government (Monarchia). The next five chapters concentrate on Dante's masterpiece, the Comedy: its structure, Dante's worldview (still relevant today), and the Comedy examined as a poem. Much has been written on Dante's moral, political, and religious ideas; important as these are, however, such discussions are perforce limited. It is above all as a work of poetry that the Divine Comedy maintains its appeal and fascination to readers of all backgrounds and beliefs. /// Firmly grounded in the latest advances of Dante scholarship, Understanding Dante offers an original and uniquely detailed, global analysis of Dante as poet of the Comedy that will be welcomed by those who read the poem in translation as well as by those who study the original Italian text. At the same time, Scott's book will be welcome for its rich and insightful analysis of the whole corpus of Dante's writings, as well as Scott's mastery of the vast sea of critical literature in various languages. Scott bridges the gap that often exists between Dante studies in English-speaking countries and the great tradition of Dante scholarship in the poet's homeland. No work in English about the great Italian poet can rival Understanding Dante's scope in both depth and breadth of close reading and critical vision.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wzxlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Understanding+Dante+(The+William+and+Katherine+Devers+Series+in+Dante+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A political fable","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KoJRbwAACAAJ&dq=A+political+fable&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Sondheim, Volume 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MoBVzgEACAAJ&dq=All+Sondheim,+Volume+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Representations of Slavery: Race and Ideology in Southern Plantation Museums","description":"How is slavery presented at the public and private plantation museums in the American South, almost 150 years after the Civil War? Jennifer L. Eichstedt and Stephen Small investigated this question in Virginia, Georgia, and Louisiana by touring more than one hundred plantation museums; twenty locations organized and run by African Americans; and eighty general history sites. Their findings indicate that the experience and legacy of slavery is still inadequately presented within the larger discourse surrounding race, racism, and national identity. The vast majority of slavery sites construct narratives of history that valorize a white elite of the pre-emancipation South and trivialize the experience of slavery for both enslaved people and their enslavers. Through systematic analysis of richly textured data, the authors of Representations of Slavery have developed a typology of primary representational/discursive strategies used to discuss slavery and the enslaved. They clearly demonstrate how these strategies are linked to representations and practices in the larger social and political arenas. Eichstedt and Small found counter narratives at sites organized and staffed by African Americans, and a small number of white-organized sites have made efforts to incorporate African American experiences of slavery as part of their presentations. But the predominant framework of the  white-centric exhibition narrative  persists, and the authors draw from contemporary literature on racialization, museums, cultural studies, and collective memory to make a case for public debate and intervention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_OFOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Representations+of+Slavery:+Race+and+Ideology+in+Southern+Plantation+Museums&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Blacks: An African Centered Perspective (3rd Edition)","description":"For courses in Introduction to Psychology, African American Psychology, African American Studies, Multicultural Counseling and Cross Cultural Counseling and Psychotherapy.

Dit rapport werpt licht op deze vragen en geeft aan waarom SOF belangrijker zijn geworden, wat SOF zo speciaal maakt, hoe SOF in verschillende landen georganiseerd zijn, en hoe SOF zich in de toekomst kunnen ontwikkelen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Y0FWCgAAQBAJ&dq=Special+Operations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faithful Followers: Celebrating a Decade of Bon Jovi","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hkvmAAAACAAJ&dq=Faithful+Followers:+Celebrating+a+Decade+of+Bon+Jovi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wizard War (Chronicles of an Age of Darkness 1)","description":"Science fiction constitutes one of the largest and most widely read genres in literature, and this reference provides bibliographical data on some 20,000 science fiction, fantasy, and horror fiction books, as well as nonfiction monographs about the literature.

But in this quest, many companies find themselves focusing on only half of the equation, relentlessly improving their own products and processes, or attempting to please customers at any cost--without a strategy for linking the organization's capabilities and goals with the real needs of its customers. In \\"Delivering Profitable Value,\\" Michael Lanning draws from over twenty-five years' experience and groundbreaking thinking to offer a fundamentally new approach to strategy and performance, showing how any business can transform itself into a value delivery system that consistently and profitably delivers superior experiences to customers.After clearly describing the philosophy of and framework for delivering profitable value, the book presents a comprehensive and practical methodology for its application, illustrated through the successes and failures of such companies as Hewlett-Packard, Glaxo-Wellcome, Southwest Airlines, Chevron, Sony Microsoft, Kodak, Weyerhaeuser, and Proctor & Gamble. Adopting the \\"DPV\\" approach will result in subtle, but profound, changes in the way managers define their businesses, establish success criteria, explore new markets, study and interact with customers, analyze competition, deploy resources, and develop processes and functions.Managers who employ the principles and tools outlined in \\"Delivering Profitable Value\\" will help their organizations: Stop making and selling products and services and start delivering deeply understood and carefully chosen customer experiencesAbandon the internally driven and customer-compelled mindsets and adopt the paradigm of superior value deliveryAvoid the temptation to focus on the most immediate and easily attracted customers and commit to delivering superior value to the most profitable customersGive up on confusing, unactionable market segmentation and learn to identify the best strategic options in the relevant marketsCease listening to customers and master the process of becoming the customerAt its core, \\"Delivering Profitable Value\\" is about the creative relationship between an organization and its customers. Michael Lanning's landmark book provides a tested method for establishing and nurturing those relationships, and capturing the profitable growth that results.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I1diQgAACAAJ&dq=Delivering+Profitable+Value:+A+Revolutionary+Framework+To+Accelerate+Growth,+Generate+Wealth,+And+Rediscover+The+Heart+Of+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crustacean Nervous System","description":"Crustacean preparations have been successfully used for more than 50 years to investigate the principles which enable nerve cells and neural circuitry to perform in a wide variety of functions. The proud record of information of general significance obtained from crayfish and lobster nervous systems testifies that the use of an experimental system precisely matching theoretical and experimental requirements ofa measurement is an essential part of the success. In some respects, the secondarily diversified vertebrate and mammalian nervous systems pose severe obstacles to experimentation and measurement, whereas the crustacean nervous system recommends itself by being composed of individual neurons of unique morphology and physiology, which can be used repeatedly in several preparations. Moreover, a restricted number of invariantly displayed behaviors enable the experimenter to correlate neuron activity with parts of the behavior easier. Experts use these advantages to focus on a well-defined neuron and mechanism and to take a convincing measurement within a minimum amount oftime. In this book distinguished neurobiologists, the leading experts in the field, have joined efforts to present research using crustacean experimental systems. Thus they have contributed comprehensive information regarding a nervous system other than that ofvertebrates and mammalians, that ofcrustaceans. The accumulated knowledge on the crustacean nervous system shows that it is clearly divergent in evolution but functions in a similar way to neuronal circuitry found in the vertebrate system and can be used to interpret it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ACXyCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prescription for Living","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Wjy1mAEACAAJ&dq=Prescription+for+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Bible Stories about Jesus","description":"Collects biblical stories for infants and toddlers that teach about Jesus Christ.

Physicist, historian of science, and tireless sleuth, Gingerich is internationally respected for his rigorous scholarship and well-known for his challenging views. His work has had a profound effect on the history of science, disputing prevalent notions of the Copernican revolution, revising interpretations of Kepler's work, and redefining Newton. The Eye of Heaven: Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler is a provocative Gingerich collection, focusing on the transformation of astronomy from Ptolemy's geocentrism to Kepler's remolding of Copernican cosmology. In 25 bracing essays, it uncovers the subtle and surprising ways in which raw data, interpretation, and creativity propel science. Several of Gingerich's favorite themes are illuminated: the importance of historical context, the careful examination of scientific work habits, and the role of creativity and artistry in science. Did Ptolemy fake his data or merely, as many other scientists have done, mold them into a consistent form without intent to deceive? Was Copernicus's heliocentrism an inevitable response to crisis-ridden Ptolemaic cosmology, or was it an original, unexpected leap of imagination? Are scientific discoveries merely the unveiling of physical reality, or are they more akin to artists' creativity? The Eye of Heaven: Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler includes Gingerich's influential essay on crisis versus aesthetic in the Copernican revolution, a thought-provoking look at Newton's Principia as a work of art, and one of Gingerich's most popular pieces, \\"The Computer versus Kepler,\\" in which an IBM 7094 handles in seconds a computational problem that occupied the German astronomer for years. Here is science history at its best: astute detective work that demolishes popular notions, sensitivity to context and personality, meticulous scholarship, and elegant writing. In short, classic Gingerich.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h6XuAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Eye+of+Heaven:+Ptolemy,+Copernicus,+Kepler+(Masters+of+Modern+Physics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Curse of the Raven Mocker","description":"After her parents disappear from their isolated home in the Great Smoky Mountains, Adanta discovers the truth of the Cherokee stories her father told her and embarks on a journey to thwart the sorcery that has claimed her parents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NMdttAqIxeAC&dq=The+Curse+of+the+Raven+Mocker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thinking Like a Therapist: Audiotapes for Improving Clinical Skills","description":"A \\"sink or swim\\" philosophy frequently prevails in mental health settings today.

Voegelin allows us to contemplate the crisis in its starkest terms as the apocalypse of man that now seeks to replace the apocalypse of God. The totalitarian upheaval that convulsed Voegelin's world, and whose aftermath still defines ours, is only the external manifestation of an inner spiritual turmoil. Its roots have been probed throughout the eight volumes of History of Political Ideas, but its emergence is marked by the age of Enlightenment. In our postmodern era, discussions of the collapse of the \\"enlightenment project\\" have become commonplace. Voegelin compels us to follow the great-souled individuals who sought to go from disintegration of the present toward evocations of order for the future. Such thinkers as Comte, Bakunin, and Marx suffered through the crisis and fully understood the need for a new outpouring of the spirit. They resolved to supply the deficiency themselves. As a consequence they launched us irrevocably on the path of the apocalypse of man. One of the great merits of Voegelin's analysis is his exposition of the pervasive character of this crisis. It is not confined to the megalomaniacal dreamers of a revolutionary apocalypse; rather, echoes of it are found in the more moderate Enlightenment preoccupation with progress to be attained through application of the scientific method. Faith in the capacity of instrumental reason to answer the ultimate questions of human existence defined men such as Voltaire, Helv tius, Diderot, D'Alembert, and Condorcet. It remains the authoritative faith of our world today, Voegelin argues, demonstrated by our continuing inability to step outside the parameters of the Enlightenment. Are we condemned, then, to oscillate between the rational incoherence of a science that never delivers on its promises and a now discredited revolutionary idealism that wreaks havoc in practice? This is the question toward which Voegelin's final volume points. While not direct, his response is evident everywhere. Crisis and the Apocalypse of Man could have been written only by a man who had reached his own resolution of the crisis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ix060QZD-fIC&dq=Ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exiles","description":"WINNER OF THE TRILLIUM AWARD An unforgettable saga inspired by true events, The Last Exiles is a searing portrait of a young couple in North Korea and their fight for love and freedom Jin and Suja meet and fall in love while studying at university in Pyongyang.

The Dutch control of the region was short-lived, but had profound effects on the Hudson Valley region. In The Colony of New Netherland, Jaap Jacobs offers a comprehensive history of the Dutch colony on the Hudson from the first trading voyages in the 1610s to 1674, when the Dutch ceded the colony to the English. As Jacobs shows, New Netherland offers a distinctive example of economic colonization and in its social and religious profile represents a noteworthy divergence from the English colonization in North America. Centered around New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan, the colony extended north to present-day Schenectady, New York, east to central Connecticut, and south to the border shared by Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, leaving an indelible imprint on the culture, political geography, and language of the early modern mid-Atlantic region. Dutch colonists' vivid accounts of the land and people of the area shaped European perceptions of this bountiful land; their own activities had a lasting effect on land use and the flora and fauna of New York State, in particular, as well as on relations with the Native people with whom they traded. Sure to become readers' first reference to this crucial phase of American early colonial history, The Colony of New Netherland is a multifaceted and detailed depiction of life in the colony, from exploration and settlement through governance, trade, and agriculture. Jacobs gives a keen sense of the built environment and social relations of the Dutch colonists and closely examines the influence of the church and the social system adapted from that of the Dutch Republic. Although Jacobs focuses his narrative on the realities of quotidian existence in the colony, he considers that way of life in the broader context of the Dutch Atlantic and in comparison to other European settlements in North America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vgnh3E5Mm0cC&dq=New+Netherland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations, 2nd Edition","description":"Students preparing for courses in real analysis often encounter either very exacting theoretical treatments or books without enough rigor to stimulate an in-depth understanding of the subject. Further complicating this, the field has not changed much over the past 150 years, prompting few authors to address the lackluster or overly complex dichotomy existing among the available texts. The enormously popular first edition of Real Analysis and Foundations gave students the appropriate combination of authority, rigor, and readability that made the topic accessible while retaining the strict discourse necessary to advance their understanding. The second edition maintains this feature while further integrating new concepts built on Fourier analysis and ideas about wavelets to indicate their application to the theory of signal processing. The author also introduces relevance to the material and surpasses a purely theoretical treatment by emphasizing the applications of real analysis to concrete engineering problems in higher dimensions. Expanded and updated, this text continues to build upon the foundations of real analysis to present novel applications to ordinary and partial differential equations, elliptic boundary value problems on the disc, and multivariable analysis. These qualities, along with more figures, streamlined proofs, and revamped exercises make this an even more lively and vital text than the popular first edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oWao9tYvYXAC&dq=Foundations,+2nd+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quotations Vietnam: 1945-1970","description":"\\"The quotes selected for this book represent samples of all published viewpoints on the Vietnam conflict.

Focusing on presidents' personae, their messages, and the American public, he explains why presidents are often unable to move public opinion and suggests that their efforts to do so may be counterproductive. Edwards argues that shoring up previously existing support is the principal benefit of going public and that \\"staying private\\" - negotiating quietly with elites - may often be more conducive to a president's legislative success.\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8rYfn5zDBc4C&dq=On+Deaf+Ears:+The+Limits+of+the+Bully+Pulpit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Patient's Sourcebook on Injuries to the Meniscus","description":"Resource added for the Physical Therapist Assistant program 105241.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=paL7xiEPjQoC&dq=The+Official+Patient%27s+Sourcebook+on+Injuries+to+the+Meniscus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theology and the Church","description":"Christopher A.

Why, then, have southerners - and Georgians in particular - clung to the fruit? The Georgia Peach: Culture, Agriculture, and Environment in the American South shows that the peach emerged as a viable commodity at a moment when the South was desperate for a reputation makeover. This agricultural success made the fruit an enduring cultural icon despite the increasing difficulties of growing it.

The interaction between biology and evolution has been the subject of great interest in recent years. The author, Eric Davidson, has been instrumental in elucidating this relationship. He is a world renowned scientist and a major contributor to the field of developmental biology. The Regulatory Genome beautifully explains the control of animal development in terms of structure/function relations of inherited regulatory DNA sequence, and the emergent properties of the gene regulatory networks composed of these sequences. New insights into the mechanisms of body plan evolution are derived from considerations of the consequences of change in developmental gene regulatory networks. Examples of crucial evidence underscore each major concept. The clear writing style explains regulatory causality without requiring a sophisticated background in descriptive developmental biology. This unique text supersedes anything currently available in the market. The only book in the market that is solely devoted to the genomic regulatory code for animal development Written at a conceptual level, including many novel synthetic concepts that ultimately simplify understanding Presents a comprehensive treatment of molecular control elements that determine the function of genes Provides a comparative treatment of development, based on principles rather than description of developmental processes Considers the evolutionary processes in terms of the structural properties of gene regulatory networks Includes 42 full-color descriptive figures and diagrams","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F2ibJj1LHGEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Easy Meals in Minutes: 150 Tasty Recipes in 30 Minutes or Less","description":"Why let hectic work, school and family schedules get in the way of good meals? \\"Easy Meals in Minutes\\" lets you put delicious, satisfying food on the table in 30 minutes or less.

Richard Saunders brings to life this amazing story of revitalization, showing how a combination of creatively structured aid from the public sector and talented private management gave railroads new momentum. By 2002, American railroads carried five times the tonnage they hauled in their former heyday, and they did this with one-tenth of the employees. How did this revolution happen? Saunders shows how limited, disciplined, and politically risky government intervention stabilized a sinking industry. Whatever their results for other industries, President Carter's deregulation and President Reagan's tax revisions restored the railroads' financial health. Container cars and other new technologies also helped to transform inefficient railroads into vibrant enterprises. Corporate strategies varied on the road to success, and even skilled managers encountered pitfalls, but the railroads' resurgence and growth proved to be unstoppable. After the merger mania of the mid-twentieth century, the main U.S. railroad systems evolved into seven transregional corporate giants. Of the \\"Super Seven,\\" only four survived past the 1990s--the Norfolk Southern, CSX, Union Pacific, and Burlington Northern-Santa Fe. These four set the standard at a time when no other major railroads could afford the new technologies needed to turn a profit. A sequel to Merging Lines, this engagingly written account brings the story of American railroads up to the twenty-first century. As American transport enters the twenty-first century, the iron horse that consolidated the Industrial Revolution once again flexes its muscle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YVp2QgAACAAJ&dq=Main+Lines:+Rebirth+of+the+North+American+Railroads,+1970-2002+(Railroads+in+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We learn to share (A tiny doings book)","description":"We Learn To Share A Tiny Doings Book for pre-schoolers, giving them a solid, basic conception of God's love, His creation, and conduct that pleases God.

However, as he was an active participant in the wars and struggles of the period and drew his friends and enemies from all levels of society, it became a vivid and convincing portrait of the manners and morals both of the rulers of the sixteenth century and of their subjects.With enviable powers of invective and an irrepressible sense of humor, reflected in an equally vigorous and extravagant style, Cellini has provided an intriguing and unrivaled glimpse into the palaces and prisons of the Italy of Michelangelo and the Medici.

In the years since the US invasion of Iraq it has become clear that the threat of weapons of mass destruction was not as urgent as the Bush administration presented it and that Saddam Hussein was not involved with either Al Qaeda or 9/11. Many consider the war a mistake and question why Iraq was invaded. A majority of Americans now believe that the public were deliberately misled by the Bush administration in order to bolster support for the war. Public doubt has been strengthened by the growing number of critical scholarly analyses and in-depth journalistic investigations about the invasion that suggest the administration was not candid about its reasons for wanting to take action against Iraq. This volume begins with a survey of private scholarly views about the war s origins, then assesses the current state of debate by organising the best recent thinking by foreign policy and international relations experts on why the US invaded Iraq. The book covers a broad range of approaches to explaining Iraq  the role of the uncertainty of intelligence, cognitive biases, ideas, Israel, and oil, highlighting areas of both agreement and disagreement. This book will be of much interest to students of the Iraq War, US foreign and security policy, strategic studies, Middle Eastern politics and IR/Security Studies in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N2SpAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Irq+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Known: Theology and Experience in George Herbert's Poetry","description":"This book changes the way we read one of the greatest masters of the lyric poem in English. Unlike much recent scholarship on George Herbert, Love Known demonstrates the inseparability of Herbert's theology and poetry. Richard Strier argues persuasively for a strongly Protestant Herbert who shared Luther's sense of the primacy of the doctrine of justification by faith. Cutting across traditional lines, the book is the first sustained study of the theological basis of Herbert's poetry, pointing out connections between Herbert and the Protestant \\"left\\" of his own and the following era. In each chapter, Strier closely analyzes a coherent group of Herbert's lyrics to reveal the theological motives of their movements and design. When placed in a theological context, the poems come into focus in a remarkable way: many hitherto puzzling or unnoticed details are clarified, some neglected poems emerge into prominence, and familiar poems like \\"Love\\" (III) and \\"The Collar\\" take on new cogency. The chapters build on one another , moving from the darker implications of \\"faith alone,\\" the insistence on the pervasiveness of sin and pride, to the comforting implications of the doctrine, the assertion of the possibility of freedom from anxiety, and the defense of individual experience. Love Known thus offers not only a new historical approach to Herbert, but a new appreciation of the relationship between the psychological realism and human appeal of the lyrics and their theological core.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eiliPwAACAAJ&dq=Love+Known:+Theology+and+Experience+in+George+Herbert%27s+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Master the Art of Selling Anything (12 Audiotapes) (The most effective sales training program ever produced!)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BrASAQAAMAAJ&dq=How+to+Master+the+Art+of+Selling+Anything+(12+Audiotapes)+(The+most+effective+sales+training+program+ever+produced!)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legal Feminism: Activism, Lawyering, and Legal Theory","description":"In the late 1970s, feminist scholars and activists joined together to build a movement aimed at bringing feminist theory and experiences to the practice and teaching of American law.

But as this innovative and interdisciplinary book convincingly demonstrates, the scientific examination of beliefs and values now influences research and practice across a range of disciplines. Specifically, this edited volume explores the many cutting edge implications and applications of Equilintegration or EI Theory and the Beliefs, Events, and Values Inventory (BEVI). Grounded in twenty years of research and practice, EI Theory seeks to explain the processes by which beliefs, values, and worldviews are acquired and maintained, why their alteration is resisted, and under what circumstances they are modified. Based upon EI Theory, the BEVI is a comprehensive analytic tool which examines how and why we come to see ourselves, others, and the larger world as we do as well as the influence of such processes on multiple aspects of human functioning. Edited by the developer of the EI model and BEVI method, and informed by contributions from leading U.S. and international scholars, this book features captivating research findings and pioneering practice applications. Research-focused chapters explain how the EI model and BEVI method increase our conceptual sophistication and methodological capacity across a range of areas: Culture, Development, Environment, Gender, Personality, Politics, and Religion. Practice-oriented chapters demonstrate how the BEVI is used in the real world across a range of applied domains: Assessment, Education, Forensics, Leadership, and Psychotherapy. Written in an accessible and engaging manner, this fascinating and timely volume speaks to many of the most pressing issues of our day, by illuminating why we believe what we believe, and demonstrating how our beliefs and values may be assessed, explained, and transformed in the real world. Key Features: Presents an interdisciplinary theoretical model and innovative assessment method derived from two decades of work on the etiology, maintenance, and transformation of beliefs and values Features contributions from leading scholars from the U.S. and internationally, demonstrating the many implications and applications of this cutting edge approach for research and practice Demonstrates the importance of \\"making sense of beliefs and values\\" in addressing many of the most pressing issues of our day","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ck8CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of the Field: On Writing Ethnography (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)","description":"Once upon a time ethnographers returning from the field simply sat down, shuffled their note cards, and wrote up their descriptions of the exotic and quaint customs they had observed. Today scholars in all disciplines are realizing how their research is presented is at least as important as what is presented. Questions of voice, style, and audience--the classic issues of rhetoric--have come to the forefront in academic circles. John Van Maanen, an experienced ethnographer of modern organizational structures, is one who believes that the real work begins when he returns to his office with cartons of notes and tapes. In Tales of the Field he offers readers a survey of the narrative conventions associated with writing about culture and an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various styles. He introduces first the matter-of-fact, realistic report of classical ethnography, then the self-absorbed confessional tale of the participant-observer, and finally the dramatic vignette of the new impressionistic style. He also considers, more briefly, literary tales, jointly told tales, and the theoretically focused formal and critical tales. Van Maanen illustrates his discussion of each style with excerpts from his own work on the police. Tales of the Field offers an informal, readable, and lighthearted treatment of the rhetorical devices used to present the results of fieldwork. Though Van Maanen argues ultimately for the validity of revealing the self while representing a culture, he is sensitive to the differing methods and aims of sociology and anthropology. His goal is not to establish one true way to write ethnography, but rather to make ethnographers of all varieties examine their assumptions about what constitutes a truthful cultural portrait and select consciously and carefully the voice most appropriate for their tales. Written with grace and humor, Tales of the Field will be an invaluable introduction to novices just learning the fieldwork trade and provocative stimulant to veteran ethnographers. \\"Engaging and well written.\\"--H.

M. Montgomery s in her Anne of Green Gable series draws her reader into the richly-textured, rural setting of New Zealand in the mid-20th century. In this first book, young Gabrielle Allan (called Gay) is living contentedly on Drovers Road, her Uncle Dunsany s sheep station in the hill country a hundred miles from Gisborne. Besides her young, bachelor uncle there are her three orphaned cousins Eve, Hugh and Merry and their Great-Aunt Belle. Taken in by Dunsany years before, after her parents  divorce, Gay now scarcely remembers any other life. There are lessons at the local school, taught by pretty, sensible Susan Leigh, regular chores, plenty of riding and jumping, pranks with Merry, unlikely pets and abundant potential for unexpected adventures. Then, everything starts to change. With boarding school suddenly looming on the horizon, Gay and Merry besides hating the idea also begin to realize the expense they are to their uncle. Are they the burden standing in the way of Uncle Dunsany s marriage? Additional unsettling possibilities are added when Gay learns that her father is returning to New Zealand after an absence of many years. Will this mean leaving Drovers Road forever? In a story filled with unforgettable characters (human and otherwise), horse shows and hunts, careless actions and scary consequences, happy (and not-so-happy) romances, young Gabrielle learns something about love and trust through the shared ups and downs of a very human, but also very caring family and extended community. Original Book: 186 pages This is the first book in the Drovers Road Collection. The second book in the series is Cape Lost. The third book in the series is The Golden Country.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MWcNAQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Drovers+Road+Collection:+Three+New+Zealand+Adventures+(Bethlehem+Budget+Bks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Otr Exam Review Manual","description":"Are you a student preparing for the NBCOT exam?

A combined version of these essays, first published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, begins this volume. Because his statement was important and controversial both as a commentary on the history of economic thought and as a theoretical contribution in its own right, the Journal of Political Economy in 1972 presented critical reviews from noted monetary theorists, including Karl Brunner and Allan H.

For most of the twentieth century, states and international society gave priority to a view of order that focused on the minimum conditions for coexistence in a pluralist, conflictual world. Justice was seen either as secondary or sometimes even as a challenge to order. Recent developments have forced a reassessment of this position. Firstly, many trends in the 1990s increased expectations of greater justice within a liberal and liberalizing international order - for example, in relation to human rights, humanitarian intervention, collective security, and self-determination. Second, globalization deepened the sense of ideational and material interdependence, prompting acknowledgement that we co-exist in a single world and that effective solutions to shared problems cannot be achieved without a concern for justice - especially as the negative aspects of globalization have become more evident. Third, claims to justice and critiques of the existing order have been forcefully pressed by an increasing range of non-governmental and other groups within transnational civil society. These three developments suggest movement towards a greater solidarist consciousness and ambition, based primarily on a liberal vision of the relationship between order and justice. This book sets current concerns within a broad historical and theoretical context; explores the depth and scope of this presumed solidarism amidst the difficulties of acting on the basis of a more strongly articulated liberal position; and underscores the complexity and abiding tensions inherent in the relationship between order and justice. Chapters examine a wide range of state and transnational perspectives on order and justice, including those from China, India, Russia, the United States, and the Islamic world. Other chapters investigate how the order-justice relationship is mediated within major international institutions, including the United Nations, the World Trade Organization and the global financial institutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LNBiUVKnJEIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gallery (The Best Book of World War Two Stated Gore Vidal)","description":"Three generations of Gehrons lives are chronicled in this memoir by one of those whose life typified what has come to be known as The Greatest Generation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-Rh2AgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Gallery+(The+Best+Book+of+World+War+Two+Stated+Gore+Vidal)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oil, War, and Anglo-American Relations: American and British Reactions to Mexico's Expropriation of Foreign Oil Properties, 1937-1941 (Contributions in Latin American Studies)","description":"The Mexican expropriation of British and American properties in March 1938 marked the first time any oil-producing country successfully stood up to foreign companies who claimed to own oil properties in that country and who had the support of their respective governments. Although both Washington and London wanted a return to the pre-expropriation status quo, Washington was unwilling to work with London to achieve this goal, and Washington's attitude paralleled its reaction to British efforts to get U.S. support on certain defense issues during this critical period. The resulting Anglo-American strife over how to handle Mexico was also consistent with Anglo-American commercial competition and the oil rivalry in Mexico early in the century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mCJGAAAAYAAJ&dq=Oil,+War,+and+Anglo-American+Relations:+American+and+British+Reactions+to+Mexico%27s+Expropriation+of+Foreign+Oil+Properties,+1937-1941+(Contributions+in+Latin+American+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"European Politics Reconsidered","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jQaJAAAAMAAJ&dq=European+Politics+Reconsidered&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faces of jazz: Ruth Williams photographs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=R4GAGwAACAAJ&dq=Faces+of+jazz:+Ruth+Williams+photographs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A SHORT WALK FROM HARRODS","description":"First published in 1993, A Short Walk from Harrods is volume six of Dirk Bogarde's best-selling memoirs Forced to return to London because of his manager and his partner's rapidly deteriorating health, Bogarde learned to re-adapt to life in the west London neighbourhoods that groomed him as an aspiring young actor. With his fame fading and his descent into old age, the entire process had become rather difficult to endure. He writes of stalking the streets like an 'apologetic turtle' and avoiding society, announcing that he would, from then on, only do 'matinees' because he is too tired to go out in the evenings.

Taken to the public arena, he is faced with two doors, behind one of which is a hungry tiger that will devour him. Behind the other is a beautiful lady-in-waiting, whom he will have to marry, if he opens that door. While the crowd waits anxiously for his decision, he sees the princess among the spectators, who points him to the door on the right. The lover starts to open the door and ... the story ends abruptly there. Did the princess save her love by pointing to the door leading to the lady-in-waiting, or did she prefer to see her lover die rather than see him marry someone else? That quandary has made the story a staple in English classes in American schools, especially since Stockton was careful never to hint at what he thought the ending would be (according to Hiram Collins Haydn in The Thesaurus of Book Digests, ISBN 0-517-00122-5). He also wrote a sequel to the story, \\"The Discourager of Hesitancy.\\" Odin's Library Classics is dedicated to bringing the world the best of humankind's literature from throughout the ages.

Kohn shows point by point the methods by which the Times' mission has been subverted by the present management-routinely slanting the presentation of the facts in leads, headlines, and placement; utilizing polls, labels, and loaded language to convey particular views, not genuine news; and staffing the newsroom with hacks who manipulate information to further a leftist agenda.

Combining a look backward with her own trademark and forward-looking style fresh, simple, and inimitable Foley offers design inspiration for all those who long for a cottage by the sea. Every chapter showcases both the practical design solutions of sailors and sailboats as well as living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and design details that express a nautical style.  Setting Sail  reveals the functional beauty of sailboats and their basic elements wood, cloth, and rope.  Shipshape  demonstrates how onboard necessities such as decks, skylights, bunks, and galleys worked their way into homes on land. In  A Seafaring Legacy,  Foley captures the timeless appeal of such marine details as brass hardware, maps, and weather vanes. Finally,  Coastal Living  explores the allure of lighthouses and boathouses, not only as vernacular architecture but as converted contemporary homes. A resource section provides valuable direction for finding stores, ports of call, and suitable nautical reading. In the first book to examine our sailing heritage in culture and as a lifestyle, Foley has also created a nostalgic wish book and design guide for an enduring approach to everyday living.

Why does adding cheese make a hamburger a cheeseburger whereas adding ketchup does not make it a ketchupburger? By the same token, how do we determine which things said at a meeting should be included in the minutes and which ought to be considered off the record and officially disregarded? In this wide-ranging and provocative book, Eviatar Zerubavel argues that cognitive science cannot answer these questions, since it addresses cognition on only two levels: the individual and the universal. To fill the gap between the Romantic vision of the solitary thinker whose thoughts are the product of unique experience, and the cognitive-psychological view, which revolves around the search for the universal foundations of human cognition, Zerubavel charts an expansive social realm of mind--a domain that focuses on the conventional, normative aspects of the way we think. With witty anecdote and revealing analogy, Zerubavel illuminates the social foundation of mental actions such as perceiving, attending, classifying, remembering, assigning meaning, and reckoning the time. What takes place inside our heads, he reminds us, is deeply affected by our social environments, which are typically groups that are larger than the individual yet considerably smaller than the human race. Thus, we develop a nonuniversal software for thinking as Americans or Chinese, lawyers or teachers, Catholics or Jews, Baby Boomers or Gen-Xers. Zerubavel explores the fascinating ways in which thought communities carve up and classify reality, assign meanings, and perceive things, defamiliarizing in the process many taken-for-granted assumptions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2LFcfUh2Xc0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For Sinners Only","description":"For Sinners Only is finally back in print!

Het bleken profetische woorden. Eind 2008 waren we slechts een paar uur verwijderd van de complete ineenstorting van ons wereldwijde kredietkaartenhuis. In zijn nieuwste boek, De Big Reset: Gold Wars en het financi?le eindspel, beschrijft Middelkoop de historie en problemen van ons huidige financi?le systeem en onthult hoe we voor 2020 zullen overgaan naar een nieuw systeem. Goud heeft als enige valuta de afgelopen eeuwen haar koopkracht behouden. Bankiers proberen de vlucht naar goud al tientallen jaren af te remmen maar lijken deze War on Gold nu te verliezen. - Willem Middelkoop is oprichter van het Commodity Discovery Fund en publicist. Daarnaast is hij een veelgevraagd spreker en columnist. Hij verwierf landelijke bekendheid als marktcommentator bij RTLZ en als regelmatige gast van \\"De Wereld Draait Door\\" en \\"Pauw & Witteman\\".

Speelt hierbij zijn geweten of speelde het geweten van zijn voorgangster een rol? Gezien het bestaan van wetgeving die de Nederlander dwingt om zorgpremie te betalen aan priv?ondernemingen met winstoogmerk, waarbij een deel van de premie automatisch in de zakken verdwijnt van begerige afgedankte politici als, met recht zo genoemd, vorstelijke salarissen, bonussen en ontslagvergoedingen, kan de Nederlandse bevolking terecht aannemen dat het geweten van de Koning bij het tekenen van de wet die dit mogelijk maakte, geen enkele rol speelde. Dat kan ook betekenen dat het, ondanks zijn uitgebreide staf en zijn mogelijkheid om de betrokken minister om uitleg te vragen, pure desinteresse betreft.En daarmee is de status van het Nederlandse staatshoofd niet meer dan het alibi van volksvertegenwoordiging en regering, de regering het alibi van volksvertegenwoordiging en Koning en de volksvertegenwoordiging het alibi van Koning en regering.Terecht mag er gesproken worden van een Alibi Koning.

I am also only too conscious of the infancy of the methodology introduced in these notes. However, it is my sincere hope that exposure to a wider audience will accelerate its maturity. Readers are assumed to be familiar with the basic theory of time series analysis. The book by Professor M.B. Priestley (1981) may be used as a general reference. Chapter One is addressed to the general question: \\"why do we need non-linear time series models?\\" After describing some significant advantages of linear models, it singles out several major limitations of linearity. Of course, the selection reflects my personal view on the subject, which is only at its very beginning, although there does seem to be a general agreement in the literature that time irr'eversibility and limit cycles are among the most obvious.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KcXeBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia;: A story of the American civil war,","description":"With Lee in Virginia, A Story of the American Civil War (1890) is a book by British author G.A.

Although the subject of considerable research, the origins of the disease remain unclear. There has however been an explosion of interest in this disease in the past decade. The first edition of Myeloma: Biology and Management provided the first authoritative, comprehensive textbook, covering the epidemiology, immunology, and haematology of this important cancer. Since publication in 1995, several important advances have taken place in myeloma research, necessitating areview of the previous text. While bringing fully up-to-date the topics covered in the first edition, the second edition includes several new chapters; the patient and family perspective of the disease, infections in myeloma, cytogenetics, neurological complications, along with a history ofmyeloma. The book has been written and produced by the leading world-wide authorities in myeloma research. Comments on first edition 'This book represents a first-rate reference source for all haematologist and oncologists...' (British Journal of Haematology, 1995) 'Myeloma: Biology andManagement may be the most comprehensive monograph written on this subject in the last 20 years... It belongs in the library of anyone seriously interested in myeloma and should be required reading for trainees in hematology or oncology.' Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 1995 'This book isa useful compilation of the most recent advances...

The advantage is that the excitation amplitudes required can be either uniform or nearly uniform across the array, thereby allowing use of a simple feed system for excitation of the array elements and minimizing adverse mutual coupling effects. The design methods have found only limited applications, however, since results are not always reliable due to the approximations necessary to simplify the analytical work. Various computational methods have been presented to circumvent this problem, but these in turn suffer disadvantage in that they provide no control over the ultimate positions of the array elements, giving rise to unrealistic spacing configurations and severe realization problems through mutual coupling. In this work a new computational technique is presented for designing unequally spaced arrays. The method is particularly suitable for use with modern high-speed electronic computers, and allows certain practical restrictions or constraints to be included in the design procedure by allowing use of a limited number of different excitation amplitude levels. The result in any given example is an unequally spaced linear array designed for a specified sidelobe level, with a number of amplitude levels appropriate for insuring that prespecified spacing restrictions are met. Thus, the practical difficulties encountered with the results of other computational schemes are largely avoided. Several examples are given, and both theoretical and experimental results are included.

An examination of Greek, Roman, and Jewish literature, which speaks to the issues of virginity, reveals that the Christian understanding of life-long virginity was a foreign concept to the peoples and cultures of the ancient Mediterranean world. In a time when families and authorities demanded that women follow the ancient tradition of marriage and motherhood, a growing number of important Christian authors were calling for a life free from the \\"dangerous\\" sexual passions that beset all women. In Sex and Salvation, author Roger Steven Evans gathers over thirty documents from early Catholic, pseudopigraphical and heterodox letters, epistles, apologies, and canon law that trace the importance of virginity in early Christianity. Evans contends that the sexual ethic established by early Christian authors has reverberated throughout the intervening centuries, and is still being felt in the post modern world of the 21st century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P9drzQEACAAJ&dq=Sex+and+Salvation:+Virginity+As+A+Soteriological+Paradigm+in+Ancient+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The human predicament: dissolution and wholeness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NogCjwEACAAJ&dq=The+human+predicament:+dissolution+and+wholeness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yolonda's Genius","description":"After moving from Chicago to Grand River, Michigan, fifth grader Yolonda, big and strong for her age, determines to prove that her younger brother is not a slow learner but a true musical genius.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mzh6KxczlxgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Belong in a Zoo!: Tales from a Lifetime Spent with Cobras, Crocs, and Other Creatures","description":"From catching alligators in the reservoirs of New York and capturing giant crocodiles in Venezuela and giant frogs in West Africa to finding mummified human heads in a Bronx apartment, eels on a bus, cobras on the loose, and crocodiles that make change a memoir of one man s career working with exotic reptiles and other animals.

A dream of fleeing her otherwise happy urban life for fresh air and open space. A dream she would discover was about something more profound than that. A dream she never ever expected to come true. Until a hot summer afternoon led to a drive in the country, where a place that had existed only in her fantasies turned out to be real--and for sale. Fifty Acres And A Poodle The place is almost too perfect to be believed, but there it is: a pretty-as-a-picture-postcard farm, with an Amish barn, a chestnut grove, and vistas so beautiful, they take her breath away. And in that moment she knows that this is the spot where her future begins. So she drags her boyfriend Alex, a committed urban dweller with zero agricultural awareness who owns a poodle, into her scheme, hoping that love will somehow conquer all. But buying a postcard--fifty acres of scenery--and living on it are two entirely different matters. The questions seem endless: How long before the barn roof collapses? Should they buy sheep? Will the place be good for her writing, and for her relationship with Alex? And is there any way to keep Betty the mutt and Marley the poodle from rolling in mud, leaves, and unidentified smelly remains? In this funny yet tender tale, Laskas shares what happens when you follow your dream--and what happens when it's almost snatched away. Fifty Acres and a Poodle is a charming and surprisingly poignant memoir of Jeanne Marie Laskas's first year on Sweetwater Farm. It is a journey peopled by unforgettable characters: Billy, the local contractor who bulldozes her briars, takes her shopping for tractors, and advises her on buying a mule; Tim, the FedEx driver whose truck becomes Marley's obsession and nearly his downfall; the local hunters who present her with an entire wardrobe of blaze-orange hats; and Bob the cat, whose valiant fight for life gives her the courage to love. Jeanne Marie Laskas writes with exhilarating wit and extraordinary wisdom about life, love, and finding your true self on a farm. It's hard to say how a dream forms. Especially one like mine, which at first seemed so utterly random. It could have been a sailing-a-boat-to-Tahiti dream, a quit-your-job-and-hitchhike-to-Alaska dream. It was a fill-in-the-blank dream, born of an urge, not content. An urge for something new. I was thirty-seven years old. I lived on Eleventh Street, the last house on the right,in South Side, a gentrified old mill town on the banks of the Monongahela River. I rented an office in downtown Pittsburgh, a fifteen-minute bike ride away, which is where I spent my days writing stories and magazine articles. I had a garden. I had a cat. I had a dog. And I had a farm dream, a fantasy swirling around in my head about moving to the country. Where in the world was this coming from? That's what I wondered. It might have made sense if I was a miserable person, sick of my life. But I was not.I had a good life; it had taken me a long time to get it that way. A farm dream would have made sense, I supposed, if I was at least the farm dream type. A person with some deep personal longing to churn butter. A person who had had city life forced upon her and now was determined to go be true to herself and live among the haystacks. A person who wore her hair in long braids, used Ivory soap, and liked to stencil her walls with pictures of little chickens and cows. A person who, at minimum, had a compost pile in her yard where she diligently threw lawn clippings and coffee grounds and eggshells and earned the right to use the word organic a lot. But I was not that person. I was not even sure what hay was, or why anyone would stack it. And if I composted anything, it was only by mistake.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2XeEGPUXm_YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The children in the jungle","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OUDsGAAACAAJ&dq=The+children+in+the+jungle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thorns","description":"The Grishaverse will be coming to Netflix soon with Shadow and Bone, an original series!

The United States and Great Britain, aided by France, responded with a daring air logistical operation that in fifteen months delivered almost three million tons of coal, food, and other necessities to the people of Berlin. Now, drawing on rare U.S. Air Force files, recently declassified documents from the National Archives, records released since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the memories of airlift veterans themselves, Roger G. Miller provides an original study of the Berlin Airlift. The Berlin Airlift was an enterprise of epic proportions that demonstrated the power of air logistics as a political instrument. What began as a hastily organized operation by a small number of warweary cargo airplanes evolved into an intricate bridge of aircraft that flowed in and out of Berlin through narrow air corridors. Hour after hour, day after day, week after week, a stream of airplanes delivered everything from food and medicine to coal and candy in defiance of breakdowns, inclement weather, and Soviet hostility. And beyond the airlift itself, a complex system of transportation, maintenance, and supply stretching around the world sustained operations. Historians, veterans, and general readers will welcome this history of the first Western victory of the Cold War. Maps, diagrams, and more than forty photographs illustrate the mechanical inner workings and the human faces that made that triumph possible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PC26jfegblgC&dq=To+Save+a+City:+The+Berlin+Airlift,+1948-1949+(Texas+a&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Give the Boys a Great Big Hand","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Anthropology","description":"Decolonizing Anthropology is part of a broader effort that aims to advance the critical reconstruction of the discipline devoted to understanding humankind in all its diversity and commonality.

But no one was prepared for her decision to marry a local warlord a man who seemed to embody everything she was working against and to throw herself into his violent quest to take over southern Sudan s rebel movement. With precision and insight, Deborah Scroggins who met McCune in Sudan charts the process by which McCune s romantic delusions led to her descent into the hell of Africa s longest-running civil war. Emma s War is at once a disturbing love story and an up-close look at Sudan: a world where international aid fuels armies as well as the starving population, and where the northern-based Islamic government backed by Osama bin Laden is locked in a war with the Christian and pagan south over religion, oil, and slaves.

His global influence has been felt further through the organizations he established - the Langham Trust, the London Institute for Contemporary Christianity and the Evangelical Literature Trust. During this time he has published over forty books that have sold over eight million copies worldwide, as well as serving as editor for the series of expositions appreciated around the world as The Bible Speaks Today.\\" \\"All this and more has led prominent churchman David Edwards to consider John Stott to be, apart from William Temple (who died as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1944), \\"the most influential clergyman in the Church of England during the twentieth century.\\" In this book is found the history of the maturing of the evangelical movement worldwide and the story of one of its most pivotal and inspirational leaders.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Drawing on theory from political science, economics, sociology, psychology, communications, education, and linguistics, the book examines the ways in which differing access to technology contributes to social and economic stratification or inclusion. The book takes a global perspective, presenting case studies from developed and developing countries, including Brazil, China, Egypt, India, and the United States. A central premise is that, in today's society, the ability to access, adapt, and create knowledge using information and communication technologies is critical to social inclusion. This focus on social inclusion shifts the discussion of the \\"digital divide\\" from gaps to be overcome by providing equipment to social development challenges to be addressed through the effective integration of technology into communities, institutions, and societies. What is most important is not so much the physical availability of computers and the Internet but rather people's ability to make use of those technologies to engage in meaningful social practices.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2KnuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LIKE MOST REVELATIONS: New Poems","description":"Poems and monologues deal with artists, poets, victims, families, memories, and inspiration","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B9laAAAAMAAJ&dq=LIKE+MOST+REVELATIONS:+New+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slither (Critics Choice Paperback)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7_32AAAACAAJ&dq=Slither+(Critics+Choice+Paperback)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mycenaeans (Peoples of the Ancient World)","description":"The Mycenaean world: the stuff of legends and heroes who conquered Troy and who still stand at the heart of Greek identity today.

Jeffrey Segall skillfully demonstrates how various political, ideological, and religious allegiances influenced the critical reception and eventual canonization of what is perhaps the twentieth century's greatest novel. In re-creating the polemical debates that erupted, Segall provides a dramatic reminder of just how challenging and controversial Ulysses was and is. Seventy years after Ulysses was first banned, the novel remains at the center of contemporary debates among feminist, neo-Marxist, and poststructuralist critics. Segall allows us the opportunity to view Ulysses from the perspective of its early readers, and he also elucidates key moments in recent American cultural history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EoZ6ZhT9lBwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steinbeck Novels 1942-1952: The Moon Is Down / Cannery Row / The Pearl / East of Eden (Library of America)","description":"A definitive collection of stories from one of America's greatest writers includes The Moon Is Down, which details the transformation of ordinary life under Nazi rule in an unnamed Scandinavian country under German occupation, as well as Cannery Row, The Pearl, and East of Eden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xWFbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Steinbeck+Novels+1942-1952:+The+Moon+Is+Down+/+Cannery+Row+/+The+Pearl+/+East+of+Eden+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japanese for Busy People II: Workbook Tapes (Japanese for Busy People Series) (Pt.2)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l_8PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Japanese+for+Busy+People+II:+Workbook+Tapes+(Japanese+for+Busy+People+Series)+(Pt.2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran","description":"The shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, would remain on the throne for the foreseeable future: This was the firm conclusion of a top-secret CIA analysis issued in October 1978. One hundred days later the shah--despite his massive military, fearsome security police, and superpower support was overthrown by a popular and largely peaceful revolution. But the CIA was not alone in its myopia, as Charles Kurzman reveals in this penetrating work; Iranians themselves, except for a tiny minority, considered a revolution inconceivable until it actually occurred. Revisiting the circumstances surrounding the fall of the shah, Kurzman offers rare insight into the nature and evolution of the Iranian revolution and into the ultimate unpredictability of protest movements in general. As one Iranian recalls, The future was up in the air. Through interviews and eyewitness accounts, declassified security documents and underground pamphlets, Kurzman documents the overwhelming sense of confusion that gripped pre-revolutionary Iran, and that characterizes major protest movements. His book provides a striking picture of the chaotic conditions under which Iranians acted, participating in protest only when they expected others to do so too, the process approaching critical mass in unforeseen and unforeseeable ways. Only when large numbers of Iranians began to think the unthinkable, in the words of the U.S. ambassador, did revolutionary expectations become a self-fulfilling prophecy. A corrective to 20-20 hindsight, this book reveals shortcomings of analyses that make the Iranian revolution or any major protest movement seem inevitable in retrospect.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bt2GiD5OkUUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Industry Petroleum","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T8LOzAEACAAJ&dq=Our+Industry+Petroleum&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boys Who Would Be Cubs: A Year in the Heart of Baseball's Minor Leagues","description":"Looks at how minor league baseball teams are run, explains how players progress to the majors, and follows a group of minor leaguers during the 1988 season","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=i-o8AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Boys+Who+Would+Be+Cubs:+A+Year+in+the+Heart+of+Baseball%27s+Minor+Leagues&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cracks in My Foundation: Bags, Trips, Make-up Tips, Charity, Glory, and the Darker Side of the Story","description":"Go further under the covers and stay in bed a little longer with Marian Keyes in this winning follow-up to her smash essay collection, Under the Duvet.

It also argues that states must avoid policies of admission and exclusion that can only be implemented through unjust means.

Now, in The Persian Puzzle, published to coincide with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Iran hostage crisis, he examines the behind-the-scenes story of the tumultuous relationship between Iran and the United States, and weighs options for the future. Here Pollack, a former CIA analyst and National Security Council official, brings his keen analysis and insider perspective to the long and ongoing clash between the United States and Iran, beginning with the fall of the shah and the seizure of the American embassy in Tehran in 1979. Pollack examines all the major events in U.S.-Iran relationsincluding the hostage crisis, the U.S. tilt toward Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, the Iran-Contra scandal, American-Iranian military tensions in 1987 and 1988, the covert Iranian war against U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf that culminated in the 1996 Khobar Towers terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia, and recent U.S.-Iran skirmishes over Afghanistan and Iraq. He explains the strategies and motives from American and Iranian perspectives and tells how each crisis colored the thinking of both countries  leadership as they shaped and reshaped their policies over time. Pollack also describes efforts by moderates of various stripes to try to find some way past animosities to create a new dynamic in Iranian-American relations, only to find that when one side was ready for such a step, the other side fell short. With balanced tone and insight, Pollack explains how the United States and Iran reached this impasse; why this relationship is critical to regional, global, and U.S. interests; and what basic political choices are available as we deal with this important but deeply troubled country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VtISTfUL-NAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brighty of the Grand Canyon","description":"Brighty was a real live burro who lived in the Grand Canyon. He is believed to have been brought from Flagstaf Arizona down to the Colorado River in the bottom of the Grand Canyon in 1890-1892. Whomever brought him there is believed to have drowned in the Colorado River. That persons body was never found. After that, Brighty spent the next thirty years as essentially an independent contractor. He would carry loads and passengers up and down the Bright Angel Trail in return for food. Nobody ever owned him. If the payment he received in food was not satisfactory, he would just leave and go to work for somebody else. Brighty was given his name by a prospector who found him after his original owners had died. Brighty became famous when US President Theodore Roosevelt used him to hunt mountain lions. An old prospector living in the canyon found the burro running wild along Bright Angle Creek and named him Brighty and held him not with ropes but with friendship. When the prospector mysteriously died, Brighty once again roamed free. On his trips up and down the canyon wall he hobnobbed with map-makers, artists and geologists and soon they were following his trail from rim to river.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7ntUjgEACAAJ&dq=Brighty+of+the+Grand+Canyon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soaring Spirit Thirty Five Years of the Ford Thunderbird ([An Automobile quarterly marque history book])","description":"Discusses the designs and technological developments that have contributed to the popularity of the Ford sports car","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wv7tPQAACAAJ&dq=Soaring+Spirit+Thirty+Five+Years+of+the+Ford+Thunderbird+(%5BAn+Automobile+quarterly+marque+history+book%5D)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How 2 Study Law","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-aIW7Pnq07AC&dq=How+2+Study+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confronted with Death","description":"A compelling handbook for pastors, counselors, and adult discussion groups, this book deals honestly and openly with the cultural and human issues surrounding death.

It is not sufficient to view the persons of the Trinity as offering a mere example for human relationships; actual participation in this triune communication shapes both our knowledge of God and the pastoral practices that flow from it. Paul S. Fiddes develops a radical understanding of the \\"persons\\" in God as nothing other than relations, or as movements of divine relationship into which we are drawn. This important new book engages in conversation with recent thought about the Trinity in Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox theology. But it does so always through theological reflection on pastoral concerns. Fiddes brings the doctrine of the Trinity into dialogue with key issues, including the relation of the individual to community, the nature of power and authority, the effect of intercessory prayer, the problems of suffering, the power of forgiveness, the threat of death, the use of spiritual gifts, and the living of a sacramental life. Participating in God is essential reading for all those interested in Christian doctrine and pastoral care.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OsANkSM50iwC&dq=Participating+in+God:+A+Pastoral+Doctrine+of+the+Trinity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Yes & Know: Ages 9-99 (Yes & Know)","description":"Each one of us is a masterpiece created by God with unique gifts and potential for success.

It is full and impartial. Though written as an independent and private study, records and information of an exceptional range and kind were used in its making. These give it authority. They include all the pertinent State Department papers; the American official military records in preparation; selections from the Roosevelt papers at Hyde Park; the full private diaries of Stimons, Morgenthau, and Grew; the file of the intercepted \\"Magic\\" cables; and equivalent collections of official and private Japanese records. The author was at the time in the State Department (as Adviser on International Economic Affairs) and thus in close touch with the men and matters of which he writes. In telling how this war came about, this book tells much of how other wars happen. For it is a close study of the ways in which officials, diplomats, and soldiers think and act; of the environment of decision, of the ambitions of nations, of the clash of their ideas, of the way sin which fear and mistrust affect events, and of the struggle for time and advantage. The narrative follows events in a double mirror of which one side is Washington and the other Tokyo, and synchronizes the images. Thus it traces the ways in which the acts and decisions of this country influenced Japan and vice versa. Originally published in 1950.

We gained the benefits of cheaper and, in some cases, better foreign-made products, while U.S. firms gained wider access to foreign markets. The increasing economic interlinkages with the rest of the world helped promote capitalism and democracy around the globe. Indeed, we helped \\"win\\" the Cold War by trading and investing with the rest of the world, in the process demonstrating to all concerned the virtues of trade and markets. In recent years, however, a growing chorus of complaints has been lodged against globalization--which is blamed for costing American workers their jobs and lowering their wages. The authors of this book speak directly and simply to these concerns, demonstrating with easy prose and illustrations why the \\"globaphobes\\" are wrong. Globalization has not cost the United States jobs. Nor has it played any more than a small part in the disappointing trends in wages of many American workers. The challenge for all Americans is to embrace globalization and all of the benefits it brings, while adopting targeted policies to ease the very real pain of those few Americans whom globalization may harm. Globaphobia outlines a novel, yet sensible program for advancing this objective.

This book illuminates Ives's music by comparing it with that of other composers in Europe and the United States. Edited by two highly regarded Ives scholars, the book begins with essays that examine the influences on Ives of his musical predecessors and concludes with essays that find extensive parallels between Ives and such European contemporaries as Mahler, Schoenberg, Berg, and Stravinsky, whose music he knew little or not at all, but with whom he shared influences and concerns. Taken together, these chapters demonstrate that even apparently strange or distinctively American aspects of Ives's music--from his penchant for quotation to his juxtaposition of disparate styles--have strong precedents and parallels among European composers. Ives emerges as a composer at home in the classical tradition, engaged in exploring the same issues that confronted composers of his generation on both sides of the Atlantic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=71srZz7K35QC&dq=Charles+Ives+and+the+Classical+Tradition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The After House","description":"\\"An astonishing story of love and mystery, which equals if not surpasses in interest those other lively stories of Mrs. Rinehart's.

Beneath the Moors and Darker Places, a companion to The Whisperer and Other Voices, collects nine lengthy exemplars of the best of Lumley's short works, many of them unavailable for decades in any form. The Cthulhu Mythos of the immortal H.P. Lovecraft provides inspiration for much of Lumley's work, including \\"Dagon's Bell\\" and \\"Big C,\\" both included here. The explosive creation of a new volcanic island off Iceland in 1967 led to \\"Rising with Surtsey,\\" a homage not just to Lovecraft but to the great August Derleth. \\"David's Worm\\"--which takes an interesting view of \\"you are what you eat\\"--was published in a Year's Best Horror Stories and later adapted for radio in Europe. The collection also includes the macabre \\"The Second Wish,\\" published here for the first time with the author's original, intended ending, and \\"The Fairground Horror,\\" first published in The Disciples of Cthulhu twenty-five years ago and not seen since save for a small press edition. The title tale, Beneath the Moors, a complete short novel, has been unavailable in the United States since its first publication by Arkham House in the early 1970s. It is considered to be one of Lumley's strongest short works; Tor is proud to restore this and the other pieces in this volume to Lumley's growing readership.

It was located in the area of the Caucasus that now comprises Dagestan and Chechnya, on the western shore of the Caspian Sea. In the middle of the eighth century the Khazar Khagan (king) and his nobles adopted Judaism as their religion. In the novel, David, son of the Khagan, is sent from his homeland in the Caucasus to Spain at age seven. There, he studies in the same household with another boy who is later called Maimonides, earning the right to be called Rabbi, a scholar of the laws, scriptures and customs of Judaism. When the time comes to return home, seventeen-year-old David leaves civilization to rule an untamed country. His Khazaria is sparsely populated by pagan nomads and by the descendants of many Jewish immigrants who fled persecution in Persia and Byzantium and intermarried with Khazar converts. To survive, they must emulate the lifestyle of the nomads. When Davids father dies, he becomes Khagan and is sworn to keep his homeland safe and under a Jewish sovereign. He faces many difficulties, not the least of which is trying to balance his wish to keep the Jewish laws and customs he learned in Spain against the need to survive in a wild country under attack by barbarian tribes. In an effort to reverse a betrayal of his people, David of Khazaria undertakes a long journey, both physically and spiritually, to save his kingdom. He meets many important historical personages and plays a role in some of the events that shaped history in the years between 1150 and 1170 C.E.in the Caucasus, Persia, Byzantium and Egypt. A Review From The Jerusalem Post Internet Edition: Who is a Khazar? By Gabriel A. Sivan February, 20 2002 (February 20)The Rabbi King: David of Khazaria. a Historical Adventure by Monroe S. Kuttner. Xlibris/Random House. 505 pages. A once-upon-a-time true fable about a Jewish kingdom in south-eastern Russia continues to capture the imagination. Though a work of fiction, this is one of several books that testify to renewed interest in the Khazars, a formerly nomadic people of Turkish stock whose ruling class embraced Judaism in or around 740 CE and established an empire stretching from the Crimea to the Aral Sea. By tradition, it was after a debate between representatives of Judaism, Christianity and Islamin which the Jewish arguments proved most convincingthat King Bulan made Khazaria Jewish. The faith that he adopted contained an admixture of paganism, however, and normative rabbinic Judaism was only introduced by his successors. Khazar merchants traded through_out the Near East; Khazar troops helped the Magyars conquer Hungary and joined the Byzantines in a war against Persia. Vague accounts of this remote but powerful empire heartened Jewish communities in Western Europe and inspired Judah Halevis famous exposition of Judaism, Sefer ha-Kuzari (see box). Tragically, from 965, the Khazar state declined and eventually collapsed under savage Russian and other attacks. \\"However, it is documented that Khazars, and a land called Khazaria, existed well into the early 13th century, probably in the area of Russian Dagestan and Chechnya,\\" writes Monroe Kuttner, author of The Rabbi King, who obviously did a great deal of research. True enough, Khazars appear to have survived as an ethnic group until the Mongol invasion in 1237, and the last remnants were no doubt absorbed by Jewish, Karaite and Christian populations. Kuttner evidently believes that there were Khazars among his ancestors in Hungary and Russia. On that basis, he invents a khagan or king named David, Khazarias last rulerduring the years 1150-1170whose empire is limited to what is now Dagestan.

Among these soldiers, one regiment stands out above the others: The Black Watch, the Royal Highland Regiment. In Canada, the Regular Force battalions of the Black Watch were formed during 1951 in response to the Cold War. Drawing on five reserve units based in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Victoria, and Nova Scotia, the Black Watch were first based in Aldershot, Nova Scotia, and then at CFB Gagetown, New Brunswick. The First and Second Battalions were stationed in Germany, fought in the Korean Conflict, and served as a peacekeeping force in Cyprus. Then, in 1970, the Regular Force Batallions were disbanded and the Black Watch reverted to a one-battalion Militia unit. This illustrated history brings together the colour and pageantry of the Regular Force Battalions of this legendary regiment. Photographs of the soldiers, their commanding officers, bases, uniforms, badges, and medals bring to life the story of the thousands of men who trained for a war that never came.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fvmoNwAACAAJ&dq=THE+BLACK+WATCH.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art of Indian Cuisine","description":"Indian cuisine traditionally conjures up images of tantalising food steeped in fragrant spices, enriched with subtleties of different flavors, exotic methods of cooking such as dum, baghar, and dhungar.

It is an account of a tour or rather of selected adventures which occurred during a tour undertaken in the Levant in 1834, but was not published until ten years later. The biographical notices of the are somewhat meagre, as by his dying directions all his papers were destroyed. He was born near Taunton in 1809, and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, at which latter he is said to have been the friend of Thackeray and Tennyson. On leaving college he started on his Oriental tour with Lord Pollington (the Methley of Eothen), and on returning to England was called to the Bar at Lincoln s Inn, and obtained a lucrative practice. But the life was too tame to suit his taste. In 1845 he visited Algeria, and went through a campaign with the flying column of St. Arnaud; and in 1854 went to the Crimea with Lord Raglan, and was present at the battle of Alma. On returning to England he decided to go into politics, and was elected for Bridgewater in 1857 in the Liberal interest. He seems to have been a poor speaker, and to have exercised little parliamentary influence; but we are told that in 1859 he was strongly opposed to the Conspiracy Bill, which was introduced after Orsini s attempt to murder Napoleon III., and that in 1860 he denounced the cession of Nice and Savoy to France. In both cases he was apparently actuated by his personal dislike of Napoleon, which is evident in his historical works. In 1868 he was again returned for Bridgewater, but unseated on petition, for bribery. One might have supposed that he had acquired this habit in the East, but his biographers assert that he knew nothing of the irregularities which were committed by his agents. But the chief business of his later life was the composition of the History of the War in the Crimea, of which the first two volumes appeared in 1863, and the seventh and eighth (completing the work) in 1887. He died in 1891.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zyYlDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eight Cousins","description":" Eight Cousins - Or, the Aunt-Hill  is a 1875 novel by American author Louisa May Alcott.

Drawing on interviews and published works, Christopher Lutz traces MacIntyre's philosophical development and refutes the criticisms of the major thinkers including Martha Nussbaum and Thomas Nagel who have most vocally attacked him. Permanently shifting the debate on MacIntyre's oeuvre, Lutz convincingly demonstrates how MacIntyre's neo-Aristotelian ethical thought provides an essential corrective to the contemporary discussions of relativism and ideology, while successfully drawing on the objectivity of Thomistic natural law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z9RaG9ccs44C&dq=Tradition+in+the+Ethics+of+Alasdair+MacIntyre:+Relativism,+Thomism,+and+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adobe Creative Suite 2 Bible","description":"Adobe's Creative Suite 2 bible brings together Adobe Bridge, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, GoLive, Acrobat Professional, and Version Cue in one volume.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aiXPt1Dk5xQC&dq=Adobe+Creative+Suite+2+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Symmography: Linear Thread Design.","description":"Discussion of the tools, materials, patterns, designs, and techniques of symmography is illustrated with a variety of string constructions and geometric compositions","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xL9aAAAAYAAJ&dq=Symmography:+Linear+Thread+Design.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matrix of Man, an Illustrated History of Urban Environment","description":"Global warming is the most severe environmental challenge faced by humanity today and the costs of responding effectively will be high.

For thousands of years, the prophet Moses was regarded as the sole author of the first five books of the Bible, known as the Pentateuch. According to tradition, Moses was divinely directed to write down foundational events in the history of the world: the creation of humans, the worldwide flood, the laws as they were handed down at Mt. Sinai, and the cycle of Israel s enslavement and liberation from Egypt. However, these stories and their frequent discrepancies provoke questions: why does the first chapter in Genesis say that man and woman were made in God s image, while the second says that woman was made from man s rib? Why does one account of the flood say it lasted forty days, while another records no less than one hundred? And why do some stories reflect the history of southern Judah, while others seem sourced from northern Israel? Originally published in 1987, Richard Friedman s Who Wrote the Bible? joins a host of modern scholars who show that the Pentateuch was written by at least four distinct voices separated by borders, political alliances, and particular moments in history then connected by brilliant editors. Rather than cast doubt onto the legitimacy of the Bible, Friedman uses these divergent accounts to illuminate a text that was written by real people. Friedman s seminal and bestselling text is a comprehensive and authoritative answer to the question: just who exactly wrote the Bible?","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GafkyQEACAAJ&dq=What+Is+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Gregory Hymnal and Catholic Choir Book (Abridged Edition)","description":"The second Vatican Council was convened by Pope John XXIII between 1962 and 1965.

Yet, until very recently, the trend has been for 20th-century authors to bypass discussion of the relation of Acts to the world and history around it. In this book, Colin Hemer examines various strands of interlocking data, ranging from the epistles of Paul to records of the corn fleet that sailed from Alexandria. The wealth of new literary, epigraphic, and papyrological data brings fresh light to numerous details as well as to the central question of Luke's conception of Paul's visit to Jerusalem. The result is a broader understanding of the Hellenistic world in general and a greater appreciation for Acts as a coherent and consistent product of its day. Originally published by J. C. B.

As such it provides students and professionals alike with an essential sourcebook that can be mined for visual inspiration as well as for textually rich and authoritative insight into the links between structure, architecture, and cultural context. The chapters address fundamental structural elements and systems: columns, walls, beams, trusses, frames, tensile structures, arches, domes and shells. Each chapter is subdivided into two parts: ? The essays  introduce the chapters with the reprinting of a curated set of essays and excerpts by various authors that uniquely address how particular structural elements or systems relate in essential fashion to architectural design concepts. ? The model studies  physical models of the overall structural systems of several notable contemporary buildings from Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia are illustrated with large photographs, detail close-ups, and views of their external forms and internal spaces that establish the exceptional qualities of these projects in connecting structural form to architectural design objectives. Mosaic layouts complete the chapters with a collection of photographs of yet more models whose particular details and unique features serve to extend the visual repertoire of the structural type being considered. The combination, juxtaposition and mutual positive reinforcement of these two collections, one largely textual and the other image based, provides the reader with unique and multifaceted insights into how structural forms and systems can be related to architectural design intentions. Conveyed by a strong and deliberate graphical design format, this assembly of materials gets to the very essence of structures within the context of architecture, and will inspire students and practitioners alike to make strategic design decisions for their own projects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bB03DwAAQBAJ&dq=Richard+Rogers:+Complete+Works,+Volume+1+(Richard+Rogers+Vol.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Object to Be Destroyed: The Work of Gordon Matta-Clark","description":"In this first critical account of Matta-Clark's work, Pamela M. Lee considers it in the context of the art of the 1970s particularly site-specific, conceptual, and minimalist practices and its confrontation with issues of community, property, the alienation of urban space, the \\"right to the city,\\" and the ideologies of progress that have defined modern building programs. Although highly regarded during his short life and honored by artists and architects today the American artist Gordon Matta-Clark (1943-78) has been largely ignored within the history of art. Matta-Clark is best remembered for site-specific projects known as \\"building cuts.\\" Sculptural transformations of architecture produced through direct cuts into buildings scheduled for demolition, these works now exist only as sculptural fragments, photographs, and film and video documentations. Matta-Clark is also remembered as a catalytic force in the creation of SoHo in the early 1970s. Through loft activities, site projects at the exhibition space 112 Greene Street, and his work at the restaurant Food, he participated in the production of a new social and artistic space. Have art historians written so little about Matta-Clark's work because of its ephemerality, or, as Pamela M. Lee argues, because of its historiographic, political, and social dimensions? What did the activity of carving up a building-in anticipation of its destruction suggest about the conditions of art making, architecture, and urbanism in the 1970s? What was one to make of the paradox attendant on its making that the production of the object was contingent upon its ruination? How do these projects address the very writing of history, a history that imagines itself building toward an ideal work in the service of progress? In this first critical account of Matta-Clark's work, Lee considers it in the context of the art of the 1970s particularly site-specific, conceptual, and minimalist practices and its confrontation with issues of community, property, the alienation of urban space, the \\"right to the city,\\" and the ideologies of progress that have defined modern building programs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Arh7W3v0uVAC&dq=Object+to+Be+Destroyed:+The+Work+of+Gordon+Matta-Clark&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Place, A","description":" Bij mij ben je veilig  van Sharon Cameron is een historische roman over een jong meisje dat tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog dertien joden op zolder verborgen hield.

During the time occupied in developing his ideas' on these heads he was constantly occupied in studying and forming large collections of fruits, and nearly every continental new fruit found its way to Sawbridgeworth, and most of them eventually to the fire heap. Mr. Rivers was at one time a most ardent cultivator of what are called ornamental trees and herbaceous plants; his collections of both were at one time very large, and he was quite as enthusiastic a lover of these as of Roses. Loudon gave him the benefit of his vast know ledge, and took great interest in his various collections in one tribe, that of the. Oaks, his collection was unusually extensive. He has made good use of the Orchard House to endeavour to improve the varieties of Peaches. The few sorts selected as worthy of naming have been taken from more than seedlings, and it may give some idea of the work done when it stated that these were all grown under glass. Mr.'rivers has been a large employer of labour; a small agricultural village has.

Mr. Rivers, through failing health, has retired from active life, yet his mind is still active. Seventy-six years is a long measure of life for a man, but few men can look back with greater satisfaction than he can on a life worthily spent and deserving in every way of the commendation that, as far as lay in his power, he has been a good citizen of a great country.

Looking at eleven plays, Strauss shows that this confrontation is essentially one between poetry and philosophy, and that poetry emerges as an autonomous wisdom capable of rivaling philosophy. \\"Strauss gives us an impressive addition to his life's work the recovery of the Great Tradition in political philosophy. The problem the book proposes centers formally upon Socrates. As is typical of Strauss, he raises profound issues with great courage. . . . [He addresses] a problem that has been inherent in Western life ever since [Socrates'] execution: the tension between reason and religion. . . . Thus, we come to Aristophanes, the great comic poet, and his attack on Socrates in the play The Clouds. . . [Strauss] translates it into the basic problem of the relation between poetry and philosophy, and resolves this by an analysis of the function of comedy in the life of the city.\\"  Stanley Parry, National Review","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mC2GDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Impressions of the Natural World: An Inspirational Journey","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RZIGAAAACAAJ&dq=Impressions+of+the+Natural+World:+An+Inspirational+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Loot","description":"In luck and out of luck, John Grimes was a living legend of the spaceways.

I am now working through what I thought was a foundational doctrine that I also thought was settled long ago. This book should be required reading for people on both sides of this issue. Dr. Denny Nissley, AG minister, Director of Christ in Action Ministries Many books and articles have been written in defense of speaking in tongues as the unmistakable, physical evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit.

It counters the claims of some psychologists that it is impossible to increase intelligence because that ability is determined at birth. Thinkback builds on the Think Aloud strategies in Arthur Whimbey and Jack Lochhead's popular and widely used volume, Problem Solving & Comprehension, now in its sixth edition. Since its publication, thousands of students have used these techniques for improving thinking and analytic reasoning to increase test scores, win National Merit Scholarships, and gain admission to top-ranked professional schools. Now, Thinkback shows how these powerful strategies can be applied to a range of important academic areas including mathematics, language arts, social studies, and science. Thinkback is a tool for student empowerment--a strategy they can use to improve both their ability to think and their ability to learn. The Thinkback classroom, on the other hand, is a design for teacher liberation--enabling them to see learning more clearly than they ever could before. This is the only book currently available that contains detailed models of metacognitive dialogues in the classroom. These dialogues enable teachers and teacher educators to observe thinking processes that have previously been invisible and undetectable. Based on over 20 years of careful cognitive research, the dialogues provide teachers with important insights into the nature of thinking and problem solving.

We live in a moving medium of feelings. In Flying Lessons, clinical psychologist Dr. John Snyder weaves together these two realms, drawing on his experiences as a licensed pilot to illuminate the existential truths that have helped him transform the lives of troubled men and women for more than 35 years. Part adventure story, part philosophical meditation in the tradition of Saint-Exupery, Flying Lessons offers a fresh perspective on timeless problems of anxiety, depression, and relational conflict. Each of the books eight chapters begins with a dramatic incident from Dr. Snyders 2000-hour flight log: the sheer terror of a total power loss, the disconcerting moment when the sky above becomes indistinguishable from the sea below, the sensation of spiraling toward the earth in a stall, the shock of emerging from a cloud bank to find a mountain peak rising dead ahead. Dr. Snyder uses each of these flying stories to generate a metaphorical lesson about the nature of human relationships, illustrating general principles for sustaining joy and intimacy with case histories from his clinical practice. Written in a straightforward, unpretentious, personal style, Flying Lessons is designed for everyone who desires a more exciting and intimate lifeand for everyone in the helping professions who would like to be more effective in their practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dTfVt8h6leYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Women (Junior Classics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MBpkswEACAAJ&dq=Little+Women+(Junior+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Irish language (Gneithe dar nduchas)","description":"This volume contains both reprints of articles and new essays about specific aspects of the social history of Canadian music.

Japanese immigrants have found themselves in a variety of cultures and contexts, but have often maintained a loyalty to their native cuisine. This has required local adaptation over the last 100 years: the so-called Nikkei community has embraced a new country s ingredients and assimilated these into their cooking using Japanese techniques. Nikkei cooking is found wherever in the world Japanese immigrants and their descendants are. But, for historical reasons, two countries have had substantially more Japanese immigrants than the rest of the world  Brazil and Peru. Nikkei cooking has gained popularity in Europe and the USA due to the influence of chefs Nobu Matsuhisa and Toshiro Konishi; the last two decades have seen the emergence of a number of outstanding, creative Nikkei chefs and restaurants all over the world  including Pakta in Barcelona by Albert Adria. This stunningly photographed cookbook includes 100 Nikkei recipes, including 10 contributed recipes from top Nikkei chefs from around the world such as celebrated chefs Toshiro Konishi and Mitsuharu Tsumura ('Micha') from Peru, Tsuyoshi Murakami from Brazil, Jorge Munoz & Kioko Li of Pakta in Barcelona and Jordan Sclare & Michael Paul of Chotto Matte in London. Nikkei Cuisine is a ground-breaking cookery book and a must-have for anyone with an interest in Japanese or South American cooking, as well as for those keen to discover cutting-edge cookery and flavours. The recipes range from the simpler Nikkei family favourites (the dishes eaten at home) to the more elaborate and elegant Nikkei dishes served in restaurants around the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4sm3CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Margaret, Queen of Scotland and Her Chapel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=upQvMwEACAAJ&dq=St.+Margaret,+Queen+of+Scotland+and+Her+Chapel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of California","description":"Brings to life the turbulent times in the heyday of each town and guides the visitor to the sights that are relies of those times.

The period of his creative friendship with William Wordsworth inspired some of Coleridge s best-known poems, from the nightmarish vision of the \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" and the opium-inspired \\"Kubla Khan\\" to the sombre passion of \\"Dejection: An Ode\\" and the medieval ballad \\"Christabel.\\" His meditative  conversation  poems, such as \\"Frost at Midnight\\" and \\"This Lime-Tree Bower Mr Prison,\\" reflect on remembrance and solitude, while late works, such as \\"Youth and Age\\" and \\"Constancy to an Ideal Object,\\" are haunting meditations on mortality and lost love. This volume contains the final texts of all the poems published during Coleridge s lifetime and a substantial selection from those still in manuscript at his death, arranged in chronological order of composition to show his development as a poet. Also included are an introduction, table of dates, further reading, extensive notes, and indexes of titles and first lines.

Biogeographically, these forests lie between cool-temperate deciduous forests to the north and drier shrublands to the south. In a more general view, they are ecologically intermediate between these deciduous forests and humid warm-temperate evergreen forests, such as the laurisilva of the Macarone sian islands or the broadleaved evergreen forests of eastern Asia. Holm oak forests are characterized by small-stature trees (usually 5 to 12 m tall), which are slow growing, cast a deep shade, and have small, evergreen, sclerophyl lous leaves. Summer drought is the major environmental constraint. Mediterranean broadleaved evergreen forests have been underrepre sented in the open literature. For example, The Woodlands Data Set of the International Biological Program (IBP) contained data from just one holm oak forest plot, Le Rouquet in southern France (Reichle 1981). Also, some models of European forests consider just two major forest types, broad leaved deciduous and evergreen conifers, forgeting the extensive forests and woodlands of holm oak and cork oak (Quercus suber 1.), which are the ma jor evergreen oak tree species in the Mediterranean Basin. The extensive lit erature on Mediterranean-type ecosystems has also largely neglected these forests, being centred mostly on Mediterranean-type shrublands.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BpkQngEACAAJ&dq=Ecology+of+Mediterranean+Evergreen+Oak+Forests+(Ecological+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wireless Room","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gZRxAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wireless+Room&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Well-Matched Pair","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hQb8ewEACAAJ&dq=A+Well-Matched+Pair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Lady of the Circus","description":"The latest offering by acclaimed Mexican writer David Toscana is a whimsical and dark tale about a group of circus performers who, disillusioned with their lives as traveling entertainers, are seduced by the idea of settling down and living like ordinary people. Our Lady of the Circus begins with the once formidable circus of the Mantec n Brothers breaking apart, resulting in one brother taking with him the best of the group. Left behind is brother Don Alejo, who tries to rally the remaining troupe of eight stragglers and a pig. Together they stumble upon an abandoned town, where the demoralized performers seize the opportunity to start over and christen it Santa Mar a del Circo. What ensues is an absurd and tragic look at the misfits' struggle to create new lives for themselves. Through these desperate characters, Toscana skillfully reveals the many defects of humanity and the individual's desire for self-realization, and, in so doing, creates a touching metaphor for the human condition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QSS2QgAACAAJ&dq=Our+Lady+of+the+Circus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"APPLIED NONLINEAR DYNAMICS","description":"This introduction to applied nonlinear dynamics and chaos places emphasis on teaching the techniques and ideas that will enable students to take specific dynamical systems and obtain some quantitative information about their behavior.

Grounded in the culture that gave rise to Christianity and thus sharing many of the community's values, rabbis schooled outside the region brought erudition and an exotic individuality to the frontier. Furthermore, a rabbi's prophetic sense of social justice, honed through centuries of Talmudic thought, gave a Hebrew minister moral clout in a vigilante climate. Because Texas synagogues were small, rabbis served entire communities, evolving into public figures recruited for an array of roles. They blessed stock shows and rodeos. They founded hospitals, symphonies, and charities. They broadcast Sunday sermons over the radio. They challenged the Ku Klux Klan and fought for academic freedom and prison reform. Their names are etched on cornerstones and scrawled on state documents. Welcomed as leaders of the Chosen People, rabbis thrived, and many stayed their entire careers. Rabbis who accepted a call to the Lone Star State when it was still on the edge of the frontier often ventured out West as a last resort. Some were freelancers, never ordained. Others came because they had no better pulpit offers. A number had left Europe as rebels, seeking to escape traditional religious practices. These maverick rabbis were drawn to places with little Jewish history or hierarchy -- communities such as Beaumont, Galveston, Fort Worth, Lubbock, El Paso, and Tyler -- where they created their own religious blueprints. This thoroughly researched and engaging volume, covering a time span from the 1870s through the 1920s, tells the lively stories of elevenrabbis, their lives, and their Texas towns, from big cities such as Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio to the remote locales of Hempstead and Brownsville.

Founded in 1924, the Music Corporation of America got its start booking acts into speakeasies run by such notorious Chicago mobsters as Al Capone. How then, in only a few decades, did MCA become the driving force behind music publishing, radio, recording artists, Hollywood, and the burgeoning television industry? Enter Ronald Reagan. By the late 1950s, Reagan was a pass  movie actor. As president of the Screen Actors Guild, he was also MCA s key client. With Reagan s help, MCA would become the most powerful entertainment conglomerate in the world. And with MCA s help, Reagan would secure a fortune (resulting in a federal grand jury hearing), be marketed to the public as a viable politician, and ascend to the presidency of the United States. But according to reporter Dan E. Moldea, there had always been another catalyst behind MCA: Ties to organized crime that reached back to the company s inception and through Reagan s Teamster-backed candidacy had never been severed. From the author of The Hoffa Wars, this is an epic and serpentine investigation into the insidious links among Hollywood, the Mob, and politics. Based on research of six thousand pages of previously classified documents, including the entirety of Reagan s grand jury testimony, Moldea  has, through sheer tenacity, amassed an avalanche of ominous and unnerving facts.

They lived in the South during 1865 -- a year that saw war, disunion, and slavery give way to peace, reconstruction, and emancipation. One was a slave determined to gain freedom, one a widow battling poverty and despair, one a man of God and planter's son grappling with spiritual and worldly troubles, and one a former Confederate soldier seeking a new life. Between January and December 1865 they witnessed, from very different vantage points, the death of the Old South and the birth of the New South. Civil War historian Stephen V. Ash reconstructs their daily lives, their fears and hopes, and their frustrations and triumphs in vivid detail, telling a dramatic story of real people in a time of great upheaval and offering a fresh perspective on a pivotal moment in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1nw_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SHE LIVES!","description":"Meet the ministers and laypeople driving foundational Christian theological change and restoring awareness of the sacred value of women and girls.

In a series of compelling chapters, Coast of Dreams moves through a variety of topics that show the California of the last decade, when the state was sometimes stumbling, sometimes humbled, but, more often, flourishing with its usual panache. From gang violence in Los Angeles to the spectacular riseand equally spectacular fallof Silicon Valley, from the Northridge earthquake to the recall of Governor Gray Davis, Starr ranges over myriad facts, anecdotes, news stories, personal impressions, and analyses to explore a time of unprecedented upheaval in California. Coast of Dreams describes an exceptional diversity of people, cultures, and values; an economy that mirrors the economic state of the nation; a battlefield where industry and the necessities of infrastructure collide with the inherent demands of a unique and stunning natural environment. It explores California politics (including Arnold Schwarzenegger s election in the 2003 recall), the multifaceted business landscape, and controversial icons such as O. J. Simpson.  Historians of the future,  Starr writes,  will be able to see with more certainty whether or not the period 1990-2003 was not only the end of one California but the beginning of another ; in the meantime, he gives a picture of the place and time in a book at once sweeping and riveting in its details, deeply informed, engagingly personal, and altogether fascinating.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fw5N5qg5BHQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Structures","description":"Before structural mechanics became the common language of structural engineers, buildings were built based on observed behavior, with every new solution incurring high levels of risk.

Understanding Structures brings the art and science of structures into the environment of a computer game. The book imparts a basic understanding of how buildings and bridges resist gravity, wind, and earthquake loads. Its interactive presentation of topics spans elementary concepts of force in trusses to bending of beams and the response of multistory, multi-bay frames. Formulate Graphical and Quantitative Solutions with GOYA The companion software, GOYA, runs easily on any java-enabled system. This interactive learning environment allows engineers to obtain quick and instructive graphical and quantitative solutions to many problems in structures.

But despite the importance of the social network in our country, there has been no single source of information about this critical component of our society. Even professionals in the field of social work or social services have not had a comprehensive volume addressing the myriad features of this critical societal structure. The Encyclopedia of Canadian Social Work fills this need. Over five hundred topics important to Canadian social work are covered, written by a highly diverse group of social workers covering all aspects of the field and all areas of the country. Practitioners, policy makers, academics, social advocates, researchers, students, and administrators present a rich overview of the complexity and diversity of social work and social welfare as it exists in Canada. The principal finding from this project underscores the long-held perception that there is a Canadian model of social work that is unique and stands as a useful model to other countries. The Encyclopedia of Canadian Social Work will be an important source of information, both to Canadians and to interested groups around the world. The Encyclopedia of Canadian Social Work is available in e-book version by subscription or from university and college libraries through the following vendors: Canadian Electronic Library, Ebrary, MyiLibrary, and Netlibrary.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=StvfAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle Will and the Fitzgerald curse","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jKoDzgEACAAJ&dq=Uncle+Will+and+the+Fitzgerald+curse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psydececk","description":"Traumatized by past sexual abuse, Jesse lives in a world torn apart. Unknown aspects of her character take charge whenever she feels threatened and split away from an awareness of her whole self. Having survived and grown into adulthood with dissociative disorder, she now stands at a precipice of crisis, teetering on unstable ground, which may crumble, descending to the loss of her marriage, sanity, and life. Rose, an enigmatic healer whose lineage traces back to the mystical teachings of Mary Magdalene, enters Jesse's ordinary worldview and reveals the transformative realm of spiritual healing and self-actualization. Together with the skill of psychologist Dr. William Blackburn, these healers assist in reuniting the shattered elements of Jesse's soul, by teaching her how to integrate her heart, mind, body, and spirit. Jesse's poignant venture launches her awareness beyond the boundaries of her concept of self. She is guided to land upon the transcendent territory of the infinite potential of her soul. From the cellular release of painful body memories to the healing integration of her personality, Jesse's tale of visionary evolution reveals the gnosis, or inner knowing of the Magdalene's legacy of sacred marriage.

Hip, helpful, and humorous, City Dharma teaches you how to keep your cool even when the road to enlightenment leads you straight through downtown at rush hour. When we're cut off in traffic, crammed on the subway, or elbowed aside on a crowded street, such thoughtless or aggressive behavior can make our blood pressure rise and our serenity disappear.

City Dharma is the essential guide for everyone living in the accelerated world most of us call home. Offering smart, practical ways to overcome daily stresses and the crazy-making reactivity of our own minds, Jeon explores the most challenging aspects of modern urban and suburban life, including: Another Day, Another Dollar Avoid Working Stiffness Walking Down a Dark Alley Awareness and Violence Sex and the City Dharma Seeking Love vs. Expressing Love Scaring Ourselves to Death Transcending Media Negativity Road Rage Dealing with Mad Max Within and Without Drawing wisdom from the ancient Eastern teachings of Advaita Vedanta and filled with engaging stories, City Dharma offers a new way of seeing the world--one that is based on connection rather than separation, direct experience rather than belief, and love instead of fear.
