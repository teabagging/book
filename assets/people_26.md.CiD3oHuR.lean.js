As for the idiotic scene where an imposter collects the hero from the Swiss police, well that sealed my opinion of JF as a novelist.If this is the best that JF can do then heaven help those who thought this was \\"riveting\\" and \\"thrilling\\", have they never read a really good novel by talented writers? Read the novels of Robert Ludlum, Tom Clancy, Frederick Forsythe and although in a different era and genre read the fabulous books of Bernard Cornwell and Wilbur Smith.

This is one of his early stories and a good one. A Matter of Honour is an espionage thriller in the days of the Cold War. Archer weaves a complex and exciting plot which leaves you breathless until nearly the last page.As well as being a best selling author, Archer lived an successful life as a UK Cabinet minister and life peer until this was ended by his conviction and subsequent imprisonment for perjury. Despite all of these traumas his story telling skills have not diminished over the years.His latest book - Sins of the Father in the Clifton Chronicles series (this book contains a sample of the first chapter) - still has his magic touch. While his latest book was released outside the US in mid March it will surprisingly not be released in the US until May 8.

Once it takes off, which doesnt take long with Jeffery Archer, it REALLY takes off. I would like to compare it with the Bourne Identity movies, just action packed. A game of cat and mouse at its best.A little about the author, Jeffery Archer was the youngest memeber of the House of Commons in 1969, apointed Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party 1985, Moved up to the House of Lords 1992. Bascially this guy was a big fish in the British Goverment. He wrote a couple of books, one of which \\"Not a Penny more, Not a Penny less\\" I think is magnificent and has about the same pace as this book. He was sent to prison in 2001 after a sex scandal which rocked...i want to say the world...but i can't be sure...Anyway the book starts off with a Adam Scott recieving his Father's will which contains a mysterious envelope......KGB, CIA and SAS all want it. He doesnt find out until after he gets it, by then everybody in the world and their highly trained assasins are after him. Being British he tries to run to them, but for the sake of the plot, they keep screwing up and he is always one step ahead of the russian assasin who REALLY loves killing people. Plus to add wood to the fire, the cops want him for a muder he did not commit.All this may sound over the top, but Archer weaves it superbly, making it unbelivably fast paced.The book being from a british author has a heap of british words, Trouser-Pants, Phoned-Called, Lift-Elevator and so forth. so it might be a little irritating if you do not know what he means, but honestly this little gripe doesn't in any way compare to the way the book is written."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Topnotch voice performer Martin Jarvis, remembered for his outstanding reading of \\"As The Crow flies,\\" gives another vital, arresting reading of this thriller by master storyteller Jeffrey Archer.With a seemingly unending supply of plots and ploys Archer has penned another fast moving tale.

Tiedemann)"},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read extensively out of Jeffrey Archers repetoire and have found all of the books not only palatiable, but also intriguing reads.I read this book 5 years ago, and make it a point to read it at least once a year if not more. This book was one of the best fiction books ever written as far as I am concerned.It is so easy for the fiction author to fall into a trap and write the same old news, sometimes in a tired, but different way. These books are not interesting. Any author who can offer a breath of fresh air to the genre recieves my hats off, and this is due to jeffrey Archer.This book isn't typical at all, the plot twists are entirely tough to predict,and even though the ending should have been a forgone conclustion (the hero winning) it was done in such a way that I was still very much interested.The basis of the story is a guy named Adam who is led through many adventures because of an archaic note he got from his fathers will. This letter to his father was written in german, and in trying to get it translated the adventure begins.His journey and escapes follow across most of Europe, and the action never stops. Somewhat like a James Bond flick, but 100 times better, and in book form is what I would compare this exciting read to.Read this book, and when you are done, read all the rest of Archers books, you will enjoy each and every one of them."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There are basically two distinct types of Jeffrey Archer books:a) Epic character-driven tales of lifelong ambition and struggle ('Kane And Abel', 'Prodigal Daughter', 'First Among Equals', 'As The Crow Flies', 'The Fourth Estate', 'Sons of Fortune')b) Relatively lean and fast-paced political thrillers ('Shall We Tell The President', 'Honour Among Thieves', 'Eleventh Commandment').'A Matter Of Honour' falls into the second category, and is yet another entertaining Archer thriller. Young ex-soldier Adam Scott is left a mysterious envelope in his father's will, and the contents soon find him being persued all over Europe by agents of the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as his own Foreign Office. What is the significance of the object Adam's father was bequeathed, and how does it relate to the Soviets' sudden propaganda campaign in the West? There is also the question of the Scott family's \\"disgrace\\", and whether Adam can use the object to finally restore his late father's honour.This is a good book, and fans of Archer's work will find plenty to love here. The characterisation is fairly standard Archer, which means it could be seen as a little cliche'd at times. Certainly Adam is very much an \\"Archer hero\\" who can endure all manner of phyiscal and intellectual challenges while still charming the pants off any girl he meets, and Romanov is the ruthless villan who'd kill his own close friends and lovers in cold blood to get what he wants. However, there are some surprisingly well-drawn side characters, in particular the increasingly enigmatic Lawrence as the friend who may or may not have sold Adam out, and the headstrong tomboyish Robin, whose fluent lying gets Adam out of several tight spots.In typical Archer fashion, he blends fact with fiction, incorporating real people and events into the narrative to give it a genuine believability. Archer always came up with intruging plots for his thrillers, and the basis for this book is quite clever; a way to potentially humiliate and humble the United States without resorting to thriller cliches like bombs, disasters, or super weapons. And as with some of his other works, parts of the ending are left open, with not every question answered or secret revealed.If you enjoyed Archer's other thrillers, you'll like this book. A good and fairly easy read. Four stars."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although the details of Mr. Archer's personal life rival the plots of his novels - from near bankruptcy, to Britain's political inner circles, to prison cell - none of it gets in the way of his well-deserved reputation as an outstanding storyteller.Next to \\"Kane & Abel\\" and \\"As the Crow Flies\\" this book is among my three favorites from Archer and I highly recommend it.Set in the summer of 1966 with Lyndon Johnson in the White House, Harold Wilson at #10 Downing, and Leonid Brezhnev in the Kremlin, \\"A Matter of Honor\\" pits a most resourceful but unlikely British protagonist, Adam Scott, against an equally resourceful Soviet antagonist, Alexander Romanov.When Adam's father, a disgraced military officer, dies, he leaves to his only son the princely sum of 500 pounds and two letters. The first is a missive from Adam's father, explaining the events that led to his resignation from the military, the circumstances that led to his possession of the second letter, and an expression of confidence that his son would conduct himself honorably should he decide to open the second letter and pursue whatever secrets it might contain. When Scott's curiosity gets the best of him, he opens the second letter and finds that it is from a now-dead elite member of Hitler's Third Reich - a man that Scott's father had been assigned to guard during the Nuremberg trials.As one might guess, it is this second letter that proves to be the crux of the story. It leads Scott to a bank vault, deep beneath the streets of Zurich, containing an obscure work of Russian art - an icon - smuggled out of the country during the downfall of Czar Nikolai II. At the same time, the Kremlin has learned that this painting contains a secret that could forever shift the balance of power from West to East at the height of the cold war. Romanov, a rising KGB star, is tasked with finding the icon and returning it to the Motherland so its embedded secret can be unveiled to the world. While Romanov is not told the nature of the secret, he knows only that its contents must be acted on within 30 days and the clock is ticking.The ensuing chase reveals that Mr. Scott's will to survive and ability to think on his feet are indeed a match for the best the KGB has to offer. It also presents an opportunity for Scott to restore his father's - and his family's - honor. Hence, the name of the book.Archer gives us an outstanding plot that is authentically placed amidst the political tensions of the mid-1960s. I enjoyed every moment of this book. The characters are nicely developed, the cheetah-like pace kept me turning the pages until well into the night, and the story had an ending that while rather predictable, was highly satisfying nonetheless.If you enjoy a good political thriller from the world as it was 40 years ago, along with a healthy dose of Mr. Archer's formidable imagination, don't pass up this book."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I recommend this book highly.It seemed so innocent. A totally disgraced British colonel Scott sends a mysterious letter to his one and only son. The moment young 17 year old Adam Scott opens the yellowing and fragile envelope, he sets into motion a deadly chain of events that threatens to shake the very foundations and pilars of the free world.Within days, Adam's lover is brutally murdered by the men that his father set in motion and he's running for his life through the great cities of Europe, pursued not only by the KGB, but by the CIA and his own countrymen as well. Their common intent is to kill him before the truth comes out, before the truth comes out.These powerful men in smoke and cannabish-filled rooms plot ever more genious means of killing him dead dead dead, Adam finds himself betrayed, sad, and abandoned even by those he holds most dear.When at last he comes to understand what he is in possession of, he's even more determined to protect it, for it's more than a matter of life and death-it's a matter of honor to his lover (rest his soul), his mother and his brothers and sister."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It's 1966, and Adam Scott received 500 pounds and an envelope in his father's will.

When Adam retrieves the icon moments ahead of him, he suddenly finds his girlfriend dead, and himself on the run from the KGB, the CIA, British Intelligence, and the Swiss police. Armed with only a small amount of money and his own wits, can he survive the hunt - and restore his family's lost honor?There is no doubt his novel heavily influenced Dan Brown (Da Vinci Code), as the elements of a hunted man, an enemy with only a code name, and a hero who seizes opportunities all come into play."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The adventure begins when Adam Scott, a former captain enlisted in the army, has a yellowed envelope bestowed upon him in his father's will. To discover what its content is, he visits a Swiss bank with his girlfriend, Heidi, from clues in the letter placed in the envelope. Meanwhile trouble brews in Russia due to a painting called &quot;the Czar's icon&quot; of Saint George and the dragon among Russian agents of the KGB.It seems that the painting, which has been lost for 15 years, contains a concealed document that marks a compromise between the United States and the Soviet Union that will be invalid in a few days (on June, 20,1966, to be exact). At the same moment, Adam discovers that the icon was the object bequethed to him, unaware of the dilemma in Russia. It is then when Heidi is kidnapped and murdered by Alex Romanov, leader of the search for the icon, that the Englishman realizes the Russians will do anything to retrieve the icon back. Running across Europe for his life and to reach England, he is pursued by agents of the CIA, the KGB, and his own countrymen. 'A Matter of Honor' is not only intriguing but conveys morals that everyone needs to grasp and the love of a son for his father we all comprehend.

When he died, he had little to leave his family, other than the taint of that resignation and an unopened letter from a Nazi war criminal. Adam, his son, inherits the letter and takes a simple one day trip to Switzerland to retrieve the contents of a bank box the letter refers to. From that moment on, Adam's life is anything but simple. Chased by the Americans, the Russians, the Swiss and the British, and unaware of the secret he's got in his possession, Adam has to get to safety. First, he has to solve the mystery of his inheritance, figure out where safety is and who he can trust, and manage to stay alive doing it all.The secret itself seems a tad silly, but other than that, the story is fast-paced and very easy to follow, putting it a little bit above some overly convoluted thrillers I've read.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"EDUCATION OF PHILLIPS BROOKS (Studies in Angelican History)","review":"I have read this wonderful book, written by a friend and neighbor - I chanced on this link while looking up Phillips Brooks, who was quoted on my home page this morning.

This book chronicles in a lively fashion the birth of the school that in turn gave birth to actors like Meryl Streep and playwrights like Christopher Durang. And this is all while Yale could at any moment be burned to the ground by the radicals of the 1960's and 70's -- people who often made New Haven their headquarters. This is a time when theater could lead to riots, arrests, and the resignation of the President of the United States.MAKING SCENES is one of the side-stories of the rebirth of the American Theater, although to call it a side-story may be selling it short. The revival of regional theater was spearheaded by Yale Rep, which then spearheaded the revival of Broadway and Hollywood. Brustein tells a great story that just happens to be true, an homage to the visions and revisions of some remarkable artists."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"With all the attention focused on DC/Vertigo's Hellblazer series (mainly thanks to the Constantine movie), this original graphic novel is great for long time Hellblazer readers and new fans to the series as well. Written by current series scribe Mike Carey and penciled by series artist Leonardo Manco, All His Engines finds John Constantine and his best mate Chas Chandler traveling from England to Los Angeles when Chas' grandaughter Tricia falls under a mysterious coma: along with children all over the planet. In between, we are given glimpses of Constantine's past as he uses his connections and various manipulative abilities, magical and otherwise, to save Tricia. All His Engines features the best the Hellblazer series has to offer: dark and gothic settings featuring the most interesting and enjoyable anti-hero in comics today. This handsome hardcover graphic novel is a nice package to get your hands on, but you'll be wishing it was a bit longer. All in all, whether your new to the world of Hellblazer or not, consider this worth picking up."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"\\"John Constantine, Hellblazer: All his Engines\\" is a brand new and original graphic novel written by Mike Carey with art by Leonardo Manco. As a Hellblazer fan ever since the blokes first appearance in Swamp Thing # 37, I can tell you it's one of the finest stories yet. When the granddaughter of Constantine's friend Chas goes into an unexplainable coma, he contacts John to try and help. Little Tricia is just one of dozens of victims of this same mysterious affliction. Constantine soon finds there is demonic influence at work which leads him and Chas to Los Angeles and the mansion of a demon named Beroul.Beroul and several other demons have decided to open up their own, little parcels of hell on Earth...think of it like a franchise. Beroul wants Constantine to eliminate the competition and is holding little Tricia as ransom to secure his services. Constantine can cause no harm to Beroul without risking the life of Tricia as he has her soul imprisoned within his own fat, putrid body. There's a marvelously wicked scene when John first encounters Beroul at his swimming pool...a foul built-in, filled with decaying bodies that the demon is liquefying down in order to bathe in...Constantine is up against it again. He finds his only recourse may be to make a deal with an immortal being even worse than the demons...an Aztec God of Death!\\"All His Engines\\" is typical of most Hellblazer stories with John making a mistake in judgment that leads to the death of an associate and in generally puts his friends in danger. And of course, in typical fashion John gets the snot kicked out of him on a number of occasions. But as ever, he proves his ultimate resourcefulness, particularly in dealing with Beroul's competition. You get a good idea of why just about every demon in the underworld would love his head on the end of a pole.Hellblazer has always had artists who do a wonderful job of capturing the palpable darkness that is Constantine's world and Leonardo Manco is no exception. His depictions of the various demons and the Death God are truly horrific. The use of this being of a near forgotten mythology comes off as brilliant in its execution.The book concludes with some fantastic resource information about the character and his creation by Alan Moore twenty years ago. Hard to believe it's been that long. Great story!Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"I liked the comment below that \\"All His Engines\\" was a lot like a Hellblazer \\"sitcom\\". I think that's dead on (except for the nauseating scenes of horror and violence that are typically omitted from a show like \\"The Jeffersons\\"). This graphic novel actually \\"feels\\" somewhat different from the typical \\"Hellblazer\\" collection. Almost all of the previous 14 Hellblazer compilations are just that - volumes that collect and compile serially published issues from the \\"Vertigo\\" comic series. But this one was written and conceived as a singular work under one cover, so the pacing is a bit different, and there is a lot less recapping and repetition in the work as a result. It makes for a very satisfying read, as a result.\\"All His Engines\\" was my first exposure to Carey's work, and I was fairly impressed. While he doesn't have the bawdy irreverence and depravity of someone like Ennis, or the sheer inventiveness and snarkiness of someone like Warren Ellis, he knows how to tell a good, dark, horror story with amusing elements...in fact, he reminds me a lot of \\"Buffy's\\" creator Josh Wheden. And Leonardo Marcos, is, for my money, one of the most compelling and interesting graphic artists working today. Not since the glory days of Totleben and Veitch have I seen an artist who manages to combine fetishism, comedy and drama so well and so consistently. In the words of a critic in another context, \\"Let's give him a million dollars so he can draw comics forever. Or more importantly, less give him a million dollars on the CONDITION that he draw comics forever.\\"Their collaboration results in a cracking good \\"Hellblazer\\" story, one that remains true to the established roots of the character - the working class street magician, his family and friends, his peers and enemies - and also manages to bring in a new set of ideas to the world of black magic and the supernatural. I especially enjoyed the Carey's use of the Aztec \\"Death God\\" as a element of culture class between modern day \\"white\\" and \\"hispanic\\" mythologies - and Marcos' depiction of the Death God was at once both exactly what you would expect, and yet still impressive and scary.So great plot, great pacing, snappy dialog, great art, more than a bit of action and violence and demons ripping each others heads off, a very tricky and satisfying resolution to the dilemma (that was still typical of Constantine's use of trickery, bluff, and misdirection)...and also a few unaffected glimpses of both the enigma and the sadness of Constantine himself.I like it. I like it a lot. More, please."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"There's about a dozen and a half entries now in the gritty series about John Constantine, master black magician of a very non-traditional sort. In this one, a \\"coma plague\\" has begun disrupting the world, including the young daughter of one of Constantine's best mates in London. The highly original cause is a series of \\"start-up\\" hells on Earth by lesser demons tired of their place in the satanic hierarchy. In their quest to halt the plague and retrieve the girl's soul, Constantine and his buddy end up in Los Angeles (where else?) and conflict ensues. This is a very noir graphic novel, better than most, but it's a little heavy on the British street slang. The art, though, is first-rate."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"Mike Carey, John Constantine, Hellblazer: All His Engines (DC Comics, 2005)I'll admit, I was one of those who thought that the departure of Garth Ennis from the Hellblazer fold was going to be synonymous with the gradual falling off in quality that would ultimately result in the title's death. Well, it's been a number of years now, and John Constantine has gotten himself drawn by a whole bunch of different artists, and he always seems to come out pretty clean in the wash. The newest (as of now) title in the series, All His Engines, has the look and feel of a sitcom episode more than anything else-- John finds himself pulled into negotiations between a number of different demons, and with characteristic style and panache, manages to make everything come out right in the end by outfoxing the smarmy so-and-sos. There are tendrils leading to books before (and, one figures, groundwork laid for the next series or two), but All His Engines is very much a self-contained episode. This makes it an excellent place to start if you're not yet familiar with the series, is the writing and artwork is competent; it doesn't have the flair of some of the earlier episodes, but you won't get lost in the plot, either."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"All His Engines is the first of Mike Carey's Hellblazer storied to have made it to graphic novel form and the 15th of the graphic novels. In this tale Constantine is asked by Cas to find out why his granddaughter Tricia who has fallen into an unexplainable coma. To save her life, Constantine ends up in LA with Cas where more people have also fallen victim to this strange phenomenon. Eventually Constantine finds out that a demon has decided to form a hell on earth and are using the souls of those in comas to start up. But because the demon has trapped Tricia inside his heart, Constantine is forced to work with him or the girl will die. But John has never been one to allow that sort of detail to get in his way, and he pulls of a rare rescue. The tale is entirely self contained, so those who do not have a knowledge of the Hellblazer books can enjoy with out context.The story offers a lot more then a romp in the cynical world of John Constantine, Carey uses complex Central American mythology to give Constante and enemy and ally of unusual proportions. The use of Gods and as well as demons is an very cool twist and worth the time to dig out a little information on the gods refrenced, if you aren't familiar with them. The story has some radically non-linear moments, which caused me at least to got flipping back to re-read things which had happened before and go...oh, yeah, I missed that bit...But as someone who loves complex story arcs I could not object. Carey, who became famous for Lucifer, is just as good here, if not better.The artist is Leonard Manco, who I had not read anything by before, but who does a wonderful job. The art is dark and gritty with thick black lines and heavy shadow. Even better, all the characters look their ages, Constantine his almost fifty years and Cas as well. There panel layouts are interesting, but never hard to follow.Looking through it again, I have to say All His Engines is a wonderful beginning to Mike Carey's run on Hellblazer."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"All his engines is an incredible story filled with what you come to expect from Constantine.

A great one to add to your collection, and also a great way to start your Hellblazer craze. Five stars all the way"},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"When I first read this over a year ago, I thought All His Engines was one of the best comic books I'd read. I was new to the world of John Constantine, and Neil Gaiman's quote on the front cover may have skewed my opinion a bit (\\"...the quintessential Constantine story...\\"). Since that time, I started buying the monthly title (being written by Peter Milligan), and I've read a number of the collected trades (Delano, Ennis). When reading this again recently, I found that my initial opinions were premature. All His Engines isn't the grand spectacle I saw it as. It's actually just your standard, run-of-the-mill Hellblazer story.John is enlisted to help save his best friend's granddaughter from a demon who creates his own hells on earth. If you're already a Hellblazer fan, you can expect everything to work out the way it usually does, with John caught between a rock and a hard place, someone accidentally dying, and John playing the demons like cards in the end. This is the Hellblazer format. And no Hellblazer story is as standard as All His Engines.Don't get me wrong, the story is still great! The writing is masterly, and the art is awesome. Just don't expect the best (unless you haven't read another Hellblazer story, in which case, you'll be floored).writing: [7.5/10]art: [9/10]"},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"Competition is a natural and contentious fact of life when obtaining the rights to any franchise. Things can certainly get down and dirty, and in this latest trade from the decadent mind of Mike Carey, the topic of discussion is not the opening of another 7-11. We are talking about franchises from Hell. This new manner of ghoulish venture may come as a shocking surprise to most, but probably not to one John Constantine. Many perturbing and disturbing players are in the market for being your unfriendly neighborhood Hell merchant, with no depths too low to sink to for their exclusive rights. The granddaughter of John's friend Chas is just one of the many innocent victims of the leading \\"entrepreneur\\", thus setting the stage for his involvement. Deals are brokered and subsequently and unsurprisingly broken, with John once again needing to pull the proverbial rabbit out of a hat to save the day. His final bit of legerdemain is somewhat puzzling and perplexing involving more smoke and mirrors than logic, but isn't that usually the case with magicians, or more befitting Constantine, conmen or charlatans. John is quite comfortable in a game of high stakes poker, or in this case chicken, and thanks to him our local neighborhoods were kept safe from this expansion of evil enterprises. Mike Carey's wicked imagination usually takes us on a delightful detour through the bowels of Hell itself. This time around he travelled down a different path, exploring the chilling prospects of branches of Hell on Earth, and what a nightmare they would be. After all, the last thing anyone wants is a chain of Hell's Kitchens, Hells Bells, or Hell R Us on every corner."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"Up front, I'll confess that I've read and currently own every issue of the ongoing/monthly HELLBLAZER comic. It's a weird and often terrifying comic, which is odd because I rarely read horror novels and never attend horror movies; can't stand them. Nonetheless, I'm a devoted fan of HELLBLAZER, so I can lay claim to at least one very dark corner in my soul.That said, I enthusiastically recommend this self-contained and original graphic novel to fans of horror and dark urban fantasy literature. ALL HIS ENGINES is NOT a collection of previously published comics; it stands on its own and delivers a satisfyingly chilling overview of the dreadful world through which Constantine travels, this time accompanied by his longtime friend, Chas, for whom he is on a mission of mercy. Carey's take on the characters is dead-on, and Leonardo Manco's art--well, what can I say? \\"Unforgettable\\" sums it up.Everything that makes Constantine enjoyable, irksome and darkly compelling is on display. He's the kind of fellow of whom you are simultaneously afraid yet wish you were more like. The big brother you're glad you never had, but that you hope shows up when the existential chips are down.ALL HIS ENGINES is dark, sticky and macabre, but in a good way. Recommended only for grownups comfortable with their mortality; children and the easily nauseated would do well to avoid it.And, finally, one small caution: Once you read this novel, you'll want to know more. Be forewarned that Constantine's life, however, is not something to be explored without trepidation. Some things, once learned, for good or ill, you carry with you for the rest of your life. You've been warned."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"A rash of unexplained comas have been happening, and when a little girl that Chas is related to is affected, Chas calls John in and asks him for a favor.When he starts digging, he finds a demon, and Hell franchising out into the mortal world.

Marco's art is both detailed and dark. The cityscapes are well rendered, reminding me of Director Michael Mann's panoramic shots of Los Angeles in \\"Collateral\\".The story features John Constantine's hard bitten chicanery and ability to hoodwink Hell's own. Casual fans will enjoy this work as much as hardcore Hellblazer-heads."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"I recently saw the movie, Constantine, not noing anything about it. I knew that it was based on a comic, but I didn't know which. After seeing the movie, I bought Constantine: The Hellblazer Collection. This book was good and reprinted some good stories, but I thought the art was too classicy and the stories tried too hard. Then I saw this book in a store. It was wrapped in plasic so I couldn't look at the art. I looked at the Constantine books and still didn't like the art. I bought this book, taking a chance, and loved it. When I got out of the store, I started reading it and couldn't put it down. It's about Constantine (who really isn't like how the moie portrays him) and him bargaining with this demon for a little firls life. Chaz, from the movie, is in it and is not a punk kid! He's a grandfather! Overall I thought this book was good. I like the art and story. Thanks to Constantine the movie I have discovered other good series too, like Sandman. YOu should try those books too."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"I have vivid memories of stopping at the local comic store when I was a kid, and picking up the latest issue of Alan Moore's amazing SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING series: It was issue #37, the introduction of a new character named John Constantine. I've been there since John started, and I have to say that Mike Carey's ALL HIS ENGINES is a puzzler to me. It's a barely standard Constantine story, elevated a bit by Leonardo Manco's art, and it makes me wonder why DC chose to give THIS story the deluxe hardcover treatment? It probably had something to do with timing- Keanu Reeves' CONSTANTINE film was just hitting theaters when ALL HIS ENGINES was originally released in hardcover, and DC doubtlessly wanted a big-ticket item to have on the shelves simultaneously. ALL HIS ENGINES is standard Constantine, and long-time readers will know all of the beats by heart: Someone near-and-dear to John gets in a Supernatural bind, John reluctantly agrees to help them, discovers that the scope of the problem is bigger than he thought, it looks like John is screwed, but then he makes a deal with one of the Satanic big-dogs, ultimately double-crossing them and saving the day, and all is right with the world.ALL HIS ENGINES may be, barely, enjoyable for newer HELLBLAZER fans, but old-timers like myself have already been there and back numerous times already."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: All His Engines","review":"Mike Carey and Leonardo Manco's run on Hellblazer was okay, but nothing spectacular. Hellblazer has been consistently losing readers for several years now (all you have to do is look at the sales figures), and something I read on a messageboard summed it up perfectly. \\"Hellblazer is like an old friend that you can't get rid of\\" - you don't particular love to read the book, but you continue reading it because you've been reading it for a long time. This is Vertigo's longest running title, and I can't help the feeling that even though it's not particularly good, they keep publishing it because they've always published it.Which makes me wonder why they bother having an original graphic novel when it's the same creative team on the regular book at the time that they published it - this is basically six months worth of individual issues all published at once, instead of being collected afterwards. The problem with this book is the same problem with all current Hellblazer books - nothing ever happens. Obviously, since John Constantine is always going to be around, they can't make dramatic changes to his character, and after one the-world-is-ending story after another, and another, and another, you never really feel that it matters.Essentially, Hellblazer has become a story about the freakshow side attractions and the supporting cast. Which is what this story is about. Like every Hellblazer story, a problem is introduced in the beginning, the problem is solved at the end, but through and through, we're exactly the same at the end as we were at the beginning. Sure, lots of people and demons die in the process, but they're not characters we care about or are emotionally invested in. Honestly, the sameness makes it boring. I suppose there's really no reason for this book to exist except to cash in on the mediocre Constantine movie. The other reviewers are right - one good thing about this book is that you don't need to know anything about the long backstory of Hellblazer to enjoy this book.So I guess when it comes down to it, if you're already a Hellblazer reader, this is nothing that you haven't seen before (and you'll probably wonder why this was published separately and not in the series like I am), but if you're a brand new reader, it's decent enough a point of introduction. All this aside, evaluated on its own, the writing and storytelling is a solid B. Nothing great, but not bad. (Check out Mike Carey's much better Lucifer.) The art is actually pretty good, if you are into horror art, and gets a solid A."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

In this continuation of The Pride of Lions, where Catherine Ashbrooke and Alexander Cameron -- the first an English young lady and the second a Scottish spy -- are forced to get married after her intended challenges Alexander to a duel, pick things up where they'd left off. Catherine Cameron is back in England, heartbroken after Alexander sends her back to her family. She'll be able to start over unscathed. After all, she and Cameron were never really married, since he married her under a different name, and once she was back with her family, her own culture and political beliefs, she'll be the same spoiled person she had been before she got to spend time with Cameron and his friends and family. Meanwhile, Cameron is at war with the English, relieved that his beloved is alive and well. And now that she's gone back to her old life... out of sight, out of mind. Only things don't work out that way. They miss each other, and they would risk life and limb to be together. And with a member of the dragoons after Catherine, Catherine's family fleeing their home after its taken over by the Jacobite army, and Cameron's wanton cousin still causing mayhem, these star-crossed lovers might have to do just that.The Blood of Roses, much like The Pride of Lions, is a well-crafted and nicely woven romance mixed with an impressively accurate historical setting. Scottish history has always fascinated me, and it's always great when you encounter an author who knows her stuff. The story, while long, is never boring, going from one twist to another. Cameron and Catherine show a subtle and believable character growth throughout the book. There's nothing quite like when an author uses an equal amount of telling and showing. So many romance writers miss the mark when it comes to that. Is it laziness? A tight deadline? Lack of skills? Who knows, but Canham has been consistent so far. One thing I did not like is that she's at times repetitive with the descriptions, especially when describing the heroine's eyes. \\"Her violet eyes were moist with tears,\\" \\"She opened one violet eye,\\" \\"Cameron gazed into her blue-violet eyes,\\" etc. Fine. She has beautiful blue-violet eyes. I get it. I hate it when romance authors do this. It's almost as if they're more in love with the heroine's beauty than the hero's. Judith McNaught is guilty of doing the exact same thing. Other than that, I recommend this gorgeous novel, but you MUST read Pride of Lions first.

I wish I read The Pride of Lions before I picked this up from the library for a more complete experience but nevertheless, I enjoyed the book thoroughly; the story and characters will linger in my head for many days to come.This is a very well-written historical romance. Technically, her description is vivid; so many ways to describe the changing colours of the sky, landscape and weather. Historically, this book is rich in history; its accuracy amplifies the tragedy and emotional roller-coaster ride of the characters. Romantically, the love between Catherine and Alex, Deidre and Aluinn, are heart-wrenching. It contains separation, reunion, steamy love-making and courageous determination. Creatively, the plot twists are spellbinding and masterful; giving some examples would spoil the fun.Words are not enough to praise this book. I was simply transferred into another world.

He then joins the Scottish army, led by Bonnie Prince Charles, that is invading England. Not too long after that, The Scottish forces successfully occupy Derby and Catherine's family home. Catherine and Alexander enjoy a pleasant respite, but soon the Scots flee northward, knowing that they cannot continue to battle against the overwhelming English forces.L However, as Scotland battles for its independence, Catherine is forced to flee her English haven for the protection of her husband. Still, Catherine is captured by Alexander's sworn enemy English Captain Hamilton Garner. With a great battle coming soon at Culloden, Alexander realizes that he will have to fight Hamilton to the death in order to insure the future safety of Catherine.Historical romance fan favorite Marsha Canham provides a refreshing sequel to her extremely popular ??. THE BLOOD OF ROSES stars two popular figures from the previous novel, whose star-crossed love for each other adds to the era. However, it is the genuine feel of Scottish and English history prior to and during Culloden that makes this a wonderful eighteen century romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"The book was wonderful, I loved the storytelling. It was vivid and heart-renching. The only problem is... has anyone read Rebellion by Nora Roberts? She wrote it in the early 80's and rereleased it recently. If you haven't-read it, and then reread Canham's series- does it sound familiar? Roberts essentially wrote the same book years earlier, it seems that Canham just changed the female and male character's origins. I was so disappointed! It turns out that Pale Moon Rider resembles the poem The Highwayman from Alfred Noyes. Also, the Black Wolf de Amboise series (Last Arrow...etc) is a unique way of telling the Robin Hood Story, but even that isn't an original plot line. Anyone else notice this?"},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"Although I have gotten a little teary eyed over certain stories over the years, this is the first and only time that I actually openly wept while reading a book. After I finished reading this book I felt as if my heart had been physically snatched out of my chest, wrung out and then hung up and left to rot. I know that's a little dramatic but the emotional upheaval that this book has caused in me calls for a little drama.This is the continuing epic love story of Alex and Catherine Cameron two seemingly star crossed lovers who are repeatedly torn apart by the events that take place during and after the doomed Jacobite rebellion of 1745. The author's vivid descriptions of this dark period in Scotland's history brought to vivrant life a bit of history I knew nothing about. Through Ms. Canham's flawless writing I was able to feel Catherine's despair at having to see her husband go off to war without knowing if she'd ever see him again. Also, I was able to comprehend her inability, at first, to understand what drove her husband and the other Highlanders to fight agaisnt such insurmountable odds. On the other hand, Alexander's desperate attempts to shield his wife from the ugliness of war and to keep her safe from the repercussions that would surely some after the debacle was over were equally vivid. His attempts to keep her safe were met with derision by Catherine who now considers herself a Scot and is determined to take her place by her husband's side even if it means giving up the gilded world of the aristocracy and putting her life on the line. Catherine's believable evolution from a selfish, self centered girl to a mature, strong woman who will do anything for the man she loves is a testament to this author's skill as a writer.While this is very much Alex and Catherine's story, it is also the story of a people who will fight to the death for honor. A people who are driven by a sense of loyalty so strong that they are willing to pay the ultimate price for what they believe is right.This is not an easy book to read and it is almost impossible to summarize and review in an objective manner while I'm still so emotional over it. Suffice it to say that it's an epic love story; one that I know will haunt you long after you've turned the last page. This is not say there isn't a happily ever after, there is but it is a bittersweet one.In short, I highly recommend this book to those who love historical romances but be warned that this author does not wallpaper her book with history as so many others do she uses it heavily to immerse the reader into this time period and she does it brilliantly. Highly recommended. :)"},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"This is the kind of book that I was sorry to see end, even after over 550 pages! \\"The Blood of Roses\\" is the sequel to Marsha Canham's excellent \\"The Pride of Lions\\" and is every bit as good as the first book. Set during the 1745 Jacobite uprising, it continues the story of the valiant Scottish warrior, Alexander Cameron, and his passionate English bride, Catherine Ashbrooke Cameron. I would strongly recommend reading \\"The Pride of Lions\\" first, and having \\"The Blood of Roses\\" on hand to begin *immediately* after the first book is finished in order to avoid groans and gnashing of one's teeth at the \\"end\\" of \\"The Pride of Lions\\".Fans of the \\"Outlander\\" series of books should lap these stories up since the books are similar in setting, deft characterization, thrilling, nonstop action and careful attention to historical detail. It should be noted that these books were actually written *before* \\"Outlander\\", so they are in no way derivative.I loved the character of Catherine even in \\"The Pride of Lions\\" when she was a spoiled, selfish, pampered little princess. So many heroines are given this same initial \\"Scarlett O'Hara\\" personality, but fail to engage me because that is *all* that there is to them. Catherine (like Scarlett herself) has a core of pure steel beneath her ribbons and paniers. She is every bit as tough as Alexander and is worthy of his love. In \\"The Blood of Roses\\", she has matured into a wonderful heroine--passionate, loyal, and madly in love with Alexander.Alexander is a *great* hero--a soldier of fortune and Jacobite spy who had sworn never to remarry after the murder of his teenage bride, he returns to England after fifteen years of exile on the Continent at the beginning of \\"The Pride of Lions\\", still a wanted man accused of murdering the men who were responsible for his first wife's death. He and Catherine are forced to marry following a scandalous duel, and initially they both seek to escape the union and to annul it. But that story is told in \\"The Pride of Lions\\"...\\"The Blood of Roses\\" picks up where the first story ended--Alexander and Catherine are well and truly married and in love (but separated--how frustrating!) The Jacobite army is on the march with the Camerons leading the charges and an angry and mutinous Catherine has been sent home to Derby for her protection to wait out the war (HA! As if *that* will happen!) The beginning of the book moved a bit slowly for my taste. There is alot of exposition to rehash the events of \\"The Pride of Lions\\", much commenting on how much Catherine is missing Alexander and a long description of the battle of Prestonpans (an excellent description of a thrilling battle--but a very *familiar* battle, the details of which are well known to anyone who has read the \\"Outlander\\" series and/or any other books about the Jacobite rebellion of 1745.) Don't get me wrong, I really liked all the historical detail and descriptions of real historical figures included in this book--it adds immeasurably to the richness of the tale, but our hero and heroine were separated for too darn long at the beginning of the story. Once they are reunited, the nonstop action (swordfights! battles! assaults! betrayals! black-hearted villains!) and steamy love scenes sweep the reader along to the bittersweet conclusion.This is historical romance as I love it best--a well-plotted, exciting tale of passion and adventure with memorable characters and a healthy dose of historical detail. A five star read!Highly, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"I have never read a book that I felt exhausted after reading it. It made me wonder how Ms. Canham felt after she was finished writing it??? I loved the book. I have read as many of her books as I can find and found that, even though I loved them all, this one, and the one before: &quot;Pride of Lions&quot;, are truly unmatched. I have read many books by many authors since then and no one can truly compare. However, I have just finished reading &quot;Rebellion&quot; by Nora Roberts that also was place at the time of the Battle of Culloden. In a way I wished I would have read that one first because the historical characters in that book correlate to the historical characters in this book. However, that book I would consider to be &quot;Battle of Culloden 101&quot; for historical facts, and this book, &quot;Battle of Culloden 401&quot;. It is very intense, very passionate, very bloody and very real. I could feel the swords biting into me, I cried the tears of the women waiting for words, and I could smell the blood on the various fields. Mostly, though, I can grieve over the loss of their land and their country. Even today, though they are now called the &quot;United Nations&quot; England reigns over the country and they live under the ruler of Queen Elizabeth. I wonder what those who died in that last battle would say today if they could?"},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"The &quot;Pride of Lion's&quot; and the &quot;Blood of Rose's&quot; are my favorite books to date.Very moving and touching stories. I was so moved by both that I want to write to the author and let her know this personally."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"If you like an ending where every character lives happily ever after, \\"The Blood of Roses\\" is not for you. But if you like historical romances that follow true history, this book will knock you off your chair.FIRST, A WARNING:This book is the sequel toThe Pride of Lions. If you have not read \\"The Pride\\" yet, don't read \\"The Blood of Roses\\" or even the rest of this review yet. Go right to the reviews for \\"The Pride of Lions\\", and start there. This 2 book series is one story, with the same main couple and all of the events of the war they are involved in. If you miss \\"The Pride\\", you will miss out on the story completely. Be sure to buy both books at once. \\"The Pride\\" ends in a way that will make you feel an urgent need to pick up \\"The Blood\\" and immediately continue the story. (I'm so glad I read these now. I would have hated having to wait several months for the sequel to be released when it was being written.)The Blood of Roses:Scotland is feeling the joy of victory. With less than half the men of their enemies, the English, they have succeeded to win back Scotland. They are free! The fierceness of the Scottish army has troops of thousands of English fleeing battlefields in terror. For the Scottish lairds, freedom for Scotland is enough. However, their spoiled and childish prince pushes his loyal Scots across the English border. His greed insists upon taking England under his rule.Catherine has reached her father's home. She is heart- broken that Alex sent her away. She is careful to hide his identity, protecting him by claiming that her husband is away on business. She hasn't heard a word from him in months. Has he forgotten her?Alex is discovering just how much his love for his wife consumes his thoughts. He writes Catherine a love letter that washes away her every doubt. Through Damien, he finds a way to see her.The couple do not realize they are being watched by English soldiers. When Alex must return to the war, he believes he is keeping Catherine safe by leaving her with her family. However, for a jealous English officer, this provides an opportunity to attack her. In the midst of his attack, Catherine's faithful maid beats him to death. Now Deirdre is in danger of being tried for murder. The two women must flee England and find Alex's clan for protection.The war is turning viciously to England's favor. Alex, Aluinn, and Struan fight for their lives, their clan, their home, country, and the protection of their wives. Their prince is a fool who continues to make bad decisions that destroy Scotland's chances of not only freedom, but their very survival.England feels ashamed of their past defeats. To insure their victory, the son of the English king leads an army to a final battle. Without his father knowing, he demands that the English soldiers break all rules of fair and ethical war. He plans a complete and thorough slaughter. Every man, woman, and child is fair game. Thousands will die, including many of Alex's and Catherine's closest friends and family.Marsha Canham is always sure to keep her stories as true to history as possible. Many of the characters in the book are actual people who lived and fought in Scotland. Because they are real, they die in the story just as they did in their real lives. Also, to show respect for the tragedy that the Scots faced, many of your favorite fictional characters will be lost. The last 100 pages are very hard to read, and they get harder as they go. But I found myself so desperate to see who would survive, I read them straight through. The final battle scene is graphic, but again Canham was careful not to degrade the bravery of the Scots nor the barbaric tactics of the English.When I finished the book, I found myself haunted by the outcome. This story sticks with you."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"than you will like Canham. She has great romance as well as historically interesting reading. I love this whole series."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"I'm going to start out by saying that I only rated the first book in this series 3 stars because I was bored of the battle talk & preparations (I felt it was lacking in the romance department) therefore I was very hesitant to start this book. Boy am I glad I went on to this book. I'm not one that typically likes reading about battles & such in history & that's the main reason I wasn't big on the first book but in The Blood of the Roses I felt like I was pulled right into the book & right there fighting with these people. I didn't mind it at all & was surprised to admit that I actually liked it. There was much more romance & adventure in this book then there was in Pride of the Lions. Alexander Cameron is #1 on my list of my all time favorite Hero's in books. He is one that you won't forget (or want to) for a very long time. The last 75-100 pages of this book had me crying several times & I usually don't do that but boy this is an emotional book. I just grabbed the last book in the series Midnight Honor & read the back & was a little disappointed to see that it's not going to continue on with who you are expecting it to carry on with but I'm open & I'm going to give it a try. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"Marsha Canham is a wonderful writer. I read this book a few years back, having been captivated by Alexander Cameron in The Pride Of Lions. Marsh really knows how to put her characters into the story of the history, not the just story of love and conquest. If you want a good read, and exciting ride through history, packed with intrigue and danger with a tale of romance that will keep you up until all hours of the night, read The Blood Of Roses. And I suggest you pick up a copy of Midnight Honor as soon as possible. Get swept away with Marsha Canham as often as you can."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"First of all, before you read this book, get &quot;The Pride of the Lions.&quot; Not only will you be missing out on some great moments between the main characters by heading straight to the prequel, you will also be a little confused by what is going on even if Ms. Canham explains everything very well. The romance between Alex and Catherine is too amazing to miss, though, and you should see how it all started.Here's the thing about this romance: there is a LOT of historical information--so much that I too ended up skipping over some of the longer, more boring bits that did nothing to support the love story I was so eager to return to. The love story itself is beautiful. There has never been a hero so strong, so gentle, so magnificent than Alexander Cameron, and in Catherine we find the ultimate heroine--the strong and brave woman who would defy anyone and everyone for her love.Be prepared for a lot of details, but don't let that deter you from reading this book. You will get to know some wonderful characters and you will cry and laugh and smile and get all hot and bothered as you go through this wonderful novel. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"If you're asking why that title - visit \\"The Pride of Lions\\" book!I loved both books, but I must admit this one was my favorite. The love story between Alex and Catherine has evolved - you can feel the love they share. And the historical part (I'm a history junky) was just awsome. The battle sequenced - the smell of the blood, the moaning of the wonded, the absolute silence after the battle at Culloden - it was just blood-curdling.Another must read from a great author!"},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"In my opinion, of course. The Blood of Roses picks up neatly where The Pride of Lions leaves off. Alexander Cameron has sent his new bride, Catherine Ashbrooke, back to her family home in England in an effort to keep her safe from the pending danger of war in the Highlands. This book has all the ingredients to make it an exciting read: passion, drama, mystery, treachery, bloody battles, tragedy, and the truth of history. I love novels that have ficticious characters interacting with real-life historic persons. Canham brings to life many historic figures in a manner that makes readers consider how they actually may have thought and felt during this time of war and rebellion. Prince Charles Stuart, The Duke of Cumberland, and Colonel Anne Mackintosh are portrayed believably enough, in a way that brings them to life for readers. The battles leading up to and including Culloden are described in brutal honesty, a fact I personally admire in historic novels. No sugar coating here.I could almost hear the cries of the wounded and dying as I envisioned the blood soaked field at Culloden.If you've already read The Pride of Lions, there is no way you can miss reading this book! It would be like watching a moive half way through and calling it quits.The Blood of Roses is an awesome conclusion to the story that began in The Pride of Lions. There are a score of fascinating secondary characters, both real and ficticious, that move the plot along to it's conclusion. One character in particular, Count Fanducci, emerges a tarnished hero in a manner that effects Catherine personally.All in all, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"I have read both The Pride of Lions and The Blood of Roses. From the moment Alexander Cameron was introduced, I loved him. I cried when he and Catherine were seperated. I cheered when the were reunited. While reading the books, I went through every emotion know to man. I absolutely treasure both books."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"From the first page the reader is again &quot;sucked in&quot; to the saga of Alexander and Catherine Cameron. Bonnie Prince Charlie et al are on the march and are heading for London. Catherine hasn't seen Alexander for three months and is beginning to wonder if she has been fooled by the physical impact of their union into thinking her marriage is a cut above that of others. Enter Alexander to quell such thoughts. But now that he is in England (in the midst of an encampment of Dragoons lead by none other than his nemesis, Hamilton Garner)how can he rejoin BPC? Will the two lovers live long enough to celebrate their first anniversary? Of course, Catherine doesn't want to be left behind either. Ms. Canham has again used the historical foil of the Rising of the '45 as a backdrop to her story of the star-crossed couple. The details include many historical facts that are usually left out of the recent flow of romantic novels written about this era. Her inclusion of t! hese facts serves to make the novel of even greater interest than the normal swash buckler. Hats off again to Marsha Canham!"},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"Although &quot;The Blood Of Roses&quot; is a sequel to Marsha Canham's &quot;The Pride Of Lions,&quot; this novel can stand on its own. I would suggest reading the prequel first, however, as it is also an excellent book and details the beginnings of Scotland's Jacobite uprising along with relating the story of how the principle characters meet.English Lady Catherine Ashbrooke Cameron and her beloved Scottish husband, Alexander Cameron, the &quot;Camshroinaich Dubh,&quot; (Black Cameron), met and married in the whirlwind novel &quot;The Pride Of Lions.&quot; Now, with a price on his head, wanted by the English and his many enemies, and the target of at least one paid assassin, Alexander takes Catherine to his home in the Highlands while he and his clan plan to wage war on the English and place Prince Charles Edward Stuart, (Bonnie Prince Charlie), on the thrones of Scotland and England.The story of the rebellion is meticulously researched, as are the conflicts between the clans, the Prince and his general. This is an extraordinary period in history and a tragic one. There is plenty of romance here - between the once spoiled young English noblewoman and Alexander Cameron, the man she gives up her wealth and home for. A second intense and passionate romance comes into play also between Catherine's lady's maid Deidre and Alexander's best friend, Aluinn MacKail.As usual, Ms. Canham writes with style and captures the 18th century time period, the strife, battles and the intensity of the relationships with realism and passion. Her characters are three dimensional and seem to leap right off the page. It is also difficult not to feel terrible sorrow for the doomed Scots with the foreknowledge of the Battle of Culloden Moor and its horrific aftermath. I highly recommend this page-turner.JANA"},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"After reading Pride of Lions, I was on a mission to find Blood of Roses. Thankfully, Amazon.com came through. Too bad Marsha Canham didn't. Sadly, I found this book dragging and reminiscent of a college history course. As an avid reader, I attack books with a voracious appetite: this left me actually bored. I am thrilled that others enjoyed it so much, but as for me, I like a little more romance and a lot less blood. Although it is stunningly accurate historically,( I am married to a Scot who is part of the historic Clan Donald) romantically its lacking."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is a GOOD book but..... I found myself skipping quite a few pages that seemed to be bogged down with too many details about war etc. etc. The central story of Alexander and Catherine was terrific. It was heartwarming, exciting and passionate, all the elements I look for in a romance novel. I normally like my romance novels to be &quot;light&quot; &amp; &quot;entertaining&quot;. As I stated, this book is GOOD, (O.K., maybe better than good)and I commend the author for her historical accurancy, but some parts were slow and I found I just wasn't interested. I do hope there will be another book with these characters. They spent too much time apart in this one and I'd like to read about their time together,as they were in The Pride of Lions."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"The Pride of Lions and Blood of Roses tells the love story between Catherine and Alexander against the backdrop of the Jacobite uprising in Scotland. unfortunatley, while book 2 is very well written, and keeps the reader engrossed, it tends to put our lovers story in the baground to the actual battles between england and scotland. For those who like a happy ending, and everything tied up nice and neat, this is not that book. While I read both books when they first came out several years ago, they still made me cry reading them again today. I love these 2 characters and will always love these two books, but whish that Ms Canham would write a third book to let us know what happened to those who survived and provide us the happy ending for our couple that we yearn for."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"I loved this book!

I read Outlander and its impact on me has been tremendous. Since then, I have read many Highlander books in search of another book that can capture Scotland and its beauty in the same manner. The Blood of Roses is as good as Outlander. Buy it, read it, savor it. Its brutal, beautiful and captivating.

Alexander and Catherine had one of the most beautiful and tortured love stories I have ever had the pleasure to read. I will admit however, that the scene of Deirdre O'Shay and Aluinn MacKail on the battlefield made me cry more than I have ever cried over a book in my life! I have never been so touched by secondary characters in all my years of reading. I cried so much I had to stop reading until I could calm down. Even years later, all I have to do is think about that scene and I get choked up all over again!

I can't say enough how much I loved this book."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"I can't possibly say it better than \\"gigibookworm.\\" She expressed my feelings exactly. I cried my heart out through this book, particularly the last half. I knew what I was heading into in THE BLOOD OF ROSES after finishing the first book in the series, THE PRIDE OF LIONS. Historically savvy, I knew what was going to happen, but Marsha Canham explicitly describes what the history books leave out.I am now reading the third novel about Colonel Anne and am expecting to cry throughout it as well. It is so hard to accept that these things really happened to the Scottish people. I don't like to cry my heart out because it makes my eyes hurt so badly, so I'm not sure that I can say that I really \\"enjoyed\\" reading this series. All I can say is that it broke my heart.The love stories woven into this historical series are wonderful and make the series well worth reading if you don't mind a good cry."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"Blood of Roses is the continuation of The Pride of Lions and I would highly recommend you read it's predecessor first. This is the story of Catherine Ashbrooke Cameron and Alexander Cameron and how their lives are affected by the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745.The beginning of book is spend recapping the previous novel so if you haven't read the Pride of Lions you will have a pretty good idea of what has happened thus far. I would really describe Blood of Roses as being much more of a historical fiction book than a romance as so much of it is spent in details of the rebellion and the military gains leading up to the battle of Culloden Field. I was very pleasantly suprised with all of the wonderful detail as a lover of history in general. The author spends a great deal of attention to the Bonnie Prince Charles and the military leaders entrusted to the rebellion. I really felt she did a wonderful job describing why the rebellion failed and why the Scots backed it in the first place.Amongst all of the details about the rebellion this is also a great romance story. The author did a wonderful job balancing the romance portion of the story with the rich history of the time. This was a great read and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"The first book in the pair was very good, but I must say this one was very heavy on history and light on romance content. It was well written and historically correct, but I was not drawn into the story and the characters lives as I was in the first novel. The ending was more like frayed threads rather than a tightly woven finish."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"In the sequel to The Pride of Lion's \\"The Blood of Roses\\", Catherine and Alexander's saga continues but with much more tension and tears. Leading up to the battle of Culloden the story is passion filled and adventurous but I found myself slowing down and not wanting to continue once the Jacobite group enter's Moy Hall. I knew what was coming and I had my own reservations about experiencing the sorrow and blood shed. I did not know what would happen to all of the character's that I had fallen in love with and frankly did not want to face their demise. Knowing some of the History before hand I had some idea's about the major players on the Scottish side, it was the main character's of the story I was unsure of and after reading many of the reviews I knew I was going to have to face the loss. This was a powerful story that was well researched and well written, one I will not easily forget."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"Blood of Roses is the sequel to Pride of Lions. This is truly an epic story of a great love between a legendary Highland warrior and a proud and courageous Englishwoman as they struggle to survive the war between England and Scotland.You'll not find many love scenes here. The lovers themselves are separated quite a bit because Alex wants to make sure Catherine is safe while he puts himself on the frontlines. For that reason, I was sometimes frustrated because there was so much detail on the backstory, the Scottish struggle for independence, while the storyline between Alex and Catherine was allowed to languish for a bit.Despite that, I still enjoyed reading Blood of Roses. There is much detail on the battles and the political intrigue that the author paints a clear picture of the seeds that led to Scotland's defeat at the hands of the English."},{"Title":"Blood of Roses","review":"I'm a historian, although not a student of Scottish history, and I love a GOOD historical novel. This enthralling novel has convincing characters and a riviting story. It is set against the Scottish revolt that ended with the battle of Culloden, the shadow of which hangs over the story. There is a lot of history, much more than the ususal romance, but if that's not your cup of tea, you can skim the politics and the battles and still be entranced by the romance. Marsha Canham's two wonderful novels, Pride of Lions and Blood of Roses, should be read together as one work.(You will get used to the dialect, but some of it pretty distracting.)"},{"Title":"Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice (S U N Y Series in Deviance and Social Control)","review":"This account written by a professor of sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has derived his sources entirely from accounts written by members of the Irgun and Lehi during the time of the British Mandate especially between 1937-48.The books lasting value though, is not the authors intention to provide an ideological justification of the acts it portrays but derived from the inherent contradictions contained in the various accounts of these members across different assassinations. These contradictions ultimately suggest a much more complex truth.The book takes an open and unapologetic pro-Zionist stance.What is of most interest though are the contradictions in the description of the protagonists. For example the book contains descriptions of alleged 'torture' by British members of the Palestine Police of certain arrested members of the Irgun but who would later 'escape'. Yet with unequivocal and unrepentant gusto the book later refers to these same 'tortured suspects' as being themselves British Agents or 'squealers' who were themselves subject to assassinations by the same organisation.What this volume therefore unintenionally portrays is a group of extremists who, without the support of the majority of their community waged war on the Arab community,those charged with peacekeeping as well as unsupportive members of their own community. The mainly British peacekeeping force charged with upholding law and order between rival Arab and Jewish groups are portrayed with the same antagonistic zeal reserved for the Nazis (who incidentally the Stern Gang tried to negotiate with against the British). This book represents more than anything the inherent contradictions of the Irgun and the Lehi in their struggle for an Israeli state and for this reason deserves to be read by all interested students of the period(both Zionist and anti Zionist alike).More than anything this book is testament to the reality that the victors of history in any given period are free to write what they choose - yet not just despite this but BECAUSE of it - an objective truth may still be derived from the excessive zeal with which these partisan accounts are portrayed. This remains true of all ideologies whether religious or non religious and of which this slim volume remains a pre-eminant example."},{"Title":"Sketches from the life of Paul","review":"We have been studying the life and times of Paul.

Why should there be pages missing and messy, hard-to-read sections in a book I paid over $35 for? I could go to a copy machine and do better than that myself."},{"Title":"Statistical analysis in psychology and education (McGraw-Hill series in psychology)","review":"A difficult to read text. I have used it as a text for a statistics course I taught (it was not my choice). There are few illustrations, the text is not clearly written, and despite this being the 6th edition, there are still numerous errors in the solutions given for the problems at the end of each chapter. Further, no use of current statistical software is mentioned. Many students have been frustrated by this text -- there are better options out there."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"This is not Ian Rankin's best book but it is still a giant leap above the quality of so many writers who prefer to have gruesome death scenes described in detail.Inspector Rebus is called to the raid of an illegal brothel where they find amongst the clients the local MP Gregor Jack. Amidst much media scrutiny of the MP being found in a brothel, Rebus begins to sense some trouble and starts to investigate how the media were tipped off about the raid and then the story becomes murky as a lengthy history of misadventures are exposed.This novel was a quick and easy read, as the author himself admits, it is one of his lighter books but it is still Inspector Rebus, which means you get character development, a look at Scotland and a fine novel to read."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"John Rebus is a detective inspector who works in a police station inEdinburgh, Scotland.

John keeps going back to Gregor Jack trying to help him fix the damage to his career, but while this is going on Jack's wife is missing. Rebus has many bad feelings, and when her body turns ups, Rebus and his faithful Sergeant Holmes trail a killer. The investigation throws them up against some of the so-called \\"cream\\" of society, and John has to pussyfoot around in order not to upset feelings. These Rebus books are really good. I enjoy Rankin's eccentric and spare writing style. I also enjoy the look at Scotland that the books give. And most of all I enjoy Rebus. He is a real character! The mysteries are always quite complex. Lots of fun."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"Somehow this Inspector Rebus mystery doesn't quite measure up to others in the series for me. Rankin takes the usually strong features of his novels--story line, quirky characters and interesting backdrops--either too far or not far enough in development. The storyline is overly meandering and the conclusion not particularly convincing. Rankin has made his protagonist, Rebus, more intrusive and obnoxious than curious and perservering. This is a moment in Rebus' career that I wouldn't have minded missing.Having said all that, I will continue to be a Rankin fan, particularly of his more recent novels."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"My first Rankin mystery. I hope it is the worst of them, because it was BAD. If all his books meander and rest on scatology, that's it. One more try - because I bought it already. I would never imagine myself saying this but the lack of female characters who are not whores or exploited girlfriends adds insult to injury. Rebus is not clever. Did I miss something? Is the book supposed to be taking place in the 60's? It was published in the 90's but perhaps this is Rankin's fantasy of the swinging 60's? To sum up: Yuck. No stars at all."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"Not great condition but not terrible either.

But among the customers caught in the raid is a local Member of Parliament, Gregor Jack -- and in the circumstances, the cops have a lot of fun making jokes about that word \\"member.\\" He's a very popular man, reportedly a straight-shooter as MPs go, and Rebus begins to wonder if he wasn't set up for trial-by-media. Naturally, being the sort of free-wheeler he is, he begins poking into things, and not always quietly. Mr. Jack has a group of old friends known as \\"the Pack,\\" and they seem to be setting themselves up to protect him as much as they can, but Rebus has his doubts about some of them, too. And them Jack's wife is murdered -- and she was a very different sort of person from her husband, and with her own group of hangers-on. It all gets pretty complicated pretty fast, and Rankin does a good job construycting a complex but logical and believable plot.He also has done a good job with the milieu in which Rebus works and lives. There's his ambitious young sergeant, Brian Holmes, who has recently moved into Jack's constituency, and his boss, the chief superintendent, who may be coming unraveled, thus opening up opportunities for the more ruthless among Rebus's colleagues, and his newly developing relationship with Patience (she wants him to move in with her but he's strangely reluctant). This is perhaps the most satisfying entry in the series so far."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"I give this book 4 stars out of 5. I love the Inspector Rebus series because it's set in my home town of Edinburgh and I can therefore relate to the setting and situations. However, I feel this book, although enjoyable, wasn't one of Rankin's best books, because at times I found myself getting mixed up with the various characters, nicknames and relationships.It did keep me hanging on until the bitter end, as usual though. Once again, I had no idea whodunnit until the very last page!"},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"In Strip Jack Rankin is still finding his voice. The story involves many characters and they easily confuse the reader though the plot itself is interesting and highly engaging. This particular paperback edition has a major problem in its very dense spacing; the lines are very close to each other and there is little white space. Overall a good though early thriller."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"This is a very good Rebus novel -- the intersection of murder and politics make it better than some of the others."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"One of my favorites.

Almost impossible to make a mistake with one of his books."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"Ian Rankin once again proves that he is amongst the best, if not the best writer of Crime Fiction in the world. Strip Jack has all the twists and turns that make Ian Rankin's books unputdownable. The plot, MP wife's suspicious disappearance and subsequent murder, moves along really well. The numerous sub-plots, unlike in some stories, actually help the book to move along rather than detract from the main story. As usual all the plot lines are integral to the story. All in all an excellent addition to the Rebus series, if you like good British Detective fiction (and who doesn't, it is the best after all) this is a must for your library."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"As Ian Rankin's series progresses, Detective Inspector John Rebus is becoming more and more likable. This time he's trying to solve the murder of a local MP's wife. He comes up against the usual brick walls put up by superior officers on the way to solving the case, but in this book for the first time, he seems to have made a friend in the force in young DS Brian Holmes.I'm finding the Insector John Rebus books even more enjoyable since the newer, mellow John Rebus has been developed.A wonderful British police procedural full of wit and glint-in-the-eye humour."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"STRIP JACK is not one of the stronger books in the \\"Rebus\\" series. In this one, Rebus becomes interested in the trials and tribulations of an MP who is caught during a raid on a brothel. This leads to a couple of murders that may or may not be related and Rebus getting involved just out of curiosity. Rankin just seems to be going through the motions on this one, the mysteries are not very interesting and relatively straight forward, Rebus's usual emotional response seems distant and he seems to be in a state of befuddlement about life, career, and even the politics involved in the case. STRIP JACK lacks the laser-like focus of Rankin's other episodes and while I don't think Rankin has written a bad Rebus novel, this one is just a filler."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"I cannot believe that the reader from Chicago found this book so Bad. I however enjoyed it hugely. This was the first Inspector Rebus novel I read, and I'm looking forward to read a lot more.

If you like novels with twists and turns and masses of tension and touches of humour then you will love this book."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"This is my first Ian Rankin novel. Although I find the TV version of Rebus (BBC) interesting and stylish, the episodes are very moody, dark and gristly. I was a little worried that the book would be the same way, however, it was excellent, witty and complicated! The reader took a little getting used to, but I got into it and enjoyed it.I am giving it 4 stars instead of five because I thought the ending was good, but not great.Another reviewer refers to the &quot;new, mellower&quot; Rebus, so maybe the earlier works are violent. I can only say that I will keep on reading Rankin!"},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"And I think it's safe to say I couldn't find a successful complaint. The characters are complex and human, thankfully drawn out in a 3-D shape which helped me actuall care about the characters. John Rebus is no hero, he's just a guy who does his damn job. Brian Holmes I found to be a good character, quite happy with his involvement.I never once found myself bored by this book and was quite impressed with how Ian Rankin kept me entertained with his mix of dark humour and dark side of the streets of Scotland. It's a bit hard to join up in the middle of a series but I think Ian Rankin did well with that part of the job. I hope I will read more of Ian Rankin's boks and hope I am as entertained by them as I was by this one.\\"MP Gregor Jack is caught in an Edinburgh brothel with a prostitute who is only too keen to show off her considerable assets.

At heart Rebus, with his flat and his girlfriends and hi-fi, is still a middle class hero, and I can picture him having a couple of pints with Inspector Morse, even if Rankin would perhaps shudder at that thought........"},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"When I chanced upon Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus series I took no chances and tucked into it with gusto. The first in the series, Knots and Crosses wasn't all that, in fact it wasn't a very stron mystery. But as I went through the series one by one, the experienced stopped being a slop and became more os a joy. This book has been very entertaining and has rewarded my faith in Rankin.The storyline and plot are structures in Rankin's novels. Not that they are bad but they are merely one of many reasons to read the book. His writing is gossipy, psychological, sometimes schizophrenic but always rewarding to the reader because it encompasses so much. This story had the best flowing narrative so far. The description of the crime scene investigation part of the story is detailed, horryfying, and fascinating, even though it is just a peripheral part of the story. The discourses on books and the literary world is also fascinating but also peripheral. This series embodies all that is great with a multifaceted explorarion of crime and crime solving with hte grit and realism of a Dashiel Hammett novel."},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","review":"This is the fifth of the series that I've read, and all I can say is that Rankin/Rebus get better as the series grows and so does the character. Rankin does a good job of filling in the personality of Rebus and his supporting cast ('Farmer' Watson, 'Fart' Lauderdale, Brian Holmes...etc) and their working relationships.In this book we also get a travelogue of the areas north of Edinburgh, but we also get an insight into how Rankin/Rebus feels about politics, the old and new rich, the pressure that the media can put on the police, as well as the presumption of authority.All in all this is a fine addition to the series."},{"Title":"The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary","review":"I purchased this book along with 'Beginner's Hindi Script' and 'Say it in Hindi'. It is very clear. Many other books and dictionaries I have looked at use cheap, rough paper and the type does not print well on the paper. The syllable characters in this dictionary are crisp and clear; large enough to see; the English transliteration is right next to the Devanagari script; examples of many kinds are included with many of the words so you can see all of the variants and idioms. I sometimes have a problem where I can't find a word I want to know the meaning of because it is perhaps written in a tense that I need to know the root of first. However, this is due to the fact that I am a beginning student of the language, I'm sure. Looking up the various words in this dictionary has certainly helped me learn the syllabary more quickly. This is the best Hindi dictionary I have found so far."},{"Title":"The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary","review":"My only regret is that there is no English-Hindi counterpart. This book includes all common usages of words in conjunction with verbs, as well as variations and related words. Also very helpful is the origin of each word, and its spelling in its language of origin. If you are student of Hindi, I could not recommend a better book. Mr. McGregor is my hero."},{"Title":"The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary","review":"This dictionary is really worthwhile! Being only Hindi-English actually helped me, by forcing me to accelerate my learning of devanagari. Of course, after the devanagari spelling is the roman transliteration as well. Because it's only Hindi-English, you get a bigger number of entries in a still-manageable size. For the budget-conscious Hindi student, this is a must have."},{"Title":"The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary","review":"This dictionary is worthy of much veneration. Besides the multitudinous number of words provided, the print is very clear and legible. Etymology of words is also given, which is a nice feature because one can see whence a particular word originated, and that alone is reason enough to buy this dictionary.And despite what one reviewer claimed about there being no Roman transliteration provided, that is not true. Words are listed first in the Devanagari, followed by a transliteration.It would've been nice if there was also an English-Hindi section included, but, aside from that trifling shortfall, the dictionary as it is is deserving of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary","review":"It includes a wide variety of words, whether standard language or dialects. Etymology of words is also interesting. It is easy to manipulate, not too thick and easily transportable. Headword presentation and examples are clear."},{"Title":"The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary","review":"When I bought this dictionary over a year ago I was desperate for a good Hindi-English dictionary. I was taking Hindi at my school and the dictionary that the book store provided was the Hippocrene Hindi-English, English-Hindi version. I was never happy with that dictionary from the start because it lacked so much of the information that I needed. I did not find one Hindi-English, English-Hindi one on Amazon or anywhere else either. I'm glad that I bought this version by R.S. McGregor. It has a little over 1000 pages and it seems like it is much more than a dictionary. It gives you some of the phrases that you are thinking of under certain words. It also gives alternate spellings so you won't be lost trying to figure out if the word you are looking for is spelled right and so on and so forth. The only thing that could make this dictionary better is if it was hardcover. Sometimes I'm afraid that when I am looking in the very last pages it is going to break apart from the binding.Because you are also going to need an English-Hindi dictionary, I suggest that you buy the Oxford English Hindi version edited by S.K. Verma & R.N. Sahai. The trick with that dictionaray is to look up whatever you are searching for and then look up the Hindi version they give you. Because McGregor's dictionary is so thorough you will be able to find out if the word/phrase they give you in Verma & Shahai's version is the right context for which you are looking.This is definitely a good buy!"},{"Title":"The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary","review":"As in my review of Verma's Oxford English-Hindi dictionary, I preface this by saying that I am an American English speaker, but one who was trained at the University of Wisconsin in Hindi and have several years of Hindi language experience, including two years in northern India.MacGregor has developed an excellent resource, but both of the Oxford Hindi dictionaries should be more inclusive of contemporary Hinglish, Urdu and Marathi loan words, borrowed English, and Bollywood/Hindi internet slang usage. Bombay is an influential city and a good dictionary should reflect that. Ideally I would like a dictionary to allow me to translate most of what I might see in a contemporary Bollywood movie such as one of the \\"Munna Bhai\\" films.As in my other review I recommend Hindi beginners try to find a class in Hindi, get an audio course, and a native speaker tutor if at all possible. Too many sounds in Hindi do not have an easy English phonetic equivalent. As tempting as having a romanized version of this dictionary might be, there is no substitute for Devanagari, and the proliferation of different transliteration systems can be more confusing than helpful. Oxford was right on in sticking with Devanagari.Keep up the good work Oxford!"},{"Title":"The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary","review":"This dictionary is very complete however it only goes one way.

You have to guesswhich words it is composed from and look under that word. for instance, napasand might be found under the prefix na and so forth.2) I've taken off 1 stars for inaccuracy and incompleteness.

If you are trying to learn a word in Hindi how can you look it up if you don't already know it??

Some are his stories are poignant or even tragic, whilst others are heart-warming and touching. As always, his ability to convey what is lost between the interstices of idle chatter is to the fore.The tale from which the book derives its title is a sad one. An inexperienced young man, Michael, has his illusions shattered, losing his innocence, when he discovers the sordid reality of the life of Max, the man to whom he is attracted and with whom he has been trying to pluck up courage to form a relationship. Max, for his part, loses the innocent Michael because of his own sexual incontinence. Both are left sadder and not necessarily wiser men. In \\"Epiphany\\" another potential relationship fails because of a failure to seize the moment - too much agonising can kill love. \\"When Love Wears Thin\\", on the other hand, is the story of a relationship maintained only by one partner turning a blind eye to the other's infidelity because of the need to stay together for financial reasons - the story of many a marriage! \\"A Quiet Life\\" is a finely observed tale of making use of someone - something we've all observed!One of Mr. Mandal's strengths is his ability to depict crippling self-doubt and lack of self-esteem. Too often people fail to plunge in because of their inability to see themselves as people of worth. Amongst gay people this diffidence is doubly cruel since their opportunities are statistically narrower than those afforded to straight people and their negative attitudes have been reinforced by a lifetime of societal disapproval. It is all the more pleasing, therefore, to see that a story from his previous, equally as entertaining book \\"A Different Kind of Love\\" called \\"Of Cabbages and Kings\\" is taken up again and resolved in \\"Many Truths\\". The diffidence and self-doubt of both the protagonists, Matthew and Jan, persist and almost wreck their relationship. In the nick of time they speak and act truthfully and their relationship is salvaged and moves on to firmer ground.Not all of the stories in this volume are heavy. Some are quite whimsical. \\"The Triumph of Hope\\" and \\"Neither Hide nor Hair\\" are stories of relationships beginning by chance whilst \\"A Lucky Escape\\" and \\"Business is Business\\" tell of victory in love snatched from the jaws of defeat. \\"All Beautiful Things\\" is a touching tale of love across the generations.As should be apparent by now, Mr. Mandal ranges widely over the gay condition in this collection of stories, sufficiently wide to please most readers who are more concerned with the marvel of relationships, despite or because of their fragility, rather than with sexual explicitness. Mr. Mandal has produced a very satisfying volume ideal for reading in short bursts. It should be on every bookshelf. I look forward to his next offering and can unreservedly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Loss of Innocence","review":"\\"The Loss of Innocence and Other Short Stories\\" is a compilation of 28 short stories by acclaimed British author Jay Mandal. The stories are of varying lengths, some averaging ten pages while others offer vignettes of one or two pages. The overarching themes of this collection are the quest for and loss of love with the full array of accompanying human emotions, including, loneliness, insecurity, longing, fear, hope and joy.The stories are not contextualized. Instead they provide the reader with an intimate glimpse into slices of gay life and love through exemplary dialogue and narration throughout. It is as if the reader is invited to listen in on a series of conversations and exchanges between the protagonists of each story, with dialogue that is so well crafted it serves as the main source of characterization.While I enjoyed all the stories in this collection there are a few that were deeply touching.The introductory story of the same title, \\"A Loss of Innocence,\\" tells of the hopes of first love as Michael, a shy and inexperienced twenty-three year old, and Max, a professor at the university, form a friendship, and through this Michael begins to accept himself and the possibilities of being with Max. But Michael's hopes are shattered and his innocence lost when he takes that first step only to be met with an unwelcome surprise.\\"Second Class Male\\" is the story of Maurice, a fellow with virtually non-existent self-esteem for whom life holds nothing but one disappointment after another. His loneliness and sense of alienation is heart-achingly palpable. In \\"Clothes Maketh the Man,\\" the author reminds us of our need to be accepted and loved for who and what we truly are, regardless of our outward appearance. Both \\"Many Truths\\" and \\"Bookends\\" deal with May/December relationships and the fear of taking the plunge thereby risking the loss of love. \\"All For The Best\\" is a bittersweet story of the realities of love and relationships in the age of HIV/AIDS. This story broke my heart as Adrian and Guy try to forge a relationship but ultimately go their separate ways because of Guy's reticence to subject Adrian to the pain of his illness.In the final story of this compilation, \\"A Quiet Life,\\" Lawrence leads a very structured, quiet and solitary life and has a strict schedule that he adheres to in respect of his activities. A chance meeting with Alan who has recently broken up with his boyfriend disrupts the familiar and safe patterns of Lawrence's life and throws him into a world of human interaction. Although inexperienced and somewhat tentative at first, Lawrence begins to trust his new found comfort and ease in this very different life until Alan pulls the rug out from under him.The book summary is most accurate in its description of this compilation of stories in that they are poignant and written with a tender, compassionate and thoughtful hand. Some are indeed humorous and whimsical and will have you laughing out loud, some are bittersweet and yet others are heart breaking. In this sense, this collection is a testament to the full spectrum of realities of gay life, love and relationships.Jay Mandal has been referred to as Britain's answer to Armistead Maupin and on a level with author Edmund White. While I have not yet had the pleasure of reading Maupin or White and therefore cannot provide an opinion on this, I can unequivocally say that Jay Mandal is an exceptionally gifted author with a unique writing style and voice in his own right.I highly recommend Jay Mandal's \\"The Loss of Innocence and Other Short Stories\\" without any reservation as it is an outstanding collection of stories.This review was originally published online by Rainbow Reviews on September 13, 2009."},{"Title":"More Small Astronomical Observatories (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"This book is not a step-by-step guide.

This curiosity led me to \\"Parapsychology, Philosophy, and Spirituality--A Postmodern Exploration,\\" the publication of which predated 9/11 by four years. In this scholarly work, Professor Griffin pays serious attention to the controversial subject of parapsychology, and intensely focuses on non-mainstream topics such as messages from mediums, reincarnation, and out-of-body experiences (OBEs). With seeming inevitability, Professor Griffin concludes that \\"there is formidable evidence of life after death.\\" However, it is not so much the conclusion but the analysis and presentation of the direct evidence leading to that conclusion which makes this book such an absolutely rewarding read.Professor Griffin comes across as a bit of a rebel when identifying \\"the central task of philosophy: to criticize the prevailing worldview(s) and to suggest a better one,\\" an assessment that endeared him to this reader. For the record, I am also in accord with Professor Griffin's own \\"fully naturalistic\\" worldview which \\"allows humans again to feel kinship with the rest of nature, and...encourages reverence for life in all of its forms.\\"In this book, Professor Griffin uses the term \\"parapsychology\\" as a synonym for \\"psychic research.\\" He divides paranormal phenomena into three major types: (1) extrasensory perception (ESP), the two main forms of which are telepathy and clairvoyance; (2) psychokinesis (PK), and (3) experiences such as messages from mediums and near-death and out-of-body experiences, that are suggestive of the existence of psyches apart from their physical bodies. Having set the parameters, Professor Griffin thoroughly engages the reader with \\"the scientific study of events\\" involving these three types of psychic phenomena.Early on in \\"Parapsychology, Philosophy, and Spirituality,\\" Professor Griffin provides an expansive list of the well known people who have become convinced that \\"paranormal events do happen,\\" including, I was surprised to learn, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Thomas Edison, and Mark Twain. The author points out that just as the mainstream is unaware of the famous and respectable people who took the study of parapsychology seriously, \\"The same ignorance exists about the fact that there are long-established psychical research organizations with reputable journals and rigorous standards,\\" an ignorance which Professor Griffin confronts with effective summaries of the legitimate psychical research performed since the late nineteenth century.Especially illuminating is Professor Griffin's description of the \\"factors involved in the formation of opinions about controversial matters, such as the paranormal.\\" These factors are: one's worldview which subjectively determines what is possible and impossible; one's awareness of empirical data; and wishful or fearful thinking. Categorizing people's views in this way--including the views of members of the so-called scientific community--makes their positions and thought processes easier to understand.To be sure, some of the topics covered won't be very easily comprehended by the average nonfiction reader, e.g., the concepts of \\"prehension\\" and \\"retrocausation,\\" and the various technical philosophies. However, Professor Griffin has a way of getting back to basics that is most welcome, and at times even poetic (e.g., defining \\"God\\" as \\"The Soul of the Universe\\"), making this a fascinating read overall.Professor Griffin reveals that \\"telepathy and clairvoyance, which have been reported throughout history and were verified by tests with mediums and other people in the early days of psychical research, [also] have been verified in strictly controlled experiments in laboratories.\\" Previously, the only known scientific approach to the paranormal that I had been aware of was undertaken as part of \\"The Afterlife Experiments\\" (Pocket Books, 2002, and earlier an HBO Special) conducted by Gary E. Schwartz, PhD, at the University of Arizona. Those experiments featured a study of notable contemporary mediums, including Suzane Northrop and John Edward, and demonstrated that mediumship is real. Professor Griffin's revelations about the prior historical research into psychic phenomena lend additional credibility to \\"The Afterlife Experiments\\" retroactively.An entire chapter is devoted to the philosophical conceivability or possibility of life after death, and it is here that people's mindsets come into prominence. While people with \\"data-led minds\\" are able to consider the evidence of life after death objectively, Professor Griffin notes, data-led minds \\"seem to be few and far between.\\" There follows an extended and persuasive discussion of ESP and PK which buttresses the case for the possibility of life after death. But it is not until the succeeding five chapters that Professor Griffin examines the actual evidence for life after death, in the contexts of: mediumistic messages, possession, reincarnation, apparitions, and OBEs.In the chapter on mediumistic messages, Professor Griffin states that \\"My purpose...is less to try and convince others of the reality of life after death than to show that there is evidence that is worthy of serious study.\\" Indeed, there is a substantial amount of convincing evidence present in this chapter alone. Especially noteworthy are the actual case histories of readings by the medium \\"Mrs. Piper,\\" and the so-called \\"cross correspondences\\" documented from 1901-1932 which involved \\"clever souls, who while living, had been involved in psychical research and wanted to provide evidence for their own survival [after their deaths] that could not be explained away in the usual manner.\\"On the subject of possession, Professor Griffin concludes that this type of evidence does not contain phenomena that are in themselves \\"strongly suggestive\\" of life after death.However, convincing evidence of life after death does exist with regard to \\"cases of the reincarnation type.\\" In the chapter on this topic, Professor Griffin relies primarily on the case studies of Ian Stevenson, MD, and does an excellent job of digesting Dr. Stevenson's extensive research--research that is most certainly indicative of reincarnation, and thus life after death. There are many general features in cases of the reincarnation type that make this evidence authentic--including the fact that the subjects are very young and innocent. Also intriguing is how often a child's current birthmarks or wounds are reflective of the manner in which the prior personality passed away. However, I did disagree with Professor Griffin on one point posited within this discussion. Specifically, he states that \\"persons who are \`reincarnated' tend to be persons of a particular type--those who are intensely materialistic and possessive, or intensely religious--or persons who have died in a particular manner: violently (or at least suddenly), while still young, or with strongly felt \`unfinished business.' The crucial factor, accordingly, seems to be the intensity with which that person lived, died, or wanted to continue living.\\" Rather than limiting the experience of reincarnation to these \\"intense souls,\\" I would argue that intense souls may simply be the type of souls most likely to demonstrate evidence of reincarnation in a subsequent life. (My two other main areas of disagreement did not, as here, involve an assessment of what the evidence indicates, but different beliefs. Specifically, Professor Griffin takes a linear approach to the concept of time, whereas I subscribe to the theory that time (as we know it) does not exist on the \\"Other Side.\\" And contrary to Professor Griffin's and Dr. Stevenson's views, I still believe that the \\"so-called law of karma\\" (as Professor Griffin labels it) does exist.)Highlights of the chapter on evidence from apparitions include an analysis of how alternate explanations (such as \\"super-ESP\\") don't really negate the possibility of life after death. For Professor Griffin, the two phenomena that \\"tip the scales in favor of an explanation in terms of postmortem agency [i.e., life after death]\\" are collective apparitions (where two or more people see the same apparition at the same time), and the similarity between apparitions of the living and those of the dead.The discussion of apparitions segues nicely into the chapter on evidence from OBEs, defined within the book as \\"an experience of being out of one's body (whether one really was or was not).\\" Here, Professor Griffin examines the various features of OBEs and a number of case studies, and concludes that \\"OBEs do provide direct experiential support of an affirmative answer to the chief question at issue, which is simply whether the person (the mind or the soul, with or without some kind of nonphysical [energetic?] body) can exist apart from the physical body.\\"While certain categories of the evidence are more convincing than others, it is the evidence taken collectively that is most compelling. This is so because, as the author says, \\"each of the kinds of evidence increases the antecedent probability of a survivalist interpretation of the others...and...some of them provide support for elements of the others.\\" Further, \\"Whereas the nonsurvivalist interpreter must come up with a variety of [often strained] hypotheses to handle the various kinds of data...the survivalist can use one hypothesis--survival with (limited) agency--to explain the basic feature of all the phenomena.\\" Thus, in sum, the conclusion that there is life after death is the most likely conclusion to be reached after a thorough and objective assessment of all of the evidence submitted.When I began reading Professor Griffin's postmodern exploration, my strong belief--based on my own experiences and studies--was that the soul survives the body's passing. I did not expect to be persuaded otherwise upon completing this book. However, I also did not anticipate that my belief in the survival of the soul would be reinforced as a result this reading. Yet, that is exactly what happened, simply because the scientific evidence presented by Professor Griffin is substantial, compelling, and ultimately an extremely powerful indicator that there is indeed life after death."},{"Title":"Parapsychology, Philosophy, & Spirituality: A Postmodern Exploration (Constructive Postmodern Thought)","review":"I have read a number of books on parapsychology and regard this one as the most important I've read to date. Griffin is to be applauded for his courage and originality. I would like to dialogue with anyone (including the author) who might wish to delve deeper into the book's philosphical and political implications."},{"Title":"Parapsychology, Philosophy, & Spirituality: A Postmodern Exploration (Constructive Postmodern Thought)","review":"David Ray Griffin is a relatively well-known theologian in the United States. Or at least *was* a theologian before he joined the Truth Movement and became a conspiracy theorist. The various books in the \\"SUNY Series in Constructive Postmodern Thought\\" were written before 9/11. It should be noted at the outset that Griffin uses the term \\"postmodern\\" in a somewhat idiosyncratic fashion. Essentially, he has appropriated the term and pinned it on his own variant of process theology. This brand of liberal Christianity is based on the philosophical works of Alfred North Whithead, Charles Hartshorne and (arguably) Griffin himself. Real postmodern thinkers would most certainly regard Whitehead's all-knowing metaphysics as a parody of early, pre-Kantian modernity. Indeed, Whitehead's works seem to be taken more seriously by theologians than philosophers - but then, that might actually be a commendation, considering the pseudo-intellectual vandals philosophers *do* take seriously.\\"Parapsychology, philosophy and spirituality\\" is an extended pitch, directed at scientists and philosophers, to take parapsychology seriously. Griffin argues that parapsychology is a bona fide science, and that its findings strongly suggest that paranormal phenomena are real. He discusses a broad range of such phenomena: telepathy, clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences, reincarnation, mediumistic messages, etc. CSICOP won't like this book!Griffin then attempts to explain the phenomena from the viewpoint of process theology. Apparently, many process theologians reject the idea of an immortal soul or life after death. So did Griffin until he turned to parapsychology, at which point he changed his mind in favour of the idea of an immortal soul. The problem is that Griffin constantly attempts to pigeon-hole parapsychology into the somewhat restricted worldview of process theology. Thus, he doesn't see paranormal phenomena as proof for dualism. Instead, he attempts to reconcile them with panpsychism (or panexperientialism). He also attempts to square them with evolution, proposing that perhaps the immortal soul evolved at a certain point in human (or animal?) evolution. Griffin is also forced to reject precognition, ostensibly because it's incoherent. In my opinion, the real reason is its incompatibility with process theology, according to which the future doesn't exist - the God of process theology is a God within time who co-evolves with the universe.In fact, I suspect that sections of this book are actually veiled polemics against fellow process theologians who won't readily accept the idea of survival after death. Thus, Griffin discusses at ridiculous length the alternative hypothesis that parapsychological phenomena are the result of \\"super-PSI abilities\\" rather than the survival of bodily death. Under this scenario, all memories of the dead are somehow still floating out there, and a medium with developed telepathic abilities can \\"prehend\\" them and appropriate them, thereby creating the illusion of a deceased person speaking through the medium, when in reality the medium simply rehashes old memory patterns. This is a classical example of the explanation being stranger than the problem it's supposed to explain - in practice, the explanation accepts the occult notion of the Akashic records! It also strikes me as incoherent, since one of Griffin's arguments against materialism is that consciousness is a self-existing whole rather than a mere sum of small parts that could be reduced to matter. But if the memories \\"prehended\\" by the medium are so holistic that they can mimic the deceased person almost perfectly, wouldn't this be a strong presumption in favour of the memories *actually being* the dead person?In the end, Griffin rejects super-PSI and settles for the \\"survivalist\\" hypothesis. He seems to regard out-of-body experiences, especially those reported in conjunction with near-death experiences, as the smoking gun evidence for life after death and the existence of an immortal soul that can leave the physical body. The book ends with a call to unite science, philosophy and spirituality, using the philosophy of Whitehead as a necessary starting point.\\"Parapsychology, philosophy and spirituality\\" does raise a lot of interesting points. Griffin writes in an easily accessible and pedagogic manner, although at times he becomes a bit too pedantic and boring. (He's a theology professor, after all!) This is not a bad book, not by any means. My problem with it is that Griffin somehow rejects one set of dogma - those of materialist science - in favour of another set of dogma, this time process theology. I admit a certain fascination with Whitehead, but the all-knowing, all-prehending traits of his philosophy do strike me as somewhat odd. Did he have a revelation on the road to Damascus, or what? Griffin should be commended for changing his mind on a central issue for his own theology, but it still feels as if he is attempting to squeeze the paranormal into a rigid, dogmatic framework anyway.The truth is out there, agent Griffin. But is the truth to be prehended through the lens of process theology? That still remains to be seen..."},{"Title":"Parapsychology, Philosophy, & Spirituality: A Postmodern Exploration (Constructive Postmodern Thought)","review":"A very well-written and interesting book.

The premise is interesting, seeing if natural enemies can learn to tolerate each other, and hopefully become friends, if raised together from an early age.Yet while I found the book easy to read and wanting to know the outcome, I was put off by several things. First, I did not think his writing style compares to his other books. I also felt that Masson was very repetitive in his beliefs of trying to create a natural environment for all. I do not feel differently from him, but I felt he was a bit over the top and could have distanced himself from several readers.This book also caused me to look at Masson differently. I was upset to learn that many of the animals Masson gets for his research (including \\"Dog's Never Lie\\") were given away afterwards. While I am sure all animals went to good homes, I was dissapointed that they were not as much a part of his family as it came off. With the way Masson treated his dog in this book, I was glad the dog was given away.But overall it was entertaining although it didn't live up to expectations."},{"Title":"Raising the Peaceable Kingdom: What Animals Can Teach Us about the Social Origins of Tolerance and Friendship","review":"Masson, a resident of Auckland, New Zealand, was interested in learning the essential ingredients in interspecies friendship. His idea was to raise a puppy, bunny, chick and a baby rat together to see if they could get along with each other but also grow an authentic friendship. He hoped that there might be, in his experiment, some lessons for human beings to learn about getting along with each other.Masson ended up with seven animals: one puppy, one bunny, two rats, one kitten and two chicks. The animals were absorbed into the family and observed. Initially the results were mixed with the adjustment being the easiest on the rats. Soon the chickens began their exploration of the Masson home and contact with the author. As in life, there were accidents and scares. Hohepa, the rabbit suffered an injury that easily could have resulted in death -- and the rats disappeared one day. They were eventually found in the bathroom wall but Masson noted that while they seemed to enjoy human contact, they preferred the freedom to wander at will.As the experiment continued it was interesting to see what happened with the relationships between the animals -- and between the animals and the human beings in their lives.Armchair Interviews says: Raising the Peaceable Kingdom is an extremely interesting, unique and entertaining look at the world of animals and how they behave. Most readers will ponder the results and wonder, what if?"},{"Title":"Raising the Peaceable Kingdom: What Animals Can Teach Us about the Social Origins of Tolerance and Friendship","review":"Jeffrey Masson's latest is a delightful book and a good read for children and adults. He shows us how he and his family learned to live with cats, dogs, chickens, rats, and a rabbit. We learn how,with patience and understanding, these animals gradually come to accept each other. Why, one wonders, if cats and a bunny can get along, why can't human beings?I was most delighted by Masson's stories about the two rats, Kia and Ora. People tend to despise rats along with bats, spiders, snakes and a few other species. They are hated and feared so that most people simply refuse to learn anything about them. The hate and fear is passed down from generation to generation and few people care enough to learn more about them.Friends got me over my learned prejudices about rats in my early twenties. They worked in a research lab where they had befriended some of their subjects and brought them home as pets. They had the run of the apartment. When I stayed there, a couple of them would sleep with me on the couch. They were like small kittens and just as playful and affectionate. Many a morning I would be awakened by the tickle of whiskers, twitching noses, and tiny feet on my neck or cheek.As usual in his books, Masson's prose is like a friend talking with you, but with plenty of friendly questions and remarks that will make you think."},{"Title":"Raising the Peaceable Kingdom: What Animals Can Teach Us about the Social Origins of Tolerance and Friendship","review":"This is an interesting concept and idea, but I really had some unhappy feelings about the way the author executed it.The author wanted to do an \\"experiment\\" and see if he could raise animals that are considered to be natural enemies together, and see if they could overcome their differences and co-exist, and ultimately see if it would be possible for them to actually become friends or even \\"soul-mates.\\" He wanted to compare this to humankind trying to overcome our differences. The animals he chose for this experiment were birds, cats, rats, rabbits, and dogs.The most disturbing factor is that the author did little to no research on the animals he adopted. His sole information on the care of the animals was based on what he already knew (or thought he knew) and the opinions of the people he got the animals from. Depending on where they came from, the information he got was both good and very bad.He adopted a dog from a shelter and talked to a dog psychologist there about which one would be best to fit in with this family. He bought a cat from a breeder based on word-of-mouth opinions that he had heard on which breed would be most docile. He adopted two chickens, and on the owner's advice, took two because just one would be unhappy (one of the few good pieces of advice he received). He adopted two rats from a shelter and took both because the shelter recommended that they'd also be lonely without another rat companion. He bought one rabbit from a breeder who misinformed him that rabbits don't have feelings, aren't social and don't need companions, and need nothing but food and a cage to be happy.(Also interesting to note- the author states that he is only interested in adopting animals that are homeless, but then he buys some animals, including the cat, from breeders.)I was especially distressed by his admittance that he didn't seek outside advice regarding animal care when he was aware that the people he got his information from did not even like the animals (the rabbit seller, for example). I believe that he made the initial existence of some of these animals very miserable and endangered simply due to his ignorance and unwillingness to do research for his experiment.The \\"experiment\\" was further tainted by the fact that he already had two cats who were a well-established part of his household. None of the animals were able to grow up completely surrounded by other animals that did not know a life without the others. The original pet cats were threatening to the smaller animals for months and eventually did kill one of the rats.I think the concept of this book was a good idea, but it was very poorly executed and dismal in the lack of research. It's amazing to me that the animals survived as well as they did, and heartening at least that the rabbit eventually was able to bond with the youngest cat in the household. It was upsetting to read about the rabbit's behavior for the first year, as it was obviously very lonely and feeling neglected.The author feels that this experiment was a beautiful success and can be compared to how humans should overcome their differences and all live peacefully, but I only saw a little of that in his experiment. He likes to ramble about the beautiful beach and yard he provided to the animals, while refusing to acknowledge any mistakes or failures in the experiment (including the death of an animal and several near-fatal events); he only reiterates the successes and brushes off violence and problem behavior as accidents. It is heartening to note that eventually the animals did form some kind of community, but also interesting to note that he didn't keep them, and eventually gave most of them away to better homes. He briefly admits at the end that several of the animals were unhappy or in mortal danger, and he gave them away.This book is a really intriguing idea, which is very poorly executed."},{"Title":"Raising the Peaceable Kingdom: What Animals Can Teach Us about the Social Origins of Tolerance and Friendship","review":"If you can make it all the way to the end, this book will teach you about the eight rules of tolerance, then the nine rules of play, then back to eight for the eight rules of friendship. Occasionally, I feel that Moussaieff Masson jumbled the rules slightly, or stuck one in a list (say, for \\"friendship\\") where it might more accurately be conceptualized as a rule for \\"play.\\" For example, \\"One step at a time.\\" Now, he has this listed as the fourth rule of friendship, and I would urge squeezing it into the list of rules of play, even if this means expanding the number of play rules to an ungainly ten. Well, I never have liked one of the existing \\"rules of play\\" anyhow--the very first, \\"Know when to quit.\\" It reminds me of the famous song by Kenny Rogers about The Gambler/ So perhaps that rule could be omitted, the line about \\"one step at a time\\" given its due among the rules of play, and then the rules of friendship would be reduced.These rules are inspiring and, I feel, credence must be given to Moussaieff's own experiments using animals to prove his various points, such as rule 7 of the \\"Eight Rules of Tolerance,\\" which is, \\"Possess nothing the other wants.\\" But you have to admit, that's a hard one to follow in real life practice! Maybe for animals, who don't really \\"have\\" anything anyhow (except good looks and high energy). But for people, it's a different story. For what person, no matter how humble, doesn't have something that somebody else might conceivably desire? Masson himself is rather a pretentious man and some of us, both in the USA and his adopted New Zealand are united in this opinion, but most odd is his apparent lack of love for most of his pets. It seems like he just gets them to write about them, and when he's done writing about them, he lets them go to other homes.Sometimes the results are amusing, sometimes one feels he just writes to shock, for he started as a controversialist and something of the tabloid headline will always cling to his name. \\"Visitors were sometimes shocked,\\" he writes, in a discussion about the socialization of rats, \\"to see two small heads pop out from between Leila's breasts\\" (by the way, Leila is a grown human) \\"the whiskers twitching nervously, bright little eyes alight with curiosity.\\" Next stop, Stuart Little!"},{"Title":"Raising the Peaceable Kingdom: What Animals Can Teach Us about the Social Origins of Tolerance and Friendship","review":"It's not often that you find these three elements -- uniqueness, insights, and fun -- in the same book, but in Raising the Peaceable Kingdom, you do.Animals can teach us many things we really need to learn, and humans are just beginning to wake up to the idea, helped along by books like this one. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson is a gifted and inspired writer, and I heartily recommend this book (and all of his books, frankly) to anyone -- from those who have pets/love animals and are already predisposed to enjoy the topic to those who might be a bit skeptical about what humans might learn from animals about getting along with each other. If you're not sure which side of that fence you're on, it doesn't really matter, because you'll enjoy the book either way."},{"Title":"Raising the Peaceable Kingdom: What Animals Can Teach Us about the Social Origins of Tolerance and Friendship","review":"I found the book to be a little too preachy about vegetarianism; I think the author is quite proud of being a vegetarian, and he hits on that point quite a bit.I really didn't feel that inspired about what animals can teach us about tolerance or friendship, either.I grew up on a farm, and have seen firsthand how \\"tolerant\\" and \\"friendly\\" animals can be towards each other. I guess that I am just a little too realistic to believe in a beautiful co-existence with nature; I feel that nature is nature, and will do its best to exist, no matter whose expense is taken."},{"Title":"Raising the Peaceable Kingdom: What Animals Can Teach Us about the Social Origins of Tolerance and Friendship","review":"After spending eight years as a psychoanalyst, Mr. Masson set out to see if it is possible for \\"animals ...to live with other species in peace...and friendship.\\" He admits halfway through his experience with the chosen menagerie to decide that his goal was to learn something about the roots of tolerance, friendship, and even compassion in humans from this project of raising animals together. Affection is different from tolerance. You cannot coerce affection, cannot force one animal to like or love another animal. But, he wrote, \\"the conditions which permit affection to grow can be cultivated, encouraged and rewarded.\\"In this project, he gathered together animals which would not normally choose to be together. Using domestic animals there in New Zealand, the final experiment included two rats, two chickens, a kitten, a puppy, and two rabbits. This in-home observation of the interactions of this diverse group lasted six months. I don't call that time enough to \\"raise any animal.\\" We once had a rabbit for several months which my son won at the Fall fair; by Spring, 'Roger Rabbit' had to move on after he bit the tip of my little finger off -- no doubt, thinking it was a small carrot. With this disparent collection, he hoped to learn about the essential characteristics of enmity between humans (comparatively) and what made for cooperation, empathy, compassion and friendship. He came to the conclusion that \\"there are no experts when it comes to human emotions or animal emotions.\\" He commented on humans inability to understand the feelings of other people. We are responsible for whatever we tame. In the movie, 'Fly Away Home,' a thirteen year old girl nurtured fifteen Canadian geese and led them to freedom. \\"We, animals and humans, can change. I have seen it with my own eyes in this \\"little experiment with the big ideas.\\"When cats are not compatible, it is generally about territory, and they don't have to justify their actions. It is a protective measure. Cats are the only ones who choose to live with humans. His young family already had two three year old cats who had their own ways to treat the young male cat; one ran away from him with a hiss and a snarl. The other showed more than curiosity toward the two rats. I have difficulty understanding how anyone would want to observe a rat outside of a lab, though his pediatrician wife became attached to them. I had a close encounter with a rather large gutter rat at the bus stop -- thought at first that it was a small squirrel coming toward me until I saw its long, skinny tail. My dad used to raise chickens, but he had a large group for which he built a chicken house and enclosed yard surrounded by chicken wire. I steered clear of them as the rooster was a mean character.The family black-and-white pictures throughout the book showed different ones with the animals as they were initiated into a communal experience, which proved the impossibility of peaceful habitation in close quarters for some of their choices. It made me feel that he needed to watch Marc Morrone on his weekly \\"Petkeeping\\" television show. Now, he is an expert! \\"My experiment, to find the peaceable kingdom, was really in conflict with allowing the animals to live as close to a natural life as could be achieved in the suburbs of a large city. When they were all assembled, it was chaos and confusion with no order or effectual rules. One of his young sons said, \\"Dad, I thought you were an animal expert.\\"\\"Only a few months after these 'natural enemies' began to live in close contact, while they weren't yet best friends, they were one and all living peacefully together. I considered that a significant accomplishment, the implications of which fascinated me. As for the older cats, I wasn't sure they would ever adjust or that it was even reasonable to expect them to.\\" The real surprise of the experiment, and the \\"unexpected success for me, was what had been happening\\" to the two established pets. The kitten was placid, \\"like Ferdinand the bull,\\" no fighter. \\"Against all expectations and contrary to all rules of cat behavior and their evolution, the two older, semiferal cats had appeared to accept the younger animals. At the end, Megala, the one cat who had refused to join 'the peaceable kingdom,' even made friends with one of the rats, a transformation he never thought even possible. Megala (miracle of miracles) did what leopards do when they make friends: turned over and started to purr. \\"I guess Megala finally decided there was nothing like friendship across the species barrier.\\" This justified his entire experiment as he watched the transformation and acquiescense. He felt rewarded at the result.Since leaving the psychoanaylzing of humans back in Berkeley, California, his collection of books would make one think the has turned into an animal behavior expert. His books include THE CAT WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD: A FABLE, THE NINE EMOTIONAL LIVES OF CATS, THE PIG WHO SANG TO THE MOON, WHEN ELEPHANTS WEEP and DOGS NEVER LIE ABOUT LOVE."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I ordered this book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival.

But out of all the feng shui books that I've read, this is my least favorite. Why? because 70-85% of the stuff in the book can be found in any other feng shui book or even on the internet for free. A greater percentage than any other feng shui book that I've read. No mention of purple star, hong kong method, flying stars or anything. Just black hate 9 square method of feng shui with each sector and also remedies for shapes using mirrors, cures etc... This puts it on a level similar to that of some of lillian too's books.

Very informative and easy to understand and follow. It's really put together nicely.While I do think there is definately something to harmonizing the energy around you, I don't think that moving your stuff is any guaranteed way to bring a certain thing to yourself. I have a love/hate relationship to books like this. I find some really good ideas, and some I think are silly and just don't work. I know that there are other issues involved. -Like what's in a person's birth chart for example. If someone is having a difficult planetary aspect in their money house, then, no amount of moving furniture/furnishings is going to change that aspect. Although, I do think it COULD help the person deal with it better. By moving something, it could represent a shift in how one has arranged or re-arranged their thinking about the problem. So, in that way, I think it could have a beneficial side.I found many interesting things in this book, for example, in my helpful people/travel section of my home, that's where I already have the computer (World wide web) and I just happened to have a world map there. I found a lot of other helpful information too.This is a fun and interesting book, and it's not gonna hurt anything to give something a try afterall.

Like others have said, it's great if you don't know anything about feng shui and you need someone to explain it to you in plain English. At first I thought it sounded too much like superstition, but I really liked the explanation that it was really just giving energy (and thus momentum) to our thoughts (much like writing down goals or taping an inspirational quote to the bathroom mirror).I've had the book for a few months and hadn't put anything in place because I knew there was a strong possibility we might move, and I didn't want to put forth the effort only to box it all up.Well, we are moving, and last week I painted a small paper box silver, and wrote \\"The perfect buyer for our house\\" on a slip of paper inside.

Specifically, I put purple pieces of construction paper in all my money corners. Within a few short weeks, I suddenly had enough money in my checking account to pay off my school loans--I haven't been in debt since.My home is feng shui'ed to the max regarding career and money per MYSCYL, and those have consistently been the strongest areas in my life. When it came time to sell my old home and buy a new one, I followed Karen's advice and bought the home of my dreams. I've had countless girlfriends ask me how to find Mr. Right using feng shui, and I tell them to use MYSCYL and two pals got engaged within six months of moving their stuff.Feng shui will work for you too, and MYSCYL is by far the most reader-friendly and practical book on the subject.

With Karen's book, I finally GOT IT and got it quickly!And has it changed my life and the life of others who've received it.An example of how much it works? My sister seemed to have money just slipping out every month. When I saw her staircase from the second floor bedrooms ended a few steps from the front door, I gave her some red tape to put at the bottom of the last rung along with Karen's book.A few weeks later, the money problems disappeared. But months later, she was speaking to me on the phone and explaining how money just seemed to be slipping out the front door as if the red tape wasn't there any more. Suddenly, she let out a scream. \\"It's gone!\\" she screamed over the phone, \\"someone took off the red tape!\\" After putting another piece of red tape back in place, the money problems stopped again. Needless to say, she checks her tape every day now.That's only one sample of the many true stories I could tell you of how helpful and easy this book is to use.And my life? A complete turn-around, and it's still going!If you've wanted to get a feel for Feng Shui and just didn't know how to get started, this is the PERFECT book for you!

I really took to the idea of &quot;move your stuff, change your life&quot; because now, as I look around the warehouse that I call my apartment, I realize how haphazardly I (ahem) decorated. In fact, most of what I've done in my apartment was pretty unconscious. Now I'm redecorating consciously. What I choose to put in the east corner or the southwest corner is deliberate, based on what &quot;gua&quot; or &quot;area of life&quot; that area represents. Ms. Carter is about as clear and helpful as any feng shui author I've read. Her writing is breezy and light and everything is clearly expressed and conveyed. I have a notebook full of notes. Right now I have such a messy and small apartment that only time will tell if feng shui has actually &quot;worked&quot; for me (or if I've done it correctly!). The thing is that even with the few things that I've moved around or cleared away, I can already feel how &quot;right&quot; the decorations fit with that part of the room.

The first chapter is a brief introduction, then the next chapters are an in-depth look at each different part of the bagua (basically the 9 different sections of your home and their relating life situation, for example the center of your home is related to health). The chapters are really well organized, they start off by saying what can be achieved by balancing that section, then say what elements should be there. For example, in your prosperity corner, red, green and purple are good colours to have around, and so is moving water. Then the book says what to avoid in that section, like in the prosperity section, you shouldn't have broken items. Then the author goes into greater detail about that section and the various &quot;cures&quot; for it. At the end of the chapter there is a list of immediate &quot;cures&quot; to use if you need a really quick change and also a summary of the chapter.

I instantly appreciated her humor and rejoiced that the advice given in the book was immediately useable. Do this and this will happen. Cause and effect. Maybe that's a little too cut and dried, but there is very little of the cloudy, etherial mysticism and tedious history, (that doesn't help and isn't immediately useable or needed), I have noticed in other books that tends to get a reader bogged down and feeling like you need three years of instruction before attempting to place your first piece of purple in your Prosperity area or hang up your first bell.I am fortunate that I have supportive friends who practice Feng Shui and a husband who is willing to learn. If Karen's book had been anything other than the clear-cut guide that it is, my husband would have chucked the whole idea out the nearest window. As it was, my husband was so impressed that my attempts at Feng Shui seemed to be working, that he let me have Karen Carter come into our home to do a consultation. The un-cluttering of our home has been a sometimes slow process, but it is working.

I tried reading several other books before I saw this one.Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life : How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect and Happiness by Karen Rauch Carter helps readers unlock the mystery of Feng Shui and understand that there is a shift in perception and intention, not just the action of moving stuff.I found Ms. Carter's style easy and informational. Her book chapters describe each area of the bagua so that the reader can move to any area quickly. Each chapter has a clear \\"what to do\\" and \\" what not to do\\" in addition to examples the author has seen working with clients. I really appreciated the charts and graphics to help clarify all of the symbols for each area of the bagua.I'm a life coach, and I know that clearing my life of clutter will continue to help me (and my clients) move towards my goals. Setting an intention when you arrange your \\"stuff\\" helps focus on the goals you choose.

Ms. Carter provides a modern Feng Shui that complies with America's thirst for the fun, quick, & simple. Her methods are easy to learn, understand, & apply. Her message: Feng Shui is about careful decorating; taking a good look at what you choose to surround yourself with & making sure it gives you pleasure - if it doesn't CHANGE IT! It's that simple. Ms. Carter doesn't waste your time with the \\"hex & curse\\" part of Feng Shui like measuring your furniture for dimensions that may indicate severe bad luck, or evaluating your land and taking compass readings. Die-hard-old-school-Feng-Shui masters will suggest you move inauspicious mountains! Along with Ms. Carter, I say if they are good enough for mother nature - they are good enough for me!

It is not filled with unecessary or common place information in the introduction. The author kindly gets to the point not soon after the introduction. The author focuses the book on one subject of Feng Shui; the sections of Ba-gua per Black Hat. Each section of the Ba-gua is a chapter to itself that is amply dealt with and uniformly organized consistanly. The drawings of floorplans are clear and understandable. There is a large graph crossection of the basis of each qua that is straighforward and clear. The authors approach maintains it congenial user-friendly. The author does a good job of making connections between the gua/sections instead them being isolated. There are a lot of useful,interesting suggestions and explanations in the book. The Ba-gua sections begin with the \\"Prosperity\\" followed by \\"Fame and Reputation..then \\"Relationships and Love\\"..positioned to meet the book's (sub)title.On the other side of things the subtitle of the book reveals a typical problem that arises; materialistic and instant gratification waterdown approach. The author continues throughout the book with a condesending, sterotypical, unnecessary, and cheesy use of marketable well-known names of people and slang expressions. Tacky and presumutious suggestions like \\"You can even use one of me (photo in back of the book)\\" in reference to what images to put on an altar, namely herself. There is in too many instances in this book of a lot of stupidity in expression, suggestion, and approach.Three stars is for its good points about this book. However I would encourage anyone to not limit themselves to it..read, compare, grow."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book says it's about feng shui, and it is, and of all the feng shui books I've read it's easily the clearest, most intuitive and most understandable. But the real power of the book, for me, has been in helping me to understand and implement organization. By examining space using principles of feng shui, I can ask questions about each object and its purpose and evaluate it in the context of my life. This allows me to get a snapshot, if you will, of my unconscious mind, and to make it congruent with my conscious goals and values. So it's not so much the moving of stuff that changed my life, but the investigation into my stuff, into my objects, that provided me with a mechanism for evaluating who I am and what elements could be added or subtracted from my space and from my Self. I do wish the book had an index, but I've been working with this text for ten years and it continues to be a valuable resource. Well done, KRC."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I have many Feng Shui books in my library, but this is the one I simply can't live without.

Can't find your keys?) Then the author suggests how to rearrange rooms and add certain Feng Shui elements like red threads, mirrors, etc to ward off bad energies.The book is very chatty and less technical than many Feng Shui how-to books. There are a lot of line drawing illustrations and examples of situations--how houses are oriented for example.This is a very good, short introduction to Feng Shui and probably one of the most readable books I've seen on the subject."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This is a fun book that provides ample inspiration and ideas to reorganize and redecorate your home or office. I use this book and gave copies to my kids. If you need a quick jump-start when your surroundings are ho-hum or cluttered, this is the best book to read to get unstuck. Don't trust the library to have it when you need it on a gotta-clean-this-messy-apartment kind of day; get your own copy. You'll refer to it often and, if it works for you as it has for my friends and family, it'll pay for itself in one use."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Life isn't what you hoped for? Household not working for you? Get this book, and at the same time get the book _Clear Your Clutter_ by Karen Kingston, and you'll have all the Feng Shui tools a Western person needs to start to tackle improving the energy that affects everything in your life. You don't need strength of character, a pleasing personality, or organizational ability to take productive action. Start with the Kingston book, which will set you to pouncing on your clutter with a clarity of purpose you probably haven't had in decades, then move on to _Move Your Stuff_ and really start viewing your environment with deliberation.I have read other books on Feng Shui, and these two are remarkable in their ability to inspire. _Move Your Stuff_ is great fun, well-written, and will explain things quickly. Guidelines are specific enough to let you take action (including identifying Feng Shui challenges so big you may want to call in the pros), but not so cookbook that you can't be creative about things and make your living space truly inspiring to you.

The author presents her information in a clear, concise, very humourus format; not a &quot;dummies&quot; version of feng shui instruction, but one that can be quickly grasped by almost anyone.

It is a wonderful starting point in how to simplify your home, and begin to get your life in order. It inspires you to delve more deeply into the fascinating aspects of Feng Shui, and perhaps study more. At the least, it will inspire you to get rid of needless clutter.

Sure, this book is very tongue-in-cheek, and it treats its subject extremely lightheartedly, but you can indeed learn much from it and become inspired to take a second look at your surroundings. I know some feng shui &quot;die-hards&quot; may consider a lot of what she says to be blasphemous, but feng shui is NOT a religion (so lighten up!). The author can get a bit cheesy in her humour at times, but I think the point is to ultimately look beneath the layers and find what works for you. Good companion books for this read are &quot;Clear Your Clutter With Feng Shui&quot; and &quot;Creating Sacred Space with Feng Shui&quot; by Karen Kingston."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life is as accessible as you could ever want a book to be.

I put this book on my reading list, and it stayed there for about 2 years before I had the time to read it. Over winter break I ordered it, and feng-shui'd my suite inside of the apartment that I share with two other people, according to the book. I put a small plant in my 'family' area, and another plant in my 'fame and reputation' area, and added a silver requests container to my 'helpful people' area, and some other little innocuous things like red pillar candles and red ribbons under the drain. Much to my surprise, my relationship with my parents has done a complete 180 since my dabble in feng shui, and all I can think of is that this small little lettuce plant sitting on my window sill next to my bed is responsible for this! And that I MUST keep it alive at all costs :) I joke, but truly the book is amazing, and easy to read.

It also gives a great explanation of feng shui and the various \\"bagua\\" components (like prosperity, family, career, creativity and children, helpful people and more).It also provides great feng shui \\"cures\\" for all sorts of potential problems, using things that you can easily purchase (or may already have in the home).This book uses the \\"Black Hat\\" approach to feng shui (apparently there are a few different types of feng shui out there). I will be reading about the American Syle next so that I can see how they differ (when I review that book, I'll explain any differences between the two feng shui styles).Overall, I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in feng shui'ing their home - however, I would suggest taking notes, as there's a lot of information packed in these pages!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I've heard about feng shui for years, but didn't know much about it.

Now, skeptics will say, come on, adding purple to my \\"prosperity corner\\" will make me rich? YA RIGHT! But I think the overall purpose of the book and the practice in general, and I'm generalizing, is to make you focus on your intentions. So after you've feng shui-ed your career corner every time you enter that room you are aware of your intentions for your career and think about all the great things you want in your career. And this applies to all areas of your bagua.A friend of mine is having financial trouble (who isn't right?), I checked her layout and lo and behold, bathroom in the prosperity corner! Time to turn to the prosperity chapter in the book, breakout the toolbox for a feng shui fix. I love that about the book! Immediate issues you are struggling with have instant \\"cures\\" that you can do quickly. Also, it tells you the hazards of each area so you can eliminate them immediately. And you don't have to steal stuff from the local Chinese restaurant to achieve feng shui. You can use the stuff you already have - BONUS!Ready for a testimonial? Everyone has a testimonial! I moved my desk to the center of the room and placed bookshelves behind me to \\"guard\\" over me and guess what? I got three new leads to design jobs that week. Now is it a coincidence? Maybe but, it also started me thinking about the next job and then the next job, etc. success breeds success. Same theory applies to all areas of the bagua. Thinking positive thoughts, using the power of intention in your life and feeling in control of your life and direction is half the battle. And after using the tools in the book, your house is in harmony and you'll feel better! Now go feng shui!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life : How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect and HappinessThis little book by Karen Rauch Carter is the best feng shui book I've read.

Now I am waiting for my romance energy to imporove!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I made a huge mistake with this book the first time but I won't do that again. I purchased this book originally in the Spring of 2003 as an impulse from a book club to fulfill an obligation. It wasn't too expensive and it just sounded like a curious title.well I got the book and I didn't take it all in but I decided it would be fun to experiment with it a bit. I started making small changes, coros here and there , a few plants, some small rugs, bed placement, some art. Nothing I did was major or crazy since at the time I was living in a one bedroom apartment.Well from these small changes all sorts of things happened. Little things I could not explain. People I hadn't heard from in a long time started contacting me, i started meeting new people to date and had a full social calendar, my job started smoothing out in rough spots and I went on 3 vacations in 5 months. I also found the perfect house during this time and started moving.A few months later I told a friend about all of this. She knew a lot about traditional feng Shui and convinced me in a well meaning way that this system I was using was not authentic and I would not really experience the results I wanted.I didn't know any better so I gave the book away. I tried to learn \\"authetic\\" feng shui and it never worked. It was too complicated so I just gave up.Now 5 years later I recently took this book out of the library to read again. 3 months ago I started making minor chages again and life is showing little changes that are just unexplainable. It might be from my intentions combined with the positive energy I have created in my home. I don't know what it is but it is working.The book is light, positive and fun. I talked to a Feng Shui expert who uses different schools of Feng Shui in her business and she explained that this is Black Hat Feng Shui. It is very westernized but it does have many benefits.So if your intentions are good and you want to experiment and just improve your space a bit and see what happens take a chance on this book. You won't see anything negative from using it. It is an enjoyable read and it might just change your life a little. If nothing else it will make you look at your life and your home a little differently."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Karen has done a wonderful job by writing this book with depth of information, easy to apply remedies in a humurous fashion.

It's fun to read and Karen Rauch Carter has a chatty, welcoming style of writing.

I'd heard about feng shui, and had even tried reading a few books on the topic, but this one was the first one that I actually understood.It starts out with an overview. Then it moves into chapters, which are divided by guas, or the different areas of your home. For example, one chapter deals with wealth and that area of your home. There are examples and anecdotes about different problems and cures. She offers solutions that can range from using color to objects you might have on hand around your house already. She also tells you what things are bad to put in this area of your house. There's a quick reference summary at the end of each chapter.I have tried a lot of 'cures' based on the book, and have found that they do seem to work!In addition, my house is just much neater. It helped me get rid of a lot of useless stuff. Now when I look around, I like almost everything I see. That alone is a miraculous cure! But it's funny, I'll try different things, and then find that stuff in my life shifts a little. I haven't won the lottery, yet :D -- but I'm experiencing more harmony in my life, and my work seems to be going more easily.This book also makes a good gift. It's written with humor, and the writer really seems to care about the subject and her audience. Definitely a worthy book for any personal library."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This is a great book for someone just starting with Feng Shui.

Three weeks later I got a $7000 raise. Of course, a lot of hard work went into getting that raise, but that large sum at one time is virtually unheard of in my company. I have to think those red ribbons aound my plumbing had something to do with it! (And the fact that I have a purple &quot;Prosperity&quot; bathroom)!Loved this book. Quick read, easy to understand and very easy to incorporate into my lifestyle. This book is my new &quot;housewarming&quot; gift for my friends and family. Worth the money!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"While I own several books on Feng Shui this is the book that I find recommending to other people again and again. It is written in a smooth accessible manner that is both personal yet conveys a wealth of information. Each time I reread it I find new information and new insights.Karen provides a clear explanation of the five elements and how these relate to your home is provided; something often lacking in similar books. Many Feng Shui books assume that you have studied eastern philosophy to some extent and their explanations of object placement in the home are based on that assumption. Most of us prefer to have at least some minimal understanding of why Aunt Hilda's portrait is better hung in teh laundry room rather than over the mantle.Karen proves many helpful features including summarized lists of do's and don'ts for each area of your home, office, and even automobile.The book is written with a sense of humor and an attitude that you are smart enough to arrange your own living space based on your tastes and desires."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book makes feng shui easy and fun! Karen Rauch Carter uses the Black Hat style which is a very simple, but effective, form of feng shui.

You'll be able to start making changes to your home, and your life, immediately with the easy to follow instructions that are provided.Inside, you will find a chapter for each of the 9 sections of the Bagua. Immediate action items and a short summary are provided at the end of each chapter, which can be referred to over and over. Karen will keep you entertained though out the entire book with her quirky sense of humor! She also provides loads of examples and stories of how feng shui can improve your life. I am an antique dealer, by trade, and I own my own business. I can honestly say that after decluttering my laundry room (my prosperity area) and painting it a pretty shade of lavender, I immediately noticed and increase in sales at my shop!Just A Tip: Make sure you read chapter 12 before you start making changes in your home, the affirmations in this chapter will make all of your actions much more effective!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I've read several Feng Shui books. This one is by far the easiest to read and apply the techniques. The author tells you exactly what colors and objects to put in each section (gua) of your home. In just one month, I've noticed positive changes in my life - both my husband and I are getting new job offers, my kids are behaving better. The author uses easy things - no need to spend thousands of dollars re-doing your home. She even uses regular aluminum foil and kids construction paper. However, if you are really into feng shui, there are more detailed books out there to hone in on particular problems. This is a general, over-all, fix-your-home book."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I've read a few other feng shui books and have not found any as practical or \\"user friendly\\" as this one.

This book de-mystifies the principals of Feng Shui, and reveals it as a common-sense approach to arranging and managing your surroundings.Each chapter examines an aspect of your life and walks you through the Feng Shui way of seeing it. It explains what the Chinese historically associated with each aspect: colors, numbers, compass directions, household functions, etc., and then explains how best to arrange things around you to improve your situation with family, friends, lovers, your career, and anything else about your life that could use some help!This is a must read introduction for any Westerners who are curious about what Feng Shui is and how it can improve their lives."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book is a brief and enjoyable introduction to the basic concepts of Feng Shui. Ms. Carter's writing style immediately sets the Western reader at ease with her use of tongue in cheek humor and continuous references to American pop culture and idioms.Enjoyability aside, this text assists the novice with some simple applications of feng shui, with a focus on Intent, Practicality and Personalization of each cure. She makes age old Chinese concepts less \\"foreign\\" and encourages the creative practice of the art -- integrated and customized for each person's beliefs and lifestyle. Having read many books on the subject, this is one of the few I feel comfortable recommending both to friends (due to the light nature) and to relatives (due to the avoidance of Eastern spiritual influence)."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Ms Carter makes feng shui fun. The overview of concept is easy to grasp and the everyday &quot;cures&quot; simple. It's a down-to-earth approach that takes away much of the confusion surrounding this popular subject. The author demonstrates that you don't need to be a &quot;black belt&quot; in feng shui to get great results! If you buy only one book on the subject, make it this one!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book is a good introduction into the world of Feng Shui. It's lighthearted approach makes it an easy read -- and it has succeeding in turning me on to studying the practice more seriously. (I felt that many other feng shui books are overwhelming and intimidating for beginners). The tongue-in-cheek humor gets a little tiring at times... but all in all, I did learn many principles that I started to apply right away.One suggestion to the author: an index would have been helpful."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Move your stuff Change your life was easy to read. I started implementing suggestions right away. I also got rid of a lot of clutter. It was fun to do and helpful. I now want to read more on the subject. I also decorated my husbands new office and every one seems to like it better than all the other offices. I used feng shui to decorate the office and the desk. I feel better already."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I have over 2 dozen books on feng shui, and they all left me confused and frustrated. Which feng shui system should I use? Where the heck is my prosperity corner? Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life knocks all the other feng shui books off my book shelves. The others try to be mystical, philosophical, and pay homage to their feng shui masters. Move Your Stuff just gets down to business with a lot of humor, and a lot of great information (that I did not find in the other so-called expert feng shui books.) I admit I had lots of accumulated clutter to clear before I could think about arranging my work and living quarters for optimum prosperity and well being. However, it was easy once I read each chapter as outlined for each of the segments of feng shui (fame and reputation, prosperity, love and marriage, etc.) One of the best things in the book is that Karen explains how to determine if there is a problem, and what you need to do to resolve it. She makes it clear - fixes are not just physical - they are mental and emotional, too. You must be clear in your intent to improve your life and take the necessary steps yourself. No one can take action for you. But Move Your Stuff can sure give you great guidelines for making positive energy flow in your life again. Try it. I promise your energy will increase and your circumstances will improve as you take feng shui actions to improve your life."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I've bought several books on Feng Shui, and this is the first one that actually makes sense! Yes, it's probably simplistic in its presentation of a complex topic and practice, but finally I got practical tips and tricks to immediately implement--on my own. Almost immediately after implementing some of her suggestions as well as some ideas of my own using her info, things started changing in my life. I hadn't realized how stuck the energy was in my house until I could feel it moving! I feel energized and motivated instead of exhausted and mired in mud. I also realized that things were basically where we had put them out of the moving boxes 5 years ago; now things are beginning to be put in their place, where it feels right for them to be--and I am finding such enjoyment in seeing them there. I think I will still call in an expert at some point (our powder room is in our prosperity gua, and there's a piece missing!), but I really am having fun doing a lot of it on my own. I highly recommend this book. It's a quick and easy read, and even funny sometimes."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"People are used to my wacky stories about my family, but my new favorite wacky stories are about Feng Shui.I read this book with much skepticism....but thought, &quot;Hey, it can't hurt, right?&quot; A few years ago, a Feng Shui practicing friend of mine asked me if I closed the toilet lid when I flushed...I said, &quot;Sometimes, but not always....&quot; and she replied, &quot;You're FLUSHING away your wealth!&quot; I had a good laugh, but decided to try it. I began religiously to put the toilet seat down...and got an unexpected check in the mail from the IRS that year. Let me just say that has never happened before or since.I decided to bone up on Feng Shui and did a Bagua map of my home and saw that my wealth area was my back bedroom which was in maxed out disarray due to a flooding problem which had recently been fixed. I took a week off from work and totally remodeled the room....even put new furniture in....and my husband got a nice raise! I know, it sounds crazy... but I think, in part, having an orderly home free of clutter destresses you and helps you become more peaceful and therefore more productive and happy.This was a great book. I can't comment on the love part as I've been married forever (but still love him), but I'm sure it can't hurt to try either! I highly recommend this book, if for no other reason, to get your home decluttered and more organized."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I have a number of books on Feng Shui, and this is easily the most accessible. It is written clearly, provides concrete examples, and the reasoning behind doing certain things is explained properly. In other books I have on the subject, a lot of time is spent dealing with the more arcane aspects of Feng Shui, which many of us do not need or want.This book is practical and easy to use, and its format allows one to walk around the house carrying it and applying its suggestions without having to take volumnous notes and study for days. If you want to bring order to your life, stimulate the flow of &quot;chi&quot; (energy) through your home, and make it a happier, brighter place (and your life better at the same time), this is the book to help you. It's sort of like &quot;Feng Shui for Dummies&quot;, but better. Don't hesitate on this one, buy it!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I was attracted to this book for the very reason that so many people seem to dislike it: it's basic, simple, straight-forward. I lived in Asia for 5 years and have accumulated numerous feng shui books - and was completely turned off by the whole attitude that \\"real\\" feng shui knowledge and power is only for those who have \\"earned\\" it. I don't believe this, and neither does Karen. Her attitude is that the power to change your life is right there, and with some adjustments, you'll tap into it - all on your own, with no \\"masters\\" or years of study. While I respect those who can and do study, the fact is that feng shui is an accessible and simple philosophy, and I see nothing wrong with a book promoting that.Another thing I like about this book is that it troubleshoots many situations, such as what to do if you live in a flat (as opposed to a house, which so many of us do) and what to do if part of your Prosperity, Family, Health and Fame corners fall outside your flat (as mine do, since I live in an \\"L\\"-shaped flat). Nowhere else have I seen such practical, real advice.I walked through my flat with the book in one hand and I noticed that all areas of my life that are going well (Helpful Friends, Creativity, Career, Knowledge, Relationships) already have things that Karen recommends, so I left them alone, as she says. But the areas where I am stuggling (mentioned above) all fall outside my flat, specifically in a dirty, dusty, unheated general storage room across the hall, full of tables and dead flowers (this is my Prosperity corner, so no wonder I'm living from paycheque to paycheque) and in the stairwell outside. I can't do anything about the architecture of my building, but she gave me several ideas how to help the situation and make up for this lack of chi. I made the changes yesterday (I buried a purple pencil in the dirt floor of the storage room, for example, in hopes of nudging my Prosperity into action) and am hopeful that things will improve. I'll keep you posted!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This is the ONE feng shui book you should bother with buying and reading. Trust me on this because, between myself and my mother, we have a library of certainly more than ten, all of which we've looked through but never actually read because they are too confusing and scientific. \\"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life\\", before changing our lives through feng shui and the rearrangement of our furniture and decor, first changed our lives by being the only feng shui book we've ever read like a novel. It's full of little magic tricks for your home and not confusing compasses and photos of interiors for design ideas. It's not at all scientific and it's really funny and fun to read. And the author makes feng shui sound like it makes a lot of sense too, for those that don't quite understand it. It would be so much harder to learn about feng shui from any other book I've read on the subject. I'm so enthused about it that I even came here to amazon just to review this book. I really love it. It will become indispensible to you!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book found me! We were on a ski trip at a friends home in Lake Tahoe. Two books were on the coffee table, one I had given my friend, and this book. Having read other books on Feng Shui, I picked it up for a quick browse and ended up taking copious notes and reading the whole darn thing in 24 hours. Karen (she feels like a close friend after reading it) has organized the material in an easy to digest and &quot;get it&quot; fashion. You will be able to focus and implement cures immediately based on her black hat sect style of feng shui. Yes, you still have to clean house a bit, but with Karen's recommendations, you don't feel overwhelmed, just inspired."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I've read lots of feng shui books and articles and Move Your Stuff is one of the best of the lot. The information is very solid and accurate; it's easy to access solutions and ideas. I discovered some new &quot;cures&quot; and learned that I was using an incorrect approach in one area that I will correct this weekend!I also love her tongue-in-cheek style of writing and ability to present information in a humorous fashion at the same time as taking her subject seriously. The only feng shui practicioner I've read who can see the humor is this art.I am a practicing Christian and there is nothing in this book that offends my spiritual or religious sensibilities.Only criticism - I'd like a list of references.A must for any amatuer practioners of feng shui or anyone who wants to make some real life changes in the millennium! I just bought a second copy to give to my brother."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book is very easy to read. I read the whole thing in just a few days. After each chapter I would tackle that part of my home - following the advice in the book - adding power tools and removing anything that would destroy the chi. Just one month after my roommate and I feng shuied our house we both have new jobs and are moving to areas we've been dreaming about! While we were moving all our stuff this was our main focus - changing jobs and moving. We are speechless that it has worked so well.One of the main things I noticed with feng shui - in this easy &quot;california&quot; version - is that it revitalized our energy. Its not like we just sat around waiting for new jobs - they developed for us but we did alot of leg work to find them.I think this book is a great tool to help anyone in creating order in their home and gaining energy to create changes in thier lives."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Having read quite a few Feng Shui books this is by far the best and easiest to understand. I read the book in two days and started to enchance my house,desk and car right away. Very practical and you don't have to &quot;buy&quot; anything. Most items are in your possession already. I hope Karen is writing another book soon. I loved her light and funny manner of writing, instead of all the historical and technical terms most other authors use. Great Book!! I loved it!!!

Ms. Carter provides a modern Feng Shui that complies with America's thirst for the fun, quick, &amp; simple. Her methods are easy to learn, understand, &amp; apply. Her message: Feng Shui is about careful decorating; taking a good look at what you choose to surround yourself with &amp; making sure it gives you pleasure - if it doesn't CHANGE IT! It's that simple. Ms. Carter doesn't waste your time with the &quot;hex &amp; curse&quot; part of Feng Shui like measuring your furniture for dimensions that may indicate severe bad luck, or evaluating your land and taking compass readings. Die-hard-old-school-Feng-Shui masters will suggest you move move inauspicious mountains. Along with Ms. Carter, I say if they are good enough for mother nature - they are good enough for me! This book provides the can-do type of Feng Shui. It focuses on the positive and provides and uplifting guide to better your surroundings &amp; change your life. It worked for me."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"While visiting my son and his family, I was really into reading this book. My son showed an interest so I bought them one as a gift. He started using it right away. He moved items around in his office and another space in his home and received two important phone calls, that will change his prosperity!Karen's humorous approach makes this book really easy to read and follow. She removes a lot of the mystic that is sometimes associated with Feng Shui. I highly recommend it to anyone that is just becoming acquainted with Feng Shui!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book is easy to read and implement. I am reading it over a second time as I try to make some sense of my home. At the very least, it her suggestions don't work, I will have cleaned all of the corners of my house trying to unstick the chi. I actually have been trying some of the suggestions and am feeling better about my life and home and family than I have in a long time."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This is easy to read and understand and most things are covered. A couple of things are not quite covered, like staircases, but for the most part this book is fun, useful, and very easy to implement."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book makes feng shui do-able for everyone. It is written in clear, easy-to-read and understand language. I used it to &quot;fix&quot; my previous house, and life became so much easier and happier. Money started flowing in instead of out. When the time came to sell the house, I went back to the book, used the &quot;Helpful People&quot; hints, and had my first offer within 3 weeks. The sale and purchase of my new home came off without a hitch. Now I'm looking forward to optimizing space in my new place to keep the energy flowing."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book was written for mass media, not for people serious about Feng Shui. The tone of the book is childish with corny jokes thrown in frequently. Feng Shui is about the ancient art of placement to become more in tune with the universe. The author of this book treats Feng Shui almost as a magic act to get what you want. In addition to being written in a disrespectful manner, many important aspects of Feng Shui were omitted from the text. Many other reviews of this book are from people stating this is the first book on Feng Shui they understand. Perhaps this is because so many aspects of Feng Shui were not even mentioned in this book. My advice is - try another book on Feng Shui. It may be a little harder to understand, just study harder or hire a Feng Shui consultant to help you."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"If you are simply looking for a book that can tell you the practical ways you can bring feng shui into your life, and you don't care about the tone in which the book is written, then you may like this book. I, however, was very put off by the silly, almost giddy way the author writes. The minute I read that the Love/Relationship corner of a house is the area you want to work on if you're looking for a &quot;shagadelic good time,&quot; I was done. Now I am off I go to try to find a book that treats the art of feng shui, and those who are interested enough in the world around them to learn about it, in a more respectful way."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK,IT CHANGED MY LIFE,GREAT INFORMATION HELPED ME SO MUCH.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE!IT IS A FAST READ"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I have bought this book several times as a gift and twice for myself, because we were still unpacking after our move and I wanted a refresher in Feng Shuing our new home.Over the past 12 years I have read various teachings of Feng Shui and have to say that Karen's approach is the most practical and useful approach for my family and friends.

I've used cheap construction paper for many of my cures, but I'm putting flower bouquets together and feeling much better about controlling my future. I noticed that my finances have been good this year, since Christmas, and when I re-read my other feng shui book that I've had for years and reminded myself that red was my lucky color, I remembered that I had bought myself a red wallet while Christmas shopping. Now I feel like this can really make a difference and I'm putting more effort into it than I did 5 years ago when I read the first book. The other book is more about directions and lucky colors and shapes. It doesn't even go into the bagua. There are many angles to feng shui."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Many simple solutions and ideas that don't cost money (or don't cost much) and the author is actually quite entertaining--which is great bcs you need lots of humor to help understand more about what feng shui does and also what it CAN'T do for you. The book makes feng shui totally approachable: if you're looking for ways to utilize chi (energy) enhancements that work in your own weird/old/typical home, then this is the book for you. Most feng shui books don't offer solutions that renters and apartment dwellers can utilize, but this one does. I mean, honestly, who has a landlord willing to install a fountain in the front yard or who'll swap out your old front door--because YOU, the renter, need a career booster? Yah. Not mine, either."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book is great. I have purchased a number of them over the years. After I help my friends with their feng shui I give them this book for reference. It is easy to understand when feng shui can sometimes be very confusing. Karen writes it in a way that you can easily implement some basics or go in depth as much as you choose. I highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I have read more than a dozen Feng Shui books, and Karen's is the only one that I would take the time to endorse. It's crammed with useful, easy to understand information that is appropriate for the feng shui novice and enthusiast alike.There are so many things that I've learned from this book that amaze me. I have been studying up on this for 3 years, and her book was the inspiration for me to start a total de-cluttering of our place! You need this book!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Carter claims that \\"proper feng shui is purposefully arranging the stuff around you to gain positive results.\\" That right there tells anyone who knows anything about feng shui what garbage this book is. I picked this up because of all of the reviews and I was appalled at how bad it was! Yes this book is easy to read. It's really small and simple. It lets you know that all you have to do to improve your life is put a color here and move a chair there and a money tree there and wallah!- You become a great success and meet the love of your life.. Ah yes wouldn't that just be grand if it were true? No wonder so many love this book; Wishful thinking!But here's why it's such a quick read and takes zero time or effort to implement- Because it's not actually feng shui. Real Feng Shui is a little more complicated than that. It requires some time to figure out certain equations. Books that teach you genuine feng shui as has been done in the east for centuries show you how to do at least some of these equations for you to implement the art to your home with adequate results. People love this book because it requires no time and no figuring out of anything- Just buy certain things and move them around- so it offers no results either. In fact one can actually end up making things worse as far as real feng shui is concerned. Just to give you an idea- this book as well as the author's other book entitled \\"clear your clutter\\" were voted among the worst feng shui books on the market by writers and practioners of traditional feng shui. This woman either doesn't know what she's doing or she's banking on the fact that westerners don't want to put in the time for real feng shui so she's instead written a couple of books on neatness and design and decided to call that \\"feng shui\\" to make money. This book may motivate you to organize yourself and add certain colors and things that you otherwise wouldn't & that's great, but I guarantee you that with this book you won't be practicing feng shui. For the real deal try books like 'The complete idiots guide to feng shui' or 'Chinese Whispers'. Because they've got more content and because they teach you how to figure out the equations used in feng shui, they aren't as quick to read and apply, but even if you don't have the time to study those books I feel its better to read & apply a tiny portion of real feng shui in your home than it is to read entire books of crap that's deceptively marketed as feng shui."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"After reading the MANY negative reviews for this book; I decided to update my earlier review and explain a few things to some of the self professed Feng Shui experts that ripped this wonderful book.1. This book is about the black hat sect of Feng Shui. NOT the Form or compass sects of Feng Shui.The Form and compass schools of Feng Shui work expertly in Asia where the homes are built facing south to take advantage of the heat of the sun in winter. Homes are designed to better take advantage of Feng Shui from the beginning.Here in the west when the homes are built where they face every different direction imaginable; so the rigid compass school of Feng Shui does not work here as it does in Asia.The form sect of Feng Shui DOES work in the U.S. but not many people practise that variety, and is very complex to understand.2, The Black hat sect of Feng Shui is the easiest sect of Feng Shui that I have EVER read!3. Ch'i primarily enters the home at the front door. It is only logical to turn the compass in the direction your home is facing, and viola; you end up with the black hat sect!4. I read lots of books on Feng shui (teaching both the form and compass sects; and in my years of trying; Feng Shui was pointless.I bought this book quite some time ago, and learned that my prosperity corner was in the bathroom. I starting keeping the commode lid down, and the bathtub and sink closed. amd placed a peice of jade in the linnen closet. since I have been doing this; I have been more prosperous than at any other time since I lived in this apartment. I have sold more than $4,000 of books, got a raise at my job, AND gave three HUNA workshops (One in Atlanta, Ga, and two HUNA workshops in Ontario, Canada), and will probably be going to the Caribbean next year to give a HUNA workshop.5. I KNOW from first hand experience that this book works, and will help anyone with an open mind.6. If your house faces south; the compass sect of Feng Shui will work GREAT; but if you are like me, and your residence faces North west, or in some other direction; then BUY this book!I am NOT entirely happy with the book because it is weak on cures for dealing with shars (poisoin arrows).E-Mail me if you like."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book works! When something is out of sync....family, work, money I open up my book and make a few adjustments! I sware it works! I've given 4 copies away as gifts thats how awesome this book is. I believe it is a must have. If your looking for a college degree in Feng Shui this is not it. If you want to put the idea's to work in your everyday life this book is it."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This is very easy to understand and very entertaining. I tried the techniques and after I worked on my prosperity corner I received an unexpected but welcome check. There are many types of Feng Shui and many don't acknowledge Black Hat, but for me this is the most reasonable. Most of the other forms are just not feasible in the way we live today. This book is well worth the money."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I really liked this book. I thought it was entertaining as well as educational. It read like a novel while teaching me how to balance my stuff. I really liked the part about affirmation in the back. I believe the affirmations should probably be read before you start moving your stuff around, that way when you place stuff and say your affirmations at the same time, it makes the placement that more meaningful for you and your intentions."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I have recently become interested in Feng Shui, and many of the books I am reading have been confusing and contradictory.

The following morning I reached for it as soon as I got out of bed. It's the first book on Feng Shui that I actually understand, with the major tools and principles stated in plain english. The book shows you how to make small changes in your home to achieve big successes in your life. In one day, my home feels calmer and more serene, and so do I. This is a great book for practical people looking for practical Feng Shui solutions."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book seems simple but doesn't really work. I tried many, many of the recommendations. Not only did my life not change,but my apartment looked terrible. The book is overly simplistic and mentions little about intention, putting energy into your actions, house blessings, etc. I just recently discovered Feng Shui for Dummies and would recommend it instead. I just made a few of the changes from it and the energy in my place just feels much better. Even if I don't get major life changes, my interior design is flowing better. Skip Move Your Stuff, it doesn't change anything."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"This book provide a good overview of basics of Feng Shui. Well written, author being a native english speaker language flow is appealing. However, before you start doing anything serious with Feng Shui lot more reading and knowledge is requried. Also like most western practioners author has taken the liberty to ignore some of the very important formulas in Feng shui. As an example, this entire book is written with assumption that front door is at the north and left back corner is the Propserity. However, no where in the book it says the fact that left back corner is not always the prosperity corner. It is the South East corner that is the prosperity corner. Also things are not that simple, to make anything meaningful one need to consider 8 mansion formula at minimum. Which is completly ignored in the book. Flying star Feng shui is also not discussed. Flying star is an advance Feng Shui. Book should at least consider 8 mansion, without that any cure you do can invite disaster by activating some unlucky stars.I have given 4 stars because its style. Technical accuracy may be 2 stars.It is important to note that Feng Shui is a dangerous subject to attempt without knowing the details. What is in this book is good to read but please consult a professional or read more before trying out. e.g. People say clear your clutter. Which is in general true. But you do not want to go out and disturb 3 shas by cleaning wrong parts of your house during the wrong time. You do not want put a wate fountain on wrong (yellow stem) direction"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Easy to read and clear instruction on how to use this ancient energy.

It is broken down very well and has worked like a charm ... I mean a \\"cure\\" in our household. The only detractor for me was that there was no index for quick reference. However, the simple charts alone make it worth more that the other books on Feng Shui that I have tried.

Very simple to use, quick to get into..you can open the book and find simple cures right away...very basic, BUT gave me a new angle on things I was confused about in other books. Highly recommend for the beginner OR seasoned reader.Just to be more clear things I loved about this book...-the stress on whole house balance, for example, gives numerous examples of how the areas or guas affect each other...(a big problem we had, money came in, but it went out as fast...strengthening the 'family' gua would back up our prosperity, etc, etc, etc)-anyone can open this book and start-I have an older home with lots of added on 'porches' which I never really was able to 'fit' with other advice (including a feng shui consultant). What I loved was that this book suggested that I utilize the house as it was originally built, AND where I felt the house 'started' with the front door...(it sounds wierd, but I have 2...and this 'fit' with what I was unable to 'fix' with other feng shui advice)-lots of little tips and examplesNow is this the be all and end all?

I added water into my career area, and was able to get a job. Also put the name of the manager of the company I interviewed days before in helpful people section. Viola, I got a call with an offer from the same manager. I was unemployed for two months before I did this. After few months into job, I ignored and removed water from the career section. I lost that job. I was unemployed again for 3 months. I was attending many interviews, but no job offers. One day just glanced this book for career area, I realized my mistake and put the water again in my career area.

I have a friend that's been calling me for years complaining about his work situation. I decided to bring the book over, keep him busy doing the \\"Feng Shui\\" thing at his house to take his mind of his work woes. In his prosperity room we found a broken table and chair, broken fountain, a curio where he put his industry information (that had not been cleaned, touched in 10 years). He fixed the table, chair, and fountain. We emptied and cleaned the curio. I told him to trash all his industry books, but tear out the page of the one company he wanted to work for. We implemented everything from the prosperity chapter and the next day he was inspired to call the company and ask for an interview. That was on a Wednesday and he was hired Friday. Not only was he hired at NBC, but CBS picked him up as well. For all you advanced Feng Shui students who complain that this book is rudimentary and \\"Folk-ish\\", just relax...it's a great starting point for somebody who needs to do something \\"today\\". I have a great collection of advanced Feng Shui books that require compass and maps and coordinates...and it's very overwhelming. When I go to a friend's house and we take our first look around, this book does not overwhelm, and it's quite entertaining =o)"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I first read this book in 2000 when it came out. I have since read it every time I have moved or when I was feeling stuck in some part of my life. I get the book out, I figure out which bagua needs to be changed, change it and viola, I have positive changes where I need them in my life.

Shortly after moving my belongings around in my career area, I was enrolled in college. My prosperity and helpful people sections were spruced up, and my husband landed a job earning over 200,000.00 a year. Is it magic? No it is Feng Shui principles utilized on the simplest levels with a huge dose of intention and direction from the author of this book. Her humor and ease of use make this my number one Feng Shui book and I would recommend it to beginners as well as seasoned practitioners. Give it a heart felt try and watch in amazement as your life transforms in front of you as if you are in a movie. Real Cool."},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"Feng Shui is a very deep subject, and as a classically trained practitioner, I know that it takes many years to master the subject, learn all of the techniques and especially, develop a real understanding of the principles involved. Karen has it in this easy book! She nails the principles!Karen speaks to you, and easily describes ways in which you can start to move your life forward by creating a more supportive environment. You can't become a practitioner from this information, but you can get some great results for yourself! I refer to her book when I am feeling stuck!Is clutter all there is? Do we all need to boost our Wealth or Love corners? Perhaps, since our experience with the energy (Qi or Chi) of our environments is specifically affecting each of us in a different way. But in general, these ideas are good for starting to make your home a better place for you, and for getting that 'shift' in your life, building intention for a better life, and thinking more about your environment, instead of taking it for granted.Karen is a really warm and caring person, and her book is the result of her years of practice, her education and her desire to pass this on. I recommend this book to everyone who feels stuck, or is interested in learning how Feng Shui could positively affect their lives!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"After reading and practicing Feng Shui myself for years, I stumbled across this gem and wished I had it sooner! It is very easy to use, VERY practical. It takes the guessing out of all the other types of Feng Shui. Karen does an outstanding job at teaching you while incoorperating her own sense of humor into what you need to know about Feng Shui and especially in the different Guas. This is very easy to use, you are able to use common sense usually everyday household items so you aren't spending a fortune on making changes in your life. When other people ask me what book is the best, I know recommend this book above all others. You will not be disappointed.I do want to touch on some comments on here. There are many styles of Feng Shui, ranging from compass points to Black Hat Sect. For some of us, including me, especially the compass point one really threw me for a loop because I basically suck at math. Having said, that one of the main reasons I loved this book is it is clearly written for the layman, the everyday man who wants to make changes and can by utilizing the techniques in this book. I am not saying the other styles are wrong, because they aren't, each style is just that, a different way of utilizing what you have in your environment to make the best improvements in your life.So again, whether you are a beginner or an expert, this book teaches you the Feng Shui lingo but at the same time, in a way that you can not possibly misunderstand!Read it....use it...I promise you it will change your life!"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","review":"I bought this book thinking, from the reviews I read here, that this book would be an easy approach to Feng Shui BUT I was disappointed.

Heck before this I was sleeping on a mass of filthy clothes, that faced the east, I moved my little sleeping nest and viola! Not only does the sun not glare in my eyes when it rises but the lights from the passing cop cars were unable to find me the other night when a drug bust right next door was going down.Heck that's just damn GOOD LUCK right there. ;DInfact when the Shopping Cart Lady came and lived with me for a while it helped organize her too. We put the old shoes in what was possibly the back dining room, and the old toilet paper rolls in the fire place. Of course when I told her that Pink is not a color SHE should be wearing she got insulted and left. But not without chucking a whole laptop at me that she'd ripped off from somewhere.Heck if it wasn't for this book and our neighbors very open cable/internet line I would never have found this lovely site and ordered the Golden Feng Shui Coins and Waving Golden Cat.Heck this book got me to try Feng Shui'ing the front yard and lo and behold Duggie the Druggie was walking by.

The Guyer text is thorough and rigorous--a quite careful reading and interpretation of the Third Critique--I recommend it along with Allison's recent work. (Allison and Guyer sometimes disagree on important points....)Allison is an astute and keen defender of Kant (see his Transcendental Idealism/Yale UP). This new book is aptly in line with his best scholarship and cautious reading. I highly recommend it.Allison's text is divided into four parts. First, he deals with Kant's \\"Conception of Reflective Judgment,\\" whereby I recommend that you also review B. Longuenesse's book on judgment (Princeton UP). Allison's interpretation here differs from L's, and he clearly states how his view is unique, as well as a more balanced comprehension of the conncetion between the reflective judgment of taste and the epistemic role of reflection.I daresay, the second part of the book is the most important (Chs. 3-8); it deals with the quid facti/quid juris distinction in the domain of taste. Chs. 6-8 are quite useful, especially ch. 8, which is on \\"the Deduction of Pure Judgments of Taste.\\" An understanding of this material is crucial to a more certain grasp of K's Third Critique.Part 3 deals with the connection between judgments of taste and moral judgments. Ch. 10 discusses the mirror-like connection between 'duty' and pure 'aesthetic judgments.'Part 4 discusses genius and K's notions on sublimity. For specific coverage on this topic, see Crowther on the Kantian Sublime (Oxford UP) in conjunction with this chapter."},{"Title":"Kant's Theory of Taste: A Reading of the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment (Modern European Philosophy)","review":"Allison's book provides a wealth of interesting and semi-interesting arguments on the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment. The book is important in engaging with Guyer and the tradition of analytic aesthetics. It responds to many of the lacunas in Guyer's *Kant's Theory of Taste*, particularly as regards the status of judgments of taste as reflective. However, Allison by no means goes far enough in explaining the import of this status. Those interested in the 3rd Critique are adivsed to get Makkreel's much more readable work if they wish to understand the reflective character of aesthetic judgments, including their contribution to reflective interpretation. Also, Allison at times goes too far in attacking Guyer, leaving Guyer able to readily deal with many of Allison's points, and thereby continue his own critique of Kant."},{"Title":"Diners of Pennsylvania","review":"Eagerly awaited this book, but expected it to be another 'photo' book, but it is a well-researched, nicely mapped handbook to the surviving diners of Pennsylvania.

Of those, the Ingleside Diner in Thorndale (a featured diner in the book) is gone--apparently since 2002 (according to further research on the web), the Crescent II is now the Double D (interesting name--but that is where I went--and really enjoyed it--has a real diner feel). What was the Downingtown/Cadillac Diner is there--looked kind of seedy--and was marketing on its outside its connection to \\"The Blob\\"--even though that original diner has been gone since the sixties...Anyway, I realize (as well portrayed in the book) the frequent changes in the diner scene--and I also realize that keeping up with new information would be a gruelling task.

There have been many weighty works on the life and times of Villa produced since. The main advantage of this one is that when it was written the author was able to interview a lot of old timers who had known Villa. The only contempories of his still living were children then. Since the book is rather popular in character and not a scholarly work, it can be read with pleasure but only the completist and the specialist collector need it. I would recommend John S.D. Eisenhower and others that I have reviewed here as much more historically sound. On the other hand the Recent Book by Fredrich Katz is more than the average curious reader will want to read. Even as a specialist I found it more useful as a reference than as a straight through read."},{"Title":"Pancho Villa","review":"William Douglas Lansford's book &quot;Pancho Villa&quot; paints an enlightening perspective of the man behind the image the &quot;Bandido.&quot; This beautifully written story illustrates how a single act of defensive violence leads Villa to commanding the epic struggle of the Mexican Revolution.

Helfgott's book gives a good overview of the development of how the West has influenced both carpetmaking and technique, and also convincingly sets forth the case against both Western importers and those involved in industrial scale production for unfair labor practices persisting until today. The book is marred, however, by a somewhat academic writing style and and a haughty stance the author takes vis a vis Western carpet collectors (though I'll bet he owns some). Sometimes the reader gets the unpleasant impression that Helfgott is writing to impress other academics with his politically correct views and verbiage. He uses words which it seems he thinks are more exact, like \\"Temur Lenk\\" for example, instead of the generally used \\"Tamerlane\\" for example, despite the fact that \\"Temur Lenk\\" is merely the Arabic version of the Persian \\"Timur-i-lang\\" (Temur the Lame). Temur, of course, was neither Arab nor Persian, but Turkic from Central Asia, and was actually called \\"Amir Temur\\". On the whole, the book in general is worth reading for its information, so long as one is prepared to wade through some annoying bits of professorial snobbishness."},{"Title":"ties that bind: a social history of the iranian carpet","review":"I just finished \\"The Ties That Bind\\", by Helfgott Leonard. I have to say that I was surprised on how much I ended up liking it and got out of it. I had a slightly hard time in the beginning with it. As I found the writing on the dry side. Though as the book progressed it seemed to get better. Whether it was the author loosening up or myself just getting used to the style, I am not sure.Though style aside, I found the book to be a marvel at filling all of the blanks that oriental rug books leave you with. Most books dealing with oriental rugs talk about where a village that could have made a particular rug is or which way the wool is twisted or the number of knots per square inch for a particular type of carpet. Though few ever really talk about the people behind the looms. Whether it is a weaver or producer.The book also takes the Iranian oriental rug industry out of the vacuum that it seems to fall into in most books and puts it into context with the rest of the world at different times up to the 1940's. This reason alone makes the book worth buying. As you see the outside influences that really caused such massive change in Iran. This is true not only in the business world but also culturally for them as well.I don't think this book is for everyone. It is not a light reading book, but a scholarly book for the person interested in the oriental rug business or in the history of Iran. For this person I would highly recommend it. Being in the oriental rug business for about twenty years. I found that it talked about a side of the business that rarely gets discussed. It was exciting too me in this way and I found that I learned a lot.Kudos to Mr. Helfgott"},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"This book is great and works under the premise that you get the best effort out of people, not by lighting a fire under them, but by building a fire within them.In short, its simply a collection of ways to reward employees for doing a good job. It is divided into 6 sections (day to day rewards, intangible rewards, tangible rewards..) so there's definitely a boatload of reward ideas to fit just about any work situation. Examples from companies across the United States make this a fun read as well. Also good for any HR department-The Sixty-Second Motivator."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"BOOK REVIEW 1001 WAYS TO REWARD EMPLOYEES by Bob Nelson Workman Publishing Company, NY, NY Whether you manage a department, oversee a division, lead a company, or run a family business with just one employee, there is an essential principle to follow that is too often overlooked: What most motivates the people who work for you is recognition. The problem for too many of us, however, is that we don't have &quot;employee recognition&quot; as a line item in our budgets. In response to that all-too-common problem, Bob Nelson, author of 1001 Ways To Reward Employees, polled the American business community asking for low-cost ideas, proven strategies, achievement awards, contests, time off, case studies, and praise ideas. And the business community came through for him-and for us. This paperback has 225 pages of great ideas that leaders in the business community use to reward their hard-working employees-from keeping a &quot;treasure chest&quot; brimming with gifts so supervisors can reward employees on the spot (Chevron) to cab fare for workers who have to stay late (Time, Inc.) to pocket protectors, magnetic calendars and notepads imprinted with the slogan &quot;Got an idea? Write it down!&quot; to encourage employee participation in a suggestion program (John Deere). Whether you have a large recognition budget, a small budget, or no budget at all, you will find informal and formal ideas, expensive and cost-free ideas-something that will fit your need to let employees know how much you appreciate their efforts. Ken Blanchard, who wrote the forward, noted, &quot;With 1001 Ways to Reward Employees, praising, recognizing and rewarding employees just became a little easier. You can now provide the rewards and recognition that people in your life so richly deserve...This is one book that should be on every manager's desk!&quot; I have taught first-time manager classes over the past five years, and this is one of the concepts and tools our new managers appreciate the most. I've used many of the ideas myself. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"As the title implies, the book contains a large number of ideas. Some will work in some organizations, while others might work elsewhere. As often happens when one tries to generate ideas in abundance, not all will be useful. But being able to puruse the overall landscape of opportunity has been helpful.My concern, however, is the focus that this book places on recognition, as opposed to results. For a deeper treatment of human performance in the workplace, I suggest people also read RESPONSIBLE MANAGERS GET RESULTS: HOW THE BEST FIND SOLUTIONS, NOT EXCUSES, by Gerald Faust and co-authors. This provides a balance to the overall perspective of the leader. Because after all, the main purpose for rewarding employees is to achieve responsible performance that leads to organizational, bottom-line results."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"I am always leary of books of lists. With my skepticism on full blast, this book immediately disarmed me by leading off with my own favorite advice about motivating people: Ask them what motivates them.The book is then organized into sections that capture different kinds of ways to praise and recognize individuals. Taking the items that turn someone on, you can then cruise the lists until they trigger an idea that fits your situation. The book works well in that sense.The book works well at another level: You get a sense of human ingenuity by reading all of the interesting things that people have done to appreciate each other. It gives you a good feeling, as well, to consider how much thoughtfulness people show for each other.Reading the book reminded me of an experience I had in my 20s. Our CEO had encouraged me to run a seminar for people in our company to make strategy development easier for people. I had worked hard, and it went well. Hoping to inspire people, I had arranged for him to speak to the group at the end of the seminar. I was tremendously pleased when he did. Imagine my immense happiness when he arrived with a gavel in hand, and presented it to me. He had ripped it off of a Junior Achievement trophy that he had in his office, because he wanted to give me a gift. After 27 years, I still have and treasure that gavel. This book will help inspire you to have the same effect on others.Most of us would love to be great founts of motivation, but our imagination trails our enthusiasm. This book will help you fill that void. As Bob Nelson points out, 75 percent of companies do too little motivating. Even if you do the right amount of motivating, this book will help you do it better. There are appendices in the back to make it easier to implement the ideas in the lists in the front.It's a great book concept for managers. No wonder the book has been a great seller for years. Be sure you get this book and use it often! You'll be well on your way to overcoming the communications stalls that delay progress in almost all organizations, by creating the basic appreciation for one another that forms the trust necessary to all good understanding.There's an old saying: Don't show me how much you know, show me how much you care. This book embodies that spirit in a beautiful way."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"This paperback is an easy reference book for managers considering ways to reward (read: acknowledge excellence) among employees. There is also some suggestion of programs designed to reward longevity (just being there).Good managers are good leaders with vision and drive. Using this book as a tool, a manager might provide a team with the seeds for some creative thinking. However, if your organization is not part of a bigger corporate structure, many of the ideas are too expensive or too large to personally manage. The result is a bit discouraging as you flip pages thinking &quot;good idea...but...&quot;There are great quotes in shaded areas along the edges of each chapter, and the general ideas are organized under headings such as Employee/Company Anniversary, or Safety. Finding information is easy thanks to the author, Bob Nelson.I've let my managers read and react to the book, and I used it in a workshop on rewarding employees. This is a fine resource, an affordable book to stimulate discussion, but not likely the sole solution to your issues.Amazon features a wide selection of books on the topic of employee reward and recognition, this is a mid-range book in that spectrum of resources. It is an effective argument against simply providing cash incentives and managers seeking to win that debate are greatly served by this book."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"I own a charity-focussed website, and have over 300 volunteers who donate their time and effort towards the site's efforts. We deliberately channel all the extra money we can towards charities. I greatly value and appreciate all of the volunteers efforts and try to do my very best to show them my appreciation. I bought this book looking for ways to help those volunteers to feel cared for and respected.You get about 225 pages worth of one-paragraph blurbs describing specific ways that companies have recognized their employees. Many of these, despite the book's subtitle of \\"low cost ideas\\", are rather expensive. Leo Burnett provides $3,000 in adoption assistance. Kollmorgen Corporation takes its people for ocean cruises. Domino Pizza holds company-wide Olympics, giving away $4,000. I just don't have that kind of budget.Still, as with most management books, if you go through the details, you can pick out a few great ideas amongst all of the ones which are entirely unworkable. You can make a hall of fame of outstanding employees. Create awards for individuals who go above and beyond the call of duty. Recognize great contributions immediately, and encourage people to offer up suggestions on how to improve things. Find ways to help your employees become healthier and happier.I really did appreciate many of the suggestions, like offering cash prizes, would help companies with spare cash. I think I was disappointed because right at the top of the book it says \\"money isn't everything\\" and \\"low-cost ideas\\". There were a few inexpensive ideas at the beginning of the book - and then it promptly went into things requiring a fair amount of money or are simply cash bonusses. If I had money to burn, then I could *easily* think up thousands of ways to reward my volunteers without any help at all. That would be easy! The balancing act is that I do *not* have a lot of money - but want those volunteers to know how incredibly valuable they are. That is the challenge, and I had hoped this book would help me with that. The book claimed on its cover that it would ... but that wasn't quite what it offered.For those with a fair amount of money, the book will be a great help. However, I think that it should remove the \\"money isn't everything\\" title at the top, given how many of its suggestions are either cash awards, or costly items."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"I was disappointed with this book. Yes, it does have lots of reward ideas (I tried counting them but only got to around half of the advertised 1001 ideas). What really disappointed me, however, was that most of them required a fairly large expenditure. I work for a small company (under 100 employees) and in a tight economic environment, we just don't have the funds to be sending people to Hawaii or some of the other *big* rewards in this book. I needed something that recommended inexpensive reward options. This book was not it. (I did find another one listed on Amazon that advertises it has \\"101 ways to reward team members for $20 or less\\" -- I think that might suit me better. I'm going to buy that one next and see if it suits my situation any better.)"},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"I read this book at least a year ago for the firsttime and implemented several of the ideas immediately.

Any successful employer knows that you invest in employees; you cut back on other expenditures. Successful entrepreneurs have learned that treating an employee with respect and dignity, providing a positive work environment, paying what the employee is worth and providing incentives and benefits will increase productivity and enhance profits. If this does not produce results, perhaps you have hired the wrong employee for the job. An employee wants to feel a part of the business, as if he/she is working with you, not for you.. MINIMUM WAGE IS NOT AN INCENTIVE OR A REWARD FOR QUALITY WORK, DEDICATION AND LOYALTY! After all, it is your employees who are going to help you achieve a profit.This is a fantastic book and one employers, particularly those with few human resource skills, should read. Money is not always the answer when it comes to rewarding quality work. This book is well-written and contains some very worthwhile points and suggestions on both motivating and rewarding your employees."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"Even though Bob Nelson wote this for business-oriented workplaces, it can apply to anyone in a supervisory/ team-oriented situation. Even as the advisor of a high school student organization, I found the suggestions and examples very encouraging at thinking of ways to increase member satisfaction. I used a few suggestions as soon as I could, and I saw our membership increase 20% after implementing the first idea. Any organization would benefit from what is offered here or in Nelson's followup books, such as 1001 Ways to Energize Employees. I have given this book as a gift to others in leadership positions, and have been on the receiving end of some of the concepts since one of the recipients was the principal of my school. If you had only the time and money for three books to help an organization improve, this should be one, and teambuilding books like the Indoor/ Outdoor Teambuilding Manual should be among them."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"Bob Nelson and Ken Blanchard have established the benchmark in reference works for understanding the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards and how to use them.

While this may not last long, it becomes vital to find ways to motivate employees, especially if a firm is not hiring or cannot spend much on extras and must keep current employees productive and happy.The good thing about &quot;1001 Ways to Reward Employees&quot; is that not all the ways require big expenditures. The book gives ways to match rewards to your budget. More importantly, it also lists how to match the reward to the type of employee. The book lists best practices from organizations as diverse as BankBoston, Disney and the Federal Government.Praise and thank-you's are some of the rewards discussed. These come from findings of surveys where many employees say they would really just like recognition and gratitude for special efforts.There is a useful section giving sources for specialty rewards, firms that can arrange reward activities, travel, and companies and associations that specialize in rewards and incentives.All in all, a useful book and one that could help any manager get more productivity and boost morale while holding down costs."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"Heard the taped version of 1001 WAYS TO REWARD EMPLOYEES,written and read by Bob Nelson . . . the author says that what mostmotivates people who work is recognition--and not just money! . . . hethen presents a most useful guide to rewards of every conceivable typefor virtually any situation . . . the ideas include the spontaneous gestureof praise to formal company-wide programs and just about everythingin-between.These ideas, in particular, made a great deal of sense to me:Works who must stay late at TIME INC. get cab fare home.Marion Laboratories annually takes all employees and guests to seea Kansas City Royals game.Chevron keeps a Treasure Chest brimming with gifts so supervisorscan reward employees on the spot.Every Christmas, the Walt Disney Company opens Disneyland foremployees and families only--with executives running the park.My only disappointment in the book was in the author's narration . . . helacked any real enthusiasm for the task, and this is one time that itwould have been much better had anybody else been the reader."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"Employees are the assets of a company.

This is one of those books that makes me hit myself on the head and say, \\"Darn! Why didn't I think of that?\\" The concept is simple: find out what other employers are doing and compile them into one book. With all of the ideas listed, everyone should be able to find at least one or two (or more likely, nine or ten) they can use in their workplace.I found that it was particularly useful for a mid-manager in a corporate environment that didn't encuorage the \\"Employee Recognition\\" thing, because the book had lots of no cost and low cost ideas for letting your employees know how much you appreciate them. It also continually hammers home that what employees value most is receiving praise from their boss.Some of the ideas may seem wildly impractical due to expense, but even they serve the point of emphasizing that some of the most successful companies find clever ways to recognize employees.Only the most recalcitrant boss would come away from this book without finding at least one good idea to use. The good bosses will find several great ideas."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"High achieving workers are motivated by self-actualizing stimuli such as having a chance to accomplish something worthwhile, pride of achievement, a sense of challenge. (Good salary and lucrative benefits serve primarily to obtain and retain good employees, not necessarily to motivate them.)Employees who put forth extra, unselfish effort should be recognized by their peers and rewarded. Not to be confused with company incentives like bonuses and gainsharing, non-cash rewards are employed simply for fun and as a way of saying, &quot;Thanks.&quot; Using non-cash, non-competitive rewards is a useful way to strengthen the team and help define its values.To help stimulate team spirit, team members themselves should give the rewards. Team values must remain paramount. The criteria for giving rewards should be based on actions and values, rather than solely on physical accomplishment. The team should establish clearly which values it honors highly enough to reward individuals for.Any reward should be fun and at the same time have value, whether symbolic or actual. It may be a &quot;homemade&quot; trophy or a ribbon with a catchy phrase; a gift certificate or dinner for the family. Employees are quite creative when it comes to brainstorming for ways to reward themselves. Management will usually approve reimbursement for a sensible rewards program. Don't block the door to rewarding those on other teams who have helped your team achieve its goals. When team members present a reward, they must explain exactly why the reward is being given and not just say, &quot;Here ya go!&quot;A reward should be given only when someone really merits extra recognition. If given on a regularly scheduled basis, the reward becomes the featured event instead of the behavior being honored; team members may just end up nominating their friends, resulting in rapid trivialization of the reward. To keep a reward program most beneficial, use it sparingly.This book is a virtual encyclopedia of inexpensive, practical and fun rewards. There is lots of great info and novel resources with a text that promotes rewards as a motivational way of making work more fun --- not as tools for controlling."},{"Title":"1001 Ways To Reward Employees","review":"Non-profits and government offices typically lack funds to help recognize employees who do more than is expected.

However, after 127 pages I can't stand to read more because it is repetitive. Companies reward their employees day-to-day, informally, tangibly, etc. and reading a short list of how they do that with most of the rewards being pretty much the same (except that each company might have a different name or twist on the reward) bored me. For example, Company A might give a trip or Company B might give gift certificates. Company X might post a name of a top employee on the bulletin board or Company Y might write a paper note to that employee instead yet Company Z might write an email instead and send it off to the employee (you get the idea).However, there were three quotes I loved in this book (the first one I consider the best quote) which are:\\"You get the best effort from others not by lighting a fire beneath them, but by building a fire within them.\\" (page 48)\\"Compensation is what you give people for doing the job they were hired to do. Recognition, on the other hand, celebrates an effort beyond the call of duty.\\" (page 104)\\"Compensation is a right; recognition is a gift.\\" (page 116)If a person wants ideas on a different twist to each reward, then this book has met its objective.

Then I recently saw a C-Span program in which bell hooks led a discussion with a college audience. Reminded of the intriguing excerpts I had read, I chose Black Looks as my first full encounter with this intriguing woman's thoughts.I did not examine the readers' comments on Black Looks until completing the book, but I too would like to take the opportunity to give the book my whole-hearted endorsement for everyone's perusal.Unlike the reader who began a review highlighting his leftist political affiliation and interracial marriage/family, I DO believe that this book was intended for that individual reader, as it was intended for me, a white female -- and for all men and women of all colors, backgrounds, and sexual orientations. One's skin color, (marriage) partner, children, class status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and gender, among many other characteristics, do not determine one's dedication to overcoming the racist, heterosexist, capitalist patriarchy. Indeed, I think that this idea is a theme running throughout Black Looks, as evidenced in bell hooks' essays on Clarence Thomas and Madonna.I do not find incivility in bell hooks' thoughtful expressions and critiques. Rather, I find a much-needed naming of the incivilities that happen to people in this world, due to various \\"-ism\\"s and those who espouse them.Complaints of \\"bias\\" or \\"slant\\" in bell hooks' essays and other works seem nonsensical to me, when I recall that no human being's thoughts, feelings, and perspective are \\"objective.\\" Moreover, \\"objectivity\\" is not a quality that one desires in cultural criticism, which functions to set forth an alternative point of view that is so often silenced. An individual who feels the need for \\"objectivity\\" in Black Looks might seriously question whether any book, television program, song, or other form of media is \\"objective,\\" including those forms of communication that comprise mass media.I think that an individual who can accept that this book is for him/her can also begin to look at mass media with a more critical gaze, an activity that is sorely needed after the hours of unquestioning consumption of TV/movies that fills the evenings and weekends of many Americans."},{"Title":"Black Looks: Race and Representation","review":"I'm biracial . . . my father is white and my mother is black, Latina, and Asian. hooks makes us look deeply and critically at the linkages of race, class, gender, and sexuality in ways that are painfully honest and moving. Oppression is never an easy topic. As she has stated, reading hooks' work should make us feel angry, sad, &amp; uncomfortable. Finally, an intellectual who goes beyond the &quot;taken-for-granted&quot; simplistic non-analysis and makes us THINK DEEPLY! This book is a classic!"},{"Title":"Black Looks: Race and Representation","review":"The cover of this book caught my attention at the library, so I just had to check it out. I must say, Bell Hooks's ideas and opinions are right on the money. She mentions issues such as black male masculinity, feminism, and racism and breaks them down very well. She's not the average traditional black feminist. She's not afraid to talk bad about white folks (like Madonna) and she's brave enough to use the word &quot;white supremacy&quot;; not in a militant way, but more reserved. It's easy to tell she's a liberal, but she's not restricted to traditional left-wing philosophy because of her strong Afro-centric view-points. This is a must read for all Black people, especially Black women who hardly have any intellectual role-model to look up to."},{"Title":"Black Looks: Race and Representation","review":"THIS BOOK IS ANOTHER MANDATORY READING FOR ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE EXCHANGE OF CULTURES OF THE INDIGENOUS OF TURTLE ISLAND AND THE AFRICAN, WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON BEFORE THAT THUG COLUMBUS CAME OVER HERE."},{"Title":"Black Looks: Race and Representation","review":"The book speaks for itself.

Only Goethe, Schiller, H&ouml;lderlin, and Novalis had died before Nietzsche was born in 1844. There are eleven poems by Nietzsche, more by Rilke, Goethe, and Schiller, but it was good for me to find two of Nietzsche's poems in this book before I would have noticed them elsewhere. These are short poems, but each has a point.STAR MORALSCalled a star's orbit to pursue,what is the darkness, star, to you?Roll on in bliss, traverse this age--its misery far from you and strange.Let farthest world your light secure.Pity is sin you must abjure.But one command is yours: be pure!VENICEAt the bridge of lateI stood in the brown night.From afar came a song:as a golden drop it welledover the quivering surface.Gondolas, lights, and music--drunken it swam out into the twilight.My soul, a stringed instrument,sang to itself, invisibly touched,a secret gondola song,quivering with iridescent happiness.--Did anyone listen to it?"},{"Title":"Come and See: A Photojournalist's Journey into the World of Mother Teresa","review":"This book is an absolute wonderful collection of photos and textthat truly shows the life and works of the Blessed Mother Teresa.A book that should be on every bookshelf of those who appreciate the work of this most-giving individual."},{"Title":"Come and See: A Photojournalist's Journey into the World of Mother Teresa","review":"Come And See: A Photojournalist's Journey Into The World Of Mother Teresa by Linda Schaefer (the last professional photographer granted personal written permission by Mother Teresa to photograph that sainted lady's work) is a warm and heart-touching visual showcase, lavishly illustrated with full color photographs of that hallowed Roman Catholic nun and the destitute and desperate people she spent her life striving to help.

She was quoted twice as saying that she ...\\"doesn't make her religion exclusive\\"...That's a problem, because Jesus did. When Jesus said in John 14:6 \\"...I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\\" it doesn't GET more exclusive than that.Then there's the quote \\"I do convert. I convert you to be a better Muslim, Buddhist, Catholic, Jain or Hundu. I want to help you find God. What you do with Him after you find Him is up to you.\\" So, let me understand this. She helps them to be a better non-Christ follower, on their death beds, right before they go to Hell? Instead of speaking the words of eternal life to them and perhaps helping some to a saving knowledge of Christ? How compassionate is THAT? She was possibly the most compassionate person this last century, yet didn't share Christ the SAVIOR with anyone? Even the writer is quoted \\"I have come to terms that there are many paths to god, and there is no one right way.\\" REALLY? Again, read John 14:6 and the whole new Testament. She goes on to say \\"Mother Theresa never asked me to convert. If she had, I might have seriously considered it\\". She didn't even reach out to the person doing her autopictography.Consider this parable: People are on the Titanic, and it is sinking. Mother Theresa could be loading those who are willing into lifeboats, and save them. But instead, she is giving them pillows on the deck chairs, just minutes before they die a horrible death.Or another parable: A DR. has a cure for AIDS in his pocket, and he is in a room full of AIDS patients who are dying. Instead of sharing the cure with them, she makes them comfortable during an agonizing death. IS THAT compassionate? Would someone as compassionate as Mother Theresa withhold the cure for sin? Why would she not give them the words of eternal life in Christ? The only answer is because she never possessed them herself.I just returned from ministering in India myself, and the need there is great. To just go there and rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic while leaving them all as unsaved as when she found them is not compassionate at all. To withhold Christ from people is evil. This book and her life, while full of good works, is a perfect example of works with no salvation. There is no difference between her good works and the good works of unsaved Muslims, Jains, Buddhists,.... because they are all good works without Christ. How sad.p.s. We are not saved by good works. We are saved by repentance and faith.

The book is thorough, vividly written and steady and has, obviously, already been assailed by the right wing punditocracy largely because Blumenthal actually admires Clinton and measures the man's very real achievements (while also being quite forthright about Clinton's missteps, particularly his incoherent first two years in office.) But Blumenthal has also ticked off another power nexus -- that of the mainstream media. Why? Because Blumenthal, a former reporter for The Washington Post and The New Yorker knows how the game was played, and he names names, providing an absolutley devastating analysis of how big media companies like The New York Times, The Post, Time, Newsweek, et al, were duped by dirty tricksters on the radical right; how the Whitewater story was concocted by Republican gamesters during the '92 election and how, after Clinton's election, those gamesters used Jeff Gerth at the supposedly 'liberal' NY Times to do their dirty work by foisting the story into the national mainstream. With results we know now.Attacks on Blumenthal, from Times' editors, Newsweek's Isikoff strike a false and shrill (and hugely defensive) note. Blumenthal has the goods on these characters. The smoke has cleared, and as they say \\"history will judge.\\" Those media bigfeet who became so usefully available to the Republican propaganda machine do not like now to have their bad behavior brought back up. Thus, the tenor of reviews claiming the Clinton era is all 'ancient history' and we should let the past be past...."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"What can I say? What an excellent book on the 8 tumultuous years of the Clinton White House. Stretching across the history of the United States Clinton was part of a long time of active progressive presidents attacked from the conservative establishment and entrenched conventional wisdom. Clinton - Johnson - Kennedy - FDR - Wilson -TR - & Lincoln. It's a long but extremely engaging book backed up with many footnotes and facts.I was skeptical of Hillary's \`vast right wing conspiracy' charge on the Today Show - however after reading this book and learning about the Arkansas Project, William Mellon Scaife, David Brock, the elves & Ken Starr - it's hard not to believe in the veracity of his claims. Clinton was attacked relentlessly and impeached on the most bogus reasoning in order to derail the progressive movement.I think you'll find as the reader an incredible education on the machinations of the establishment and the danger that the right wingnuts are to the Constitution. After reading the Clinton Wars I must get involved in local politics and make a difference - we all have to make a difference."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"This work is enclopedic. It presents the Clinton era in one volume from the perspective of one who was there and whose head was in the cross hairs. It gets a bit tedious in spots but it is fairly easy to wade through those spots and get on with the gripping story. I am glad that I paid little attention to what was going on at the time it was going on. This work gives me a sufficient review of the whole story. I am glad I read it and I recommend it without reservation. Subsequent books will go on to vindicate President Clinton even more. I liked the man and would have voted for him for a third or fourth term if that could have been done. As to my feelings about the villians of the piece, I draw a veil or a pall over them and their kind."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"pretty much breaks down why and how President Clinton was a great president.

I started reading it because it was there and to my surprise I became totally engrossed. A lot of unanswered questions and half truths were confronted and answered. When I checked out the information from this book I was skeptical; then I was shocked-it was as accurate as it was disturbing. I would encourage anyone really interested in the facts to read this book and take the time to check out the facts and references-it's time consuming but very sobering."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"The American press corps has a lot to answer for, after being led around by the nose for several years by Ken Starr, much to the detriment of a fine presidency and of one of the most capable national leaders ever to occupy the White House. Some journalists were being more than led, of course: they were in active collaboration with Starr in an intense campaign to use sexual activity -- which never should have been anyone's business -- to unseat a strong Democratic president. Only a few journalists saw and wrote the truth about these sham scandals. Sidney Blumenthal's book details the sordid saga in calm and eloquent prose -- weaving a fascintating tale in which important national policies and policy issues were obscured by a torrent of mud. Those who can't stand the truth will accuse Blumenthal of simply trying to settle scores. He's doing much more -- telling us what actually happened, and warning us of the degradation that has occurred in our national political process and in the 4th Estate that is supposed to be a critical part of our constitutional system. For his accuracy and steadfast courage, Blumenthal deserves to be seen as quiet hero -- in the best of American traditions."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Finally, an eloquently written, and highly detailed, book to combat the history of the Clinton Administration being written by the right wing media machine: Fox News, radio talk shows, conservative \\"think\\" tanks, columnists, Washington Times, Regnery Publishing, etc.Blumenthal examines the forces out to destroy President Clinton...even by violating the Constitution to do it.His book is a warning about the ugly underbelly of American conservatism at work today.This book is a must read for anyone-conservative, liberal or moderate--who wishes to understand the United States in the 1990's and today."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"A great read. Blumenthal's insider view puts the reader as a fly on the wall. Worth all 5 Stars."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"This book changed the way I looked at all of the distractions raised during Bill's presidency. Of course, now that we have hindsight it is easy to see how frothed and crazed the Clinton attackers were, and how all of the politics were just overblown exploitations in the name of pride. This book gives great details and meat into the situation and keeps one entertained untill the end."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"There's a reason why, as Sean Wilentz notes, the professional historians praise this book while the journalists trash it: Because it (like the fine Conason-Lyons book The Hunting of the President) shows how the US corporate media, both knowingly and unknowingly, was made to do the bidding of Bill Clinton's political enemies.Information that favored the Clintons was buried; spurious tales that damaged them were given uncritical 24/7 coverage. Blumenthal explains, again and again, in irrefutable detail, how this happened. Yet he does so calmly, politely, like the fine attorney he is.This book is essential, both to understand what happened to the Clintons and how the Republican National Committee took over the American corporate media to use it for their own gain and the nation's loss."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"The greatest strength of Blumenthal's book (among its many assets) is its ability to transcend the who, what and why of his engrossing narrative to reveal in the fullest dimension yet the cultural war in America which fueled the relentless attack against our last elected President. In fact, the dimension and endurance of that war are fully apparent in the diverse reviews written here about this book.To echo other reviewers, Blumenthal deserves thanks for writing the first draft of history...and exposing the prosecutors, pundits and reporters who sullied themselves in their attempted overthrow of American government. Blumenthal trades in what these critics do not--the facts. And thus, for them, the truth certainly hurts."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Sidney Blumenthal explores his Clinton years in a profoundly well written book that resolves many questions a caring reader has about that time.I chuckle when I read how a reviewer was &quot;a Clinton voter&quot; and then proceeds to take both Sidney and President Clinton apart. Only a school boy couldn't see through this childish ploy which is to justify the ill founded opinions of those writing the review.Take it from a life long Republican who was forced to leave his party due to the low lifes that now occupy it. This is a great book and the beginning of the more accurate look at just what the Clinton years were all about."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I am biased in that I believe Bill Clinton was a superior president. But I am also angry at him for his reckless disregard of his personal obligations and responsibilities which resulted not only in giving his enemies the sword to slay him, but also to undercut his policy, program and visions, which ultimately led to the restoration of a right wing agenda and administration. Sidney Blumenthal's book has reenforced both conclusions, and in doing so has made a convincing argument that the sins of Clinton's enemies (including Ken Starr and his staff) were far greater that Clinton's own sins. Blumenthal does not purport to be an objective historian or observer, but has marshaled together, in a long but very readable book, a advocate's brief on behalf of the Clinton Administration and Bill Clinton's leadership.Blumenthal has actually woven two books into one. The first is an insider's view of the second term. The second is essentially a legal brief on behalf of the Clintons and a defense of the allegations leveled against Blumenthal himself. Although Blumenthal is a journalist not a lawyer, the legal brief is far more powerful and interesting than the journalist account.I would have preferred that Blumenthal had documented every source in his footnotes, but he is after all a journalist not an historian. Still he gives enough sources, including an on the record interview with Sam Dash, to support his argument that the concerted effort to undermine Clinton by whatever means available was done to justify the hypothesis that Clinton was an illegitimate president. The irony is that those who question the legitimacy of President Bush's selection, do not question the legitimacy of his administration, while those who attacked (and still attack) the legitimacy of the Clinton Administration never questioned the legitimacy of Clinton's election.Blumenthal's book can - and has been - easily dismissed by Clinton opponents as being the ranting of a member of the \\"not so vast left wing conspiracy.\\" I would like to read the retort of a critic who credits Blumenthal with a serious defense of the Clinton Administration and the shallowness of the scandals which consumed it and than contradicts Blumenthal's thesis with references to his chronology and arguments rather harangues about the messenger."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"When checking out the many reviews posted here, I noticed a sharp difference between the \\"pros\\" and \\"cons.\\" Those who liked \\"The Clinton Wars\\" wrote literate reviews that discussed topics covered by the book. Those who deplored it appeared not to have read the book at all, and wrote on something like a 5th grade level, with misspellings and poor grammar, and tended to make personal attacks on President Clinton, the First Lady, Vice President Gore, or (occasionally) even the author, Mr. Blumenthal.It gave me a pretty good idea of who to trust, and my reading of the book confirmed what the \\"pros\\" have been writing. \\"The Clinton Wars\\" is an excellent history, and an informative guide to how the ultra-right (now synonymous with the Republican Party) operates. If you want to understand the 2004 Presidential (and other) races, you must read this book. The RNC is still using these vicious, mendacious tactics, and with the fundraising prowess of Mr. Bush Jr., will be a major force to reckon with.If you plan to vote (and you really have to), read this book to get perspective on what the \\"so-called liberal media\\" is \\"reporting.\\" Then apply the necessary corrections."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"As I read this work, pausing frequently to ponder and reflect on the text and its implications, I was repeatedly swept back to the vivid emotions and intensely mixed feelings I had about Clinton, his presidency, and his administration.Originally I was going to assign five stars in rating this book, but the more I thought about it the more I realized this would not be justified. The book has many excellent qualities: 1) it's extremely well written, 2) very thorough, 3) well researched and documented, 4) very insightful and wise, and 5) generally fair.I think its greatest strengths revolve around the exposure and the thorough scrutiny and analysis of the very powerful and active right wing groups in this country - - and how they've managed (with plenty of help from the left, as well!) to poison, distort, corrupt, and pollute politics in the United States over the past several decades. Their amazing successes cannot be denied or gainsaid, and one reason they've been so successful and effective is their having operated largely &quot;under the radar screen&quot; from both the media and the public at large.Sidney (and his wife Jackie's) Blumenthal's story is vividly portayed here - and it's a sickening, vicious, sordid, and ugly tale indeed. Although I follow politics pretty closely, I was largely unaware at the time of what was happening to him. What a sad and repulsive commentary on how politics - and personal smear and vendetta - has degenerated in this country.Yet despite all its wonderful attributes, this book has some serious shortcomings. In particular, Blumenthal overlooks a number of important truths. I was especially disappointed in his omissions or grossly incomplete coverage of the following topics: how the Clintons frequently lied (or seriously shaded the truth), how they used and discarded friends and former loyalists, how they ostracized those who turned against them, and how the Clinton administration had many failures, faults, and losses - even without the right wing's active opposition.Furthermore I found the coverage of the 2000 presidential campaign to be woefully inadequate and misleading. Gore's many weaknesses and flaws were largely overlooked; Gore is not quite the wonderful man Blumenthal makes him out to be. Furthermore, by almost any measure, Gore blew a campaign he should easily have won: to be beaten by Bush in 2000 is a serious indictment of how miserable, pitiful, and pathetic a campaign Gore ran. Don't blame Ralph Nader. Blumenthal also overlooks the rather intense disaffection and emotional separation that took place between Clinton and Gore in the final couple of years of Clinton's presidency.Likewise the very ugly, hostile, and vicious campaign Gore mounted against Bill Bradley in the primaries is entirely ignored by Blumenthal. I thought Gore's savaging of Bradley was despicable and sickening.Finally, although Hillary Clinton is an extraordinary and remarkable woman, she is not quite the unblemished saint Blumenthal makes her out to be. Many of the problems and nightmares of Bill Clinton's presidency must be attributed - at least in part - to Hillary's attitudes and actions. The blame must be laid at her feet for causing the administration to make serious errors, both strategically and tactically, over eight years. Whatever personal wrongs Bill has done to her, she has contributed in a profound way to many of his political errors and defeats (as well as to his triumphs).I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the inner workings of contemporary American politics. Another strength of this book is its major focus on how Clinton's presidency tied in with center-left governments in Europe and South America (related to the so-called &quot;Third Way&quot;). If you read this book, you won't be bored and you will be guaranteed to have your emotions stirred!"},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"What happened to America in the 1990's is that a small band of people composed of: 1 die-hard segregationist, some zealous Christian vote organizers, 1 wealthy conspirator, and a number of unscrupulous operators of all kinds attempted to blacken the reputations of Bill and Hillary Clinton. With the help of an out-of-control and inept Special Prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, they were able to bring a set of charges into Congress that they called an impeachment case. But the \\"case\\" was a worse embarrassment to the lawyers who concocted it than to the Clintons. So flimsy was this set of charges that it took the President's lawyers less than 24 hours to destroy the \\"case\\" it took 5 years and $70M to build. The impeachment could never have been brought if the country's \\"mainstream\\" press had not faithfully printed everything the conspiracy wanted them to print for all six years after the Times broke the Whitewater \\"story.\\" The complicity of the press in spreading the endless lies of the conspirators was much more dangerous than the conspiracy itself, because it means that for the moment, America has no national news purveyor it can trust to be more interested in the truth than its own convenience and parochial prejudices.It was a conspiracy, and it was one the American media have not discovered to this day. But Mr. Blumenthal is not half as interested in skewering the conspirators as he is in reporting a real live presidency in all its hard work, focus, intelligence, ingenuity, and barely controlled chaos.It is a pleasure to be able to recommend Mr. Blumenthal's book highly on several grounds: first, it's a first draft of the history of the era, and a damned good one; second, Mr. Blumenthal writes clear and sometimes eloquent prose; and third, the book gives an irreplaceable account of what it was like to be working at the White House, assisting President Clinton effectively, and to be rewarded by having your public reputation blackened by the same kind of malodorous lies that Bill and Hillary Clinton were suffering. Among other virtues, the author's wry and gentle humor demonstrates one of the qualities it took to survive the ordeal the author's public service turned into. You meet a human being in this book, a smart, hard working, ethical one, who understood going into his White House job what was in store for him. The first lie about him arrived in the Drudge report the night before he reported to work. Welcome to the Clinton White House, Sid Blumenthal.The book is a model of concise reporting on events the author was part of. Everything is footnoted, and the personalities of people Blumenthal knew are sketched insightfully and even-handedly. Blumenthal's politics are progressive, and he, like Bill Clinton, has a vision of what political power exercised on behalf of all the people of this country and all the people in the rest of the world, can accomplish. He reports on what was accomplished in the midst of the hideous static of unending journalistic attacks. Among many other matters, he reports on how seriously President Clinton took terrorism in general and Osama bin Laden in particular, and he reports on the amount of anti-terrorism legislation Clinton sent to a Republican congress (where much of it died) and on the successes the administration enjoyed in preventing bin Laden's army from blowing up more things than they did. He clearly respects and admires both Bill and Hillary Clinton, and he says why. After overexposure to the endless psychobabble and rumor mongering that press coverage of the Clinton presidency became, Blumenthal's account of what the President wanted to do and how much of it he accomplished is wonderfully refreshing. He reports both the successes and the failures with political acuity.I paid this book the supreme compliment of carrying all 2+ pounds of it back and forth to work so that I could read it on the bus. (Normally I don't carry books over 7 ounces for commuter reading.) I found it as gripping as a novel, despite the fact that it tells a story whose basic plot I already knew. It is a much better story he has to tell than the cartoon drawn for us by the mainstream media. For those whose minds are not already made up, it is an indispensable book."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Blumenthal packs a lot of punch in this summary of American national politics at the end of the century. For years the right-wing has had its own way in the national media, all the while claiming \\"liberal media\\" over and over again so many times from so many sources that most people believe it.This book doesn't waste much time on that (for the Liberal Media canard, see Eric Alterman's masterpiece). \\"The Clinton Wars\\" does have to visit the media frequently, because that is where the offensive part of the war took place. In many cases, as Blumenthal points out, the Clintons were permitted no defense whatsoever. Reading this story makes you wonder how they survived, even though you know by now how it turned out!If you are turned off by political hate-books (like Coulter, Noonan, Hannity and others) you won't be disappointed by Blumenthal. If his narrative seems a bit sharp at times, it is only because Clinton's enemies were so hate filled that it seems that even to fully describe them there is no way to not appear partisan. Blumenthal is always careful to back up his assertions with footnoted facts and direct quotes, and so far I have not found any faking of footnotes of the type that were discovered in Ann Coulter's book.This will all be very unhappy reading for the demographic for whom it is an article of faith that the Clintons are vile, corrupt power-mongers who only \\"got away with it\\" and were never innocent of anything in their lives. \\"The Clinton Wars\\" takes the trouble to go back in history to explain how this mind-set developed as well, back to FDR's time and before. History was my least favorite subject in high school, but it wouldn't have been had this book been around.As it is, I'm glad that Blumenthal got this on the record."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Dismissed as a partisan puff piece by the right wing, THE CLINTON WARS is a serious work of history covering--but not limited to--the period of Bill Clinton's impeachment &quot;trial&quot; and its aftermath.That history will heap scorn on the right wing for their pathetic attempt at a coup d'etat is a given--Bill Clinton served this country and the world with unsurpassed skill. After $70 million of taxpayer money was wasted investigating him by the Office of the Independent Counsel, the subsequent impeachment was a vile abuse of our country's patience with the extreme and possibly syphilitic right wing leadership.Blumenthal can really WRITE. A great book. Lots of policy wonkishness too, but that's fine with me."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"With increasingly concentrated media ownership, the right wing now controls the megaphone. Hate radio and cable news have effectively manipulated public opinion over the past 15 years. The good news is that it seems that people are now finding their voices and with the writing of some brave authors armed with the truth, public opinion is beginning to shift.Sidney Blumenthal's beautifully written account of his experiences dealing with the deep pocketed attempts of the right to bring down our last legally elected president is both chilling and enlighting.With the publishing of David Brock's Blinded By The Right, and others like Michael Moore, Joe Conason, Eric Alterman, Hillary Clinton and Al Franken's soon to be released book, a much clear picture is beginning to emerge of the nefarious plans of the power elite and the lies they tell to fool those not paying attention.Well done Sidney!"},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Politic's does indeed make for strange bedfellows. With the recent onslaught of books coming from the not-so radical Right ( where they never met a Liberal they didn't abhor! ) it is truly a pleasure to walk into my local bookseller and see Sidney Blumenthal's book \\" The Clinton Wars. \\" At last a work of non-fiction that didn't require that I take a long, hot shower after perusing it's pages and one where I gratefully was not subjected to some more of the typical Clinton bashing and finger-waging of our favorite seething Conservatives who apparently continue to work out some very serious issues regarding our former ( and still extremely popular! ) President.Mr. Blumenthal enjoyed unlimited access to President Clinton during his second tenure and much of what happened during that, at times, scandalous and hectic period of our country's history. Blumenthal does touch upon the Lewinsky scandal, Whitewater, Kenneth Starr and the failed Republican led impeachment process. At times though there truly is simply far too much tedious information to be found within but that is a small gripe overall. Coming in at 800 pages the reader is diluged with a wealth of info that probably isn't necessary but I suspect anything less and the Clinton naysayers would be accusing Blumenthal of not being completely upfront regarding these turbulent years. It is apparent that Mr. Blumenthal does have an axe to grind with sleazy, journalistic bottom-feeder Matt Drudge, who falsely accused him of wife-beating, but I can hardly fault Sidney for wishing to set the story straight on that not-so-small issue and clear his good name. Make no mistake, Mr. Blumenthal was by all accounts an extremely difficult man to work with and obviously he wielded a powerful stick while attending to his duties for President and Mrs. Clinton but, I greatly suspect, being constantly barraged with duties that most of us would find far too over-whelming it is no small wonder as to why he, at times, comes across as slightly contemptible to many of those who he feels would do harm to the man who occupied the Oval Office. Friends and enemies alike ( and there are many on both sides! ) freely admit as to Sydney Blumenthal being more then capable regarding his duites in the White House. Quite a complement seeing how divisive are the occupants who run the White House as of this critique. Overall, the \\" Clinton Wars \\" reads like the excellent account of the Washington insider that it promises to be. Whether you're a fan of President Clinton or not ( and if not then you probably haven't read this far anyway! ) this is most definitley worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Pathtic how the right had it out for clinton when he was a big time centrist to begin with.

From the media assault on his family on his first day at the White House, to the unjustified interrogations, Blumenthal somehow survived a prolonged attack from all sides. The book is interesting because Blumenthal is able to view it broadly--as a political war--and not simply as the personal ordeal that it must have been. It appeals as a classic survival story where Blumenthal, as the smart kid with the glasses, beats the bullies who gang up on him. Of course, the scary part is that if the American people hadn't figured it out, the bullies might have won."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Great, thoughtful book - which guarantees it will get no reviews in the right wing media.Right wingers read junk like Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity.

It is all fact,as borne by the lack of any real culpability in Whitewater,FBI scandal, Paula Jones etc. Most impressive is of course,the fact that Clinton got so much DONE despite all of thisinquisition.I was most fascinated by the connection between Naderand the right-wing."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Hillary has an easy, inviting writing style that is a pleasure to read. It is rewarding to have this inside view of events that were part of our lives, too. She truly was Living History, and I thank her for sharing her experiences with us. I came away from this book with more positive feelings toward Hillary, and a more negative view of those who put our country through the trauma of an impeachment. It wasted the time and energies of the many people who were supposed to be attending to the business of running the country and creating legislation."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I enjoyed this read of an insiders defence and exculpation of the Clinton presidential years because its so well written and sounds so plausible. Did it need to be written, I don't think anyone got taken in by the so called right wing conspiracy. I don't think anyone got taken in by Clinton or Bush for that matter. 'Grassy Knoll' is a good nick name for Blumenthal and he is fairly open about his relationships with the Clintons, saying he is Hilary's friend and thereby knows Bill but the fact is Bill's the one who confides in Blumenthal at the height of the Lewinsky-Starr matter and there are two or three key personal moments like this in the book which I felt made it worth the read. The context of the circus of politics shouldn't be a surprise and for Blumenthal to carry on as if there is some virtuous land somewhere on the planet that can hold forth with political discourse and there not to be confusion, dissembling, disinformation, mistakes, etc etc is a false impression but I suppose it can be said in his defence he sets the scene very well and contextualizes his own experiences and opinions in that regard. A good book for the historians to mull over on its finer points but its a long haul book just to find the worthy tidbits. Oh and by the way why is an Irish guy writing a review of a book on US politics, well unlike most Americans I saw President Clinton on his visits to Ireland, giving a speech and doing some shopping, the first time I went on purpose as he had a big impact here for the good and the second was an accident so I kind of read this book to understand all the fuss a bit better. I am little more entertained, slightly more aware of what the fuss was and find myself thinking whats the current fuss really about as in how did it all go so wrong in Iraq but I guess we'll have to wait for Condolezza Rice or Colin Powell or Donald Rumsfeld to shed some light there."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"The first insider's book on how the Clinton administration dealt with the first Republican coup attempt on a Democratic White House. I have nothing but praise for Mr. Blumenthal for telling this story. I hope many more books on these events are to come."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Still early to fully comprehend the dilemmas Clinton faced in the oval office as a result of partisan anxiety that erupted in the witch hunt that produced the impeachment side trip through which the media had a field day, and from which they've yet to recover, there is little doubt that sooner or later, it will become evident that despite those &quot;complications,&quot; Clinton followed Kennedy's style and perhaps his agenda from the outset. The dichotomy and enigma that continues to frustrate authors, however, is the failure to identify the different perspectives the two had in terms of support, and in personality when attacked. Where Kennedy may have been strong enough to dismiss attempts to discredit him, Clinton was hard pressed to contain his resentment, so prominent beneath his reserved exterior. These reactions are typical of perfectionists with high hopes who appear to be arbitrarily submarined as he was in many cases, owing to his agenda of doubling his efforts to control the outcome, and emerge a winner. That should have been evident during his administration, especially from his demeanor at the one and only aggressive attack made public. Though many behind the scenes have reported upon these unsettling facets of his personality, people forget that the gander is never far from the goose. And the goose always lays golden eggs, if any. Clinton may turn out to be the most distinctive and unusual President the country has ever seen when all is said and done, in hindsight."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Sidney Blumenthal's book plainly details the Neocon agenda to discredit Bill Clinton. I was a casual follower of politics during most of the Clinton administration, and though I generally supported Clinton, I was exasperated at his seeming &quot;nose for scandal&quot;. My eyes have been opened since then, and The Clinton Wars impressed me with its encyclopaedic recitation of the smears of that era.His story of his depositions before the independent counsel in the &quot;Whitewater&quot; affair is especially illustrative of the pathological hate that the right has for Clinton.Do you believe the world is better now than it was in November 2000 when democracy was stolen? If you do, then you're really too ignorant to understand this book. If you have a brain, and wish to give President Clinton a fair shake, warts and all, read this book to gain insight."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Thank you Mr. Blumental! The Clinton Wars is full of facts, quotations and the intricate history of how Bill Clinton came to be so hated and vilified by the right. The story is eloquently written and laid out chronologically so that the reader comes to understand the scalawags that make up a large portion of the republican party, their shameless and relentless attacks on The First Family, as well as, the complicity of the media. The writer also points out the public silence from Washington insiders who refused to defend the President or show respect for the office and how this enabled the publicly funded witch hunt to run on and on. If you started out liking Bill Clinton then became disheartened by the end of the second term, you should read this book. The book does more than explain the etiology of a political disease and begin to heal wounds, it sets the record straight and gives insight into the mentality of the republican party. This book should be required reading for any political science course."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Prepare for a riveting read. I followed the Clinton wars while they were happening and was incensed the entire time. The impeachment was infuriating and an abomination on this country's history. Sidney Blumenthal's first-hand inside view of what was happening day by day and the complicity of the news media (example: ABC's rightwing producer Chris Vlasto and his mouthpiece Susan Schmidt) will make every reader very frightened for this country. A Cataline conspiracy indeed!Ken Starr and his fanatical minions at the OIC, Linda Tripp, Lucinanne Goldberg, Richard Mellon Scaife, Ted Olsen, Judges Sentelle and Silberman, Tom Delay, the despicable members of the House Judiciary Committee on Impeachment, the compliant media members and all those too numerous to name here will go down in history as evil schemers.Anyone critical of President Bush is labeled unpatriotic. The conservatives players who tried to remove President Clinton should have been held in well deserved scorn and put on trial for treason. Sidney Blumenthal has written an excellent historical account of the treachery of the conservatives and their demonic plot to subvert the constitution.It is time for liberals to fight the right wingers with as much venom as they dish out. It's never too late."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"The Clinton Wars is a fantastic narrative of the political warfare which dominated much of the 90s. Blumenthal gives us an insider's view of the Clinton White House.He carefully breaks down each issue associated with the Republican vendetta against the Clinton administration. He carefully delves into the arguments, issues, and facts and provides insight into this difficult period of American political history. If you are seeking a complete and thorough response to the charges of the Rush Limbaugh's and Ken Starr's of the world this is it.The downside of this book is that Blumenthal is unnecessarily long-winded at points. At times it takes him 3 pages to say what could have been said in 3 paragraphs. He overemphasizes his importance and dwells on boring topics for too long (the 50 pages on his personal history could have been cut).If you have the endurance to make it through the 800 pages this book is fantastic."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Take Washington Republicans seeking payback for Nixon's resignation, add southern Republicans still seething over the successes of the civil rights movement, toss in a reclusive billionaire willing to spend any amount of money in support of the conservative agenda and a press corps desperate to relive the glory days of Watergate, and you have the makings of the Perfect Storm of American politics.This book starts out slowly, but hang in there. Think of the first 200 pages as the long slow climb of a roller-coaster car to the top of the first big hill. Don't be put off by the history lesson of the first few chapters; the style of this book is intelligent but unpretentious, and it's an easy read.This should be required reading for anyone who votes."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"A very large tome on the Clinton Wars otherwise known as the Lewinsky affair. Sydney Blumenthal's account of the Clinton Wars devotes extensive ink to the issue of impeachment and the real issues behind what can aptly be described as a witch hunt.Blumenthal, a former journalist, recounts how the reclusive, perhaps insance, Richard Mellon Scaife funded various conservative causes, including the infamous Arkansas Project. All the major players are recounted in this work, including ex-Conservative David Brock, Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter, David Hale and of course Ken Starr. These are the big boys and girls, the ALL-STARS but there are plenty of role players.Blumenthal aptly describes how the conservative, right wing moralists embarked on an amoral, unconstitutional campaign to bring down a president. What was really going on behind the scenes was an epic political and social battle over abortion, women's rights, civil rights, the environment, corporate responsibility and foreign policy. The rabid right wing, helped by the backwards forces of the old South in Arkansas are exposed for the bigots they are. Ken Starr and his \\"moral\\" crusade were nothing more than an undeclared Culture War.There are not enough words to describe this book and to outline all the great details. While Clinton was not perfect, he was attempting to build a better country, to move the nation forward and to bring everyone along for the ride. The bigots and government haters of the right were merely attempting to roll-back years of progress and prevent any movement forward.Read the Clinton Wars and even as a conservative you may be repulsed at the actions of the militant right."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Just the fact that the right wing neoconservatives are attacking this book should encourage every &quot;independent thinking&quot; American to purchase and read The Clinton Wars. As a progressive liberal I am a thinker, learner, reader, and not a &quot;ideology follower&quot; like most right wing neocons. I don't agree with everything Mr. Blumenthal said in this book but it was a good read and will provide great entertainment in debates and discussions. President Clinton is such an intelligent and powerful leader, His charm and charisma is overwhelming. He is still the most important stateman representing the United States around the world and this is unchallenged. This book reinforces President Clintons ability to manage the most powerful country on earth for eight years, win the hearts, minds of people everywhere and reelection in a landside. With jealous conservatives trying to bring down our democracy and prosperity for the Presidents entire eight years, he withstood the attacks. Mr. Blumenthal's writtings take the media to task and exposes the conservative witch hunt as Starr wasted about 20 million tax dollars and found nothing worth the paper he used. What a sad and embarressing situation this put the right wing in for the entire world to see. This book is attacked for no reason other than to scare people from reading it. Attacks will have the opposite effect. I bought the book because of the attacks as I said earlier. Information is knowledge, information is power. Those who wait for others to tell them what to do are doomed to be followers always. I highly recommend this book if you are open minded and enjoy knowlege and both sides of the issue. Looking forward to Hillery's new book as well."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Sidney Blumenthal writes a memoir about the Clinton years as the professional writer he actually is. This is a refreshing change from the trite and banal patter that usually comes from political hacks.The book is a joy to read from a literary perspective but is difficult to read if you have any desire to see right over might.This book is at it's best describing the insiders view of the insanity that was the \\"Clinton Wars\\". Yes, there was a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\". Yes, rich lunatics funded it.It is at it's most weak when it is describing foreign policy and the \\"third way\\" that Clinton so much wanted to begin with leaders around the world.Ultimately, however, it is a book that cries out for a time when politics was about ideas and ideals and not about the politics of personal destruction. The GOP is bereft of ideas and is only about hate: They hate Clinton and they hate progressive ideas. All they can rely on is personal attacks. They actually spent $70 million using Ken Star as their pit bull, to no avail.This sums it all up for me:Blumenthal talks about the last days at the White House, \\" our cheering rose in crescendos to affirm the work that we hadall contributed and that was at an end. We could only celebrate the past because the future was lost.\\""},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Seeing the previous review's of the Clinton War's, I note that the scale is for the majority either one star or five stars, with no margin either way. This surely reflects the intense polarization of our Nation. And make no mistake; this book may set your blood to boil, depending on your politics. But like it or hate it, it can not be about content and writing style, both of which are excellent.Yes it is 800 pages long. But serious scholarly works of history can not be reduced to sound bites. If you are only interested in selective areas to prove your pet theories, stick to books like \\"Stupid White Men\\" or \\"Slander: Liberal Lies about the American Right\\", very colorful, very short, and written by individuals with no credentials or degrees, only an agenda.And that is the bottom line. As a political science student and a free thinker, I may not agree with all of Mr. Blumenthal's interpretations of key events during the 1990's, but I will not dispute his overall theme, it was a war between opposing political forces, and if the author color's his history with a bias toward his friend Bill Clinton, at least he gets the facts right. This book is a detailed and at times painful reflection of politics run amuck, flagrant violations of the Grand Jury and the rules of evidence, and of a compliant press which took all the rules of journalistic integrity, verification, two source rule, the publishing of exculpatory evidence, and buried it in a hole in the ground.In all the negative reviews from the New York Times to the Washington Post, people who have trashed this book, unable to find any errors, inaccuracies or false statements, have resorted to personal attacks on the author. For those of us who still try to think for ourselves, after reading Mr. Blumenthal's book, we may finally get the answers to the question's that I have been asking for the last five years: What exactly was President Clinton guilty of? What crimes did he commit? And why did the OIC spend over 7 years and 70 million dollars of my tax money and fail to get a single major conviction?"},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Blumenthal writes passionately about the Clinton presidency as you would expect.The first 200 pages or so are comments on the first term where he did not work for Clinton, and I only skimmed through those as it was mostly references to other sources.The next 500 pages are much more personal and although nothing new and surprising comes out, Blumenthal still writes a fairly balanced account of the events and shows his brilliant polical and intellectual mind on many occassions.An important part of the history writing of the Clinton presidency."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Hitherto most of the books about the Clinton Presidency have been produced by its enemies. They have been characterized by a high degree of bigotry, hypocrisy, deceit, and in some cases raving paranoia. Now in The Clinton Wars Sidney Blumenthal has rescued the record of the Clinton Administration from the slathering jaws of the Radical Right (which has now swallowed most of the Republican Party)and given us the true story of a President and his Administration which, while far from perfect, had the strange idea that they were elected to govern the country in the interests of all of its people, not just those of a supercilious elite.Blumenthal concentrates on the second Clinton term. He does not shy away from the Lewinsky scandal, but covers it fully and in the context of the numerous other investigations with which the President's enemies sought to destroy him. Blumenthal rightly points out that the President was his own worst enemy when he lied about his affair in the first place. This deception by a President who was undoubtedly one of the most talented men to hold the office still rankles with me and with many of his other supporters, and I hope that eventually Clinton will explain his actions more fully in his own memoirs. However wrong Clinton was in seeking to conceal this affair, it does not excuse the overweening arrogance and smug hypocrisy with which Kenneth Starr and his henchmen in the Congress sought to make political hay out of a consensual affair between adults. Blumenthal sets out the full story of the shameless impeachment proceedings and reminds us of just how imperfect these self appointed guardians of the public virtue were themselves.Blumenthal ends his book with a description of what he aptly calls the last of the Clinton Wars, the oily machinations by which the Republicans seized control of the White House after the 2000 election. This, above all other reasons, is why this book is so important. It is a guide and a warning for all who oppose the extreme Radical Right agenda now being pursued by the Bush team. Even if we succeed in throwing the Bushies out of Al Gore's house on January 20, 2005 we will still be locked in battle with a well funded and amoral foe.The Clinton Wars will be a useful reference for years to come."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Hillary was right. There really was a right-wing conspiracy, and the entire country was victimized by it. This thoroughly documented account of what it was like to participate in one of the most successful administrations of the twentieth century and have the Republican opposition vilify it at every possible opportunity makes the reader wonder what the country has come to, and whether it can survive the vicious, unprincipled, unfounded attacks of the likes of Ken Starr and his character assassins. Some of the founding fathers worried about the ill effects party politics might have on the future of the country. With excellent reason."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Sydney Blumenthal has pulled the covers off the complicity of the press with Kenneth Starr. He has also brought to light the hypocisy of the Washington elite like the self righteous Sally Quinn and David Broder who felt that the Clintons were not a part of their social set because they were from Arkansas and because they did not bow down to them or kiss their rings. This was the start of the Clintons' problem. 'They were not a part of us'.The Whitewater pseudo scandal was the perfect place to begin. Half truths, innuendos and just plain bad reporting was the order of the day. It's amazing how the press swallowed the spin of Ken Starr and his goons.When I read of how Sam Dash was so disgusted with the actions of the OIC I was thrilled to see that at least there was one person who was not following 'The Pied Piper.'Blumenthal is a good writer and best of all he named names. The press has lost all credibility and right now they are running around like toothless dogs not daring to critisize this administration for fear of being black listed. What a shame."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"This book contains a lot of good information and is quite well written. It is not objective, however. The author spends most of his time complimenting Clinton and his policies/strategies. It's not quite as bad as being told Reagan's presidency was a time when \\"Character was King\\", but it does wear on you after a while."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"In an 800 page book by a policy wonk about the 8 years of Clinton's administration you would expect there to be a substantial discussion of policy. NOPE! This is 90% about the seemingly endless law suits, special investigations, and trials by rumor that went on. It is well researched and cites the substantial evidence and conclusions by Republican special prosecutors and investigative reporters.I recall at the time thinking there was too much to follow to really put it all into context and I was right. Not so much because I wasn't reading enough, but simply beause the Washington press corps wasn't doing their job. They were reporting every allegation and rumor, however unsubstantiated it might be and regardless of the obvious bias of the 'source' and simply NOT reporting the vindications by juries and special prosecutors. It wasn't that they wern't putting in on the front page, they were simply ignoring it!Blumenthal is admittedly biased towards Clinton's policies but still says that like many who supported the policies he was beyond mad wiht Clinton for the Lewinsky affair as it gave credence thto the ever mounting series of allegations. He presents compelling evidence that most of what was alleged (other than Lewinsky) never happened. It was the pure fabrication of nonentitites like Matt Drudge who became established celebrities and are now treated as respectable 'opinon makers' based on having their lies appearing in print in the NY Times and the Washington Post.If there are any 'bad guys' it is not the Matt Drudges and their ilk who, like mosquitos, will always be with us, but the massively lazy Washington reporters and editors who lead with whatever titillated regardless of whether it was credible. Just report whatever anyone with a web page or printing press alleges and don't bother researching or fact checking. Beats working for a living.Over 250 years ago, newspaper publisher Ben Franklin stated his policy was to present both sides of an issue and let the reader decide. But that was for well reasoned arguments from both sides of an issue. He would and did refuse any unsubstatantiated gossip clearly aimed at defaming innocents. The current so-called reporters and editors should read this, acknowledge their shame, and go get decent jobs like selling used cars."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I once said, the Clinton's would do more for book publishing than any before them; I have been proven right by yet another hardback.Nonetheless, a tough read in length and content but very interesting, in the end. The book provides the other side as well as the inside views of how the Kehilla around Clinton closed ranks and stood their ground against all critics, pundits and prosecutors.Sidney was one of the first Journalists to discredit Candidate Clinton's \\"Bimbo Eruptions,\\" by using the \\"Nuts & Sluts\\" defense. He started with Jennifer Flowers Press Conference, moved on to Clinton's swearing in as President and now ending in this book.The author points out why he was proud to be of help to bring into disrepute anyone harming Governor Clinton's election at all costs, even the truth sometimes, because that is how the political game is played, parried and replayed. Loyal subjects are known to defend the King at all costs, even though America has no Kings?Yet, I never agreed with the critics who claim President Clinton was not determined, but just lucky to have good friends to cover his sins of the heart, head and flesh. I found it to be totally unfair, in my opinion. Sidney does point out why he fought so hard to support President Clinton. And quite frankly, I came away not blaming him but admiring his passion for this President.The simple fact remains President Clinton did accomplish substantive and important policies for the future of America. He did reform welfare with Republicans, ended the ethnic cleansing killings in Kosovo, was able to pass WTO and NAFTA and appointed some very good judges, agency heads and generals.Moreover, Sidney is the first to admit President Clinton's own actions were to blame for him not being able to do more. The author states he was very disappointed that the swords of slander and substance that stopped President Clinton cold in 1994, 1996 and 1998 were of the President's own making. The cutting blades of bias to President's Clinton's political foes were forged in their own camps. I found that refreshing from Sidney making such admissions.The way the writer describes it makes you wonder why such ambitions of meticulously single-minded purpose to be elected President was overcome by careless attitudes towards personal slapdash behavior. These dealings block President Clinton's reactionary schema to the ruination of his legacy. Certainly, turning a Democratic majority into a Republican's Congress and Senate with impeachment, follow by disbarment and public ridicule was not wise, to say the least.The Media now say Sidney Blumenthal is no longer a credible journalist. They scorn the author for falling on his sword and lost his reputation when he went from predator to prey to now pundit!I only know one thing after reading this book; I would love to have a man like Sidney on my side in a political fight for my life. And his actions for the Clinton's are because he believed in them and still does, even with the messy after thoughts of historical opinionated checkmate.Say what you will about this book and author, but his passion for President Clinton and Hillary deserves praise and recognition. I came away thinking to myself, Sidney wrote this view of history because of his genuine values in their political agenda. Now whatever that was is the subject of entirely new book!"},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Mr. Blumenthal's book, which is partially a first-hand account and partially a grand history of American politics from the inception of the Republic is absolutely wonderful reading. Many right-wing media outlets have tried to smear Mr. Blumenthal and his terrific book, but by doing so they only prove his point, that the Right and its media allies went much too far in their irrational quest to destroy Bill Clinton's presidency, and continue to trespass upon the bounds of objectivity, truth, and rationality. Inside this book you will find abosolutely riveting details about the desperation with which the Republicans worked to destroy the Clintons--details that the corporate media has never bothered to report. I thought I lived throught the 1990s as an informed, educated citizen, but after reading this book, I can say with certainty that I really knew nothing, for wool had been pulled over my eyes by the media."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Blumenthal -- like most political operatives with a book deal -- has churned out an indifferently written and profoundly humourless blend of hagiography, self-justification and character assassination. (Newsflash: Sid and Hitch are not going to kiss and make up any time this century.) And like the work of most political operatives with a book deal, this will have limited appeal to anyone isn't already in the choir or researching a term paper. Three stars for partisan Democrats and those who waste their Sunday mornings watching cable talking heads. Everyone else might want to give this tome a miss."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I wish this book had been printed earlier. Its a fascinating account of hound-like Washington society, where politicians and the press are equally culpable. On the whole, I loved the methodical manner in which Blumenthal has indicted the right. His accounts are very believable. However, I wish Mr. Blumenthal had provided more insight into Bill Clinton, the person and intellectual. Controversial, but Well done."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"This book is an insider's view of Clinton's second term. To be sure it contains the bias's associated with that view. I have yet to see too many &quot;objective&quot; views about someone writing on their own experiences. However, the author provides a factual insight into the impeachment and the problems that faced the Clinton White House. Ironically the criticisms of his work tend to enforce what the author says. The pack mentality and the press's bad reporting have been documented by Conason, Lyons, and Toobin.What the author never fully addresses is why the press corps was so easily manipulated by the right and the public seemed so constant in its support of Clinton. Hopefully somebody someday will address that question."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I was unable to finish Joe Conason's and Gene Lyons' book &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot; it was so upsetting. Their book is a factual recounting of the events. Sydney Blumenthal's book has been easier to read. He gives us more of the historical context and draws parallels to other progressive presidents who were attacked and smeared with equal ferocity (but without the internet!) in their time. In retrospect these are the greatest presidents to have served us and I'm sure that history will be kinder to Mr. Clinton than Rupert Murdoch has been. Although I am still angry about the GOP's underhanded tactics as well as the Democrats' lackadaisical defense, I'm comforted by seeing the bigger picture.Mr. Blumenthal is also a wonderful and compelling writer and makes this complex and lengthy tale highly readable. Besides the Conason and Lyons book, Susan McDougal's book is simpler story worth reading for those who are interested in these recent events."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"This book could very well be the bible of liberalism for the early 21st century. Sidney has written an 800-page masterpiece about the Clinton presidency that made me outraged all over again about the GOP's wanton abuse of power during the Clinton years - specifically during Clinton's second term, when Blumenthal served as the president's chief political advisor.To say that the president was morally bankrupt regarding his affairs is to state the obvious, and Blumenthal doesn't try to defend the president. What he does do is point out the blatant hypocrisy of the GOP leadership and Kenneth W. Starr, chief Clinton hater and possibly the most inept special prosecutor this country has ever seen (one can't help come to this conclusion after reading of Starr's abuses outlined in the book).Blumenthal also details: Matt Drudge's libel about Blumenthal's relationship with his wife that resulted in a lawsuit, Paula Jones's right wing backers who encouraged her to move forward with her baseless lawsuit (that was later thrown out of court), the myth of the birthmark on the president's genitals, the press's distortions of Al Gore during the stolen campaign in 2000, the right wing scourge named Richard Mellon Scaife, the outright lies cooked up by GOP hacks to discredit William Jefferson Clinton that started before he ever took the oath of office, and the myth of Clinton ignoring the threats of terrorism in the 1990s.The latter point is a pretty stark one in the wake of 9-11, since President Bush has suffered no political price for the disasters happening on his watch. Clinton ordered the bombing of Osama Bin Laden and just missed him by hours in August of 1998 following the attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa, all while Starr was busy subpoenaing the president to testify before a grand jury about his sex life (these 2 events happened within one week of each other). There is plenty of blame to go around for 9-11, but to blame it all on President Clinton is a line fit for Comedy Central. If the president was too busy to combat terrorism, as is often the accusation, then Congress and the FBI were pretty busy with less important things as well, since Starr's investigation WAS USING UP TO 78 FBI AGENTS. That's a whole lot of manpower not looking into terrorism, but this comes as no surprise since FBI Director Louis Freeh is an unabashed Clinton hater, as is Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The latter hating Clinton so much probably didn't have anything to do with the 5-4 vote deciding the 2000 election, did it?Blumenthal also lays waste to the myth that is Rush Limbaugh, where Rush gets all of his information (directly from the RNC), and his incredible intolerance, myopia and attacks on the Clintons, including Chelsea, whom he once referred to as \\"the White House dog.\\" It took him nearly a decade to apologize.This is just a smattering of what will endure as probably the best book on the Clinton presidency by someone not named Clinton."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I have been amused by those on both the political left and the right when it comes to their views of the Clinton years. Here the author shares some first hand experiences which are both enlightening and fascinating. His bias is obvious throughout this long book, but most of the readers tackling this work will benefit despite that. In fact I would have been disappointed if he had not been passionate about the ideas that he believes in. Overall it is a good first-hand account of the Clinton years from an insider."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I came to Sidney Blumenthal's \\"The Clinton Wars\\" hoping that the book would shed some light upon why so many people hated -- and still hate -- the 42nd president with such passion and venom. Given that Bill Clinton's administration produced great prosperity, given that he himself was obviously a hard worker and inspiring speaker, and given that the intial accusations against him were so dubious, why do so many people despise him and assume the worst about him? Regrettably, \\"The Clinton Wars\\" doesn't look very deeply into that question. Blumenthal matter-of-factly explains it as people who dislike the 1960s counterculture focusing their hostility upon a (wrongly) perceived representative of that movement, a political interloper that they never recognized as legitimate. Not a wholly satisfying answer.As a liberal Democrat and Clinton supporter, I liked reading \\"The Clinton Wars\\" because it affirmed many things that I believe: Whitewater was a fraud; Kenneth Starr was politically motivated from the get-go to remove Clinton from office; Clinton was a capable commander-in-chief; George W. Bush stole the 2000 presidential election, etc. Furthermore, without explicitly saying so, this book implies something even more disturbing: Starr's legal harassment of Clinton drained the anti-terrorism activities of the FBI and State Department and enabled Osama bin Laden to carry out the horrifying events of September 11, 2001. But at the same time, I could tell that I was in the company of a starry-eyed Clinton admirer whose biases might cloud his retelling of events.Usually, when a conservative reads \\"facts\\" that support his/her beliefs, he/she accepts them at face value but takes less comforting \\"facts\\" with a grain of salt. It's the same with us liberals: Data that back up my beliefs are to be believed; those that don't are not. But despite my eagerness to accept Blumenthal's account as completely veracious, I decided to surf the 'Net for opposing viewpoints. The negative reviews at Amazon.com are largely dismissive, petulant ad hominem attacks on Blumenthal and repeat some accusations that he already addressed in his book -- not very helpful. Michael Isikoff's critical review of \\"The Clinton Wars\\" is itself criticized by Slate.com. In an on-line essay, conservative activist David Horowitz defends his organization against Blumenthal's characterization of it as a \\"front\\" organization for Richard Mellon Scaife. He also decries Blumenthal's \\"vindictive tort against Matt Drudge\\" as an assault on the First Amendment. But -- tellingly -- Horowitz doesn't mention the incident that provoked the lawsuit in the first place: Without evidence, Drudge on his widely read Web site accused Blumenthal of beating his wife. It's hard for me to see how responding to such a scurrilous, inflammatory accusation via the legal system endangers free speech, and Horowitz's omission of this inciting incident makes me question his own veracity.On the whole, \\"The Clinton Wars\\" is engaging as an affirmation of Clinton's strengths and an indictment of the Starr witch hunt. On the down side, it's too uncritical of Clinton's moral lapses and his voracious fund raising. Blumenthal forgives Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal for \\"being human.\\" But one wishes that the author would admonish Clinton about how appallingly *stupid* it was for him to have conducted himself in such a capricious way when an over-reaching prosecutor was trying to dig up dirt on him.Some may split hairs with Blumenthal on certain particulars of his account about the Starr investigation. But nothing that anyone has said about \\"The Clinton Wars\\" has shaken this conviction of mine: Starr's investigation of Clinton was utterly unnecessary, politically vindictive, and a waste of this country's valuable resources. And in their rush to be the next Woodward and Bernstein, the press became willing dupes of Starr's illegal leaks. Democrats abided Republicans in the White House for the 12 years of Reagan/Bush, granting them at least minimal respect as leaders of the country, but Republicans could not show Clinton the same courtesy. It had to be presumed that he was guilty of unspeakable acts. He had to be driven from office by hook or by crook. Republicans still condemn Clinton for \\"lying under oath,\\" but the fact that he was entrapped to do so by a hostile, politically motivated ideologue using police-state tactics seems unimportant to them. Clinton's personal behavior in office was deplorable; Starr's official behavior was frightening. And I'm still astounded that so many self-proclaimed conservatives can't see that."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Blumenthal's book is a fascinating behind-the-scenes account of his years both inside and outside the Clinton administration. The book is thorough, vividly written and steady and has, obviously, already been assailed by the right wing punditocracy largely because Blumenthal actually admires Clinton and measures the man's very real achievements (while also being quite forthright about Clinton's missteps, particularly his incoherent first two years in office.) But Blumenthal has also ticked off another power nexus -- that of the mainstream media. Why? Because Blumenthal, a former reporter for The Washington Post and The New Yorker knows how the game was played, and he names names, providing an absolutley devastating analysis of how big media companies like The New York Times, The Post, Time, Newsweek, et al, were duped by dirty tricksters on the radical right; how the Whitewater story was concocted by Republican gamesters during the '92 election and how, after Clinton's election, those gamesters used Jeff Gerth at the supposedly 'liberal' NY Times to do their dirty work by foisting the story into the national mainstream. With results we know now.Attacks on Blumenthal, from Times' editors, Newsweek's Isikoff strike a false and shrill (and hugely defensive) note. Blumenthal has the goods on these characters. The smoke has cleared, and as they say \\"history will judge.\\" Those media bigfeet who became so usefully available to the Republican propaganda machine do not like now to have their bad behavior brought back up. Thus, the tenor of reviews claiming the Clinton era is all 'ancient history' and we should let the past be past.Significantly, the one dispassionate and also hugely favorable review of this book was written not by a journalist forced to confront the press's near-treasonous conduct during the Clinton years, but by an historian, Robert Dallek."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"In trying to fairly review this book, as politics has gotten ugly and mean and divided this nation, let's imagine that someone from my favorite island (Tristan da Cunha) sets foot in the USA with no more knowledge of Clinton than he was the leader of the country recently. He wants to know more, so he picks up this book and reads it. Our man from Tristan will be able to tell that Sidney Blumenthal likes and admires Bill Clinton a lot. That's not a knock against Mr. Blumenthal in the least, as other authors have liked and admired their subjects, too - that's why they do a fine job of writing about them, their personal interest shows. But in reading this book, the Tristan man will also learn that Mr. Clinton oversaw continuous economic expansion, more than 22 million jobs created, a home ownership rate increase from 64.0% to 67.5%, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, higher incomes at all levels, the largest budget deficit in American history converted to the largest surplus of over $200 billion, the lowest government spending as a percentage of GDP since 1974, higher stock ownership by families than ever before, a 220% increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a 300% increase in the Nasdaq from 1993 to 2001.Sounds like a heckuva job of improving America to me. So why is Mr. Clinton one of those \\"50%\\" people, half love him and half hate him? Mr. Blumenthal lays out a few reasons for the hate that still resounds today, and at base level it's all politics. the hatred and vitrol directed at Mr. Clinton and family is absolutely, positively, moronically senseless. We spent in excess of $70M trying to find something, anything, on a duly elected president, and it all ended up with an impeachment charge that seems as wispy as smoke today as it did in 1998. And it was all over a private matter that, under normal circumstances, would be settled between a husband and wife. The general mood of the country during the 1990s into the 2000s is as if we were one nation before Clinton took office; one group decided that we were two nations after he took office and open warfare on Clinton was continuous; and after he left office we should pretend we're one nation again. The media has their fair share of blame in this sordid trashing of Clinton's presidency, too - our So-Called Liberal Media showed its colors brightly from 1992 to 2001. I didn't agree with all of his policies and still don't, but personal attacks were never part of the disagreement. But beyond the political reason, why do we trash this man who tried to do so much for this country? Calling him names doesn't answer the question of why. Skim away your prejudices, read the book and see if you think that we had some pretty darn good days under President Clinton.An argument brought up is that at 822 pages, this might have been a couple hundred pages too long. There is a lot of personal information that Mr. Blumenthal includes about himself in here, like growing up and going to school. At first glance, there is the thought that this information is superfluous; on the other hand, given his deep involvment with the subject and the President, The Clinton Wars were also The Blumenthal Wars, fought over the same fronts. It's a long book, but it's worth reading."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"During the mid 1990's, the witty sage, Garrison Keeler, said, \\"The Republican Party is morally bankrupt\\" in an interview published in a Lutheran magazine. As prescient as that view was, then, he could not have known how bankrupt until Sidney Blumenthal published so many facts to support that judgment in THE CLINTON WARS. While a preoccupation with sexual morality would lay that judgment on President Clinton (and as an Episcopal Priest, I would agree that the violation of his wedding vow to be faithful to Hillary was an egregious moral lapse), there is evidence in Blumenthal's book of moral rot at the core of at least the right wing of the Republican party and its adherents. As defined by the life and teachings of Jesus, morality consists of love for God and neighbor to the point of donating oneself to their glory and welfare. Blumenthal documents how unloving these folks are in trying to accomplish their own agenda. What he does not do is expose what lies behind the agenda, aside from talking about the vague \\"cultural war\\" that supposedly has gripped this country. I may be wrong, but I believe what lies behind it is one of the seven deadly sins: Greed. Accuse me of being a class warrior, if you wish, but as Molly Ivins has pointed out, our national govenment is daily becoming more and more a \\"government of the corporations, by the corporations, and for the corporations.\\" While giving a significant role to the private sector in rehabing our economy, Clinton always had the vision that government and corporations exist to elevate and liberate PERSONS to achieve the best that was in them for the COMMON GOOD. THE CLINTON WARS gives us ample evidence that the President's vision lay behind all of the proposals and accomplishments of his administration. That moral vision has since been extinguished by the Bush presidency. I hope that people who read Blumenthal's excellent book will some how help rekindle the flame."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Sidney Blumenthal gets it right. While Bill Clinton fought for a better America, the right wing and the press fought to bring him down. Many authors have noted this, but Blumenthal's perspective and his independent research (he even interviews one of the House Impeachment managers) raise this book far above the level of a White House memior. Pundits may yawn for the lack of gossip (I heard one claim that the book revealed little that was new), but it does give a brilliant insight to the disconnnect between the real world inside the White House and the bizzare furry whirling out beyond. Blumenthal often recounts the actions of the independent prosecutor, then contrasts that with the actual policy initiatives and budget battles that occupied the time of those in the West Wing. The book is long, richly detailed, and obviously not as much fun as a book by Michael Moore or Al Frankin. But the book is important as a document of an era where so much of this nation devoted itself to destroying a man and his work. Blumenthal gives tremendous space to Clinton's Third Way initiative with other progressive governments. The goal was to create an international forum based on progressive ideals, a forum that in essence crumbled with Bush coming into the White House. Blumenthal cleanly ruptures so many myths about Clinton, exposes the endless investigations - even the ones that eventually turned on him - for their partisan roots. He does not write only as an apologist, but steps back as a historian who often has the luxury of slipping into the first person.The book is not perfect (but worth the five stars). It tries to cover too much. It is not the best book on the impeachment or how Clinton won back the White House after the &quot;Republican revolution&quot; of 1994, or of how Gore lost the recount battle in Florida in 2000. But it is the best book on the Clinton presidency as a whole. It strikes a conscious balance between Clinton's accomplishments and the ever increasing furry that rose up in his enemies. It is a great and worthy read."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Simply put, any reader would enjoy the 800+ pages in this very classy, comprehensive book. Blumenthal spends a generous amount of time with each person and event, giving us extended, ruminative passages that are not simply a retelling but are carefully pondered judgements about people. He is very big-hearted and many times tender, as he gives many prominent Republicans a generous, compassionate, judicious portrayal. For example, Bob Dole has had a very interesting life, and Blumenthal leisurely and lovingly includes it, along with his insightful persnality descriptions. He does this for many persons, each one of them taken as three-dimensional.Blumenthal is helped a great deal by the fact that he appears to have simply been in the right place at the right time. Never once did I get the impression that he ever angled for such a central rol. He simply happened to be one man who went through the heart of the storm.Given the enormous importance of his experiences, as well as the brutal and dishonorable treatment of his peers by some very unstable and unremorseful people, it's obvious Blumenthal has a deep need to retell, finally, what happened. Given his reasoned, intelligent, generous, and eloquent style, this book will be a prmanent record, and will stay with you."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"No, not perfect. And it's a thick monster. But it's worth the read in trying to understand the poisonous atmosphere that rightwingers and others have created. For them, it's essential to find someone to blame.Clinton could without question be a jerk. But Republicans were shaking in their boots at even the possibility of a constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to run again. Why? Because he would have taken the flight suit phoney to the cleaners. Why?During Clinton's era, the United States balanced its budget and had the longest economic expansion in American history. There was no reason for it to end, but Bush's inauguration marked the downhill slide. The recession began in March, 2001.How remarkable was that growth during Clinton's years? For starters, Reagan's policies drove the nation into recession and almost bankrupted the nation. Talking about the success Reaganomics is revisionism. The government he turned over to Bush the elder had a deficit ballooning out of control. Reagan generated the largest deficits in history and made it harder for anyone after him to balance the budget. Bush elder made a lot of mistakes, but he somewhat bit the bullet on taxes.Clinton had to take another bite on the bullet, and aside from taxes, cut spending, amid dire projections by Hard Core Republican right wingers that the nation's economy would collapse.The opposite happened. There was no recession during Clinton's years. The economy expanded each quarter and millions upon millions of new jobs were created. No, it wasn't Clinton's singular genius that did it, but what happened, worked.How hard is that? Clinton served two full terms. No recession. That's not something you can say about Reagan or Eisenhower. In fact, you can't say it about any American President since WWII. Ike had three -- and he wasn't a bad president.The politics that Blumenthal dissects is the major reason leaders of substance have such difficulty dealing with issues of substance. Theories about government spending are nice for whacko right wingers.Social Security, which is self-financed although endangered by Bush, is one big expenditure. The Post Office is the biggest civilian employer, about 850,000, filling an essential role. But the big swallower of federal spending is the Pentagonm nearly 2.5 million people including troops and civilian employees. A great Army. But we can't get them body armor in Iraq.Perhaps Blumenthal overrates his importance, but he is a realist and he, along with many others of right and left leaning pols, know the truth. You can't cut taxes at a time like this without taking great risks with both our security and our military. As it happens, that's exactly what is happening and if it were Clinton pulling this, the Clinton Wars of the past would be nothing to compare to this. As it is, Bush ambles along and the Right wing whines that he's being treated unfairly. SEriously conservative Republicans are horrified, but so afraid of White HOuse or Texas disfavor, that they pee on their office carpets as the country goes to hell.Left wing Press. A myth. What we have a is a cowed, puppy-dog media that chews on rugs while looters destroy our country. Fox in charge of the foxes. There's nothing in this book that will make Washington reporters happy, even as they let Bush slide off the hook day after day."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Why would ANYone value ANYthing MR.

Bottom line is if you like Clinton, you'll like the book.What a read!"},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"For some stupid reason I thought Clinton was an untrustworthy demagogue. So, needless to say, I was somewhat confused when reading The Clinton Wars. I like how Blumenthal mentioned how victorious Clinton was in all of his war efforts including Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and Bosnia. Being a big war buff, I know, now that I read this, that Clinton never dodged the draft. I also learned that Clinton never lied about anything. Wow! I'm glad I read this cause I guess I had all of my facts wrong or something. After reading this, I learned how Clinton was the clairvoyant President who ushered in unprecedented growth in his impeccable tenure.Thanks to Sid Blumenthal, I now know that all of the negativity I was hearing about infidelity, perjuring to a federal grand jury, selling pardons, stealing the White House china, selling nuclear secrets to China, appeasing North Korea, and turning down Osama bin Laden were all nothing more than spurious fallacies lodged from the vicious right wing conspiracy. Kudos for setting me straight, Sid."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Sid's new book of drivel does not tell us why Bill Clinton failed to arrest Bin Laden after the Sudan offered Bin Laden on a platter 3 times.

He has been caught in so many lies and paid so much in civil penalties and legal bills that this book offers nothing in factual history.What makes this book somewhat worthy of your time is that Blumenthal was at the center of the most effective \\"personal destruction\\" machine in history. Ask how does a man guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice come out looking like both victim and hero while a federal judge looks downright evil? Clinton presided over the outright decline of the democratic party from city councils to the house of representatives and yet he managed to get every national democratic official to line up behind him even while they publicly admitted his guilt. A political machine this effective deserves to be studied, personal moral judgements aside.If you can get past his absolute denial of facts and hero worship of Bill Clinton, Blumenthal's writing is actually fun to read. There hopefully will be much more scholarly tracts into the Clinton presidency, but polmerics have their place."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Right wing - left wing - who cares? The point is Dear Sidney couldn't tell fact from fiction. He's all too hasty to elevate his boss to the point where your jaw simply drops and you go: &quot;say what?&quot; This has nothing to do with partisanship, but simply facts. I guess I'm not ready to worship at the Clinton altar unreservedly. Sidney is. And he can do it without those pesky little facts. For me, I'm a little more discerning. I need a couple facts to help me out. Sidney is scant on those. Give this one a big pass. It doesn't satisfy anyone even with the most modest curiosity of the behind-the-scenes peek at the Clinton Whitehouse. I was hoping for a story without hype and hoop-la.

The fact is mrs. coulter and mr. hannity despite whether you agree with them or not have alot more credibility and have not been caught in the lie that mr. bluminthale has. All he is is one of clintons stooges who is trying to rewrite history for and expose the right wing conspiracy. Sometimes you people sould just really sad when you are talking about the right wing conspiracy because nobody buys it most people admit there is a liberal bias and if anything there is more of a liberal conspiracy then a right wing one. The fact though is if the kind of people who read this book say smart comment about hannity and coulter being garbage just because they dont believe them well i think that shows alot of the kind of people who would read this book.

Is it plausible to suggest that Clinton would have done a better job hunting for terrorists if he hadn't been busy defending himself in Monica-related investigations? Perhaps if Clinton hadn't been hunting for Monica, he would have had more time for hunting for terrorists. Another misleading aspect of the book is that the press is controlled by conservatives. This is truly odd. The leftward tilt of the press is highly documented in numerous studies.

So, I read, and read, and read, and read, and on, and on, and on, .......If he'd wanted to be in the least bit credible, there'd been maybe one chink in President Clinton's armor. But, no. It's all the \\"right wing conspiracy.\\" In spite of the fact that Blumenthal's former employer, the fact-creating, slanderer-hiring rag New York Times is inherently liberal. Paula Jones didn't happen, Monica didn't happen, impeachment didn't happen. It was all Ken Starr's fault....for 800 pages. C'mon Sid. For those who are blindly loyal to the Clinton regime, you'll probably dig it. For those who have an objective, need-to-know bone in your body, don't bother. Clinton was voted in a CSPAN poll recently to be the most immoral president in our country's history. Not according to Sid. It was entirely the work of the Republican right and collusion. This is a cheerleading effort from front to back. \\"Don't confuse us with the facts.\\" And don't waste your hard-earned money. This book reeks of political pay-off and future employment hope on the part of Blumenthal. I expected much more from a \\"professional journalist.\\" Blumenthal has waived that right."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Sidney Blumenthal's The Clinton Wars is part memoir, part history of the Clinton years, but instead of serving as a kind of early history, it's really the Official Court History, and is about as objective as the Soviet Union's news bureaus.What's wrong with this book is what was wrong with the Clinton presidency: a main point of interest just revolves around scandal, the tone is unrelentingly \\"us vs. them\\", and there are huge parts that contain lots of verbiage but say nothing.The memoir part of the book basically derives from Blumenthal's involvement in the whole Monica business, and he goes through every detail in mind-numbing detail. He's probably the only one to actually take Henry Hyde's rhetoric during the impeachment trial seriously, dissecting each phrase and explaining its implications. Thus, even his \\"you are there\\" parts of the book aren't anything very exciting or informative. When the only \\"inside action\\" you have to dish about in your book is just rehashing of some basically undramatic scandal, you are in trouble.Then there's the relentlessly partisan tone: nothing Clinton, Hillary, or Gore does is ever wrong in any sense, ever. Blumenthal does figuratively what Monica did literally. Every incident is presented as either redounding to Clinton's benefit or as demonstrating how unreasonable/unethical/unprofessional the Republicans/press are. For example, Clinton gets asked about Whitewater while visiting South America. Here is a chance for Blumenthal to lecture the press - how dare they miss the \\"great doings\\" of the President's trip. Of course, someone less beholden to Clinton might have pointed out that if you consistently avoid ever answering questions about something at home, it's natural to get asked when you are away. If there was nothing to hide, Blumenthal should have just told the President to answer already. Another example is during the 2000 campaign, when George H.W. Bush briefly threatens to \\"say what I think of him [Clinton]\\", in response to some criticism of him. Blumenthal protrays this as being laughed at as the rantings of a bitter old man. Interesting, since some (left and right) saw it as a warning that Clinton should stop trying to get away with the \\"poor innocent\\" role. While there may be a difference of opinion as to interpretation, Bluthenthal eshews it, to his and his boss's loss.The rest of the book is a pretty bad attempt at a history of the administration, with heavy emphasis on every \\"theme\\" ever espoused by the Clintons. We get a pages-long account of Clinton and Blair and his \\"third way\\", there's a history of the Commission on Race (with its minor dramas all recounted as if it made any difference - anyone remember what the Commission said? No, because it was just more watered-down pablum); a birthday party for Hillary is detailed in several pages, including a paragraph long quotation from some book she admires that is supposed to sum up her views; the careful choosing of words and theme for a State of the Union address is discussed (like anyone remembers what gets said). If this is what Blumenthal views as a significant accomplishment, he needs help.The general trend here is that Blumenthal had little of real substance to talk about (except the scandal stuff) and pads the book with these tales, as if they were significant events. Blumenthal describes life in the West Wing, which sounds like everyone just had meetings to have more meetings, to produce memos describing esoteric concepts like \\"the crisis of the 21st century\\" or the \\"fear over the new economy\\". Blumenthal doesn't have any stuff to add about, oh, say, legislative doings (the tobacco bill? NATO expansion?), since he clearly had nothing to do with them. He sat in his office and typed memos of \\"What I think we should do\\" at government expense.This busywork is what was so wrong with Clinton. So you urged Congress to pass the v-chip? Great; what about health care, the judiciary, national security? Oh, there's lots of memos and reports to point to, just not much real stuff. That is a summary of Blumenthal's book."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"This book is very hard to swallow. Was this book ghost written by the Clintons? Mr. Blumenthal is long winded, self serving, and biased. Did the Clintons do anything wrong? They should take some responsibity for their actions.I realize that Clinton was a target but he also was not the saint that Mr. Blumenthal paints him as. The right wing conspiracy was not urging him on with Monica Lewinsky.I believe that Dick Morris' advice would have been good. Blumenthal thought that coming clean was a stupid idea. I think that if he said yes, I had a sexual relation with that girl, he would not have been impeached. It would have taken the wind out of the sails. Instead, Clinton went on television and lied to the country.Clinton was an able politician. He realized, I think on his own and without the author's much believed help from him, that he could not be a typical tax and spend democrat. He did things that were in the middle of the road.The book gives Clinton credit for everything that was good during his tenure. However, the right wing conspiracy caused evey problem. Clinton chose his cabinet wisely. The book fails to mention that Rubin and Greenspan helped to guide the economy.This book reminds me of the movie \\"Thirteen Days.\\" The Kevin Costner role was enlarged from what it really was.

The bulk of the book simply rehashed every bad thing a conservative writer, pundit, operative or politician had said about Mr. Clinton. The clincher was the Chapter on how George W.

Blumenthal's account on the other hand, finds absolutely no fault with the former president. He parrots the infamous &quot;right wing conspiracy&quot; theory originated by the former first lady.In addition, the book is way too long at over 800 pages...I gave up after forcing my way through over 500. I recommend the Stephanopoulos book or Michael Waldman's &quot;POTUS Speaks&quot; as much more interesting and balanced reading."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Since Sid was an insider, any reader expecting an objective account of Slick Willie's tenure will be sorely dissapointed. Despite the meaty heft of the tome, Sid flails about weakly attempting to castigate Clinton opponents (and often on hearsay)but failing to explain the processes going on at the time that resulted in: a) the biggest economic bubble and corporate pilaging of the 20th century (sorry kiddies, you can't blame Bush for that one); and worse b) allowing al-Queda to stage smaller terror attacks relatively unpunished that led directly to 9-11. I could care less about Ken Starr and the McDougals, as they don't matter compared to what happened in NYC that very ugly day, and his boy Clinton had a major hand in allowing it to occur."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I'm sorry, but as a person who voted for Bill Clinton, I lived to regret it. Blumenthal does little to explain away Clinton's atrocious private behaviour. Couldn't the man at least keep it to one mistress per year while he was president? He was a superb leader but a real jerk when it came to women. In the end, his private life cascaded over into his public life with predictable results. Don't you get it, Blumenthal? The sharks are always circling the White House no matter who is installed. Why throw them easy bait? As far as the writing itself is concerned, I liked it. It is brisk and easy to digest, a nice weekend book for the beach. Just don't expect it to exonerate Big Bill."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"For 10 long years, the right tried to ignore the will of the people and overthrow a presidency. And with the cooperation of the media, the people hardly noticed.Many books have been written about the sleazy tactics of the right, but none paint the picture quite like Blumenthal's latest. Even at 800 pages, it doesn't have the space to explain it all. (You'll need to read Conason and Lyon's book, &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot; to get all the gory details). But Blumenthal presents an insider's perspective of what history will eventually record as a thoroughly disgraceful (and in some cases criminal) manipulation of government by the republican political party.Don't expect good reviews (or even perhaps many reviews at all) of this book by the media. Blumenthal exposes many of the members of the media for what they are -- either craven conservatives with a political agenda, merely masquerading as journalists; or craven opportunists, easily manipulated by the right and eager to peddle their sleaze, regardless of the actual facts. This book is required reading for those who want the truth."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I always thought of Clinton as a moderate not a progressive. Blumenthal apparently thinks otherwise and makes a strong case that what occured during the Clinton years,including the so called scandals, was warfare in which smears were the weapons used by right wingers in the &quot;Clinton Wars&quot;.There is a lot of detail about the insanity of their tactics. One person Blumenthal was never able to figure out was Christopher Hitchens although his story of how their friendship became emnity is one of the more interesting parts of the book. I think in future years this book will provide a wealth of information to historians of the Clinton years including those who examine how it came to pass that Congress went so far as to impeach this larger than life president."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"So far I am only 150 pages into this book. I've not previously put anything on amazon about a book until I have finished it. I am going to make an exception in this case, because I am extremely familiar with the material that Blumenthal has so far covered in his fine, fine history of the Clinton \\"scandals\\" and how they came to be. I have scanned and read several of the scurrilous literary efforts of the professional haters who relentlessly attacked and tried to destroy the Clinton presidency and in the process have poisoned, perhaps fatally, our political processes and the political and social climate of our nation. The Clinton Wars is highly informed, meticulously factual, remarkably readable, partisan but not blindly so, and one of the most if not the most important books about the current state of the Republican Party to hit the bookshelves in years. In the first chapter, Blumenthal does the best job of anyone so far at outlining the character of Bill and Hillary and their enemies. The implacable, sometimes venel and always selfserving enemies, as opposed to the political opponents of the Clintons, and the supposedly \\"objective\\" journalists who were their all too willing tools, are revealed in all their slimy glory. The journalists were led with eyes wide open, but clouded by visions of Watergate-like notoriety, down a torturous and easily disproved primrose path by some of the most outlandish and unbelievable characters since the King and the Duke were huckstering the rubes in Mark Twain's Huckelberry Finn. The idea that this cast of characters - led by the ever despicable old racist Justice Jim Johnson (Orval Faubus's evil genius), convicted felon and small time crook David Hale, poor crazy and frightened Jim McDougal, the reprehensible Floyd Brown and David Bosie and all the rest of the unlikely cabal that almost brought down a president - was able to pull the wool over the eyes of almost all the mainstream press and influence so much of the political manuevering of the last 8 years of the twentieth century will be as ludicrus to historians as it currently is to so many of those of us who knew many of the characters pulling the strings behind this drama.If the rest of Blumenthal's work holds up to the very auspicious start of the first 150 pages, he, along with Joe Conason and Gene Lyons (The Hunting Of The President), and David Maraniss (First in His Class), has performed a major service to historians writing about politics the late 21st century in the United States. wfh"},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"When Blumenthal's book was first released, my first reaction was a groan. I had liked his writing in The New Republic and elsewhere before the Clinton presidency. OTOH, I was not a great fan of his New Yorker pieces---his partisanship undermined his credibility, although his writing was certainly more literate and thoughtful than much of what was produced by the hard core anti-Clinton partisans. Nonetheless, I saw some excerpts and was pleasantly surprised at the writing and the depth. It's a first person account of an interesting period from someone who obviously was close to the Clintons, but also had longstanding knowledge of \\"the other side\\" and even maintained friendships with Clinton opponents.I thought the 1st chapter dragged and the sequence of the book was a bit out of joint (hence, 4 stars instead of 5). I also tend to disagree with assessment of the Tina Brown period at The New Yorker---she initially trashed the place and its standards and only later showed that she could assemble a magazine worthy of the name. Blumenthal's autobiographical sketch should have come sooner as it sets the stage for both the Clinton White House and Blumenthal's overall political perspective. The book is an engrossing read and Blumenthal's previous research about the political Right, as well as his time with the Clinton's brings fresh ways of looking at the Clinton administration that are missing from other accounts.The book will not be enjoyed by serious anti-Clintonistas, but I doubt that any of them would buy the book. Indeed, some of the reviews by Clinton critics here certainly suggest that the reviewers never even skimmed it. OTOH, it is a book with some appeal to people, like me, who were not strong Clinton enthusiasts, but who also felt that the Clintons were badly served by the media."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"This book is a must it is half historical reference and the i beleive a facinating reveiw of a highly controversial President. However no matter what you think of Bill Clinton and his fratenising i beleive that history will eventually look at what he acheived, and that was a considerable amount to say the very least Could he have done more? possibly, however he has to still rate as one of the truly great presidents, if only one could get rid of the surface distractions and the petty polital hassles that were inflicted on him, i beleive, that as this book highlights he would have been known in his life time as one of the truly great presidents of the USA. I think that he will have to wait far beyond his life before the historians take a real definative look and come to this decision, so in the meantime The Clinton Wars has to be the book to have on your shelf regards this facinating man and his presidency. It is also very well written, however, you would expect nothing less from this writer, in fact he probably desrves a book in his own right, as a very interesting figure within this time period think about it Sydney i would buy it."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I loved this book, well the parts of it that weren't dedicated to Monica Lewinsky. The fact that about a 1/4 of this book centered around the Monica Lewinsky \\"scandal\\" was the main detractor, other than that I found it a great read about a presidency that had a tough time getting the word out. Though I must warn any reader unfamiliar with the Clinton Presidency that this is an unabashedly pro-Clintonian work, which requires that the reader be prepared to ask a lot of unasked questions regarding points of view and ideology so that a balanced picture of Clinton can be formed, because if it were up to Blumenthal they would be carving Clinton's face onto Mt. Rushmore as we speak. Though I will repeat myself in saying that is a worthwhile read (just do a lot of skimming when it comes to Monica)."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Sidney Blumenthal as an author wrote a devastating work on the 1988 presidential campaign, detailing the use of Willie Horton and the Pledge of Allegiance by George Bush against Michael Dukakis, and how the smear artistry and low intellectual level of the Republican campaign designed by Lee Atwater turned off many citizens to the point where they lost interest in the process and did not vote. Blumenthal shrewdly realized the Republican strategy of turning off all but the strongtly committed Republican vote and sailing to victory in the midst of a generally disenchanted electorate.As a senior adviser in the Clinton White House, Blumenthal had a participant's view of the action as the Republicans tried the same strategy on the former governor from Arkansas. When the Republicans were not able to derail \\"Bubba\\" in the voting booth they attempted Plan B, seeking to remove him from office through the impeachment process. As the Ken Starr prosecutorial scheme used the largesse of billionaire right winger Richard Melon Scaife to unleash a viciousness unseen in American politics since 1988 and, prior to that, Richard Nixon, the attackers denied what they were obviously doing. Instead they sought to attack Blumenthal and Clinton for using the media against them. The sad travesty involved a leak to scandalmonger Matt Drudge that Blumenthal beat his wife Jackie, which was picked up dutifully through the Republican network, despite the attackers not possessing a single thread of evidence.As a senior adviser dealing with communications, the Starr brigade and Republican right in general sought to use Blumenthal as a target, making him appear as a master Machiavellian who was launching smear tactics against them. He ended up spending [money amount] defending himself against their baseless charges as he was compelled to testify before a grand jury and during the trial against Clinton. He ultimately dropped his suit against Drudge due to the sheer expense involved.In addition to providing an insider's view on how the network seeking to remove Clinton from office operated, Blumenthal also recounts Clinton's triumphs in foreign and domestic policy. He cites the tragedy of Clinton having to face an impeachment trial for an extra-marital sex act when the specter of Bin Laden and terrorism loomed large before America and the world.Blumenthal's informative work has plenty of the Boswell and Kafka in it, the Boswell stemming from his chronicling of Clinton's world as chief executive, supplying interesting factual details as Boswell did in detailing the colorful life of London's legendary Doctor Samuel Johnson. The Kafka emerges in his recounting of the scurrilous relentlessness with which the Clinton haters pursued the author en route to seeking to destroy the president he served.This is great reading for any concerned Americans seeking to learn more about the political process from the sublime to the truly lamentable."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"I saw the author giving a speach about his book on C-Span a few days after I had bought his book and found it illuminating. I hadn't quite finished his book at that time. I believe a majority of the people were already dismayed and tired of the constant harassment of Clinton by the media and right-wing conservatives by the the time of his impeachment. The reason for the impeachment was so ludicrous and inhumane that those Republicans who forced this event and Starr hurt our country's image and the people's belief that our country is fair and just in its judicial system. This book is good because it tells the other side of the story-the true side (A lot of people still believe the lies, even though with all the millions spent on the investigations nothing was found). It tells about their personal, domestic, and foreign wars. You hear about the Starr/Lewinsky/Clinton case and the bullying antics of Starr. You get the story on the Bush/Gore election and dirty actions that a lot of the people don't know about. It is an important book to read. We need to be more knowledgeable about the people we vote for. We can't count on just the news because that is often distorted as you will see in this book. We need to dig deeper. Ultimately, we the people, choose the people who work for us, so we need to know their qualifications. They can either make you, break you or steal from you."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"This author really feels for his subject, that is obvious from his passionate writing. Reading this book is painful - the republican slander machine does not stop at anything to keep the power in the US to themsleves. I was amazed to read that Clinton was accused of no less than twentyfive murders in connection with Whitewater - and that was only at the beginning of his presidency! The US must clear up its own act at the same time it demands democracy in other countries.The only issue I have with the book is the comparable lack of sources and references. The slander has to be met with proveable facts, not something that can be dismissed as propaganda."},{"Title":"The Clinton Wars","review":"Sidney Blumenthal delivers a fantastic inside account of the War against the Clinton Presidency. He became a friend to the Clintons, both Hillary and then Bill during the 1988 Democratic Convention and stayed close to them both ever since. He stayed close and helped as a political advisor to Bill during his 1992 campaign. He stayed as an outside advisor to the President until 1996 when he and Paul Begala went to the White House to help strategize Clintons final term. Blumenthal delivers a great friends account of the President. He was not only his advisor but a very close personal friend. Blumenthal organized Tony Blairs visit to Washington as the Labour Party candidate sparking Blairs continual run as Prime Minister of England. Blumenthal describes Clintons love for books, knowledge and information. Clinton would be up all night at a G8 Summit in Europe playing DOUBLE SOLITARE, reading memos, watching CNN, and talking to Hillary all at the same time. We was known as a notorious CARD PLAYER, an outstanding card counter. Many times the President would be sitting in his limo while crowds waited and cameras rolled, finishing a game of hearts with his staff.Blumenthal was also 1 of the 3 people to Testify at the Senate Impeachment Trial of William Jefferson Clinton. His accounts of the war between the Republican RightWing Scaife foundations and its surrogates, FOX news, THE WASHINGTON TIMES, THE NEW YORK POST, MATT DRUDGE, and the Dirt Digging Operation known at the American Spectator as the ARKANSAS PROJECT (BASICALLY PAYING ANYONE AND ANYTHING TO SAY THAT CLINTON HAD DONE ILLEGAL THINGS AS GOVERNOR). He documents the complete trash that was the Starr Investigation and completley puts out any smoke that may have arisen from his improper and complete waste of 80 MILLION DOLLAR INVESTIGATION.If you are looking for an OUTSIDE ACCOUNT from a Friend, Advisor, and Critical Journalist, of the Clinton Administration this is it. READ this before you read Clintons' My Life."},{"Title":"The Amazing Spider-Man (No. 326)","review":"At the end of 1989, Marvel introduced Acts of Vengeance, a cross-over series that affected virtually every hero and villain in the Marvel Universe. In a nutshell, the Acts of Vengeance storyline had all of the bad guys coming together and agreeing to switch enemies - you kill my enemy, I'll kill yours. It makes a lot of sense. I mean, how many times had the Fantastic Four thwarted Dr. Doom's evil schemes? When was the last time the Kingpin managed to get the best of Spider-Man? The heroes know their traditional foes inside and out. Acts of Vengeance set the stage for battles never before imagined.In The Amazing Spider-Man #326, Graviton arrives in town to dispatch Spider-Man (meanwhile, the Kingpin is sending his men to dispatch The Avengers). Spidey certainly wasn't expecting him, as he had only heard about Graviton up to this point. Forced on the defensive by this new foe, Spider-Man finds himself in something of a pickle, as Graviton's complete control of the forces of gravity leads to a rather ignominious defeat for the web-slinger. The guy actually lifts the building housing The Daily Bugle and floats it across town - what's Spidey to do against a foe of this caliber? Graviton may not kill Spider-Man as he set out to do, but there's no doubt that he wins the round on points, leaving Peter Parker feeling like quite a loser at the end.This issue is somewhat unusual, in that neither Todd McFarlane nor his successor Erik Larsen provided the illustrations. In this truly transitional issue, penciler Colleen Doran and inker Andy Mushynsky do the honors and, I must say, do a pretty good job of it. Don't look for Cosmic Spider-Man in these pages, however, as our hero is just on the verge of acquiring the incredible new powers that will make him - for a time, at least - the most powerful superhero in the Marvel Universe. The whole Acts of Vengeance storyline, insofar as it affects Spider-Man, continued across the next several issues of all three Spider-Man titles being published in late 1989/early 1990: The Amazing Spider-Man, The Spectacular Spider-Man, and Web of Spider-Man. ASM #326 was really just a warm-up act for the real show ahead."},{"Title":"The Missing 'Gator Of Gumbo Limbo (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm a 10 yead old boy who loves to read! but I totally hate this book.

Their writing also improves as they try to model her writing style."},{"Title":"The Missing 'Gator Of Gumbo Limbo (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This fascinating novel is for anyone who has ever fallen in love with a wild place, with a wild animal, or who is concerned about our jeopardized natural world. Only Jean Craighead George could write such a comprehensible and informative children's book about nature. While they're not JULIE OF THE WOLVES or MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, Ms. George's Ecological Mysteries Series are sure to be enjoyable for any naturalist--inspiring and educational. In THE MISSING 'GATOR OF GUMBO LIMBO, Liza K. Poole lives with her mother and some eccentric neighbors in the heart of the Florida Everglades. (Anyone who was born to live in a tent and fish for food will be envious of this &quot;wild&quot; lifestyle.) When the woods peoples' &quot;dragon&quot;, a regal alligator, disappears, they begin to try to track down the great beast, especially Liza K. A ranger is after the gator, for he has been frightening nearby home-dwellers, and should be shot. Liza K. and her unique friends--including a talkative African gray parrot-- go through a series of clues to find out where the gator has disappeared to. The ending, I admit, is slightly disappointing--the threat of the ranger seems to be forgotten after the gator is found, Liza K. and her neighbors must abandon their way of life--but all in all, it's a fine read. The other Eco-Mysteries should be kept in mind--WHO REALLY KILLED COCK ROBIN?, in which a boy tries to solve the mystery of his clean town's feathered mascot; THE CASE OF THE MISSING CUTTHROATS, quite a lot like THE MISSING 'GATOR; and THE FIRE BUG CONNECTION.

My grandfather led a colorful life and this book tells about the time he was a Texas Ranger with Leander McNelly. He wasn't with him for very long, but the memories stayed with him until the end. It starts when he is a teenager straight from Georgia after the civil war, finding Capt. McNelly (who, by this time is very ill and dying of tuberculosis) becoming a Texas Ranger and how he meets my grandmother, Caroline Chamberlain, who was Mr. & Mrs. King's niece and whom he loved.

Some kind of record. I know the original issue in 1962 was not like this (Note: I worked there 1951-56) for in those days the standards were high!

The book has its share of excitement, humor and grim reality. The one jarring note is that somewhere in its production there was a clumsy attempt to dramatise certain events by a writer using the expressions of a modern western novel. Thus we have Captain McNelly checking the loads in his gun and swinging shut the cylinder, as per the TV cowboys of the 1950s, at a time when swing-out cylinders had not been invented . Also there is a reference to a \\"thutty-thitty\\" nearly 20 years before the .30/30 cartridge became available. Ranger George Durham would not have made such errors.

I am a big Texas History fan and wanted to know more. Since it was published by the University of Texas, I hoped it would be a truthful and historic version of the story. The book was dead on and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Taming the Nueces Strip: The Story of McNelly's Rangers","review":"In the 1930s, journalist Clyde Wantland was able to get an aging Texas Ranger, George Durham, to relate his experiences as a young man serving under controversial Texas Ranger captain Leander McNelly. Wantland later (1962) put the account in book form. It's considered a classic narrative of Texan history.McNelly's Rangers were charged by the governor of Texas with restoring law and order to the Nueces Strip, an area of land just north of the Rio Grande border with Mexico north to the Nueces River. This land had seen lots of violence caused by its proximity to the Mexican border: (1) rustlers drove stolen cattle and horses across the border where they couldn't be recovered; (2) a complicated cultural/political situation juxtaposed recent immigrants to the area against Mexicans resulting in the local governments failing to maintain their own control.I really enjoyed reading this book. The book is easy reading and goes fast. It took me about 4 hours, and I'm not that fast of a reader. It reads like a novel, written in first person as the story of George Durham. There's plenty of well-described action, characters, suspense, and humor. Most readers will identify with the narrator and tend to be sympathetic to his enthusiastic support for Leander McNelly and his methods.Leander McNelly's approach to \\"taming the Nueces Strip\\" was to kill bad guys without much concern for legal niceties. This approach has often in history been attractive, but the hazards to justice and civilization are more serious than many of its supporters think. Not all of its practitioners end up being good guys, so that often more killer-lawmen are needed to deal with the killer ex-lawmen, and so forth. OCCASIONALLY, it works out okay.A couple of the most interesting incidents concern George Durham's confession of his own temptations to cross over to the dark side. Durham is even present when one of his fellow Rangers abruptly commits unjustified murder, such that the fellow Ranger has to spend the rest of his life as a fugitive in Mexico. At one point Durham commented that he had only really learned one thing in his first two years in Texas: to kill people.In later life Durham became a noted and respected lawman who apparently learned to work with the law. Good thing. The rule of law really is better than the rule of violence, no matter how attractive the latter."},{"Title":"Taming the Nueces Strip: The Story of McNelly's Rangers","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. The account of George Durham is as blunt and straight forward as the men he came to know and ride with. That is, he speaks of a life that was hard and brutal. He speaks to how poor he was prior to becoming a Ranger, and what it was like for a young man to become a part of a group of men who, while they were in the business of upholding the law, they were in fact similar in many ways to the lawbreakers they sought. Durham makes no excuses for the things the Rangers did (for instance, the fact that they took no prisoners). The Rangers acted as judge, jury and executioner, and to some, they were as low as the outlaws and badmen they went after. Durham's recollections of King Fisher, a well known rustler, rancher and later a lawman, was fascinating in describing how Fisher dressed, acted, and most importantly, how he consistently outsmarted those that sought to end his days.A main character of the book is Ranger Captain Lee McNelly, who is acclaimed here and elsewhere as a brave and able leader. During his rather short life McNelly participated in some wild and woooly events, and it is our good fortune that Durham was along to witness some of it. It is apparent that Durham had a bit of the hero worship for McNelly, but considering Durham's young age when he joined the Rangers, and his lack of experience in the ways of the West, it is not unusual that Durham would be so inclined.The reason that I didn't rate this book a five star was because of the near total recall by Durham of the conversations and spoken words attributed to others, many years after the actual events. In my own case it is sometimes hard to remember what someone said a mere month ago, so while I attribute a great deal of accuracy to the events described in the book, I have to wonder about the verbatim conversations. However, this does not unduly detract from the overall favorable experience of reading this book."},{"Title":"Historia de la Nueva Mexico, 1610: A Critical and Annotated Spanish/English Edition (Paso Por Aqui Series) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"This is the definitive edition.

Wie es wirklich war.","review":"Books about the worst sea disaster in history are notably lacking in the English language. Due to the enormity of Germany's crimes in the Second World War, authors seem to feel they have no right to depict an event that is filled with the suffering of people who, on some level, seem to have brought it on themselves. It's a valid argument in a way, but such a major historical event should not just be forgotten. To really learn about the sinking, you'll need to be able to read German.For a sense of the period in early 1945 around the sinking of the Gustloff - the Soviet advance across Poland into Germany, the resulting mass exodus of the Germans living there and a very general overview of the actual sinking, this is a good introduction.All the major points in the sinking are touched on, but the book is shamefully lacking in detail. Rather than describing the individuals and the incidents that occured to them, Knopp relies on generalities time and again. I can't count how many survivors are quoted saying they thought the ship was \\"safe\\" when they boarded it, or saying they would \\"never forget\\" the sinking.Much space is wasted with redundant quotes and broad strokes, taking the drama and human tragedy out of the event. There is no firm sense of any aspect of the story, either the Russian submariners or the German Naval officers, troops or civilians. Nor is time or geography -both on the ship and in the sea around it - at any time made clear. You finish the book with a basic idea of what happened, but little specific knowledge. There are much better books out there, primarily the two by Heinz Schon, who was himself a survivor.This book is a quick read, full of photos and maps, so it's a good place to start, especially if you're not too familiar with the event, but please don't stop here if you read about the subject, Schon's book \\"SOS Wilhelm Gustloff\\" is much better and not too much longer, while his \\"Die Gustloff Katastrophe\\" is a virtual doorstop and the definitive work on the topic for now.Incidentally, don't be ripped off by the Amazon vultures trying to sell these books for hundreds of dollars, buy them from amazon.de"},{"Title":"Dangerous","review":"There is of course the knowledge that Fabio has a shadow author helping out with his novels.

I was a bit dismayed when I read how much Lexi hated Yale and yet she so quickly ended up in bed with him. Okay, it wasn't really him, but she THOUGHT it was him. And as soon as Lexi discovered it was in fact Emmett, she was cool with that too. To my way of thinking, the fact that to Lexi these two brothers were so totally interchangable (if Emmett's dead, I'll sleep with Yale... oops, looks like this isn't Yale at all so I'll sleep with Emmett) made her a very shallow character. Her thinking seemed to be, \\"I'll just be with whichever brother wasn't killed.\\" Hmmmm, how flattering to the man in her life! But it did not seem to bother Emmett. One would think that he would have some negative thoughts about \\"his\\" girl so readily going to bed with a man she thought was his brother but it did not appear to disturb him at all!

Readers be prepared to be ENTHRALLED by the fascinating and outright sensual laden world that Emma Holly creates with her exciting series of shape-changing upyrs. More importantly, die-hard fans of Ms. Holly and her upyrs will be delighted to discover the unusual background of Lucius the White - the oldest living vampire and his \`out of this world' origins!A chance encounter along the road brought Lucius and his close companion and friend Edmund to meet Lucas Delavert. Delavert's resemblance to Lucius was uncanny, and the chance to assume a mortal identity was a powerful and tempting opportunity - one that seemed beneficial both to the powerful upyr while granting the dying man his last wish and some semblance of peace.In assuming the guise of Lucas, the prosperous local squire, Lucius was the target of the local matchmaking mamas all wishing to capture the elusive squire. It wasn't until he came upon poor and unsuitable Theodora Beckett, on one of his nightly forays, that his natural predator instincts became aroused. Using his powers to thrall, he was treated to an ecstasy with Theo that was unmatched in the centuries that he'd existed. It was hard for him to believe that as the oldest and most powerful living vampire - he had fallen in love. It also became apparent that Theo, seemingly under his thrall, was also in love - but if she discovered \`what' he was, without any mind thralling by Lucius - would she be able to accept what he was or reject him in horror?--- OUCH! This one will positively scorch you! I have absolutely loved Holly's entire compelling upyr series from CATCHING MIDNIGHT to HUNTING MIDNIGHT. Now Ms. Holly is keeping those sensual fires of passion rolling in another totally stand alone entry to the Midnight series with both her trademark steamy erotic sensuality, coupled with an amazing and touching love story of a soul mate who has journeyed the eons of time to recapture an all-consuming love. Additionally, the reader is also treated to a couple of other extremely stimulating romances -- Theo's sister Caroline and the gardener Sheffield; the upyr Edmund and his conquests; and be delighted with the young and precocious five year old Fitz Clare Baron, Percy. This was an awesome and totally satisfying non-stop read from first page to the last.

Emma Holly has managed to make an extremely appealing and unique race of bloodrinkers. They are sexy, sensitive and intelligent. The only problem for them is exactly how long they really live. The sad truth of their lives is that so few beings have the stamina for immortality.The upyr were worried about Lucious. The world seemed to mean nothing to him. He was merely existing with no attachment to the world other than his companion Edmund, a younger upyr. A chance encounter with a dying man on the road leads Lucious to an important turning point. He assumes the identity of this man, and is thrust back into the world of the living where he meets Theo Beckett.Theo was a wonderful female character. She was supporting her family and being a good sister and all the time not really understanding what was missing in her life until she meets Lucious. She has lived her whole life in the shadow of her older, but very loving and supportive sister, Caroline. Theo and Lucious have a series of intimate encounters that force Lucious, out of guilt, to wipe them from her mind. He then resolves to try to win her love like a human man. She ends up thinking that she dreamed the intimacies with him, and is very confused by her feelings about a man that she initially wanted for her sister. There is never any doubt though who he really wants.This was a truly satisfying story. I have said this before, but I really like a story where the two main characters can at least admit to themselves that they want each other. You know there will be difficulties, but the strength of their bond is true."},{"Title":"Courting Midnight (Fitz Clare Chronicles)","review":"Emma Holly has given us yet another wonderful story about the Upyr.She manages to give you the feeling that you are reading a Regency and a paranormal all in one,with some very hot sex scenes.This is very skillfully done,and one of the reasons I find Emma's writing so unique-she has great balance throughout the story while giving you the best of both genres.Good secondary characters that interest you,yet don't steal the show are included as well.There are quite a few laughs to be had as Lucius settles into his new life.Lady Morris,a scheming,vain thing who wishes to see Lucius married to her daughter Lily,is prepared to compete with any rivals,by sly remarks or underhanded tactics.She was amusing and obnoxious,all in one.Theo and Lucius are a wonderful couple,and have enough sizzle to carry the book without seeming like oversexed animals.Overall,this book is a wonderful,well-balanced mix of paranormal and Regency,with enough humor and sex to make it a keeper.If you haven't read Catching Midnight and Hunting Midnight,I recommend those as well-the Upyr series are all wonderful books on their own,but complement each other beautifully."},{"Title":"Courting Midnight (Fitz Clare Chronicles)","review":"This was my first Emma Holly book. I was intrigued by the premise of a vampire masquerading as the prodigal heir, but felt the human characters were not developed enough. The emphasis remained on the two male leads and I was more interested in Theo, her embroidery enterprise, and her family dynamics. The secondary romance between Caroline and the gardener was completely unbelievable as there was no background on how they had met and what attracted them to each other, especially considering that Caroline's character was one of utmost propriety and docility. The entire segment surrounding the ball and the gown Caroline was wearing was a letdown rather than a climactic moment. The sex scenes were actually pretty well written--I usually skip those as I get bored with the same old same old. I've read a lot of books set in the Regency period and this one is adequate but doesn't quite hit the mark in enacting the historical setting. There was very little tension and the pace was too plodding--it needed either more levity and humor or a lot more suspense. All in all, the book did not hold my interest, though I'm willing to try another of her titles."},{"Title":"Courting Midnight (Fitz Clare Chronicles)","review":"But I was disappointed after the third chapter.

She's slightly unusual, I'll give the author credit but I felt like the time and place didn't really come together in this one. It was surface level.

I found it endearing the way Holly immitated Jane Eyre (Sense and Sensibility, I believe or perhaps Pride and Prejudice) and before the reader could become put off by the fact that it was so closely related, she quite covertly referred to Eyre's novel in the text when a character offered a suggestion of reading material to his secret crush.The novel covers two sisters of a poor family but with high standards whose mother is trying to marry them off to a man of substance. The older sister is the most beautiful with a sweet disposition. The younger more outgoing.

The ramifications of his genius are incalculable as the characteristics of much modern music stem from his creativity.Young Beethoven was a court organist at the age of 14, a contemporary of Mozart, and a student of Haydn's. In the isolation of his deafness Beethoven composed some of the greatest works of music the world has ever known.Beethoven Forum is a scholarly, revelatory tribute to a master.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"OPTOMECHATRONICS","review":"Opto-Mechatronics by Hyungsuck Cho (CRC) now includes errata sheet, In recent years, optical technology has been increasingly incorporated into mechatronic technology, and vice versa. The consequence of the technology marriage has led to the evolution of most engineered products, machines, and systems towards high precision, downsizing, multifunctionalities and multicomponents embedded characteristics. This integrated engineering field is termed optomechatronic technology. The technology is the synergistic combination of optical, mechanical, electronic, and computer engineering, and therefore is multidisciplinary in nature, thus requiring the need to view this from somewhat different aspects and through an integrated approach. However, not much systematic effort for nurturing students and engineers has been made in the past by stressing the importance of the multitechnology integration.The goal of this book is for it to enable the reader to learn how the multiple technologies can be integrated to create new and added value and function for the engineering systems under consideration. To facilitate this objective, the material brings together the fundamentals and underlying concepts of this optomechatronic field into one text. The book therefore presents the basic elements of the engineering fields ingredient to optomechatronics, while putting emphasis on the integrated approach. It has several distinct features as a text which make it differ somewhat from most textbooks or monographs in that it attempts to provide the background, definition, and characteristics of optomechatronics as a newly defined, important field of engineering, an integrated view of various disciplines, view of system-oriented approach, and a combined view of macro-micro worlds, the combination of which links to the creative design and manufacture of a wide range of engineering products and systems.To this end a variety of practical system examples adopting optomechatronic principles are illustrated and analyzed with a view to identifying the nature of optomechatronic technology. The subject matter is therefore wide ranging and includes optics, machine vision, fundamental of mechatronics, feedback control, and some application aspects of micro-opto-electromechanical system (MOEMs). With the review of these fundamentals, the book shows how the elements of optical, mechanical, electronic, and microprocessors can be effectively put together to create the fundamental functionalities essential for the realization of optomechatronic technology. Emphasizing the interface between the relevant disciplines involving the integration, it derives a number of basic optomechatronic units. The book then goes on in the final part to deal, from the integrated perspectives, with the details of practical optomechatronic systems composed of and operated by such basic components.The introduction presents some of the motivations and history of the optomechatronic technology by reviewing the technological evolution of optoelectronics and mechatronics. It then describes the definition and fundamental concept of the technology that are derivable from the nature of practical optomechatronic systems.Chapter 2 reviews the fundamentals of optics in some detail. It covers geometric optics and wave optics to provide the basis for the fusion of optics and mechatronics.Chapter 3 treats the overview of machine vision covering fundamentals of image acquisition, image processing, edge detection, and camera calibration. This technology domain is instrumental to generation of optomechatronic technology.Chapter 4 presents basic mechatronic elements such as sensor, signal conditioning, actuators and the fundamental concepts of feedback control. This chapter along with Chapter 2 outlines the essential parts that make optomechatronics possible.Chapter 5 provides basic considerations for the integration of optical, mechanical, and electrical signals, and the concept of basic functional modules that can create optomechatronic integration and the interface for such integration.In Chapter 6, basic optomechatronic functional units that can be generated by integration are treated in detail. The units are very important to the design of optomechatronic devices and systems, since these produce a variety of functionalities such as actuation, sensing, autofocusing, acoustic-optic modulation, scanning and switching visual feedback control.Chapter 7 represents a variety of practical systems of optomechatronic nature that obey the fundamental concept of the optomechatronic integration. Among them are laser printers, atomic force microscopes (AFM), optical storage disks, confocal microscopes, digital micromirror devices (DMD) and visual tracking systems.The main intended audiences of this book are the lower levels of graduate students, academic and industrial researchers. In the case of undergraduate students, it is recommended for the upper level since it covers a variety of disciplines, which, though fundamental, involve various different physical phenomena. On a professional level, this material will be of interest to engineering graduates and research/field engineers who function in interdisciplinary work environments in the fields of design and manufacturing of products, devices, and systems."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"There I am devouring Allende like a large meal, going from book to book, thought to thought, era to era without any regard to continuity or subject. I almost left The Infinite Plan for last but it was next on the pile so I picked it up and as weird as this sounds, enjoyed it more so than all the other novels that kept going on and on in their spinnings through history and drama and characters and relationships.Gregory is a real protagonist, I wasn&#65533;t even sure if I liked him though I knew for sure that he didn&#65533;t even like himself. He seems to meander through life with aims that are less focused than an Allende plot. But this time the meandering works, the sense of simply walking with a character and them telling you there life is really used to its fullest here. Again m review is as a comparison to other Allende books and yet this style, the masculine voice/perception really seemed to come across. What I particularly found provocative, worth the price of admission, if you will was the root of Gregory&#65533;s problems, essentially accepting the company of unhealthy, needy people in his life. He even has an associate in the law firm he owns who regularly tries to commit suicide in the bathroom. Thinking about the characters and their spiraling lives made me think that there is a marked ear for humor, a comedy lost within Allende&#65533;s work. It all becomes this heavy historical missive and borders sometimes on a historical romance novel that is laborious and in love with it&#65533;s own language. To read her in Spanish must be a real treat, an added attraction to her work because I can see how the crossing of historical tapestry can become tiresome.This time though, she strikes the mark in the final analysis of a character and his problems. Not perfect but it comes closer than the others do in fully executing a character. I agree with a previous reviewer that the Vietnam scenes are a little awkward but the awkwardness now strikes me as waiting to be funny, hilarious even but Allende&#65533;s characters tend to be so somber that their laughter is suspect or predatory for something that is about to bring more sorrow.I don&#65533;t recommend this at full price nor do I suggest it as the only Allende novel to be read but it is a nice distraction from her main body of Latin American historical/romance work. It comes as a pleasant off-shoot to the present world and a strong experiment in a writer changing from a feminine focus to masculine."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"Isabel would be able to tell every story, to put a reason in the life of every person. In reading the life of Gregory Reeves, I had the impression that the dreams, hopes and hidden reasons of my life were becoming clear to myself. Reading her books is like telling her your story, and waiting for her to give it a reason and, at the same time, to put poetry in it, to make it worth to be told.In her narration, also the feelings, the pains, the irrational of an existence are put in a rational light. But nonetheless her writing does not loose the poetry of the irrational that she shares with other South-American writers, like Marquez or Amado.I'd say that the secret of her books is really this merging of rational and irrational, the sense and order of feelings and the mysterious poetry of what seems rational."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"Usually when I read a book by Isabelle Allende I am mesmerized and eagerly turning pages waiting for another revelation. In this book I was just bored and disappointed.The main character is the child of a minister whose &quot;Infinite Plan&quot; sounds more like New Age speculation than revival preaching. He is raised in the Barrio where almost every character confirms to the whole Latin Men are sexy but sexist stereotype and when he grows up to be a lawyer, he's a complete creep.I can see that Allende's purpose is to take a likeable character, transform him into a jerk (as he warns you on about page 100 or so) and then slowly bring him back to humanity (there is one line about how he thought he was moving in circles but he was actually moving in spirals - I still remember that one.) but by the time he gets to his resolution, you still don't like him that much. He's been such a self-absorbed yuppie that you want to smack him upside the head a few more times.The rest of the characters are either awful or poorly drawn charactitures. There is the daughter who becomes a drug addict (and the main character realizes that its not his fault that his kid is such a screwup but then again, it kinda is his fault) and there's his best friend from the Barrio who has some strength and you really wish that she was in another book and not hanging out with these losers. There's the father who's mysterious and the sister that's constantly angry. There's also te best friend that is loud and abrasive.Now, this is still an Isabelle Allende book and as an Isabelle Allende book it has some great emotional highs and lows and some memorable scenes. It just isn't as sustained as her masterworks like House of Spirits or Eva Luna.A common complaint among women readers is that men who try to write women characters usually get them wrong. They are either window dressing or so obviously stereotypical as to be surreal. This book seems to be Allende's attempt to write a book from the male perspective. It's a failure, but it's an interesting failure. A better portrayal of the emotional lives of men would either be Fight CLub or High Fidelity (either the movies or the books are great)"},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"It all started a hot summer day here in Taipei. My brother was here on vacation, before he went off to university. I noticed that he wouldn&#65533;t come out of his room for hours while I played on the computer, or watched TV. It was nine pm and he came out of the room with a smile on his face and he held out a book to me. He said\\" you have to read it!\\" with excitement. After a couple days he went off to university and I was left alone. I really hadn&#65533;t payed much attention to the book, but one day I put my mind to it and started reading it. I discovered that the book never stoped unraviling surprises. It was practically impossible to stop reading in middle of a chapter, I had to know what would happen next. I was surprised how the book always had surprises.It was an emotion I had never felt before, reading a book. A sensation that you dont get by reading any other book. This is a book that shows you reality and how real life is, not just some wonderland. Its fiction, history, andventure, sexuality, and other subjects in one book. I'd read for hours until my body was exhausted. When I finished the book I was a little sad because I didnt know what would happen next. I have to say this is the best book I've read in my young life, and probably not the last book I read from this author: Isabel Allende. Id recommend this book to everyone who loves reading."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"I think this is one of Allende's best books and the one that particularly reveals the strength of her insightful power. In a story told with her characteristic artistry, the author opens up not only the depth of a man's soul but also the essence of an era in a portion of the soul of American society. The characters in this story seem sometimes unbelievable, but that is what makes the book great. Each one of them is portrayed with exaggerated traits that make them distinctively symbolic. The fresh and honest perspective from which this story is told reflects the generous view of someone exploring American society with the curiosity of an outsider, and the understanding of a deep believer in the goodness and value of all human beings."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"I have read nearly all of Isabel Allende's books and have loved them. This is the first one that truly disappointed me. It is certainly not representative of her fine writing. It seems disconnected and doesn't flow. I also felt there were too many characters and too much history packed into an average length book."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"An interesting family saga in which the author deals with many social issues - many of which are current today. These include the plight of 'illegal aliens', war, incest, parental skills or lack thereof as well as abandonment.The characters are extremely well done. Much of Greg's(protagonist's) life revolves around Carmen and Olga, who are the most forceful characters in the story. Even the very minor characters, like the white haired granny peddling her services beneath the table, are unforgettable.The author is excellent at descriptions and is frequently very humorous.Much of the book is philosophical. Greg is continually searching for happiness outside of himself. Carmen informs him that \\"every person is born with a talent and happiness depends on discovering that talent in time.\\" (233). On the subject of children, Greg admits that his own children had grown up like savages, without care and without real love but they never lacked for anything material. He concludes that money is a poor substitute for the affection he didn't know how to give. Heavy! And so true.An excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"This is generally well-written, but Allende made the characters represent too much of their entire culture, and so they are not very believable. The book drags because you don't care about the people. Caucasion American characters are greedy, lazy, immoral with no family values. Latinos are simple, traditional, their lives depend on the strength of the family. Asians are quiet, smart, unemotional. I was definitely disappointed in this book. In addition, her portrayal of American culture during the Vietnam era and the '70's is cliche. The book really loses its allure halfway through when the uninteresting, 2 dimensional characters are described in a poorly written stereotypical setting. I expected more from Allende."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"I picked this up from the library shelf on a whim, having read and loved \\"Daughter of Fortune\\" and other Allende books.

It was okay, but her other books are better."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"Isabel Allende's The Infinite Plan is a well developed novel that explores themes such as identity, race, and belonging. The novel follows the life of Gregory Reeves from childhood to adulthood. Throughout the novel, Gregory must confront the stages of life that everyone undergoes. There are losses but there are also triumphs. From a very early age, Gregory must learn the reality of life. Gregory must learn that there is always a time to settle down. He learns that life can not be a constant adventure as his father, a self-styled preacher and artist, portrayed it to be traveling and moving his family constantly. Gregory always felt his father was a modern day hero saving people from their meaningless lives infusing them with hope. However, when Gregory's father becomes ill and the family finally settles down Gregory begins to lose not only his father but his sense of where in life he belongs.Gregory's slowly loses respect for his father as he becomes disillusioned with life. Most of Gregory's faltering relationships including with his mother and sister show his instability in life. He is unsure about who he is and what he wants to become. For example, Gregory's relationship with his mother is virtually nonexistent as Gregory explains, \\"All that tied me to my mother were literature and school notebooks, music, and love for observing the stars. She never touched me; I had grown accustomed to her physical remoteness and reserved temperament\\"(54). Clearly, Gregory is left searching for love and acceptance even in his relationship with his mother. He is on a journey looking for who he belongs with and exactly where it is that he belongs. Gregory was fortunate to enjoy a strong, loving bond with his sister for many years but as soon as they settled down in the barrio their relationship came to a halt. Judy, Gregory's sister, tells him \\"that the stories, the dreams, and all the rest were over, and that [he] was too big for such nonsense\\" (55). Essentially, Gregory is alone in the world without immediate family and must learn to fend for himself.Additionally, he is immersed into an environment in which he knows little about. His family settles down in a Latin barrio in Los Angeles, California. A new life begins for Gregory as he attends school for the first time. He is introduced to gangs, sex, drugs, books and ideas. However, the biggest challenge is that he must learn a new language and a new culture. Gregory slowly learns the street smarts he needs to survive but he loses sense of who he truly is. The rest of his life is a pursuit of finding where he is supposed to belong. He looks for love in all the wrong places, becomes a drunk, neglects his children, and spends a good part of his life searching for his true self. It is not until Gregory goes back to his roots that he is finally able to find who he is and where he belongs in life.Allende's novel is truly an awe inspiring novel. Isabel has been able to teach so much about life and the importance of relationships, identity, and belonging. Allende combines her knowledge of Latin and American culture to create a realistic world. Her characters show the complexity of life and the utter chaos that comes of trying to break barriers."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"I enjoyed the book and found it an easy and fast read. It is a story about human nature, the need to find one's place and the journey through life. The characters do reflect the normal up and down emotions that we go through in life, but the characters are not necessarily always believable as a whole. For example, would the male leader of a latin barrio in LA be a follower of the made up religion of &quot;The Infinite Plan&quot;? Probably not. All the main characters seem so &quot;extraordinary&quot;; even the adopted nephew of Carmen is a math genius. The coincidences that occur to the characters in the book are even more unbelievable. So, if you want a good story, if not a necessarily believable one, then read the book. If, however, you like to read fiction that &quot;could have happened&quot;, then pass."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"After finishing \\"The Infinite Plan\\" I felt that the title of the novel suits it very well. It's a deep and thoughtful story about a man's search for acceptance throughout a challenging and complicated life. The book flip-flops between the first-person and the third-person voices, painting a portrait of Gregory Reeves. Gregory is the son of an itinerant preacher, cuts his teeth in the LA barrio, serves in Vietnam, and becomes a lawyer with a very troubled family life in San Francisco.The book takes some work to get through. It's not slow, but it takes a long time to get to know the characters. Even at the end, the protagonist seems very distant and hard to relate to. Perhaps it's because he's a stereotype of so many different personalities and I became confused about who he's supposed to be. That happens with me sometimes. The other characters were hit-and-miss. Carmen is great (until that strange episode at the very end), whereas Gregory's wives and other friends float by like ghosts, never saying anything of substance nor making much of an impression.The cover of my book trumpets \\"International Bestseller\\" at the top. I'm not sure what standard that's based on. Sure, the book is generally a good read and tells an interesting story. But it's also a bit muddled and confusing. I suspect that the author's other works may have come across better in translation."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"I have received and am looking forward to reading it. Haven't read it yet, but, am glad, I bought it.Anne Stickles"},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"This is the first novel I have read by Isabel Allende, so perhaps it is not a good example of her best work. But I was not impressed, and I think any comparison to the passionately human and verbally gifted Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a stretch. One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera rival, although also in translation, Shakespeare's lush language and originality of character. Each is the literary equivalent of a Montezuman banquet.The main point of view, or focus of narration, in this novel is that of the omniscient author, and occasional first-person narration through the voice of the main character. Her style in this work has been described as journalistic, and she does write like a reporter, or biographer, hitting the high spots of a very large story without using functional imagery and dialogue to pull you inexorably into a scene. I did not enter into the kind of imaginative experience that only a really good writer can create. Not that there is necessarily something wrong with the omniscient author point of view --it just takes a talent that is truly \\"omniscient\\" in the literary sense. Otherwise you get pasteboard characters and gratuitous events.Allende has been credited with the use of \\"magical realism,\\" a technique of rendering impossible events with such verve and clarity that the reader wants to believe them, and does. Olga, the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; spiritualist and healer, is portrayed with charming, florid excess, and was for me a truly interesting character; but here again, the \`magic\\" does not compare with that in Marquez, or in Louise Erdrich's The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse.My last criticism is possibly a criticism of what the American reading public demands in a novel. The main character, his best friend, their colleagues, female acquaintances, and so on seem to want me to believe that today, when a man meets a woman, they do not shake hands and engage in exploratory small talk, but look immediately for the nearest bed, or car seat, or warehouse bench. Sex is a good thing, but love is more, and the real people I know do not emulate (thank God!) the lustful couplings of lions on the Serengeti.Allende's books are widely read in several languages. I think by now, you the reader should know whether to rush out and buy this novel --or be thankful you haven't."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"This was the first Isabel Allende novel that I read years ago, and I have been a fan of hers ever since. On a recent episode of CSI; Miami, a jailed man was smuggling something, I can't remember what, in a book and The Infinite Plan was the book. I always thought a few of the characters in this novel were believable, like these people existed somewhere and if you read her latest, the memoir, The Sum of Our Days\\", you will have a different take on The Infinite Plan."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"Gregory Reeves goes through some stuff.Growing up in the East Los Angeles barrio, his mother a Russian immigrant and his father an itinerant preacher (of sorts), Gregory proves himself by racing his nemesis, a bully named Martinez, across the railroad tracks in front of an oncoming train. Martinez doesn't make it across.Then he goes to Viet Nam, where he narrowly escapes death. He returns to the Bay Area, finishes law school, and becomes an attorney.He marries young, but not happily, and divorces right away. He marries a second time, to his beautiful secretary, but after giving birth to a boy, she changes her mind, leaving him with the child.Gregory's two children are both wayward, but his daughter more so: she turns into a teenage hooker and drug addict.Gregory makes a pile of money but always seems to be in debt, because of his costly tastes and his support payments to the ex-wives and children.Finally, toward the end of the book, he is sued for malpractice and loses. He has no malpractice insurance and it looks like he has \\"hit bottom.\\" But instead of giving up, he keeps on trying, by more or less resigning from the rat race. His friends lend or give him money to get back up, and he continues, we assume, practicing law but in a more relaxed atmosphere.There are a great many interesting subsidiary characters in this book, but the next most prominent to Gregory Reeves is probably Carmen Morales, aka Tamar, Gregory's childhood girlfriend from East Los Angeles.Her story more or less interweaves with Gregory's throughout the book, although Gregory is the only character to speak in the first person, from time to time. We find out on the final page of the book that Gregory is dictating his story to someone.So what is the Infinite Plan after all? Well, the idea emanated with Gregory's father, who seems to have made it up himself or maybe had a revelation, and it has to do with an Afterlife, and living on earth in accord with the Afterlife, the Infinite Plan encompassing both.I don't know that there was really an Infinite Plan in the way these people weave in and out of each other's lives, but that's probably Sra. Allende's point: there is no Plan.I had the pleasure of reading this book in Spanish, although some of the vocabulary did escape me. It was to Sra. Allende's Infinite Credit that her Spanish is so clear that someone like me, just a learner, could understand most of it and get the gist of the story.This is one of Allende's only books that take place in the United States, and it really is amazing how she learned everything that was going on during the 1960s and 1970s around Los Angeles and Berkeley and San Francisco, as well as Viet Nam. Either she is a very experienced person or she had some good informants. I am limited in knowing little of her biography, but I intend to learn more.The only thing that some readers may not enjoy about Allende's style is that she tends to write with lengthy and involved paragraphs, with very little conversation. If you're used to James Patterson or some of the other American writers who give us short little chapters with lots of dialogue, you may find Allende's writing too heavy.But it's worth the effort. I recommend it. Diximus."},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","review":"This is the first Isabel Allende book I've read, and it certainly won't be the last.

Life stories repeat themselves over and over with few variations Olga, the midwife, healer, and fortune teller, learned. The family consisted of Charles, husband and father, and doctor in divine sciences, his wife Nora, and the children, Gregory and Judy Reeves, and friend and courtesy aunt Olga. Charles Reeves was a man ahead of his time. About a year after Hiroshima--Hiroshima caused Nora to lose faith in humanity--Charles was hospitalized for stomach cancer and the family camped in Los Angeles with the hospitable Morales family, Mexicans. Judy and Gregory were taught Spanish by the Morales children, and for the first time attended school. When Charles was released from the hospital, the Reeves family bought a small shack at the edge of the barrio. The priest taught Gregory to box and in turn he had to serve as an altar boy. Olga moved to a place of her own.Charles's death disrupted the family and since Nora's habit of dependence was deeply rooted she began to live in a daze. Both children thought of her indolence as a sickness of the spirit. The Morales house became Gregory's true home. When Gregory left the city thirteen years later, he was homesick for the Morales family. He was a shoeshine boy and a rabid movie watcher. Gregory started to steal and his mother unsuccessfully tried to place him in an orphanage and in an adoptive home to save him from a life of crime. Then she said to him to just grow up.He was raped by a gang leader. He and Carmen Morales developed an act of juggling, playing the harmonica, and tricks by his pet dog. The more posh the setting, the greater the rewards for the troupe. Gregory had been encouraged by his father to pursue education. He did well in high school. He developed a friendship with an employee at the public library who could direct his reading. The gang leader died in a contest with him called race the train. This defeat of Martinez traveled around the school and bolstered Gregory's reputation. Following high school, Gregory held a number of menial and factory jobs. On one he injured his leg. The man from the library died and gave him eight hundred dollars to go to college.He went to Berkeley. As a result of his upbringing he had a chicano accent. He went to law school in San Francisco. Before completing his legal studies he married and the couple had a daughter. They separated, however, and just after he took his bar exams he left for service in the army. Reeves saved the lives of eleven men. In the middle of a combat zone he taught villagers English. He was sick and was sent to Hawaii for tests. Gregory returned home from the war around the same time his childhood friend Carmen Morales moved to Berkeley. Carmen worked for two of Gregory's friends at a restaurant. Gregory was intimicated by the idea of seeing Carmen again. He confessed to her his desire to become a wealthy and successful lawyer.Carmen Morales adopted her dead brother's half Vietnamese son. Gregory remarried. His sister found happiness with her third husband and her children. Gregory separated from his wife and attained custody by default of his difficult four year old son David. After substantial turmoil a housekeeper settles the son. Gregory is nearly upturned by a malpractice claim, but his friend Carmen Morales who has become a successful business person rescues himThis is a superb book.

In the latest release from C. Kelly Robinson, titled The One That Got Away (TOTGA) the girl that got away is Serena Kincaid and the guy that is still pining for her is Tony Gooden. More than ten years have lapsed, since Tony crashed Serena's wedding to her current husband, Jamie. Fast forward a decade later and a not so accidental encounter at a friends wedding, which brings the two face to face where old memories, wounds, heartbreaks, and feelings are revisited-as well as the reason for why their paths had not crossed in all those years. But when Tony survives an untimely accident, his priorities change, and he realizes that tomorrow is not guaranteed and some people are worth taking a chance with. There are just a few roadblocks-Serena's married, dealing with a rebellious teen, and she lives in another city. Is she willing to give up what she has accomplished in the last 10 years to be with someone that dissed her a decade ago?Robinson explores marriage, relationships, love, children and inner emotions in his latest novel. TOTGA depicts the struggles that many individuals experience in the game of love and relationships. Robinson gives us mature characters who are forced to make some tough decisions. Decisions that not only affect them but that will ultimately impact loved ones as well. We witness and feel the pain of the main characters as they make decisions with their hearts rather than their heads. Robinson delivers a conscious twisting story about love and lust between Serena and Jason and forces us to assess whether or not two individuals can go back to a love that previously existed without repercussions.While TOTGA covers typical territory (it is primarily a relationship novel), Robinson does introduce unexpected plots twists and turns. Additionally, secondary characters are skillfully developed and their stories are integral to the primary storyline. TOTGA was an entertaining and engaging read, however, I wanted more back story regarding the primary characters; serious character flaws were alluded to for both but they were never really fleshed out. That aside, Robinson's writing was captivating enough to keep me reading this book and I was able to finish it in one sitting. Nice story for a clear, mild autumn day.Reviewed by YasminAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"The One That Got Away","review":"Oh my!

When her beloved teacer played the flute it seemed like the music washed away the coal dust that covered everything like a smothering blanket, leaving her feeling clean and fresh. Mr. Stuart hasn't been the same since his flute disppeared. Never well, he seems to be fading before their eyes.Maggie with the help of Summer, her best friend, who is dying of a wasting disease, conceives a plan. As the entire population of Skingle Creek work to surprise their beloved teacher, they come together in a way that breaks down all barriers. It's almost like God is smiling on Skingle Creek, but will it be enough to save Mr. Stuart?The characters in A Distant Music are as real as the people in my own community. It's a story of love and courage, as people beaten down by the misery of defeat learn to rejoice again. Most of all, it is a reminder of God's wonderful gift of hope and the difference it makes in our lives.

I despaired. I regained hope. A Distant Music inspires me to live life well no matter what my circumstances.The story is about twelve-year-old Maggie MacAuley and her struggles with friendship, loyalty and hope. Living in a small Kentucky mining community during 1892, there is no money and little to dream of for the future. Families are stuck in the cycle of poverty--children grow up and follow their parents' footsteps. Maggie's story is to be no different. Regardless of the circumstances, love and hope run deeper still. Many people influence Maggie's life:-- Summer, her best friend who is sickly yet gives of herself beyond all expectations,-- Jonathan Stuart, town teacher and mentor, who teaches her about faith in God-- Matthew MacAuley, her father who learns how to show love-- Kenny Tallman, son of the owner of the town mine, Maggie's protector and classmate.In the face of poverty, sickness, death, threats from two town bullies, and the theft of her teacher's prized flute, Maggie learns to have faith and hope in God regardless of circumstances.Armchair Interviews says: In A Distance Music, miracles do happen but in unexpected ways."},{"Title":"A Distant Music (The Mountain Song Legacy #1)","review":"After reading American Anthem and Song of Erin, both excellent books and very well written, I read this series next.

Hoff novel guarantees that you will be transported into another time filled with captivating characters. Book #1 of the new Mountain Song Legacy series, A DISTANT MUSIC, is no exception.Ever since the publication of her novella, THE PENNY WHISTLE, readers have asked B.J. for more of the story. With A DISTANT MUSIC, B.J. delivers the first installment, and it's a novel that will tug at your heart and fill you with hope.Skingle Creek in the late 1800's is a small coal mining community whose inhabitants have little of the \`extras' in life. But it is also a community where people genuinely care for one another and are willing to sacrifice what little they have to help those in need.It comes as little surprise then when Maggie MacAuley turns to those around her in a desperate attempt to save their schoolteacher, Jonathan Stuart. Ever since Mr. Stuart's flute has gone missing, he has grown sicker and weaker by the day. With the help of her classmates, Maggie hatches a plan to bring music back into their teacher's life, and hopefully renew his strength. But will the desperate plight of Widow Hunnicutt and the Crawford family put an end to Maggie's plan?It seems to Maggie that God has lost interest in the good people around her. Not only is her teacher fading away, but her best friend, the ailing Summer Rankin, is also waning by the day, spending more time in bed than at school. Then there is the matter of Kenny Tallman and the class bullies. In Kenny's attempt to save Maggie from a beating, Kenny puts up with the abuse from the bullies and swears Maggie to secrecy. But just how long will his heroism continue to protect her?Maggie struggles to understand how God can know about everything and care about it all when those around her struggle with ill health, hunger, and bullies. How can a loving God let bad things happen to good people?B.J. Hoff's gift of bringing characters to life shines in A DISTANT MUSIC. I found myself drawn into Maggie MacAuley's troubles and shed more than a tear or two with her.A DISTANT MUSIC is an enchanting read that touches the heart. Once more B.J. proves that when it comes to the historical voice, she is the master. B.J. tells us that this is the just the beginning, with more to come.

The characters are still very much alive in my mind.A one-room schoolteacher in a small coalmine town, Jonathan Stuart, must work to educate the children amidst despair and poverty. It seems to Maggie, his prize student, that even he has given up hope, for he has lost his joy in the music he used to play. This is a story about how a young girl and her friends seek to restore that hope, despite their dire circumstances.Not only are the characters remarkable, but BJ also included some major plot twists and suspenseful scenes that kept me turning pages.My favorite quote from the book: \\"All I really know for certain is that on that night, God showed me that hope is, above all else, a gift--His gift. A gift that in reality has nothing at all to do with one's circumstances, but everything to do with His love. His love...and our willingness to trust that love. That's what hope is: the music of the heart. The music of life.\\" This is just a taste of her beautiful prose.This is the first book I've read of hers, but I definitely plan to read her others, especially the ones in the Mountain Legacy Series.

She is a wonderful story teller."},{"Title":"A Distant Music (The Mountain Song Legacy #1)","review":"Reviewed by Kim Peterson for Reader Views (9/06)In Skingle Creek, Kentucky, hope feels nonexistent for residents of this typical 1892 coal mining town. Gifted teacher, Jonathan Stuart, brings unexpected beauty to their coal-dust covered lives with his storytelling and music. Then, someone steals Jonathan's flute and with it the ailing teacher's will to keep going. Most of his students come from mining families who barely eke out a living, yet, surely none of them would take his music from him. The possibility of someone he knows being involved in the theft adds to his grief.Twelve-year-old Maggie MacAuley notices the frailness and sadness of her teacher and wonders how she can help. She collaborates with her best friend, Summer, and enlists the aid of her fellow students to raise the money to replace Mr. Stuart's flute. But in a town where survival has become the main focus, the girls experience difficulty motivating the town's people to pull together. Kindness and concern for others matter to them, but those emotions lie buried under their struggle just to survive.Maggie hates to see her neighbors suffer and she wrestles with her own troubles. The hardships Maggie faces--Summer's illness, the teacher's weakness, two malicious bullies, and a needy family--drain her hope and her faith. Maggie puzzles on how God can know the needs of these people and seem to do nothing about healing or providing for His children. She tries to comfort Summer, but her friend often encourages Maggie instead. Then God uses Maggie, Summer, and the other children of Skingle Creek to impart a miracle. He touches the hearts of a few good men, including Maggie's father. Through the children's efforts, God reminds these men that loving and caring for others is part of His greatest commandment.Hoff's touching story in \\"The Mountain Song Legacy\\" series will appeal to teens and adults. Although the tale in \\"A Distant Music\\" takes place more than a hundred years ago, readers will relate to the power of friendship and goodness when life beats you down. Reading about Maggie and her family reminded me that God often works in unexpected ways. Faith, hope and love really do overcome difficulties and even tragedy.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"A Distant Music (The Mountain Song Legacy #1)","review":"In the winter of 1892, someone stole the teacher'ssilver flute.

Teresa Lewis, the cousin of the family he has made his mission to terrorize. Although when he awakens he has no idea who he is and he is suffering from temporary blindness. He forms an attachment to the kind and loving Teresa, who by the way is a Nurse. She reads to him, ironically, about the black history of the Tuskegee Airmen which she is researching for a books she is writting. She doesn't know who he is either and of course she hopes that he isn't the man who looks angry on his DMV license, or the man who has the \\"White Power, White race\\" card in his wallet. At time I thought it was funny, and wondered how Ms. Starr was going to get this family to forgive this man, how Teresa was going to feel when he got his memory back, which he does. In the end he does the right thing. Though I thought it was so funny that he falls in love with a black woman and a member of the family he has treated so awfully.

TJ has amnesia, badly burned and has lost his eye sight. The couple is stranded in the mountains due to a late season snow storm.

This last offering was a bit far-fetched to me, but then again, that's what makes it so \\"ironic.\\" I loved it, although it could have had a bit more descriptive lovemaking scenes in it.My only real pet peeve was not with the book or Ms. Starr's exceptional writing. It was with the TIMING of the releases!!! I bought Fate (Book 1) when it was first released in 2001 (and had no idea it was the first in a series). I really had to struggle to remember Vanessa & Scott's story and TJ's involvement.My suggestion---buy all of the books in the series or read several within the same time frame. That way you won't have to wrack your brains trying to remember. The book (Ironic) did briefly cover some of things that happened to former main characters in the previous books, but not enough for me---they remained a distant memory for me.

Well, just ask Travis Labranch, Jr. Here's his story...Determined to prevent his cousin from making the worse mistake of her life by marrying someone outside of her race, TJ (Travis) quickly hopped on a plane to his cousin's house. Before he could make it to his destination, TJ crashed his plane while flying through a massive snow storm somewhere in the Smoking Mountains. After being unconscious for an unknown amount of time TJ awakened to an injured body, temporary blindness and no recollection of who he was. The only thing that saved his sanity was the sweet, alluring voice of Teresa, his caretaker, as she read to him each night. During his recovery, Trey (the name Teresa used) and Teresa fell in love and planned on building a life together. But then, Trey began to experience terrible, cruel memories from his racist past that involved his continuous harassment of Teresa's family.Will Trey be able to maintain a hold on Teresa's love and win over her family by proving that he is now a changed man and he is no longer the bigot that he used to be?With Ironic Pamela Leigh Starr has written an unthinkable, dramatic conclusion to her Love Found saga. The one person who wrenched so much havoc to various members of the Lewis family, because of his chauvinistic hatred, has now found himself caught up in the rapture of love with an African American woman who just happens to be a Lewis. Now, how ironic is that! As much as I hated Travis' evil, prejudiced ways during the first three novels, I can truly say that he successfully redeemed himself in my eyes and it was easier to see him as a new, likable person (Trey) in Ironic. It is simply amazing what the power of love can do to a person. As a couple, Teresa and Trey compliment each other very well. As Ironic progressed, I witnessed the growth of their friendship and the depth of their love for each other. Overall, I was greatly pleased with how Ms. Starr managed to craft a wonderful romantic ending to such a superb series.

Once again the strength of family helps the Fortunes."},{"Title":"Heiress and the Sheriff (The Fortunes of Texas)","review":"I picked this book up at a local store because the cover and title intriqued me last Friday. Sat down on the couch that afternoon and started reading and finished it that night. Thoughly enjoyed the story of the distrustful of women Sheriff Wyatt Grayhawk and the amnesia victim Gabrielle. I did not realize until near the end of the book that this was one of the 12 books in the Fortunes of Texas Series. Characters from these books are interwoved in this book and since I enjoyed &quot;The Heiress and the Sheriff&quot; so much I ordered the other eleven books so I can read about the other &quot;Fortune&quot; characters. Well worth the time I spent reading it instead of doing house work, also had a balony sandwich for dinner so I could eat in one hand and hold the book in the other to read. Cannot wait until the other books to arrive to read more about these great characters."},{"Title":"Xanadu : The Computerized Home of Tomorrow and How It Can Be Yours Today","review":"This fine book is an invitation to dream about a New World, a peace time, with concerns only to better living standards, healthy leisure, a home for a higher level of humankind.It is now only a dream, since this amazing project was abandoned and is empty now, like all those dreams of a better, safer, nicier World.

I had a chance to take a bunch of pictures right before they tore it down in 2006. It's a real shame that brilliant contributions to architecture and design are destroyed by narrow visioned property owners. The same thing happened to Frank Lloyd Wright and several of his buildings were torn down (then rebuilt). Xanadu the book captures the golden era of this attraction. And even though the attraction itself was limited by the budget available to it at the time - the inpiration and execution was genius. You can still see the sign on Hwy. 192. Obviously the owners didn't want to use the property for additional development but only to destroy the building itself instead of preserviing it and turning it into something else.

LORD STATES PROOF OF FACTS AND IS TRUSTWORTHY."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Walter Lord's &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; is the first full text on the subject of the Titanic that I've ever read. I must say that for a first reference, it was spellbinding and literally I could not put this book down until I finished it. Mr. Lord's detailed narrative allows the reader to feel that the he or she is actually on that ill fated ship. The description of the events are so vivid that one can clearly picture the demise of the grand vessel. What is most striking to me is the apparent authenticity of the data that was known at the time of the writing of this volume. Mr. Lord writes clearly and from a standpoint of firmness which lends an incredible air of authenticity. Gladly missing from this work are the mindless theories that permeate throughout a majority of Titanic literature. Just a factual and as comprehensive, as much as the data can be verified, treatise on what actually happened on that terrible April night in 1912. Of note in this work are the whereabouts and status of the other ships in the area. Most references that I've read mention very little of the California and Carpathia just after the first distress messages were sent. Mr. Lord provides greater insight as to what these ships were doing and their eventual actions by their captains. The descriptions and actions of the principle players were mentioned in greater detail than in other references. Captain Smith was described as active by Mr. Lord which is probably the demeanor that should have been assumed by the captain of a ship rather than the passive, bewildered automaton mentioned in other works. Other persons were alluded to also that have failed to be mentioned in other works. These people, famous and not so famous, all made up the crew and passengers of the Titanic. What they did and said during this tragic event speaks greatly of the human penchant for survival, sacrifice, bravery, stupidity and what Mr. Lord has aptly demonstrated is that this was a human tragedy of monumental proportions. Mr. Lord has also captured the mind set of the people of that time. People did think differently back then as was interestingly described when a third cabin passenger broke an item belonging to the ship, which in turn belonged to the White Star Line, and was threatened with possible arrest from one of the stewards when they would eventually get to New York City. How amazing this is in light of the situation at hand. What were people thinking? And what were some of the crew thinking when they would not allow some of the third cabin passengers onto the upper decks? Most chilling is the mentioning, in the forward, of Morgan Robertson's fictional 1898 tale of a similarly fated vessel. A profound prologue for this subject and a bit hair-raising to know that so many features mentioned in his the story were part of the real story. This is a must reading for all those concerned with the subject of the Titanic. If a first book on the subject should be read, this is it."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I THINK THE TITANIC WAS AN ABSOLUTLY AMAZING SHIP! I LOVED THE MOVIE SO MUCH,I'M DIEING TO SEE IT AGIAN!!!! I LOVE LEONARDO DICAPRIO!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I admit it. I caught the Titanic wave when the movie came out. I was intrigued by the story of the huge boat sinking in the middle of nowhere and 1500 people freezing and drowing to death on a boat that splits in half sinking to the ocean depths. Its a little better than the nightly news. Walter Lord, authority on the Titanic chronology sets out a most detailed account of the sinking, from the maiden voyage to the sinking, each accounted for on the clock. The book was full of facts, however, I felt it was dry most of the time. I am not arguing the author, just his writing. I am not all together interested in every member of the crew, nor every passenger. Least of all am I worried about every little detail or account. The appendix has a complete listing of every member on board of the ship, who died and who survived. The story overall is the same and fascinating still. The inability to answer the question of &quot;why did no one respond?&quot; still remains even though we know the whole story. Certainly the best account on the Titanics chronology available to date."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"it needed more first hand accounts and was boring"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Quite a perfunctory account, lacking in any effort to provide historical context and bring life to the characters involved. I was looking for the whole story of the tragedy in the context of the times, and with good reporting on the background and motives of the ship's developers, owners, and staff, as well as the key players among the passengers. I picked the wrong book for that."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Major ConflictThe biggest conflict in the book was that the Titanic was considered unsinkable by \\"Shipbuilder Magazine\\" and many other people and sources. One of the officers even said \\"Even God himself could not sink this ship.\\" So everybody was positive that the boat could not sink, because of this they were unprepared if the ship did sink. One example of them not being prepared is the lifeboats. There were sixteen life boats on the Titanic, all together the life boats could hold 1,178 people, on that Sunday night there were 2,207 people onboard the Titanic.Character ComparisonTobias McIvey(from Land Remembered) and Captain Smith could help each other. One way is Captain Smith has a boat so Tobias could ride up the Kissimmee River to trade. Captain Smith thinks everything will be ok, like Tobias, but Captain Smith knows when something is not right or when he shouldn't do something. I think these two people would get along because Tobias is a very nice person and I think the relationship between them would be a lot like Tobias and Skillet's (former slave from Land Remembered) relationship.Jacket BlurbThe author did fantastic job on writing this book. He had referred to sources like magazines that had considered the ship unsinkable and he had many quotes from the crew and passengers aboard the ship. One of my favorites is when someone asked if the ship was really unsinkable one of the crew members said \\"Even God himself could not sink this ship\\". He also told the reader just about everything that happened even down to when they shot the flares up and how many lifeboats there were and how many people they could hold. Another thing the author put in the book was a labeled map and timeline of the ship. This was very helpful because he talks about certain thing that happen in specific rooms so it helps you see exactly what flooded first and when they flooded.RecommendationWould I recommend this book to others? Yes and no. Yes because it is extremely vivid. No because I found it hard to get interested in the book. I think one of the problems for me was that it seemed like more of a list. A list of like what people wore and what people did. Almost as if it was too vivid or had too much description. Someone who would like this book is someone who likes history or someone who enjoys reading about history.Theme ApplicationOne theme of this book is that the crew did not prepare the boat for the correct amount of people going on the Titanic's maiden voyage. One example of this is that they only brought enough life boats for 1,178 people. Considering that there were 2,207 people on the Titanic's trip. There were obviously not enough life boats for all guests on the ship. One reason they did not bring enough life boats was because everybody insisted that the ship was unsinkable. Something I have learned from this situation is to always bring enough or more than needed. Also to never say never and always expect the unexpected."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"You can watch a lot of documentaries about this event, but this book is really a gold standard, and I felt very much more closely connected to the people on board and what was going on.

Expected it to have a bit more detail and last a bit longer."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I read this book a long time ago & now that I know more about Titanic, it was even better. It tell a lot about what happened that night & how things went. If you are interested in Titanic, this is an excellent book to read."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Some authors skillfully put a human face on nearly unimaginable tragedy, to help you feel the helplessness and engage you in the terror of an event distant, not to mention often too huge to grasp on an individual, emotional level. Certainly, John Hersey is such an author andHiroshimaimparts the overwhelming human horror of sudden, total destruction. Walter Lord and his A NIGHT TO REMEMBER does the same for the sinking of the Titanic, a disaster now over 100 years distant yet still vivid in the minds of people thanks to the exploratory work of Dr. Robert Ballard, the dramatization and technical skills of director James Cameron, and especially to Walter Lord. Much of what you'll read in A NIGHT TO REMEMBER will strike you as familiar. Justly and understandably, as Lord's book still serves as the go-to narrative of the catastrophe.Yes, we know more facts about the Titanic and the circumstances of that fateful night and morning of April 14 and 15, 1912. What we don't know more of and what Lord supplies in full measure, better than anyone has, is the humanity of the event. What will strike you most are the individual stories, stories repeated in various media as a result of Lord's extensive and impressive research. Consider that Lord published A NIGHT TO REMEMBER in 1955, only 43 years after the Titanic went down. In the early 50s, the younger survivors were not yet 50, while some of the older and hardier even then lived. Primary research doesn't get any more first-hand than these recollections, cross checked and verified for veracity as much as possible by the author. You know many of them, though perhaps not the source, because they are legend. To cite one of the most famous, something you're sure to recall from Cameron'sTitanic (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / Digital Copy), the baker who perches on the stern railing of the plummeting vessel. He was Chief Baker Charles Joughin. Awakened by the collision, he gathered his bakers, who under his direction provisioned the lifeboats with loaves of bread. That task accomplished, he helped load the lifeboats. He also fortified himself with a bottle of whiskey kept in his room. Later, he pitched deck chairs into the ocean to serve as rafts. At the end, he held on to the final moment, slipping from his stern roost into the water as the Titanic disappeared into the deep. Then he swam in freezing water for his life, and he survived.But Lord's telling is more than a dramatic reportage of the tragedy. For he, as a fine historian, illustrates how the ship and the sinking functioned as a dividing line between the old British class system and a newer, somewhat more egalitarian society, with the middle class at its heart. You can read histories describing the transition, but none bring it home as dramatically as Lord's book. (For a novelistic treatment of this change from someone who experienced it, try Vita Sackville-West'sThe Edwardians (Virago Modern Classics).) As Lord summarized the impact of the Titanic on this historical process: \\"If this supreme achievement was so terribly fragile, what about everything else? If wealth meant so little on this cold April night, did it mean so much the rest of the year?\\" Questions you might find as pertinent today in light of financial events of recent times.Even if you read A NIGHT TO REMEMBER long ago as a youth, or you think it must be old and musty and out of date, pick up a copy and discover how in the hands of a top-flight historian and writer history can live and take on the cloak of humanness. Highly recommended to all."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I am surprised how much I enjoyed reading this book considering the somber subject. The story of the Titanic is fascinating and tragic, but this book manages to to tell it with heart.

It is a story of the lives lost and saved that horrible night. Recommend."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"My all-time favorite non-fiction read....a book I read as a child and then reread later as an adult. There has never been a more definitive book retelling the minute-by-minute events that happened when the TITANIC, the \\"ship of dreams\\", went to the bottom of the ocean on her maiden voyage that fateful night on April 15, 1912. When Walter Lord wrote \\"A Night to Remember\\" in the mid-1950's it quickly became one of the biggest international best sellers of that decade. There were still hundreds of TITANIC survivors still alive at the time and he interviewed personally a great many of them; 1st, 2nd, & 3rd class passengers and officers and crew who offered detailed descriptions of what they experienced, including officers on the rescue ship CARPATHIA and those officers aboard the steamer ship CALIFORNIA that laid motionless in the sea so close to the TITANIC that night that they could clearly see her deck lights, yet the rescue rockets bursting into the night sky and Morse lamp signals for help went unanswered. Every quote in the book is exactly how some survivor recalled them being spoken. And the 20th Century Fox motion picture of the same title that followed on the heels of the book's release remained true to the book...authentic and precise with no fictional characters added. \\"A Night to Remember\\" will grab you from page one and you won't want to put the book down!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book has great facts and makes you feel like you are experiencing the Titanic.

Walter Lord done an excellent job researching the Titanic and the events leading up to the disaster. As a maritime historian, I have found A Night to Remember and The Night lives on to be very good books.Most people are unaware of how long it took Walter Lord to write A Night to Remember. It took him 20 years to complete his research and the book is considered to be historically accurate.Walter Lord paved the path for historian to research Titanic.

It takes place on board the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean. On board the Titanic there were three classes of people,there was third class,second class,and first class. The passengers were fighting for there lifes when the Titanic hit an iceberg in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. People were acting crazy just to get in a lifeboat. They let women and children go first since there was not enough lifeboats for all the people aboard the Titanic. Men had to wait and see if there was room so they could go. One guy gave his lifejacket to his wifes maid. Overall I really liked the book.I think people who like stuff about the Titanic would really like this book. I also think people who just like reading about history would also like the book. And I think people who just want to pick up a book and read it would like the book. I really enjoyed reading the book, A Night To Remember."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This 1955 book has become something of a classic in Titanic literature, and it's easy to see why. The author does a great job of collecting the survivors' own stories and knitting them together into a logic and reasonable story of what happened and when, and who did what. If you are interested in the sinking of the Titanic, then you really must get this book!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is the DEFINITIVE account of the Titanic disaster. Do not read ANYTHING else until you've read this first. And then, you need not read anything else. No other account will fulfill and inform you as much as A Night To Remember will. Walter Lord is a master storyteller, without undue drama or sensationalism, he tells the story with chronology and facts, yet it is absolutely RIVETING. The facts are all you need. The way he tells the story, you feel like you are THERE, on the Titanic, in 1912. You will be mesmerized. You will be unable to put this book down until you reach the end. I can't say enough about this book. Forget the movie, forget any other books about Titanic. THIS is the only account of the disaster you need. I've read it about 12 times in the past 30 years and it grips me every time. NOTE: This review is for the ILLUSTRATED version of the book. Do NOT read any other version. The illustrated version has photos on every page, NOT just a section or two of photos clumped together. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE ILLUSTRATED VERSION, usually only in hard cover. Don't bother with any other versions. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Only occasionally do I find myself truly, inexorably engrossed in a book. Perhaps you know the feeling: the pulse quickens, and at times you are surprised to find you are short of breath (though sitting still in your chair). Walter Lord's \\"A Night to Remember\\" has just this sort of visceral effect on you; from the account of crewman Fleet's first sighting of the berg, to the chronicle of media blunders perpetrated in the days following the tragedy, it was as if the book had put a spell on me. I could not put it down.While Lord's book is a work of non-fiction, he accomplishes here what great works of fiction aim for: he manages to intertwine the life of the reader with the lives of the people in the book. Of course, novels can often get bogged down with details--imagery, say, or background information--but Lord wisely avoids this. Instead, what he gives us is a fast-moving, breathtaking account of the Titanic's sinking and the courage, loss, heroism, bravado, and shame of its (human, all too human) survivors. In short, he tells us about the people only what we need to know, but more than enough to make them living flesh and blood individuals.A quick look at a couple of the chapter titles, all of which are quotes from survivors, may help to explain the book's drawing power: for example, Chapter Four: \\"You Go and I'll Stay a While;\\" and Chapter Ten: \\"Go Away-We Have Just Seen Our Husbands Drown.\\" These statements alone are moving, and they become all the more powerful when read in context.Readers ofHiroshima By John Herseywill have a good idea of the narrative style of Lord's reportage, though at a literary level I found Lord's book to be even more thrilling to read. And the questions he leaves us with at the end of the book are as important as the answers he has discovered.A fascinating read, both suspenseful and educational, sure to appeal to anyone interested in one of the great Western tragedies of the 20th century. Included in the book are timelines and passenger lists.Finally, for a more recent look at maritime disasters and hazards, check outThe Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime, another book that is as informative as it is riveting."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I have been interested in the Titanic for as long as I can remember but had never read this book. I have seen the movie based off this book and loved it. I have watched many specials and programs on Titanic and almost everyone of them mentions this book as being one of the best and most accurate accounts of this terrible tragedy. I thought how could so many \\" Experts\\" be wrong so I thought I would give it a try. I was in no way disapointed. The book starts out with the events that began Titanic's final hours on a cold morning in April 1912. Through the eyes and words of the survivors we are led on the heartbreaking and frightening trip from aboard one of the most famous most luxurious ocean liners ever built to the decks of the rescue ship the Carpathia and beyond. We hear actual stories of individual passengers and crew members that are both full of sadness and extreme courage. The book goes into detail about the events and the timing of the events as experienced and remembered by the people aboard the ship that night. This book is one of the best accounts of the final hours of the Titanic and a must read for anyone interested in the \\"Unsinkable\\" Ship."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Good read, fast moving and true to the movie, or the movie is true to the book. Lot's ofunknown information and easy read."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"It has been one hundred years since the Titanic disaster, and people are still fascinated by the ship and her fate. Lord's classic account of the sinking is still noteworthy for the painstaking detail, much of it based on eyewitness accounts by survivors still alive in 1955. Step by step, he takes us through the events of that night, starting with the lookouts who didn't see the iceberg in time because the binoculars they were supposed to be using were locked in a chest and the key was in London. (The result of a last-minute change in the officers assigned to the ship.)We hear from people from all three passenger classes - the very wealthy, the middle class, and the lowly immigrants - and crew members from the officers to humble stewards. Though at times the book reads like fiction, it is not. He did an impressive amount of research which is detailed in the Acknowledgements section at the end. From the retrospective of the 21st century, the book represents an impressive undertaking in a world of print-only resources.After reading A Night To Remember, I think I understand why the story of the Titanic still draws us. It was one of the greatest disasters of all time, and it changed maritime history (and law) forever. But at its heart, it's a very human story-- of arrogance and hubris, negligence, bad luck and denial, bravery and cowardice, indifference and sacrifice. A testament to the bad and the good to be found in human nature. And for that reason, it is a story that will live forever in human memory."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I am not a book reader. I borrowed my wife's Kindle and wow! I really felt like this was someone's diary actually on the Titanic!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Journalism sometimes is referred to as the \\"first draft of history.\\" While not quite journalism, Walter Lord's compilation of what could be known about the night of terror aboard the Titanic was so proximate to the event that it is not yet elevated to scholarly history. In any case, it is far better than the journalism of its day which got so much wrong out of a combination of ignorance and celebrity sensationalism. It should go without saying it is an essential antidote to the contemporary, romanticized epic cinematographic experience that introduced a new generation to the horrors of the event. This is a most rewarding, quick read. A classic."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I downloaded this classic to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. I loved A Night to Remember when I first read it 50 years ago as a high school freshman. (I'll mark my calendar for 2062). This remains a great read. Even without Jack & Rose, the narrative is compelling. You'll enjoy James Cameron's spectacular movie even more after you've read A Night to Remember."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Great way to get a great book! Book is a great and easy read. My husband also read it and agreed."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book is a historically accurate, but sad accounting of the single most important event in passenger ship safety, and maritime responsibility. It was the very first time the newly adopted International Distress signal, SOS, was ever used. Lord writes with the sensitivity of one who believes even those who perished will read this book.If you're using your Kindle to read this book, you're going to test it's battery, because you won't put it down until it's finished, and only then will you take a long, slow deep breath."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"The authoratative account of the Titanic disaster. Chock full of details on the event obtained from the survivors themselves. Lord does a great job piecing together these eye witness accounts into a facinating story that keeps your interest from cover to cover."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book is absolutely riveting whether one is fascinated with the Titanic or not. This particular telling of a well-known, often related tragedy is all the more powerful because it is told in the voices of those who lived through it."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Very good read, my only complaint would be how much it bounces around. You don't have the chance to get attached to any characters, but I found it very interesting, nonetheless."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book is the definitive Titanic must read. It is not long but packed with information .. on a minute by minute timetable, of what happened on that Night to Remember. Although the book was published in 1955, it is still dramatic today as it was back then. Mr. Lord was able to interview approximately sixty of the survivors, and the stories they tell are fascinating. From the Captain all the way down to third class steerage, Mr. Lord let's us see how it all went down. A definite must read for anyone who is, or remains, a student of that fateful voyage."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"A night to rember is a great story that includes many facts that somehow slip into the book.

I got it, then for some reason it layed around for years. When I found it, I was sorry I didn't find it sooner. Forget Cameron's movie, the storyline with Jack and Rose has no truth. If you like the Titanic, but haven't read this book, read it now!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"First, to the person whom this book took seven months to read, then DON'T READ IT! But everyone else should. This book is extremely detailed, which may seem annoying at first, but after you've read it once, you should go back and read for detail. You can read this book seven times and still thirst to read it again. It is dramatic and thought-provoking. The passenger list in the back of the book is very useful, although it would be even better if a crew list had also been included. Captain Smith's tragic death is just that, tragic. Want to know more? Read the book."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Words can't describe the marvelous and amazingly detailed efforts by author Walter Lord.

It is a great re-telling of the Titanic story. What I liked about it most is that it talked about the people most. It focused on the human saga, not so much on the engeneering or the movie like other Titanic books do.

It has fascinating insights from the very start. What I also really loved was the writing style of this book. The stories of the passengers were written beautifully, and it doesn't read like a high-school history book, it reads like an amazing novel. I can't wait to read the sequel, A Night Lives On. Anyone interested in the Titanic should read this ASAP!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"A Night to Remember is one of the best out of atleast five Titanic books I've read. I beleave with just the information from that book I could write an A plus book report. I think that if anyone needs a lot of updated info. on Titanic they should head right for Titanic: A Night to Remember."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"If you're looking for an account of what happened in the hours before the Titanic hit the iceberg until the survivors arrived at the Carpathia (Rescue Ship), this is a perfect book for you. This satisfied most of the questions I had about the event."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is a rather short, but enthralling account of the Titanic voyage, from the day of the disaster to the arrival of the Carpathia in New-York's harbour. No messing around with long prologue or introduction.The author put the story together from several witness, and drew a full portrait of the sinking of the Titanic. No need for me here to recount the story, but 2 facts litteraly blew my mind off; first, only one out of 14 lifeboats went back to look for survivors, primarly because the women in those lifeboats refused to put themselves in any danger. Knowing that many if not all of those women left husbands or adolescents on the Titanic to drown and freeze to death, this is rather horrible.Secondly, even if the motto was \\"Women and children first\\", more first-class male passengers were saved than 3rd class babies or children. Equally horrible.Even if you'll come across many unselfish heroics deeds told in the book's pages, those 2 gruesomes events was what got my attention."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, makes me want to see the movie Titanic again. I would recommend it to my friends"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Guggenheim - Astor - Straus - Mrs. James J. (Molly) Brown - all names that sound strangely familiar, and yet names that will live in history. It has been one hundred years since the Titanic disaster, and people are still fascinated by the ship and her fate. I bought this book as an Amazon Kindle Daily Deal on the Titanic's 100th Anniversary; strange how it took that to compel me to finally delve into Walter Lord's classic 1955 book retelling of the great ship's final hours, \\"A Night to Remember.\\"Lord's \\"A Night to Remember\\" is a minute-by-minute account of the Titanic's final hours as told to Lord through countless hours of interview and research. This painstaking detail which he puts into the book is told in detail near the end of the book as he recounts the pages of research, interviews, and reading that he put into writing the book, even some of the conflicting details givens by witnesses. Please note that there is no central protagonist; consequently, the story will seem to jump around depending on who is recounting the story at the time. However, Lord has done a masterful job at putting all the information together and weaving it around the ship's historic timeline and creating a very readable and realistic work of non-fiction. With a passenger list in the back, detailing those who survived and those who didn't, the class prejudices and segregations are chillingly revealed; all three passenger classes are listed: the very wealthy, the middle class, and the lowly immigrants (or steerage) - and finally, the crew members from the officers to humble stewards.The 1958 British movie production of \\"A Night to Remember\\" remains perhaps the definitive dramatization of the disaster, adhering to the known facts of the time and achieving a documentary-like immediacy rather than a romanticized disaster. James Cameron's epic \\"Titanic\\" was released 39 years later and certainly broke box office records. Certainly, Cameron's film has its moments, but in truth I only liked it for the chance it gave me to see a great old ocean liner brought to life again on screen, not the romanticized \\"King of the World\\"! In \\"A Night To Remember\\", the effects are obviously not nearly so impressive, but the story-line is far better. Although addressed by Cameron, Lord's account reveals the horrifying class structure of the disaster, \\"which Cameron reduces to hollow Hollywood formula.\\" No children died in the First and Second Class decks; however, 53 out of 76 children in steerage (great diction) died. Lord's \\"A Night to Remember\\" proved that truth is far more compelling than romanticized fiction."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"It was a very good book that held my interest. A few times I got lost with the characters names. I couldn't remember who they were because they were only mentioned once or twice before they were written about again."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"She was built and marketed as unsinkable. A grander ship you would not have found. To be aboard her on this maiden voyage was privilege for the 2,207 passengers aboard, no matter if you were first class or steerage, you knew you were experiencing history in the making.If only they had known how true that would be...As she sped across the dark waters one cool April evening no one knew what was about to happen, and when it did happen....\\"Iceberg right ahead!\\"... no one thought it would do the damage it did. But once the damage was done, The Titanic in all her glory sunk quickly. A Night To Remember is the true minute by minute account of what happened after the Titanic struck ice, how some people reacted with an honor that is unmatched to this day, giving their lives... and yet other people brought out the ugliest side of humanity, and greed, and the instinct to survive, no matter what the cost.In 1898, 14 years before the Titanic sailed, a book was written called The Wreck Of The Titan. The ship, according to the book, was unsinkable. This fictitious ship was sailing the North Atlantic in April when it struck an iceberg 400 miles from Newfoundland, causing it to sink. There were not enough life boats for the people on board...As told in the opening of A Night To RememberA Night To Remember is as accurate a recap as I have ever heard as to what happened that fateful April night in 1912. Its easy to understand that 100 years later, movies are still bring produced and books are still being written about one of the greatest tragedies of the sea.Narrated by Martin Jarvis and 5 hours and 4 minutes long, this book is read at a wonderful pace filled with facts brought forth by those who lived to tell the story. While listening you will be told about:I was amazed at how close what I was hearing was to how the Titanic movie was made, all the way down to the large Irish man who fought to have the steerage women be released to have a chance to save themselves. Many of the lines from this book/audio, were also used in the movie,\\"She is Unsinkable!\\"Listening to this audio was at times painful when I thought of all the lives that were senselessly lost. In the end, it is told that the Whitestar Line never did have a policy for such an emergency, the crew made it up as they went along... in the panic that unfolded they did the best they could under that extreme amount of pressure. Many things changed after that fateful night:Never again did a ship sail without enough life boats to accommodate ALL on board. Assignments and directions to lifeboats are now stated in each stateroom.All passengers were created equal, no matter what there class in an emergency.ALL iceberg warnings were taken seriously.Every steamship carrying over 100 passengers must now carry two electric search lightsWalter Lord published this book in 1955, a classic that any Titanic follower must have in their collection.If you are interested in knowing more about the Titanic and its final night, this is an audio book I highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This was my first kindle purchase. Excellent storytelling of an horrific event with none of the hysteria associated with more recent productions. I totally recommend this book as the first and last in Titanic narrative- the benefit is of course the fact that Walter Lord interviewed all these survivors first-hand as opposed to supposition and debate that followed. I have read and seen a lot of material on the Titanic and even with the benefit of technology and impressive, extensive research, this book still stands up as the ultimate in the boat's story.No-one will be disappointed, guaranteed. (It does irritate me that Julian Fellowes has jumped on Mr. Lord's work- he had NOTHING to do with the original. A few docu-dramas does not the expert make!)"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book was written so well! Great book!

Considering the time the book was written, 1955, I think that you would agree that it is extremely factual. I would like to read an updated version of this book, one that also contains information discovered up until today. This book focuses on the Titanic's last few days before it's sinking. The book tells you what is happening from day-to-day encounters and, as the book draws closer to the end, you are told of events from hour-to-hour. I would recommend this book to all of those out there who have questions about what really happened to the Titanic and to those of you who just like a good book."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book is excellent.

Further, if you are a serious student of the Titanic, buy this book in trade paperback or even hardback; you will wear the trade paperback out (as I have.) The book is at once easy to read and pithy, presenting many of the confusing events in a clear and precise manner. Although the discovery of the wreck in 1985 and her subsequent exploration in 1986 and later have presented evidence which raises doubt on some of what Mr. Lord suggests may or may not have occured, the book remains in many ways as important as ever, not the least of which as an intellectual framework against which other works can (and should) be compared. It is worth refering readers to Mr. Lord's less stunning but still recomendable The Night Lives On, in which he revisits the disaster in light of these findings."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"It had a great minute by minute simulation of the sinking from the sighting of the iceberg to the rescue by the Carpathia.

Mr. Lord presents the events chronologically, but rather than reading like a stale history book, this reads more like an adventure story.A Night to Remember was written in the 1950s so obviously there is no &quot;post-discovery&quot; information about the wreck itself. The fact that the author was able to interview many survivors of the Titanic sinking more than makes up for this, in my opinion."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Mr Lord has given us the first and last words on the worst maritime disaster of our time in this book.

You expect to see a synopsis of her building, conditions surrounding her launching, the collision, and the sinking. Which makes for a intresting, if not bleak read.But Walter Lord's book, A Night To Remember was an inspiring novel, rather than a bleak textbook. Within the words, Lord has woven the pulsating life that had once existed on the queen of the seas, and draws us in. This books takes the Titanic expirence beyond the pages of books, and into the daily life of the people and crew of the ship that will forever humble and awe us."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I enjoyed reading Walter Lord's &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;. I found it to be an easy and fast read and was quite informative based on the eyewitnesses who were interviewed. However, this is the type of book one would find available for sell in a school weekly reader. Lord does not gives us any real history of the ship prior to departure - he starts the book a few miles from the iceberg. He does not give the reader any real scientific reasons why the ship sunk as it did (flawed metallurgy, etc). Based on Robert Ballard's findings, one could prove that it was impossible for the Titantic to right itself 90 degrees from the surface of the water and plunge straight down (Ballard believes the ship must have snapped in half). Nevertheless, considering that the book was written in 1955 and lacking the scientific evidence we have today, the book was interesting and held my attention. It did an excellent job of showing the tragedy of the California not responding to the distress calls (a fact that was sorely overlooked in the movie, Titanic). I was also surprised to find that all of the female passengers were referred to as &quot;MRS&quot; so-and-so and not by a first name. Even the ship's roster listed the women as &quot;Mr and Mrs&quot; so-and-so. But, I suppose it was indicative of the times (early 20th century)."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I read this book back in high school many years ago and later from our local public library.

The book was about the sinking of the grand ship the Titanic. It had excellent factual information, that I must have to say got a little boring at times, but still was very interesting to hear. I really loved how the book was a true minute-by-minute story. It really made you feel like you were one of the passengers on the ship just watching everything that was occurring. Even though the book was good, when you finished it filled your mind with many &quot;what ifs?&quot; What if ice conditions had been normal, or what if she had seen the iceberg 15 seconds sooner? Even though the book had some things I didn't really like, overall it was pretty good. I would definitely recommend the book to someone who has never read a book about Titanic before"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book is by the far the best Titanic related book ever.

I really don't think that this book can be compared to the movie &quot;Titanic.&quot; They are both such different stories, that saying one is like the other is missing the point.&quot;A Night to Remember is much more than Hollywook hype. It is really more of a personal account of what happened aboard the ship, and the horrors of the sinking and of the rescues (most people died, only a few survived). I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the saga of the Titanic. This book is based solidly on fact, which is one reason I like it so much. I remember reading this several years ago, and being kept up at night as a result."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I must be the only person who read this book years before the movie came out. As a child, this was one of my very favorite books that I have since reread many times. Lord captures everything: the social mores, the lavish banquets, the characters (the captain!), the conditions on the rest of the ship, and the tragedy of it all. The movie leaves nothing to the imagination, but this account is truly superb. If you never got a chance to read it, don't delay. You'll learn almost everything about the tragedy from a master story teller. The scenes right before they strike the iceburg are incredible, as are every scene of the evacuation. Finally, it's clear why no one wanted to leave the security of the ship. The worst tragedy of all was that many of the lifeboats were lowered with hardly anyone on them because they were afraid to leave the ship. Many more lives could have been saved."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I first read Walter Lord's &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; in the summer of 1968 as part of my required reading list for freshman year of high school. I was so fascinated by the account that I read it at least three times that summer and early fall. It brought to chilling life one of the greatest maritime disasters in history. As I read the dog-eared, yellowing, crinkled-paper copy of the paperback (its purchase price was sixty-cents back then) once again last year as a &quot;mature&quot; 42 year old, Mr. Lord's brilliant account of the tragedy still held my attention. His vivid, detailed, yet smooth flowing narrative brought back the excitement as felt as a young teenager, in a way that few books have. I recently viewed the movie &quot;Titanic&quot; with my fourteen year old daughter. The movie was thoroughly enjoyable, but there were some aspects of the book (such as the spectre of a rescue ship only a few precious miles away)that could have added to the drama. The book is worth reading both as literature as well as history."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is a classic book on the sinking of the Titanic and the first book I ever read on the subject. It should be understood before reading this book that our collective understanding of the Titanic disaster has moved on since the time A Night to Remember was first published in 1956. For example upon discovering the wreck of the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic in 1985 it was clear that the Titanic had indeed broken in half and rested upon the sea bed in two halves. As anybody who has seen the 1958 film \\"A Night To Remember\\" will realise this book presents the ship as sinking whole, which was not the case. But this is not to say that this book does not have a lot of outstanding information to impart to the interested reader. The book considers the Titanic from the time in 1907 when she was conceived, the building of the Titanic, the maiden voyage and the sinking and finally the subsequent investigations and recriminations. Particularly thought provoking is the full listing of the passengers at the back of the book including those who survived along with those who perished. What I found particularly shocking was the listing of Third Class Passengers, with its very low numbers of survivors. Walter Lord's book is very easy to read, though the subject matter is somewhat more difficult to digest, due to the overwhelming nature of the Titanic tragedy."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"No matter how many times you revisit it, A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, the granddaddy of all Titanic books, remains as fresh a read today as it did fifty years ago. Walter Lord is still universally regarded as \\"the man who knows everything about the Titanic\\" and this fast-paced, detail-laden, and dramatically visualized book is the reason why and the product of that reason.A NIGHT TO REMEMBER transports you to the decks of the Titanic that cold April night so convincingly that you are left with an eerie chill-between-your-shoulder blades feeling as the great ship goes down.You share the early complacency of the passengers on the 'unsinkable' ship. Your sense of impending doom grows as the bows disappear below the glassy Atlantic. You grit your teeth at the obtuseness of the crew of the Californian---why, oh why, didn't they question those white rockets?---and you share in the breathless trauma of those on shore as the story unfolds.Sure, since the discovery of the wreck many questions have been answered (and a few more posed). Some of Lord's information is dated (the ship did in fact break in half, for example). There have been other 'Titanic' books, and they explore almost every aspect of the disaster in meticulous detail; even Lord's follow-upThe Night Lives On: The Untold Stories & Secrets Behind the Sinking of the Unsinkable Ship-Titanicfalls into this category. But no one has ever told the story of the RMS Titanic any better, and it's likely they never will."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Walter Lord is one of the best historical authors of the 20th Century. His storytelling talent shows through in his classic account of the sinking of the Titanic. The book's only flaw is its brevity. The narrative portion is only 135 pages in small paperback form and starts just as the ship is about to hit the iceberg. There is no background story to give the reader perspective of the ship's construction or of the passengers whose stories it follows. Also lacking is much detail about the aftermath of the sinking. The actual sinking is retold in riveting first person accounts that detail those fatal final moments and all of their tragedies and ironies. In fact, Lord's account was good enough to make me want to seek out a more complete history of the disaster."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"If James Cameron's film Titanic made you feel you were there by watching it, (and I'm sure plenty of people feel that way but don't want to admit it since it's unfashionable right now), Walter Lord's book makes you feel the same way by reading about it. Minute by minute, detail by detail, with survivior accounts making it all the more real, we hear the story, the familiar details and plenty of ones we never heard before. Gripping with every turn of the page, your pulse races as you ache to find out what will happen next, though in the back of your head you already know. Walter Lord is a great historian and a great storyteller, and these skills are what make this book invaluable to any Titanic buff or anyone who likes a good story, or just anyone in general."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"James Cameron and I are the same age, and I first read ANTR when I was nine. It blew me down, especially the part where Major Peuchen rappelled down the side. (The Rank Movie should have used an actor that was not an English idea of a Yankee. He was as Canadian as James Cameron and me. I saw him, spot on, in Boat Six with Mrs. Brown. Jim. Why did you not show his descent? Better than Jack and Rose endless running.)But read this book. It was written in the 1950's, before the discovery of the ship's remains; but Mr. Lord corresponded with almost all survivors living at the time, and had all the survivor accounts published in books to that time. He wrote what was known, or said was known. It comes from them, and it is a masterly job of putting it all into a chronological account.It is the BEST \\"You Are There\\" narrative about the tragic night."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"At 11:40 p.m. on the night of April 14, 1912, the White Star liner Titanic, on its maiden voyage to New York, struck an iceberg in the north Atlantic. Less than three hours later, the ship known to the world as \\"unsinkable\\" was on her way to the bottom of the sea.The unexpectedness of the event, along with the shocking number of lives lost (more than 1500 by most estimates) and the many stories of carelessness and incompetence contributing to the disaster, cemented the Titanic into the collective consciousness of Western culture. Countless articles, exhibits, books, and movies (the most famous, released in 1997, grossed over $1.8 billion in worldwide revenue) have documented and fictionalized various aspects of the tragedy. Even nearly a hundred years later, it would be difficult to find someone who had never heard of the Titanic.In 1955, while many of the survivors of the Titanic's first and only voyage were still alive--and before the journalistic novel became fashionable as a genre--Walter Lord researched and wrote a minute-by-minute account of what happened during the ship's final night. Called A Night to Remember, Lord's account provides an interesting blend of minute details and broad sweeping overviews in its description of what happened onboard the ship.The book is easy to read and goes very quickly. Lord gives his prose a very journalistic feel, with short sentences and easy language. Entertaining is hardly the right word to use for a description of an event that claimed so many lives, but compelling describes the account pretty well. Lord puts readers right on the deck of the doomed ship, and then right into the lifeboats and, later, into the courtrooms and newspaper editors' offices during the aftermath of the sinking.Chapters are entitled with snippets of the dialog that occurs within each. Examples include \\"There's Talk of an Iceberg, Ma'am,\\" \\"God Himself Could Not Sink This Ship,\\" \\"There Is Your Beautiful Nightdress Gone,\\" and, perhaps most poignant, \\"Go Away--We Have Just Seen Our Husbands Drown.\\"The book's primary weakness is that in trying to include glimpses of so many people's experiences, Lord was mostly unable to go into much depth with any of the individual characters. Unlike later books in this genre--such as Blackhawk Down or The Perfect Storm, both of which describe in detail the experiences of a relatively small number of people during catastrophic events--A Night to Remember has to catalogue the experiences of over 2,000 individuals. Lord manages to include a lot of names, but without any background or detail, they quickly become meaningless.Though the scope of the book (probably necessarily) minimizes the amount of emotion connected with the tragedy, there are a few emotive moments when the reader realizes along with a child or a wife that a beloved husband or father will not be coming on a lifeboat. Depictions of the wireless operator sleeping onboard the nearby Californian, panicky passengers in lifeboats violently refusing to assist drowning swimmers, and determined high-society men donning formal evening dress to \\"go down like gentlemen\\" evoke flashes of emotion as well.Overall, the book is worth reading for its historically accurate picture of what actually happened on that cold April night. Though it's no literary masterpiece, it is informative and interesting, particularly for anyone who has seen James Cameron's movie or read Clive Cussler's book and would like to know the real story. The book contains nothing objectionable (except for the event itself), and is suitable for any reader. I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I cannot believe it's taken the impending 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic to compel me to finally delve into Walter Lord's 1955 recounting of the great ship's final hours, A Night to Remember. As detailed in the foreward to the fiftieth anniversary reissue, Lord possessed a lifelong, enduring fascination with the doomed Titanic, perhaps born out of a childhood trip on her sistership Olympia. Irregardless of the origin, Lord's passion for the subject shines in this slim volume's tightly-plotted recreation of the ship's final hours and the sinking's aftermath. Lord was in the unique and enviable position of being able to interview over sixty survivors of the sinking for his book, which he then incorporated into a blow-by-blow recreation of every moment -- from the collision with the iceberg to the Carpathia's rescue of less than a third of the Titanic's total passenger list. Lord's brisk, documentary style makes you feel as if you're watching a film of events unfold, lending the gradually dawning realization of the enormity of the danger facing the ship a depth and intensity that makes this an absolute page-turner.As Lord comments in his acknowledgements, A Night to Remember \\"is really about the last night of a small town\\" -- and by extension the beginning of the end for an entire way of life. I confess that while I've always been susceptible to the \\"Titanic mystique\\" I never really thought about the socio-economic repercussions of the tragedy. From the massively wealthy movers & shakers (i.e. John Jacob Astor IV) to the poorest immigrants in Third Class, Lord lays out a convincing argument that the Titanic was the \\"last stand of wealth and society in the center of public affection\\" -- to wit, the loss of that class's exclusivity on privilege and relative immunity to bad press. A whole way of life, the close-knit culture of the First Class passengers, an air of civility and chivalry, all of that vanished on that icy night in April, rocking the world to its core and paving the way for the unsettled political and socially charged atmosphere of the 20th century.This is an even-handed, balanced presentation of the events of April 14, 1912 and its aftermath. Lord manages to present what I feel is a relatively unvarnished view of events, but tells them in such a compelling manner that one never loses sight of the horror and human toll of that fateful day. A Night to Remember is not only an extraordinary document of the ship and her time, but of the best and worst that mankind is capable of, and of the dangers of letting the legend eclipse the great human toll of that night, and of what we can perhaps learn today from the ordinary men and women on that voyage who found themselves called to do extraordinary things."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book gave some interesting details about the Titanic sinking that I was not aware of. It moves me to read about the Titanic. It teaches us all that ultimately God is in control of our lives."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Very informative as well as exciting reading. This publication reads like you were there seeing everything unfold before you eyes.Worthwhile book, one I'm sure I will pick up again and read with as much enthusiasm as the first time."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"i picked this up at good will a few years ago. walter lord got his information from actual survivors which makes this book so compelling"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I am one of the many who, drawn by the hundredth anniversary of the Titanic tragedy, felt compelled to reread Walter Lord's excellent book. I have also just seen the film version and it is amazing how close to the book the film is. There are no sub-plots here as in James Cameron's film of the tragedy, just simple, straight-foward and often frightening reporting. Written when some of the ship's survivors were still alive, Lord used their memories and recollections well. It is beyond sadness to see how the class-disntinctions of the time even effected people in a tragedy but it is also encouraging to see acts of bravery and selflessness. For anyone interested in the story of the \\"unsinkable\\" Titanic, I must recommened this book."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"When I read it in my youth, it was the German translation, ('Die letzte Nacht der Titanic') and I found it so compelling, that felt I was part of the action. Now, many years later, I reread it in English. No matter in what language, it is still the classic account of what happened that night: No overblown hype, no laboured speculations, just a skillful collage of what the author learned from survivors and from his own research about the ship and tragedy, all written in a fresh journalistic style that draws you into the story."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"\\"A Night to Remember\\" conveys to readers in gripping detail the last hours of the doomed ocean liner Titanic. As the 100th anniversary of the tragedy draws nears, Titanic once again is in the public eye. But then again it has never really left. It was a tale of human achievement, hubris, genius, pride, courage, cowardess, triumph and sorrow. Lord interviewed dozens of survivors (the book was originally published in the 1950s) and family members of the deceased. Ultimately this becomes the main strenght of the book far and above sensational newspaper accounts or dry retellings of history.\\"A Night to Remember\\" chilling describes the impact of the iceberg from multiple vantage points. There are the surreal accounts of passengers playing with chunks of ice on deck even as far below crewmen desperately tried to stem the inexorable tide of water. There are the tragic stories of families seperated and the heroic actions of some who laid down their earthly lives to save others. Mystery abounds in some aspects. How did Captain Smith meet his fate? Did the band play \\"Nearer my God to Thee\\" or \\"Autumn?\\" Perhaps we will never know. The human drama is intense from the irony of the Titanic's builder staring at a painting depicting the passage to the new world to a wife who elected to stay on board with her husband even if it meant their deaths. There is the unthinkable tragedy of the California seeing part of the drama unfold but never putting the pices together despite being only 10 miles away. Survivors and victims offer historical characters of diverse social standing and nationality. But all of them were drawn together by chance or by destiny on that one terrible night in April 1912.For anyone interested in a detailed but very readable account of the Titanic's sinking, I highly recommend Walter Lord's \\"A Night to Remember.\\" It is a truely fascinating and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I remember this book from the movie back in the 50's. I wanted toread it as it had information from interviews of the actual survivors.I found it very informative and renewed the sense of tragedy thatsurrounds this event. A very good read for those interested in theevents of the final hours of the Titanic."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I read this book for the first time 15 years ago when the film \\"Titanic\\" was just released. I found the book to be extremely entertaining, yet filled with interesting information, and I honestly couldn't put it down. I got yelled at in a math class because the teacher caught me reading this book during a lecture. It's THAT good.The book plays out like an adventure story, so much so that you forget it's actually a non-fiction account of the final hours of Titanic. I was hooked from the very beginning and plan on reading it again this year as part of the 100th anniversary of the sinking.You don't want to miss this if you want to know more about the Titanic story. This is a GREAT place to start and it's one of the best books I have EVER read."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book is an example of a school of historiography that has almost died out. Nothing written about anything is this concise anymore. Any modern book written on this subject would have 300 or so extra pages on the passengers lives before the voyage, technical details of the ship and how the ship's voyage influenced world events and effected the social fabric. There are certainly instances where this is done in the book but it focuses more on the very human stories. This is probably helped by the fact that the author was able to speak to many of the survivors.Overall-Certainly a pleasure to read I can't say enough good things about it."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"All in all, Walter Lord's \\"A Night to Remember\\" is just that; an understated title for the series of calamities that took down the greatest and largest ship of its time and also lost more than 1500 innocent men, women and children who froze to death in water at 28 degrees. The story of the Titanic's maiden voyage is nearly incredible. Given the size and stature of this ship, an experienced captain, adequate warnings about icebergs, and with another ship less than 10 miles away, this tragic loss of life and loss of the ship should never have happened. It seems that virtually everything that could have gone wrong, virtually did.Lord did an excellent job of conveying the intensity, the confusion, the fears and the courage of those involved in the story. This work is now a classic that can neither be duplicated or improved upon, as all of the Titanic survivors are now deceased. Although the book came out in 1956, more than 40 years after the ship sank, Lord was able to gather some 60 survivors and glean from their memories the details that made this book so insightful. He also did comprehensive research into the inquiries that followed the events.I am an enthusiast of information about the Titanic. I am in constant search of new information about all aspects of this tragedy. For anyone else who wants to have a foundation of information about the tragedy of the Titantic, I encourage them to ingest this compelling tale."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I bought A Night to Remember on a whim after seeing some recent undersea images of the wreck. Maybe, like myself, you think you know the story from what has been portrayed in the theaters. Of course, we all know how it ends but to read first hand accounts of the tragedy as it unfolds is quite riveting. Walter Lord had the good fortune to have interviewed numerous survivors, both crew and passengers in writing this book and the historical details of a time gone by are fascinating.

I thought the book was very easy to read (which is always a concern of mine buying \\"older\\" books), no (or unnoticeable) Kindle \\"translation\\" errors, and of course, the price was perfect!I will say for anyone on the fence about reading this one, you certainly won't be sorry that you read it. However, I will say, having grown up on the Titanic movie and watching every single History Channel piece on the Titanic, there wasn't any information that was new to me. What makes me like this book anyway, is that it felt more \\"real\\" and \\"personal\\", as opposed to an informational history piece and even the movie (mostly because the movie focused on a limited number of characters)."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I'd seen the movie, \\"A Night to Remember,\\" years ago, and of course James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" umpteen times but this book still took me by surprise. It was extremely moving in a way neither of the movies were. This book went back to the real people as they remembered and lived the event. Errors and miss-remembrances were included and acknowledged. But the thing with the most impact for me was the very strong sense that the people simply didn't know what was happening until it was almost too late to do anything about it. There was a very real sense of on-the-spot immediacy to the writing that gave me a few nightmares, so strong was it!There was a lot less screaming and running around in the book, and a lot more pure human dignity and courage than the movies portrayed.People you've seen in the movies--real people--have a somewhat different presentation here. In \\"Titanic\\" the captain is presented as almost comatose and daft as his ship is sinking. In these remembrances he is spoken of as being active and trying to save as many as possible throughout the disaster.The tale of the ship that sat nearby, only ten miles away, and saw most of the event without realizing what was happening is heart-wrenching. There is no followup on the people on that ship in the aftermath, but the recounting of what they saw that night makes it clear enough what they had to live with later.There were hanging elements in the book I would have liked to have had explained or wrapped up better. The color of the flares shot up being one. There were a few things where it was apparently assumed you knew the tale already.This book is also closer to the era than the most recent movie and has a stronger sense of the class distinctions. Sometimes they were uncomfortable to read but it made the era more clear and vivid.Well worth reading. Very powerful account.Kindle version was clean and well formatted."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I read Walter Lord's book while doing a little background research for my own book,Reckless Abandon: The Costa Concordia Disaster. As an author of a book about another maritime tragedy, I wanted a better feel for what was different a hundred years ago as opposed to today. What I got for my money was a gripping account of personalities, pecking order, and just how important class-based privilege of that era was when it came to having a chance of surviving the sinking of the Titanic. Historically, the book also dates back far enough that Lord was able to base much of his writing on interviews with actual survivors. Besides that, the man is a master of the art of storytelling. If you're as fascinated by historic maritime tragedies as this author is (anyone else out there remember the story of the S.S. General Slocum???), do yourself a favor and get this book."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Written in 1955, this is the classic account of the forty-eight hours surrounding the sinking of the Titanic. Written without frills, the book details the sinking from various angles: the crew, the passengers, the Carpathian rescue ship, the survivors. The discrepancies in the survivor's accounts reflect their vulnerable, emotional reactions to the disaster. A timeline and list of passengers/crew that survived and those who perished are included. I learned more about The Carpathian (rescue ship) than I have from any other source.If you purchase the Kindle version, make sure you buy the one with the Philbrick preface.Rest in peace, all who perished.Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"When I was about 15, I was completely obsessed with the Titanic (yep, that's the year the movie came out!), and I brought every book I could find about it. And at the time, hyping up the movie, there was a lot of books available.A couple of years later, the obsession had faded and it wasn't until the 100th anniversary of the sinking in mid-April that my interest was piqued again. So I picked up a copy of A Night to Remember.Written in 1955, it reads with a surprisingly modern and appealing voice - it's not stuffy or wordy in it's explanations of what happened that fateful night, and although the 'cast of characters' is long, it's an extremely riveting read.Using interviews with passengers from first, second and third class and crew as a basis for the book, Walter Lord's classic has stood the test of time well. Although the cast of characters is large and complicated, the more prominent passengers (Mrs. Brown, John Jacob Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim) stand out, as do the chilling accounts from below-decks crew and steerage passengers. There are stories of miraculous survival and heart-breaking stories of final goodbyes, and coverage of the rescue and the landing of the survivors in New York.As a non-fiction book, this is not a dry read at all. Sure, it's got a whole lot of facts about the ship, the sinking and the rescue efforts, but it's presented in an easy-to-read language, interspersed with amazing true stories."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"my review about titanic is that they shouldn't have made it a love story. i think they should have told the real truth about that fateful night,also students like me would like to know more about the people who died on the ship.also i really want to see the names of the people who went down with the unsinkable rms titanic.i like to know where are the bodies are buried. i'm doing research on the unsinkable rms titanic for my class paper for school at Hawaii Business CollegeEND"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"An excellent book for anyone wanting to read more about the real stories written about this tragic event.

This illustrated edition is a book to treasure - I want to go out and tell everyone just what a wonderful read the book is - but I know I'll never get the book back!

Do yourself two favours: buy the book and see the DEFINITIVE film."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is the best book, for many reasons, on the night the Titanic sank. It is expertly constructed and wonderfully researched - he had access to survivors in the 1950s.

Anyone know?"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"When it comes to Titanic literature, this book tops the charts. It is 100% fact, unlike many books on this subject.

Since the teacher required it, I figured it was boring and didn't read it. Before the movie &quot;Titanic&quot; (which I haven't seen), I read the book &quot;No Greater Love&quot; by Danielle Steel about a family on the Titanic, it peaked my interest so I read this book. Boy do I wish I had read it when I was supposed to! I read it from cover to cover without putting it down and then gave it to the rest of my family. It sure would have brought my grade up."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I have been fascinated with the Titanic for years, and now with the resurgance of interest due to the movie, I find myself reaching for this book once again. Of all the many books, articles and journals written on the Titanic, Walter Lord's book touches us in a way the 'newer' books don't. He tells the story from survivor accounts and his own experiences after having researched the great vessel with an honesty that is sometimes cold, yet truthful. He worked with what he had at the time--not technology, but merely an interest to tell the story from a human point of view. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Titanic and her legacy. This is one book you will not want to put down and when you finally do, you may feel the emotions welling inside you as so many before when experiencing the wonder of this great tragedy."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book has to be one of the best books I've ever read.

Surely, the book offers a much more dramatic account of how it had happened. But somehow, several of the details in A Night to Remember are either murky or absent. Sometimes, the language is needlessly dense which caused obfuscation of the events. The later chapters are much worse especially after the Titanic sank. All in all, there has to be a much better book than A Night to Remember."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I thought this book was too boring. I did not like how this book described the clothes that everyone had on. It seemed to focus on fashion more than the Titanic sinking. A major difference from the book and the movie is that the movie had main characters. The book was described everyone and just told the story of the Titanic from a minute to minute concept. The book was an average book and I thought it could of been better. The author could of used more action words and other minor things."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I thought this book was too boring.

Lord interviewed a lot of characters still a live. He prefered not to create dialogues nor try to figure out what was going through people's minds. But, read a book with one thousand characters and not one of them being special is sometimes hard work. The narrative ( a kind of journalistic style ) is dry, typical of that age. The facts pile one after another with no time to sink into the reader's brain. All in all, I don't think it is a good book, but just a good attempt to write a good book about the TITANIC."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I have a Mac computer and never could download the book. A waste of my money ? I think I best use my app store"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"The book A Night to Remember by Walter Lord is one of the most closely related stories about the Titanic I have ever read. The plot is very good, but it is very easy to get lost in this book.First, the book goes into immediate action. On the first page of the first chapter it tells you when the ship collides with the iceberg. Within the entire book. you get no background information on the events leading up to the collision at all.Second, the book bounces from one character's thoughts to the next. You can never really tell exactly which character he is talking through. He will go from a major person such as the ships designer to an unknown peasant in third class.Finally, the book is very boring. He doesn't use very good words to describe what is happening at the moment in the book. He could have been much more detailed about the events. He doesn't elaborate in the book very well.In conclusion, this book is good if you are doing research on the Titanic, but if you want something just to read in you spare time, I suggest you find something else."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I've wanted this book for ages, and have both the book and the criterion collection DVD on my wishlist. The DVD is virtually impossible to get, unless I want to part with some serious money, so for now, it's a wish to have.I thought the book might be quite appropriate to read when I took a boat to Belgium - instead it gave me nightmares. But I was ever so slightly disappointed with the book. I've been what has been called \\"obsessed\\" with the Titanic for many years now, and have got every book that I've been able to get my hands on, but this is in no way the definitive version. It has been since 1955, and it's said that Walter Lord interviewed the survivors, to get a first hand account, but there's nothing new that hasn't been written in other books before and better. There's also a definitive passenger list at the back - there's been many quibbles over the Titanic passenger list for many years now, and there's always different versions in each book. There was even a J Dawson found in the Titanic cemetery (a place I would love to visit) after the film came out, which no one knew about, or remembered on the boat.I hope the movie will be better, however I will still keep this book. It may not be as good as I would have hoped, but it's still about the Titanic after all."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book comes across like a listing out of Who's Who of the era. Extremely light on technical detail, it has almost no information about the building of the Titanic, or about the hearings held after the sinking.Lord takes great pains to avoid offending the reputation of anyone on the ship, including the captain, the designers, and the builders of the Titanic, even though their collective and individual negligence was responsible for the disaster. The captain is portrayed as a stalwart, steady individual, though he was ultimately the individual most responsible for the sinking and deaths of quite a number of people. There's no mention of why he was running full steam through an icefield, despite half a dozen radio warnings concerning ice in the area. Incidentally, Lord's description would lead you to believe the Captain was chosen because of his popularity, not ability, and he bears no blame because the rich people liked his affable personality.The construction of the Titanic is described as 'watertight compartments'. No, they were *not* watertight, or the ship wouldn't have sunk. There were watertight bulkheads between compartments, essentially dams until the water level rose higher than the top of each bulkhead. Maybe the captain believed that 'watertight' description was accurate, and didn't bother to look himself. Maybe that's why the disaster happenned.Lord doesn't do anything to clarify the 'why', only the 'who'.The Wretched Reviewer"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"In my opinion A Night to Remember is a boring book! It has it's moments where it's good but most of it is pretty bad! Most of the book is peoples quotes. You don't get a feel of what really happened. There also wasn't enough emotion. They made it seem like it wasn't a big deal. When they did express the action in in this book it wasn't exciting. On a scale from 1-10 I would give this book a 4. The reason why I wouldn't rate it any less is because I have read much worse books and compared to the other books I have read this is about in the middle of the rating system."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I thought that the book was ok. I liked how Lord gave details about what individual people were doing during certain events. But, then again, it was really dragged out and was boring at times. But it was interesting to know how poeple found out about hitting the iceburn, and what they went through."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. You can watch the movie and remember certain scenes, and then read the book and feel like you're there and feel the emotions the passengers felt that haunting April night. And the feeling doesn't leave. I'll always remember this book because the details were there and Walter Lord captured the sinking like no one else could. It was completely captivating and took my breath away."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book will put you on that ship better than any three hour long glitzy motion picture ever could. Walter Lord has a gift for storytelling and this short book is packed with every possible necessity as it tells the story of that fateful night in the cold Atlantic. You will get chills as the ship sinks, after you've intimately learned about the passengers and crew. The story will break your heart, not only for the reality of the tragedy, but for the way in which it is told to the reader. Thank you, Mr. Lord, for a true CLASSIC piece of writing."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Over a thousand people died; countless widows and orphans were left destitute; the bodies of hundreds were never recovered. Entire families perished; babies drowned in their mother's arms; young women with their lives ahead of them froze to death in the icy waters.Walter Lord writes of these people, describing with eloquence their lives and what led them to board the doomed liner. And although we've learned more about the disaster than was known at the time this book was written, Lord's sympathy for the dead and his judgment of the guilty are far from out of date.And that's the tragedy of Titanic; not some silly teenage-girl romance gone awry, but the deaths of so many innocents with their lives ahead of them and the realization that it was completely and totally preventable.This book is worth every penny. I highly recommend it -- and its sequel, The Night Lives On."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"For entertainment purposes, I recommend scanning down through the reviews of this book and reading any that are less than 5 stars. Hoo boy, what can you say? Walter Lord's book is a classic, the result of numerous interviews with actual survivors, and is probably as close as we will ever get to a complete recounting of the events of that awful night (also read Lord's &quot;Night Lives On&quot; where he adds some new information and corrects some errors he made in this book - he wasn't the only person caught out when the ship turned up in two pieces!). If you're just getting into the story or need to be cured of some of the more egregious excesses in Cameron's film, this is the book you need to read. On the other hand, if you're a victim of our educational system, go watch the movie. Hmmm."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I confess - although my passion for history made me aware of the Titanic, it wasn't until I realized the 100th anniversary of the sinking was upon us that I began searching for in-depth accounts. At first I was distracted by all the \\"100th anniversary\\" publications by major names like Life and Time, but after learning of this book, I had an intuitive feeling that this should be my starting point. I found this in a used copy in the back of a bookstore, and I couldn't have made a better choice.Ultimately, the only way to record history is to access the ones on whom history acted. Nathaniel Philbrick is absolutely right - even though this account is almost 60 years old, its strength lies in its historical narrative, solidly based on firsthand accounts. With a cultural phenomenon like the \\"Titanic\\", it is all too easy to lose sight of exactly what happened and why it has reverberated down to us throughout the decades. Lord's account pulls the \\"Titanic\\" back into the realm of ordinary people, time and space. The story starts in 11:40 pm blackness of April 14 and concludes with a scene depicting one of the survivors on the \\"Carpathia.\\" Background / parenthetical material is inserted here and there - for instance, the last chapter does cover the initial reaction to the sinking in New York and worldwide - but the focus is always on what stories revolve around: people, and how they felt and acted when their world literally sank on the night of April 14-15, 1912. I first pulled this book out around 11:00 in bed, intending only to browse the first chapter. When I next looked up at the clock, it was 2:30.The length of the book is a surprising strength. I am always amazed at how a few hours, or even moments, in time can contain events that soon transcend time and become engraved in historical memory - e.g., the crucifixion of Christ, Luther nailing his theses to the door at Wittenberg, Gettysburg, September 11, etc. It only took less than 3 hours to sink a ship that has lived on in the cultural imagination for a century now. Even though most survivors would have said it felt like an eternity, in retrospect I wouldn't be surprised if some of them realized that the ordeal, relatively speaking, didn't last that long. The length of the book reflects this dual approach to time - it's not a slim primer, but it's not a massive 2 inch volume by any means.I know I am a hundred years late to the bandwagon, but \\"A Night to Remember\\" was the best way I could have commemorated this century-old tragedy. I am definitely interested in exploring more aspects of this incredible ship, probably starting with Lord's sequel, \\"The Night Lives On.\\""},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is a fairly comprehensive book detailing the passengers on board the Titanic. It describes events from multiple points of view, including staff and steerage. I thought that the book was well and very factual. At times it did feel like the author was throwing out a lot of names. At times it was hard to follow and keep track of the variety of people. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about the Titanic or a history buff."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I thought this was book was going to have many more details and interviews, it is kind of a small thin book with big margins (thing that I do not particularly like), but in general it was an interesting reading because somehow makes you to picture yourself as any of those people (not in first class, at least for me).This book allowed me to understand several things I have not before: how fast everything happened (somehow the movie gives the feeling of a lot of time has passed since the ship hits the iceberg and when she finally sinks) and the fact that the boats were not fully loaded (before I thought outrageous something like that had happened but when you read this book it seems more plausible), one realizes that half the time there was not feeling of real danger and the other half it was too late (I am exaggerating a little), if people did not know about the danger, it was logical they were reticent to go into those boats, but at the same time, how everything would have been if everybody knew they only had so little time.Still, the most surprising thing to me was the affair of the Californian.In synthesis, is a book worth to be read, even if it does not have pictures."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Sunday, the 14th of April, 1912. The Titanic, on her maiden voyage, struck an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. By 2:20 a.m. she had slipped under the sea. There were unheeded ice warnings from other ships. Her lifeboats were lowered, each far from filled to capacity. As she was listing to port and sinking at the bow, the crew of the Californian watched the strange ship's flares from only ten miles away, their wireless set shut down for the night. When her lights disappeared for good, the Californian decided she had steamed away. There were over one thousand five hundred souls lost.Those are the facts you do know. Author Walter Lord delves deeper than just the historical facts in this spellbinding account. He successfully recreates the feeling of what it was like that tragic night on the ill-fated ship. There was gallantry, bravery and contemplation that fateful night. Mr. Guggenheim changing to evening dress. Mr. Ryerson insisting his wife's maid take his life belt. The firemen manning the boilers until the last possible second. Mr. Andrews, the ship's builder, alone and motionless in the smoking room, absorbed in his thoughts, his life belt tossed aside. The band played ragtime.Mr. Lord has pieced together a fascinating account of the fateful events via painstaking research that brings us the events as they happened, minute by minute, from before the initial collision through the rescue by the Carpathia. His account is based on personal interviews with dozens of survivors, both passengers and crew, with whom he had \\"haunting conversations,\\" making his vivid reconstruction of the events possible. The author also examined several thousand pages of official testimony given to the U.S. and British enquiries, as well as seeking out passengers' memoirs and periodical interviews.And yet a bit of mystery remains. Mr. Lord notes, \\"The words quoted are given exactly as people remember them being spoken. Yet, there is a margin for error.\\" Often, various people will remember a shared event somewhat differently, and Mr. Lord makes note of these discrepancies in his book. However, one thing is certain: the Titanic changed history in many ways. At the time, many saw the Titanic disaster as the end of an era. People felt small again. The Titanic had been declared unsinkable. Some felt man had become too big for his britches, and that this tragedy was a wake-up call for humanity. A unique legend was born that momentous night, one that has fascinated for generations. Walter Lord has created a classic and has done an admirable job of recording that fateful night's events for all to remember."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"When I first read A Night to Remember it was a very thin Bantam edition that would fit in your pocket, and I don't know why I picked it up, unless it was the painting on the cover of the ship raising its stern above the water. Well, that would be an attraction for a 12-year old boy already fascinated by history and the sea (although, specifically, naval warfare). It was the beginning of a life-long obsession with the Titanic. I'm not sure how many times I read that book, but I could quote from it. In any case, I found a paperback edition of the illustrated edition in the library and borrowed it countless times. For some reason I never sought it out in bookstores, since I thought for no good reason that it was a rare item.The book is profusely illustrated mainly with contemporary drawings, paintings, and photographs. These are logically arranged through the text and flesh out the story, adding to the already stirring drama of the text. By the time you're done you feel like you got a real picture of the event. This book is a keeper."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Very well written, consise, and descriptive portrait of the sinking of the Titanic and what those involved experienced."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This piece of literature lends not only an atmospheric minute-by-minute account of a famous disaster, it presents the reader with insightful,well-thought-out points about society at the time. A lot of people look back on the tragedy as a horrible accident that claimed hundreds of innocent lives. But Walter Lord gives us the idea that more than lives were just lost, a way of life was lost. He mentions the &quot;gentlemen&quot; lost at sea, who at that point in time, made up a large percentage of those in the society who were chivalrous and extraordinarily polite, nothing at all like social discourse today. Those members of that large portion of society were lost, and a whole group that consisted of the lower and upper class alike were erased, and a way of interaction disappeared along with it."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I read the book \\" A Night To Remember\\". I thought it was a very good book for everyone. It was very interesting and touching. Walter Lord wrote the novel very realistic. It told what happened step by step each minute.The passengers had to feel very scared. All they could think about was what their family members were doing in the other places on the boat. I could never imagine that.The book tells you what happen and what the passengers felt when it was happening.They could only think about how they were going to die too. They could only start thinking about touching the freezing water and freezing to death or drowning in the water.They were out in the middle of nowhere and had no chance to really survive. The men let the wives and children go on the lifeboats first and then the husbands would get on lifeboats after everyone was off the ship. The wives and children could only think about where their grandpas or fathers were. They would never probably see them again in their lifetime. The fathers and grandpas and uncles would probably not survive the accident because it took so long just to get the wives and children on to the lifeboats.While everything was happening, some people were in their beds just wanting to die that way, some were drinking as usual in the diner and some were just trying to survive. A lot of the passengers didn't even want to think of the way they were going to pass away.I thought the novel was very good. I could feel what was happening as I read the story. It was very sad to read about how people felt and what they were thinking. The Titanic was one of the greatest ships ever and took so many lives in so little time. I could never imagine that happening. I don't know what I would think about if I had been on that ship. I think this novel is good for anyone that would like to read a good story."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"When I read this book, it brought tears to my eyes when I learned how the steerage passengers were forced to stay in the lower decks even when the Titanic was sinking. I found it absurd how people in the first class were given the chance to live when third class, who were the same as the first class (the only difference is the ticket they held in their hand) were freezing to death in the ice-cold waters of the Atlantic. Because the Titanic was believed to be &quot;unsinkable&quot;, there wasn't enough lifeboats for the 2,500 lives onboard. There were a lot of families seperated because women and children were the first to get into the lifeboats while the men were forced to stay on the sinking ship until almost every woman and child was safe in a lifeboat. I am so glad that sociaty has changed so that everyone is treated equal and no one judges you on how much money you have or what your class is on a boat."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Walter Lord did an excellent job of writing this book. As you read the book, you felt as if you were there. You had a sense of what it was like to be on the Titanic the night that it sank. You could vision the first class passengers in their elegant gowns and suits sitting in the dining room eating expensive food and talking about the days activities, the second class passengers standing on the deck looking at the vast ocean, and the third class passengers in the steerage part of the ship being overlooked by the crew and other passengers, but with high hopes that they would soon be starting new lives in America. As the book went into more detail about when the ship collided with the iceberg and began to plunge beneath the waves, you felt as if you were on the ship as it was going down. You could picture in your mind the bustling people and the crew lowering the lifeboats and trying to keep the passengers under control. You could feel the movement of the boat and held your breath as the ship sank, and almost heard the screams and cries of the people in the lifeboats as they realized that everything they had was gone. You could feel the emotions of the people who had survived. This book gives us a look into what really happened on that fateful night."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"One of the best accounts of the tragic story of the Titanic I have read so far.

Emotional rollercoaster. The full tragedy of the disaster never sank in until I read this book. The people were just names on the passenger list that I had looked over so many times.

It was interesting to see scenes from this book on screen in the new movie: Jack Thayer on deck in pajamas not wanting to &quot;miss the fun&quot;, baker Joughin on the stern rail with the main characters at the very end, etc. I first read the book when I was eleven, and I've reread it many times since then. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Judged by the reviews below, you'd thin this is a masterpiece, maybe the best bok ever written about TITANIC. But then you'll realize that the book is just 208 pages long ( appendices included ), it was written in 1955 ando so, consequently, lacks many new material that surfaced along time. It's a good book only for someone who is introducing himself to the TITANIC."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I wanted to read a book that was generally about the Titanic's sinking not the literal second by second account.

A Night to Remember took me a wopping 7 months because it was soooo boring!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I wanted to read a book that was generally about the Titanic's sinking not the literal second by second account.

This book is just a series of pointless facts that everyone already knows. I am personnaly very interested in the Titanic and what happened to it and after reading that I had not learn anything and was truly disapointed. I would not recommend that book to anyone unless the person is in search of facts about the Titanic."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"An example of a great writer telling more with less. Walter Lord took volumns of interviews with Titanic survivors and boiled them down to the dramatic essence that is this book. Tightly written with a fast pace that manages to build suspense despite knowing the ultimate fate of the ship.There are so many who write the \\"disaster\\" book now, but 50 years after its first publication, this book still sets the mark for the genre."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is the story of the &quot;unsinkable&quot; Titanic. She was four city blocks long, with the latest, most ingenious safety devices, a French &quot;sidewalk cafe&quot;, private promenade decks-but only twenty lifeboats for the 2,207 passengers and crew on board.Gliding through a calm sea, disdainful of all obstacles, the Titanic brushed an iceberg. Two hours and forty minutes later, she upended and sank. Only 705 survivors were picked up from her half-filled boats. And she had been called &quot;the ship that God Himself couldn't sink.&quot;A Night to Remember is a minute-by-minute account of her fatal collision with an iceberg and how the resulting tragedy brought out the best and worst in human nature. Some gave their lives for others, some fought for survival. Wives beseeched husbands to join them in the boats; gentlemen went taut-lipped to their deaths in full evening dress; hundreds of steerage passengers, trapped below decks, sought help in vain.If you've seen the movie by James Cameron, this book is highly recommended to get the real story."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Publishing for the first time in 1955, Walter Lord's novel remains unsurpassed in accuracy and excitement. To fulfill his purpose, Lord interviewed the few Titanic survivors in effort to create the most precise and vivid picture of what happened out in the Atlantic on that moonlit night in 1912. This book allows readers to step on board the luxury liner with an explosion of the emotions the passengers felt that night they knew there was no where to go but into the freezing icy water of the ocean. Devoid of Hollywood glamour, Lord tells exactly what happened when it happened as told by those who were actually there. With chapters brilliantly titled with heart-wrenching words of the passengers, Lord is able to describe in complete detail the events as they occurred minute-by-minute from the point of view of different passengers. Some passengers stayed in bed despite the jolt of the iceberg, some continued to drink and smoke in the lounges, and some went up on deck to investigate while others played a game of soccer with chunks of ice. By his exceptional use of lead-ins and transitions, Lord's novel flows in a remarkable manner. Descriptions are depicted in such intense detail that any reader can taste the gourmet meals of the first class, see the excessively adorned quarters, hear the chilling silence, and feel the pain of the frigid water."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"There are few people who haven't heard, at least once, about the ill-fated first voyage of the Titanic. It truly was the story of a lifetime for so many and strikes a chord within us still. Yet, even with all that has been written and published about the ship, there remains so much that is unknown to us.Like many, I remain fascinated with the Titanic and the people aboard her. I have read quite a bit about it, but I am amazed that I hadn't yet read A Night to Remember by Walter Lord. It proved to be an amazing account of the tragedy.With something like this, a story that so many know of, the mark of a good writer is the ability to create suspense in the reader. I found myself reading almost straight through, anxious and excited all at the same time. There was no doubt how the account had to end, and yet I was drawn into the story.I highly recommend this book, not only for those fascinated by the Titanic but also for anyone who just likes an easily readable, well-written and exciting story. It is truly a classic.Note: I was provided a digital copy of this book by Open Road Media in exchange for an unbiased review."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"The book A Night to Remember by Walter Lord is an exciting educational learning experience reliving the night of April 14, 1912, the night the Luxurious Liner Titanic sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. This book is filled with facts, actual interviews, and transitions to help you understand the terrible tragedy that took place. It gives you a sense of wonder and sorrow and keeps you interested every page. For die-hard Titanic fans, this book is definitely the best. Even if your not, the way Walter Lord writes captures your mind and attention. This book was excellent, one I will read repeatedly and still catch things I missed before. This is a great book for everyone."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"For those of you who are Titanic aficionados, practically everything you will have read or seen about the incident probably used this book as a major reference. Which makes it the Titanic Bible. No, we don't get the love story, but there is enough here to make your emotions work the way they're supposed to.While there are other studies, what makes this one valuable is that the author interviewed over sixty survivors for the work. This is obviously a feat that can never be duplicated again, so we need to thank Walter Lord for getting the information while we can.So we get the statistics of the ship, which are interesting. We also get to know the changes made to sea travel, and society in general due to the incident. But we also get what have now become the famous &quot;What ifs?&quot;. There are almost a dozen things, from ship construction to someone merely taking a telegram more seriously, where, if just were to go the other way, it's very possible that nearly everybody could have been rescued. This is essential reading for those interested in the topic."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Even with the amount of time I've been studying the &quot;Titanic&quot; legend, I still discovered a few new things about the disaster that I didn't know. You won't find a more detailed account anywhere else!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. You can watch the movie and remember certain scenes, and then read the book and feel like you're there and feel the emotions the passengers felt that haunting April night. And the feeling doesn't leave. I'll always remember this book because the details were there and Walter Lord captured the sinking like no one else could. It was completely captivating and took my breath away."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book will put you on that ship better than any three hour long glitzy motion picture ever could. Walter Lord has a gift for storytelling and this short book is packed with every possible necessity as it tells the story of that fateful night in the cold Atlantic. You will get chills as the ship sinks, after you've intimately learned about the passengers and crew. The story will break your heart, not only for the reality of the tragedy, but for the way in which it is told to the reader. Thank you, Mr. Lord, for a true CLASSIC piece of writing."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Over a thousand people died; countless widows and orphans were left destitute; the bodies of hundreds were never recovered. Entire families perished; babies drowned in their mother's arms; young women with their lives ahead of them froze to death in the icy waters.Walter Lord writes of these people, describing with eloquence their lives and what led them to board the doomed liner. And although we've learned more about the disaster than was known at the time this book was written, Lord's sympathy for the dead and his judgment of the guilty are far from out of date.And that's the tragedy of Titanic; not some silly teenage-girl romance gone awry, but the deaths of so many innocents with their lives ahead of them and the realization that it was completely and totally preventable.This book is worth every penny. I highly recommend it -- and its sequel, The Night Lives On."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book relives the sinking of the Titanic in a way that makes the reader feel they are right there on board ship. It is a fast paced book that can be read in one day. (At least I couldn't put it down) I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn about the unsinkable Titanic."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book was well researched. I enjoyed the almost minute to minute details this author presented of the sinking. I also liked how he brought out the feelings of the actual people who experienced this tragedy. It made you feel like you were there. I recommend this book to anyone who has a moderate interest in the history of the Titanic."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Walter Lord did his homework on the Titanic's fateful night in this unforgettable and memorable book. He did not need to create fiction or suggest anything to the contrary. In fact, he writes about it from the survivor's perspectives. Despite the horrors, what shocked me was the situation in the lifeboats in the aftermath of shell-shocked people who have watched their loved ones, mostly their husbands, go down with the ship. I don't know why California didn't seek to assist them or inquire about the distress signals. We'll never know what makes people ignore others in time of great distress. When the Carpathia arrived to pick up the survivors, they are shocked by the news that Titanic is gone and they are the only ones to tell a shocking story of so many people's last moments on earth. Forget James Cameron's movie, this book is real and faithful to those fifteen hundred men, women, and children who perished as it is to the survivors who never recovered fully. Because of the Titanic disaster, every ship since was required by international shipping law to have enough lifeboats for everybody on ship and supplies during the worst of disasters. The last pages of the book are the names of those who died and survived. Where they embarked for their final destination to New York City but most of them would never make it there. I remember survivor Eva Hart who lost her father in the disaster that it was all about arrogance. The ship had to be fast, unsinkable, and yet the disaster was unthinkable. She said her mother, Miriam Hart, lashed back with a comment that has stuck with me for years that when saying the ship is unsinkable is like tempting fate to occur. Mrs. Hart, Eva's Mother, spent her nights awak and days asleep as if a premonition of this ship never making New York City. This story was not included in this book but Walter Lord does his best and it's remarkable that he prefers facts to rumors or gossip. It has taken me years to read this book maybe because of all those who perished still resonate with the Titanic's ultimate fate. The Titanic was the ultimate ship and none has ever come close in the ship's genius, magnificience, style, and sophistication. The third class passengers never enjoyed it. The second and first class passengers must have felt like they were in heaven with first class service catered to their needs and fancies. Rest in Peace, Titanic, and all those who have sailed with you on that fateful trip. You will always be in my heart as the ship of dreams and destiny."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Two things set A Night to Remember apart from every other book and film on the subject of the Titanic:First, with the exception of the ship breaking up as it sank (and the official record, with its conflicting testimony, shows it could have been written either way in 1955) and the use of the first SOS (which Lord corrected in later editions), there is not a single fact in the book that has ever been proven wrong. And, oh, how supporters of Capt. Lord of the Californian have tried.Second, this is not a book about the sinking of the Titanic so much as it is a book about the PEOPLE involved in the event of the sinking. Take just the first sentence of the first chapter: \\"High in the crow's-nest of the new White Star Liner Titanic, Lookout Frederick Fleet peered into the dazzling night.\\" Remember back to your English grammar classes and you will note that the subject of this sentence is a person, not a ship. So it is throughout the rest of the book. As readers, are we not more compelled by people rather than objects? Of course we are.And as Walter Lord reminds us from the first that this is a story about people, so does he employ the expertise of a reporter and the flair of a novelist. The reporter . . . Who? Frederick Fleet. What? He peered. When? Night. Where? The Titanic's crow's-nest. Why? He was a Lookout. But by dressing up these facts with a few choice words and phrases (\\"High up\\", \\"new\\", \\"dazzling\\"), Lord draws us in dramatically.Over the years, science and technology have given us greater insight into the building, operation, and physical break-up of the Titanic. But no one has ever come close to Walter Lord in recreating and relating the events of the night of April 14 - 15, 1912."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"There are good books, and there are not so good books. Walter Lord's A Night To Remember is definitly one of those good books. I thought that the quality in this book was amazing, and kept you on the edge of your seat. He uses descriptive phrases combined with eyewittnes accounts/interviews with the survivors to make you feel like you are there on the ship with them. When I was reading this, I could almost feel the desperation of trying to get in one of the few lifeboats aboard the titanic.I would definitly recommend this book to anyone looking to read a good book in their spare time-whether they be old, young, male or female. In my opinion, even though some details are outdated, I still feel that this is a classic, timeless book on the events of the sinking of the Titanic."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Being a huge &quot;TITANIC&quot; fan I was in desperate need of serious reading material on my favorite subject.Going to my favorite bookstore Atlantic Books I purchased my first book on &quot;TITANIC&quot;.Anxious to read it,and driving my mother nuts we finally arrived at my house.The anxiety I felt finally opening &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; quickly subsided me as I eased into the almost real surroundings produced by Walter Lord.I was in my glory as I began to feel the excitement of the passengers when they began to leave the port.And of course the chill of absolute terror when they heard that half of them would die and that the surviving half would live to tell their story of that fateful night.They did not know that they would soon be mourned by millions of people who they of course did not know.And yet some 86 years later,on April 14th the world seems to pause at 11:40pm to give their moment of silence to a ship that was said to be &quot;unsinkable&quot;.There are also some new characters from the legendary ship that director James Cameron made noticeable such as John Jacob Astor and &quot;the unsinkable Molly Brown. Of course some new characters are fictisous yet they make the story even more romantic.So no matter what the critics or anyone else says if you like &quot;TITANIC&quot; or you just want to read a good book I highly recommended this one. __"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Walter Lord's book, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; is an excellent account of the events that took place on the night the Titanic sank. Unlike so many other books about the Titanic which launch into great detail about the various details of the ship, how and why she was created, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; starts right off where all the action is--the moment the ship hits the iceberg. The book is also written from a plethora of witnesses and survivors accounts, but it is put together in story form as though you were reading an fiction novel, only to find ou ' all true.I give this book my highest ratings and recommend it to anyone who ever had any interest in shipwrecks."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"The problem with books about Titanic are that they contain long drawn out details that are of no interest to a lot of us. Not ALL of us, but a lot of us. Most books start out with a history of ships or shipping, then it moves into the building of Titanic and sometimes it even gives you useless details such as how many rivets were on the ship or how heavy she was, or whatever. They go on and on about things before it finally gets around to the meat of the story and its as though they feel that they must write a lot of information to get to their point, which in the end is quite short. When I am done, I feel ripped off.Another problem with books about Titanic is that most have a slant in some way or another. Either Captain Smith was a fine man or he was irresponsible; either Ismay was a coward, or he was a scape goat and so on. In fact, most non-fiction (heck, even fiction too) today has more slant than I ever care to read about. I'm sick to death of having to listen to someone tell me what they think, because their opinion matters not at all to me. Just give me the facts and let me decide for myself; thank you very much.Finally, and this may seal it for some, but this is not a book that is based on the scientific or technical aspects of Titanic's demise. If that is what you're looking for, look elsewhere. Outside of the basics, there is nothing about any of that. It is more about the lifestyle, feelings and actions that took place on that dark, yet starry, night.Thankfully, this book is different from all of those examples above. It starts out with a bang, literally. The book begins at 11:40 p.m., the moment she struck the berg. He gives us a moment by moment outline of the events and who did what from that point on until the Carpathia heads to New York.It is primarily based on eyewitness accounts and facts gleaned from various sources. Try as I might, I was unable to find any slant whatsoever. He does write a small rant in relationship to the number of lifeboats, which is a sore spot for everyone, but he is quick to add that she had more lifeboats than regulations required, which is an absolute fact. He also provides examples of unsubstantiated claims, but is clear on the fact that they were unsubstantiated. Who knows? Maybe it did happen or perhaps it didn't, but it's a nice-to-know thing to consider in any case.His writing is fluid and enjoyable. Never bored, I could not put it down. I don't remember chuckling, but his flair for words definitely gave me a smile. I found myself angry that I had waited all my life to read this book. I had no idea what I was missing.If I had to list a con, it would be that I would have liked for him to have ended it after the American and British inquiries. He is very good at summarizing and that would have been an excellent ending. That's it though for him.On the subject of the Kindle Fire (or any Kindle), there are some problems. As usual, the diagram he has at the beginning of the book is too small to be legible, which is a definite problem. I am a visual learner, so when I hear \\"he went down to E deck then crossed over the whatever-it-is and went up the something or other....\\" I like to have a diagram to refer to. It gives me more meaning. Unfortunately, that was impossible in the Kindle version due to the itty bitty diagram problem. On the other hand, since I cannot see the diagram clearly at all, that may not even be what the diagram is! Additionally, again as always, there are a lot of typo errors. None of which, however, make it imperceptible.There are some grammar/error die hard folks out there and if little things like typos bother you, then skip it. Otherwise, I highly recommend it in hard copy as well as Kindle."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Starting with the lookout fleet seeing the first ice-berg, Walter Lord's The Night to Remember novel begins. W.Lord had truly grasped every angle of everything that happened from the hitting of the ice-berg to the Carpathia arriving at New York with thousands of people waiting to meet their friends or relatives. He interviewed most of the survivors, which made every word of the novel more realistic, and more fascinating. The survivors had also provided almost the exact words of what the passengers or the crew had said. For example, the only baker who survived, had provided W. Lord with thousands of information about the bakery when the ship was starting to tilt, such as providing bread for one of the lifeboats. Very fascinating, very exciting, truly amazing. This book had used thousands of help from suvivors, and of course, uncountable efforts by Walter Lord."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I have received Walter lord's book &quot;A night to remember&quot; and the movie, two weeks ago, since then I have read the book two times and seen the movie three times !

If you are looking for one book to read about Titanic this is the one."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I've read quite a few books about the Titanic, and this one is a stand-out in its detail and accuracy. Perhaps this is due to the fact that it focuses almost entirely on the night of the disaster, and little on events before and afterwards, but also that it combines the best of both worlds - hindsight and eyewitness accounts.I noticed three places shortly after the middle of the book where it appears lines have been scrambled or omitted, but apart from that, this kindle edition is well worth a read by anyone who wants to know what really happened."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"A must-read for anyone who enjoys Titanic lore. It reads like a very well-written newspaper article, so full of detail and personal observation that the author must've done a staggering amount of research.What I enjoyed most was hearing the story of the rescue on the Carpathia and the immediate aftermath for the survivors--not the part of the Titanic story we hear very often.(And I dare you to read this WITHOUT humming Celine Dion's \\"My Heart Will Go On.\\" Can't be done.)"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"The first time I ever read this book was many,many years ago and it was a library book. Now that this story has come into the 50th anniversary I bought A Night To Remember by the only authur who has ever written about the tremendous loss of life ever known on a cruise ship.It is always unfortunet to have changes made after a death but that is how this world works.As usual I cry throughout the whole true to life story and near the end I decided to go through each and every persons' name at the end of the book and read a little about each one finding out about their life and why they were coming to America writing down next to their name how old they were and what year they had died.I feel this is the only way they will be remembered and I will keep this book forever.The website to look up the people in first,second and third classes are:[...] or Second or Third Class whichever Class the person used to pay for a ticket."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I love the story of the tragedy &#34;Titanic.&#34; Ever since I was 9 I had been intrigued by the fact that there was a massive ship down there, waiting for it's second doom. I had read every book in the library about it, eventually looking for books about famous shipwrecks and oceans. But it didn't feed that curiosity, or urge. Then someone recommended &#34;A Night to Remember,&#34; and I read it. It was wonderful. The whole book is about the events that took place on that clear night. It is based on real interviews from survivors, and the remaining crew. It really takes an effect on you. It grabs you by the shoulders and makes you think, &#34;What would I have done? What could have they changed?&#34; I reccomendd this book to a person no younger than twelve, as the possibilities of crude language and eerie events are at stake. This book didn't fill up my curiosity level, but it fed most of it.:)"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"A Night to Remember by Walter Lord is the best telling of the sinking of the Titanic. Taken from many interviews with actual survivors of the tragedy, there are many intimate details of life on the big ship. A classic. Excellent!"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Overall, an insightful look into one of the most momentous events in our history. It does tend to drag on a bit in points because it goes into such depth with individual stories but some of these are deliciously entertaining. Take the good with the dull and don't feel bad if you can't keep the dozens of names which are thrown around straight in your head."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"We ave all read about the Titanic and we have all seen a million movies about the Titanic but this book certainly seems like the \\"real story\\"..Again I was pleased with the speed with which I received the book and also the condition of the book. I can't tell you enough how glad i am that I started using Amazon for all my reading material."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I consider this book a classic in the genre of Titanic accounts. A straight-forward account of the events that lead to the sinking. No analysing, no theorising, just a tale of what happened according to the various surviving eyewitnesses.This book lead to a memorable 1958 film of the same title, superbly produced and acted with scenes that haunted me as a youngster. Other books with finer detail, I'm sure, captivate, but I consider \\"A Night To Remember\\" as the definitive account and is the book to begin with for anyone interested in but not terribly familiar with the sinking of the Titanic."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"I liked it. If you know quite a lot about the Titanic disaster or if you know very little you will receive a great deal of detailed information, both personal and technical.The complete passenger list showing those that perished and those that survived is also a plus for this work.It still amazes me that a ship of this size and built with the latest technology available at the time sunk so quickly."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This historical account of the Titanic's sinking includes a myriad of stories from survivors, putting together the big picture of what was going on among the people on the ship the night Titanic sunk.The author used primary sources to put together this very readable text. I enjoyed reading the different accounts of the disaster in a mostly-chronological order. Particularly interesting were people's reactions as the events were unfolding. The author included stories from all classes, from survivors from all of the boats, so that the story could be pieced together accurately. It was incredibly interesting to me how little the people actually understood at the time about what was going on. When we look back in retrospect, it all seems very matter-of-fact, but while it was occurring, there was a lot of confusion, incorrect assumptions, and blatant mistakes being made by the passengers. Learning how the real people dealt with the real tragedy was far more interesting to me than hearing a made-up account of a fictional character from an author who could only speculate what it would be like."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This review is of A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, Walter Lord's 1955 account of the sinking of the Titanic (also inspiration for the 1958 movie), and still the \\"go-to\\" gold standard of Titanic histories. The time span is chronological between the time the ship hit the iceberg at 11:40 p.m. Sunday evening, April 14, 1912, and the survivors' rescue by the Carpathia at dawn Monday morning, several frigid hours after the Titanic had sunk. For his research, Lord conducted extensive interviews among Titanic survivors, usually quoting them directly; the impact of this book is such that their reminiscences still form the backbone of even the most modern accounts. Although the term had not yet been coined, the prose style is essentially that of a \\"non-fiction novel,\\" in which Lord's understated narrative lets the survivors speak for themselves, which is more than drama enough. Although some minor errors have been revealed with the passage of time, A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is still the place to start for those interested in the Titanic saga."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This book is not, nor tries to be, a complete forensic account of the tragedy. What it achieves superlatively with concise eloquence, is to place the reader amongst the travellers, eavesdropping on factual conversations as the nightmare progresses. It's emotive and riveting. And without ever raising the question, per se, it leaves the intelligent and empathetic reader challenged, and thinking: what would I have done?"},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"A Night to Remember is a really informative book for anyone interested in a detailed telling of the Titanic's fateful night. There is so much detail in fact, at times it does get a little confusing. However, once you get past all the names, this is a fascinating story of the ship's disaster and last hours."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is the next best thing to reading the 1912 Senate Hearings for the passenger's account of the last night on the Titanic. This was a very gripping book! You felt like you were on the ship by reading the accounts of the passengers after the maritime disaster. What stuck in my mind were the men that found out that the ship was sinking then retired to their state rooms and dressed in their fine evening wear and waited to die like gentlemen. It's hard to fathom how someone could accept their death and not try to save their life by trying to get on one of the lifeboats. Very brave and macho. I kinda got pissed off at Lightoller and how he misinterpreted the Captain's orders as being \\"women and children ONLY\\" instead of \\"women and children, FIRST\\". So, basically during the what, 1 hour of lifeboat loading, he only let one male boy get on. All men were barred on his side of the ship. Basically, this meant that most of his lifeboats were dropped into the Atlantic half-full or less since the women were scared of leaving the comfort of their ship and their men which weren't allowed to accompany them."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"This is a great book. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the facts surrounding the Titanic tragedy. Based on survivor interviews and written in an interesting manner that makes you feel as though you're watching it all take place. Includes fascinating information about society in the early 20th century."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Walter Lord does a first rate job of putting the reader on the Titanic that fateful night. He captures the immensity of the event, the horror of the passengers and the bravery of some. The book is very readable and most will find it difficult to put down. There is a great list of resources for further reading/study. I recommend this book without hesitation."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"It is pretty clear that this nonfiction book was the inspiration for the blockbuster movie. Much of the historically accurate action and dialogue in the movie is directly from this work. Engaging and interesting."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the mot famous events of the twentieth century. It has spawned numerous books, movies (including one of the highest grossing of all time), poems, songs and even a full-fledged Broadway musical. Considering all that material, it might seem difficult to believe that there would be a definitive account of the sinking. The late Walter Lord's 1955 book A Night To Remember could very well be called just that. Though published more then a half century ago, Lord's book remains a well researched, fast paced and highly accessible account of the events of April 14th-15th, 1912.Unlike many Titanic books, Lord chose to focus A Night To Remember on just about a dozen hours of the Titanic's story: namely the events from 11:40 PM on April 14th through about the same hour the following morning. Lord wisely decided not to focus on one person or group as well but instead used accounts and interviews from various survivors to create a books that seems to effortlessly wander around both the Titanic herself and the people aboard her. We float from the likes of the Astor and Thayer families in first class to teacher Lawrence Beesley in second class to Daniel Buckley and Katy Gilnagh in third class to members of the ship's crew like second officer Charles Lightoller and wireless operator Harold Bride. In doing so Lord created a fascinating human drama played out for the most part on an 882 foot stage filled with people from all walk's of life.On occasion Lord does venture away from Titanic towards other aspects of that night. The now classic prologue with its surprising twist of eerie coincidence is a fine example of this. Nine of the ten chapters of the book go about ten or so miles away from the Titanic to another ship, the Californian, which thanks to this book (and the film version of it released in 1958) would once again find itself in the middle of a controversy that continues on to this very day. The reader is also given glimpses to the wider world outside of the sinking liner such as chapter seven which looks at the aftermath of the sinking or the final chapter that finally shows the reader the reaction in New York City and around the world to the immediate aftermath of the sinking. While the book mainly focuses on the sinking itself and its immediate aftermath, these occasional ventures are welcomed indeed.The book is also helped by its brisk pacing. One might expect that to do all of the above A Night To Remember must have a page count equal to that of a great epic novel of the past. But the truth is quite different. Lord does all of the above in a mere 180 or so pages (based on the page count of the 1997 Bantam Books reprint). The ability to float from place to place, person to person makes up for a large portion of this. When needed though, Lord narrows the narrative focus down to a single moment in time. This is no better illustrated then with Lord's truly incredible description of the Titanic's final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic that, while not stating that the ship broke up as it sank (a fact not confirmed until thirty years after the book was published and that Lord would explore along with other Titanic issues in his follow-up to this book published in 1986), leaves one more then capable of imaging both the sights and sounds of that very moment. While the brisk pacing and constant moving about may leave some readers with the feeling the book is unfocused the truth is that the book is anything but.A Night To Remember is more then just another book on the sinking of the Titanic. It is a true epic that wanders from person to person, place to place as it recreates one of the most famous disasters of all time. It is a non-fiction book that feels more like a great novel and as such remains pretty much as definitive today as it was more then a half century ago."},{"Title":"A Night to Remember","review":"Walter Lord's book may not contain the very latest findings on the Titanic sinking but it is well written and a quick read well worth the time spent. There is a good reason this book is still in print and considered a classic account.

He suggests a theory of urban design based on fundamental human values and examines how such values lead to the notion of a &quot;good city form&quot;. His performance dimensions (e.g. access, fit, vitality) are broad enough to be interpreted and re-interpreted for specific contexts and sites. And the appendix, which briefly summarizes other theories of city form, is a tour-de-force by itself. A masterpiece which deserves greater attention and consideration, especially by those under the illusion that urban design is more or less architecture writ large!"},{"Title":"A Theory of Good City Form","review":"As one who straddles the two worlds of practice and scholarship with great ease and comfort, I am struck by that rare work of craft which is at once profoundly thoughtful as well as clearly directed. Most serious scholars bend over backwards to embrace the myth of \\"objectivity\\", while most practitioners salivate over superficial \\"best practices\\". Kevin Lynch's masterpiece, Good City Form, avoids both traps while offering a template for judging the effectiveness of different types of urban form and providing a guide for successful urban design projects. His starting points, a masterful overview of models of urban form throughout history and a sensitive ode to humanist values, help establish a foundation for performance dimensions to measure \\"good city form\\": Vitality, Sense, Fit, Access, Control, Efficiency and Justice.As an example, the discussion of what city design is (i.e. urban design) on pages 290-291 is masterful. Unlike many design theoreticians, Lynch uses simple and direct language rather than resort to pretension and manipulation of terminology. Beyond the deceptively simplistic tone is a multilayered understanding and more importantly a genuine love of the city. Lynch is a keen observer, a sensitive designer, and a profound thinker. Thus, his definition of what urban design should be discusses three aspects of cities: human activity, process and control, and of course, physical form. Indeed, as my own professional experience has shown to me, in order to be a truly impactful urban designer, one needs to pay close attention to all these aspects of what makes a city.I would highly recommend this book to reflective practitioners, scholars interested in the practice of urban design, and students interested in shaping the future of our cities. Practicing urban designers would do well to pay heed to Lynch's discussions of control and justice in the design process. For those who are new to the field, the book works well with two others as an excellent advanced introduction to urban design: \\"The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings Through History\\" by Spiro Kostof, and \\"Urban Design Downtown: Poetics and Politics of Form\\" by Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris and Tridib Banerjee. What the three books share is a profound sense of humanity in the design of cities that is much more critical than the ebb and flow of design fashions."},{"Title":"Radical Vegetarianism","review":"I am usually receptive to this type of book given that I am a vegetarian with vegan tendencies.

As a cat humorist and author (Lessons in Stalking...Adjusting to Life With Cats), it takes a lot to make me laugh and this book more than did the trick. Clever, original, and often naughty... a great gift for any cat lover in your life."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"Every cat in here has cat-itude (which is like attitude but for cats).

Although it does state that it's a paperback, it appears to be one of those larger sized paperbacks from the picture and from the price as well.

The photos are ordinary - everyone has a few whacky cat photos and these are no better than the ones anyone out there will have.

A dim 7 year old with no sense of creativity or humor."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"Poor quality photographs with very ordinary cat settings aren't the biggest letdown of this book.

Unlike cats... this book is foul and disgusting."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"Some cute photos, but the tag lines were inane, at best.

In fact, I bought two. One was a gift for my sister, but it was such a good gift idea that she already had a copy.It's a shame you can't really pick it up and flip through it online. The photos are hilarious, but what really makes them stand out is the short one-line zingers for each cat.Some of the humour is very low brow like toilet humour. However, the book is brilliant because Jim Edgar seamlessly mixes in sophisticated references throughout the text, making it even funnier. He'll use references to \\"cleavage\\" and \\"Krispy Kreme\\", but then throw in some phrases about \\"Yeltsin\\" and \\"glucosamine\\".It's got a nice bold graphic style that makes it suitable for both men and women. You might want to pass on this for small children though.

Since I am a cat lover I looked inside just to find out why on earth anybody would make such a bad cover. Thank God I did look inside! - The book is simply hilarious! I bought the book and took it home for further amusement. After going through the whole book I also learned to appreciate the cover. I have to compliment the author for a brilliant idea!By the way, my boyfriend, who is NOT a cat lover and used to dislike my two pets with passion, seems to have changed his attitude towards my cats after having a lot of fun with \\"Bad Cat\\". What's even more interesting, he gave me for my birthday another book with a BEAUTIFUL cover, titledWhy Some Cats are Rascals, Book 2.

A must for any cat fan!"},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"If you like cats but are allergic to their dandruff, this book will give you delight without the sneezes.If you're not allergic, you can appreciate your well-behaved kitty while reading about all the bad ones."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"As the proud slave to two feisty felines (mine are Devon Rex -- need I say more?), I was intrigued by the title of this little tome. I ordered one for myself and nearly busted a gut laughing. I ended up ordering several more as gifts for my cat-loving friends. Anyone who as ever co-habited with cats for any length of time will recognize some of the characters featured in \\"Bad Cat.\\" The photos are funny enough -- add the captions, and you're in for an hour or so of hysterical laughter. Really. I'm not kidding. You love cats? You'll love this.

I only have one cat, but they are so hilarious, and the pictures in the book prove it. The text gets stale in some areas, but it would be hard to come up with a good line for that many funny pictures, especially the ones[pics] that speak for themselves.) The fact it was titled \\"BAD CAT\\" made me buy it...that is my cat's evil twin's name... :D Buy it if you are a sucker for cute cats and your coffee table needs something new!"},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"I have little to add to the other positive reviews except you cannot possibly go wrong buying this book. I received it as a gift on March 30th and I still laugh out loud every time I pick it up. It's pure silly fun and everyone I've shown it to has laughed along with me. Even dog people. And you won't mind the fact it's not very large. Fits in your purse better this way."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"Just one of the many humorous captions in this laugh-out-loud book. My girlfriend and I saw it on display at a local bookstore and after browsing over half the book while standing there laughing out loud, (as the other patrons cast curious glances upon us) we knew we had to buy it. In fact we each purchased a copy. Some of the one-liners get a little stale near the end of the book and may seem a little repetitive, but that is an extremely minor quibble with such an entertaining little book.I don't see how anyone could NOT be greatly amused by the outrageous pictures of funky felines and the equally outrageous captions that go along with them. (Don't overlook the \\"hobbies\\" at the bottom of each page as they are also very entertaining)."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"There is no way a cat lover could get through this book without roaring!

My husband ordered it and I thought he was nuts. But after looking through the pages I LOVE THIS BOOK! The pictures are funny but the captions are even better. Everytime you need a laugh just pick it up and open it to any page and you will be cracking up! The pages that are displayed on Amazon do not do this book justice. I have since bought this book for family and friends because it is so funny. I have yet to have anyone pick it up and not laugh hysterically."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"This book is too funny! I love this book! I was in line at Barnes & Noble and noticed it on my way out. It cracked me up so much and I had to get back in line and buy it. Each page has a funny picture on it and a little caption at that bottom, which includes the cats name, age and occupation. I own Bad Dog as well but this one is the better of the two. I think the reason that this one is funnier is because cats are so independent and you don't really expect to see them in certain situations that when you do, its hilarious. I laughed so hard I cried through most of this book and would recommend it to any animal lover looking for a good laugh."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"Great little book if you have a couple hours to kill and need a laugh.

A mistake when I learned that she loved it so much that she took it to school to show her friends. This apparantely contains some adult language and depictions.

Oh My Goodness! I can not remember laughing so hard in my life - so hard that coffee almost came out of my nose (ouch!).The photos in this book are hysterical... page after page of crazy cats in either crazy situations or showing their true evil side with glowing eyes and baring fangs.Even funnier than the actual photos are the captions/bios.

The pictures are the thing. I found the text a bit irritating and silly, but the pictures really speak for themselves. The photos largely fall into two categories: spontaneous photos and posed photos. I personally would never take any of the latter. My favorites here are, therefore, the spontaneous, unposed photographs. I just don't enjoy cats dressed up or otherwise decked out. My experience as a cat owner has always been that they really don't appreciate such antics.Oh, I once knew a neighborhood cat who would climb up screens like the one on p. 103. More than once he would scare people to death when they'd look up to see this critter seemingly hanging there in midair."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"I received this book as a gift and was pleased because I had been led to believe that it dealt with \\"bad\\" (as in misbehaving) cats.

Mojo weighs a hefty 23 pounds and is actually the most gorgeous, lovable cat I've ever seen, but let's face it, he is a fat cat. I compromise by calling him \\"Big Boy\\" and she never objects to that.The cats in Mr. Edgar's book definitely have attitude, which seems to be a popular thing to have in today's world. Cutting-edge cats! How very clever!I saw this book on Amazon and just had to order it for her. We both love it, needless to say. If you want a book that will make your day, get your copy NOW."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"It's a funny book that I like to leave out for company to see and enjoy.

The price is ok."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"Jim Edgar's first delve into the psychology of Cat is actually more similar to the Bad Cat Calendar than his follow-up. Here you have 244 Cats and kitties captured in full color on film in compromising positions, intending to spread \\"badwill\\" to humanity. This book contains slightly more text than does his second venture. Here, the captions run a bit longer, and included is a category for the age of the feline in question, plus a tongue-in-cheek\\" hobby of the relevant mystical beast.All cat lovers will enjoy this book as well as his follow-up (see my separate review for that one). There is a tinge of political incorrectness in the introduction as Edgar writes, \\"while you sit amongst ... empty fo'ties of Schlitz Malt Liquor ...\\" in reference to man's ignorance of Cat's real agenda. I love that line.

I found Bad Cat in Hawkins Bazaar (a joke shop in the UK). I flicked through the book in the shop and knew I had to get it.Each page is a picture of a different cat in a different pose with a little biography for that cat, Name, Age and Hobby. There is also a caption for each picture. Some of the pictures are hilarious and made me laugh out loud; some of them are not as funny but brought a smile to my face.The forward written by Jim Edgar explains how the book was put together and why. It also links to the website for the book where you can find many more pictures of cats. I will most definitely be checking it out.I'm interested in finding out if there is a follow up book to this or any other animal books in the same lines as this one as I am sure it will be hilarious.I would give Bad Cat 4/5."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"This is a wonderful book to the cat lovers in your family!

This collection of cat candids explores the very depth of the charming malevolence and contempt exhibited by all felines. Each page has a hysterical photograph of a cat exhibiting his or her true personality, a caption/quote from the cat, the cat's name and age, and the cat's hobby. After the photographs themselves, the captions and hobbies are the funniest parts of the book.This book is for any cat lover who loves the fact that their cat isn't the personality-less slobbering sycophant (like dogs can be) and suspects that their cat really does dream about big things like, say, taking over the world or committing acts of mass destruction just for the heck of it. I know my cats sure do.It's hard to read this book without laughing like a moron, so keep that in mind. So far, I have bought three copies to give as gifts, and I'm already planning on buying more. I don't know how the author (who doesn't actually own any cats of his own) can capture the thoughts of the cats so well, but he certainly seems to be able to read their minds.This book was assembled of owner-submitted pictures by the webmaster of the www.mycathatesyou.com website.

But there are still some remote places on the planet where there are no Internet connections, much less broadband (for example, Missouri). For those poor, unfortunate souls, Jim Edgar, the supreme guru of mycathatesyou, has distilled two hundred forty-four of the site's most wanted, given them captions, and turned them into this small, hilarious book.Pictures of cats who look like they want to kill you are relatively commonplace, and have been ever since someone decided that trying to photograph a cat was a good idea. Edgar, however, has a knack of putting captions with the pictures that induce laughter. (As in, out-loud, make-people-on-the-street-look-at-you-funny laughter.) The captions are what turn this from a work of unbearable cuteness into the greatness it is.

This isn't so much of a \\"reading\\" book review as it is a review of a book that is laugh-out-loud funny... Bad Cat by James Edgar.This is a small book (in size, not necessarily in pages) that show pictures (244 of them) of cats in humorous or outrageous poses. Edgar adds captions to them that take the book from \\"that's funny\\" to \\"you've GOT to see this!\\". These are not your typical cute cat pictures you'd see in some calendar or coffee table book. No, these are photos like...A guilty-looking cat next to a naked Barbie doll with the caption \\"She was naked when I came in.\\"A disgusted cat stretched out on the piano keyboard - \\"I told you -- nobody wants to hear Billy Joel.\\"The cat laying next to what looks like a dead squirrel - \\"I think the play date's over...\\"Yes, I have a warped sense of humor...This is one of those books that will take you about 15 minutes to read, but you'll probably laugh more in that 15 minutes than you have all day. If you easily offended by semi-off-color humor or if you're a cat lover who can't take a joke, then you'll probably alternate between \\"that's funny\\" and \\"that's cruel\\".

I just bought 2 copies of this book for relatives for Christmas. Both have owned their own real Bad Cats, as have I (she went by Anna the Terrible.) I got the box today, and gently cracked one copy open to see what it was like inside. By page 49, I must have laughed out loud at least 10 times. Not much in life will crack me up when I'm sitting in my dining room by myself. This book does. Let me give you a glimpse into one page, the aforementioned page 49: the photo shows only a glimpse of the hind legs of a tabby, with the rest buried inside a pool table pocket. The caption reads, \\"I found my drink.\\" Under the photo are the cat stats: NAME: Laverne. AGE: 8. Hobby: Foosball. There is a lot of crazy tweaked-out wit packed in these well-designed pages. Trust me on this, you will laugh. Oh yes, you will... If not, you are hopeless, or perhaps, catatonic. If you only have had Saintly Cats, this book will show you the Dark Side of cat-dom. Buy it."},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"My neighbors came over with this book in hand. They were laughing so hard I gaped at them nonplussed. When they left I looked up the book online and found it was nominated for the Quill Award. (Jon Stewart from the Daily Show won.)I picked up a copy of the book at a local bookstore and I'm so glad I did. No, it's not about the feline mystique, a sour reviewer's complaint. But, Bad Cat is a gem in disguise.The book is about Jim Edgar's edgy, goofy, Far Side sense of humor. I celebrate it! The quirky, offbeat photographs make the captions all the more hilarious. I even keep a copy in my car. Edgar is a genius at whacky, unconventional humor. Thank you for riotous laughter!"},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"You dont even have to like cats. I laughed till I had black tears.Warning!

I couldn't put it down so I had to buy it...and to boot, I bought one for my mother-in-law to cheer her up! Not to mention that I usually don't write online reviews unless they are bad!"},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"This book is hysterically funny and pure genius. I have bought over the years many books full of cute animal pictures and sometimes humorous captions, but all of them have been just that; cute. This is the only one I can really go through over and over. These 244 photographs of cats are the kind that make you wonder just how it was possible that the owner had a camera out at the perfect moment to take a snapshot of the animal doing something truly funny. The quote that accompanies each one is unique in that they really and honestly look as though the cat is saying/thinking exactly what the page says. The book is brilliant in this way. It is such fun to flip through, and is suitable for everyone's enjoyment, not just cat lovers. What I also love about it is that the photos were gathered from the submissions to the Workman Publishing Co.'s page-a-day cat calendar, so they come from average cat owners, meaning that highly recognizable little things show up in some of the pictures. Plush Kermit the Frogs and Trolls can be found a few times throughout. On page 71, Ravi, one of my favorite cats in the book, wears a hat with a familiar technicolor cat pattern and Tigger summertime sunglasses. On 117, Kevin eyes a Betta fish in a blender. Cap'n Hairball on 151 looks like a true pirate. Page 163's Marcella uses a lightbulb for a crystal ball. Battista on 167 seems to speak to a silky terrier. Svetlana on 178 talks about two Grinch slippers. 195 has a classic angry cat. 13 shows a kitty kissing a sexy cobra--\\"I said no tongue!\\" Tough for a snake to kiss without it. Pages 183 and 198 were two pictures that convinced me to buy the book when I opened to them at the store. And if I could take home any of the cats in the book, I might just choose Perry on page 158 and Lex on 219. Not sure why; they just appeal to me tremendously. Lex's big orange eyes (\\"Could I look any less like a cat?\\") and Perry's face. And all those page numbers are just a tiny fraction of my favorite and most remarkable entries in the book! Furthermore, the name, age, and hobby of each very naughty feline are notated. Just wait until you see some of these cat's expressions and positions! I highly recommend \\"Bad Cat.\\""},{"Title":"Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad","review":"I picked up a review copy at BookExpo and spent an hour laughing out loud in the airport waiting area.

They show cats \\"gone wild\\" in various candid poses featuring a quote revealing insight into the cat's innermost thoughts.

The book includes a rich narrative of the voyage that began in 1872 as a scientific expedition to survey flora and fauna on land and sea including deep dredging of the ocean floor. Period photographs and engravings are supplemented by modern photographs; illustrations are found on most pages. My favorites are color reproductions of Pelham Aldrich's journal pages that include great watercolors of the ship and scenes from the voyage painted on the same pages as his narrative script.I would recommend the hardcover since I'm not sure the paperback has all of the color plates."},{"Title":"Considerable Passions: Golf, the Masters and the Legacy of Bobby Jones","review":"A delightful telling of Jones' life and his contributions to golf.

A downside to this volume is that Dr. Lewis engages in some speculation concerning Jones' attitude toward race that does not hold up to the experience of those who actually knew him. Although this volume is nice, a better treatment of Jones' life is Sidney Matthew's outstanding - but somewhat hagiographical - volume, \\"Life and Times of Bobby Jones: Portrait of a Gentleman.\\""},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This Book, I believe, is a great work concerning what Calvinism is and is not.

I was a confirmed Arminian before I read this book. This book is not all about the Doctrines of Predestination, but rather they are also about the Doctrines of Election, Total Depravity, The Nature of the New Birth, and the Power of the Holy Spirit to perservere. This book does a great job of not only presenting the doctrines in a well organized fashion, but is throughly Biblical and encounters and respectfully answers questions and criticisms, everything from &quot;The Perserverance of the Saints is antinominalism,&quot; to, &quot;It is in violation of man's free agency&quot;...all the sections regarding those objections are throughly answered.

A must read for Born Again Christians &amp; Roman Catholics. I never really understood the magnitude of the words 'unmerited Grace' until this book."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Loraine Boettner leaves very few small stones uncovered with his convincing discourse of the truth of Calvinism. This book is appoximately 400 pages and slightly less than half the book covers the biblical explanation of what the Five Points of Calvinism, while another significant portion of the book devotes an apologetic defense of this doctrine and debunks a lot of myths and misconceptions typically presented by opponents of this doctrine. Boettner also devotes the final portion of the book revealing the history of Calvinism from the time of the reformation up to the 20th century.The only thing that's slightly bothersome about this book is that it was written over 70 years ago, so some of the language used is a bit dated and the Bible verses given are presented in the old American Standard Version, which reads very similar to the King James Version. I used my own NIV Bible as a cross reference while reading this book.Overall, it's a classic and a must-have for anyone who desires to understand the truth of God's Sovereignty and Grace and man's total inability to come to God on his own for salvation."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This book is a phenomenal work. I would recommend it to anyone seeking more information on Calvinism. Boettner addresses the difficult issues with the doctrine very adeptly and provides the reader with a very solid understanding of the Biblical basis and practical implications of the doctrine.A must read for any reformed theologian/enthusiast and strongly recommended to opponents to the doctrine or those seeking more information on the reformed perspective to this Biblical teaching."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is a book about Calvinism written for those who don't really understand it, or have a limited understanding. He goes into great depth, but doesnt make the reader feel like they would need a Masters in Theology to know what he's talking about.Good exegessis of scripture, and fantastic answers to the objections most Calvinists face. I'm glad he didnt make a straw man out of Arminian doctrine, I think he gives a fair and honest representation of what Arminianism is.I'd give in 4.5 stars if I could.The only problem I had with the book is that it goes too far in saying or implyhing that God is the author of Sin.....not sure if I was just reading it wrong, but a couple of passages made me sit up and go back over what I'd just read. This has been a reaction of a lot of Calvinists who overstate the position of Calvin, but clearly he can't mean this as he quotes from the Westminster confession on Election.The grammar and style of writing can be a bit old, my edition is from the 1950's so thats gotta say something about it.Its still a great read after all these years, and a worthy addition to your Theology collection."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This Book, I believe, is a great work concerning what Calvinism is and is not.

At the time this was revealed to me, I was unaware that I was among His elect. It never ocurred to me to feel outrage, though I observed and still observe this emotion in people, particularly in people who claim to love God. The mere thought of shaking a fist in God's face frightened me beyond words to tell, so I couldn't imagine how anyone could not fall prostrate when confronted with the true attributes of the Creator? Now, years later, I understand that this outrage in people comes from a misunderstanding of who God really is. Boettner does an outstanding job of illuminating and explaining God's sovereignty. If you've ever been impressed with the divine importance of sharing God's incomparable ways with a friend who is searching, or if you yourself are serious about knowing God for who He truly is, pick up the Holy Bible, then pick up a copy of \\"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination.\\" While God's Word needs no accompaniment, Boettner's book is certainly something to be studied, if for no other reason than its important and biblically urgent reminder that there is no room for compromise when it comes to sharing Truth with those who would hear."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"As this work shows, Boettner was greatly influenced by the great Princeton theologians such as Warfield and Hodge. Both of these men were deep advocates of the system of theology known as Calvinism. Warfield believed that evangelicalism stands or falls with Calvinism, and Hodge wrote one of the great systematic treatments of Calvinism ever produced. To these efforts, Boettner adds this work which expounds on Calvinism generally, and the reformed doctrine of predestination specifically.The book is broken up into 5 sections - establishing the reality of predestination in Scripture, expounding on the 5 points of Calvinism, answering Arminian objections to Calvinism, and then looking at Calvinism in history and its meaning to the Christian life. Each section is good, with some being better than others. The section which responds to the Arminian objections to the doctrines of grace is the best section, and in particular, decimates objections against exertion and evangelism.Boettner's treatment of Calvinism in history is a bit dated, but still informative when taken up to the time when he wrote this book. In particular, Boettner eloquently demonstrates that Calvinism is a theology that while centered on the sovereignty and holiness of God, produces a level of human action that is unparalleled. This says a great deal not only about the viability of Calvinism, but also of the problematic nature of man-centered theologies like Arminianism which have actually failed to inspire the level of human action and world change that Calvinism can rightly lay claim to.The one weakness of the book is that while Boettner extensively quotes Scripture to establish his views, his exegesis is not as strong as it should be, and this is a disappointment. It was clear that Boettner was attempting to demonstrate that the clear, plain and repeated teachings of Scripture plainly support Calvinism in such a way that to take issue with these teachings requires rather elaborate and exotic (not to mention mostly erroneous) reinterpretations in order to get around them. While this is certainly true, it would nonetheless have been helpful had Boettner made a greater investment in Biblical exegesis.So while it's not perfect, it is nonetheless a mostly persuasive apology for Calvinism that continued the great tradition of old Princeton to demand a coherent theology that is faithful to Scripture and can refute the best arguments made against it."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"I was reading John Owen's book on limited atonement and this book at the same time. I finished this one in a few weeks. I'm still working on Owen's book. In other words, Boettner's book is a much easier read. Boettner's book does a good job of introducing the reformed doctrines. He starts with the biblical foundation of different aspects of the sovereignty of God, namely, providence and foreknowledge. In the next section he uses God's sovereignty as a springboard to explain each of the five points of Calvinism. He then addresses objections in the next section. Section IV is unnamed, but basically tries to balance out the distorted view of Calvinism that focusing of the five points gives. He then goes on to explain the practical importance of Calvinism and then gives a brief historical overview.The reason I didn't give the book five stars is many. The book is unabashedly supportive of Calvinism and the Presbyterian church in particular. He is not a thorough exegete like John Owen, so he gives more a general overview and does not get into the details of the arguments. I don't think he addresses the objections as thoroughly as he should. Another point, since I don't believe in Amillennialism so some of his arguments fall flat. The book paints Calvinism in history in broad strokes. He writes a nice, short summary of Calvin's life. He even has a short defense of Calvin for his part in the Servetus trial. However, his history of Calvinism makes Calvinism the driving force of the American Revolution and all that is good in the world. It may be so, but I don't think he proves his thesis and it may be impossible to prove it in a one small volume.In summary, the book is an excellent introduction to the Reformed faith. The writing is easy to read and the arguments are pretty easy to follow. He tries to be fair to his enemies and it is a very positive book. The history is the weakest part of the book, but even that has some good sections in it. This book may not convince a true Arminian, but it does present the doctrines in a clear manner. He helped me understand limited atonement better than anyone else, and I think he does a very good job with the other 4 points."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Whether you agree or not with reformed theology, this book is the Gold Standard for understanding the Five Points of Calvinism. Boettner is thorough, scholarly but very readable and never boring. He not only explains the Five Points but goes into the history of them and the effects that they have had on the world at large. This was the book that moved me from being a convinced Calvinist to a convicted one. There is plenty of Scripture to back up each and every one of his statements and arguments.Excellent book and a great reference tool."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"The truth of God is displayed by a true theologian, who realizes the most important category of truth is the nature of God. One's understanding of God is the single, most important, central element in spiritual experience.Martin Luther:'All things whatever arise from, and depend on the divine appointment: whereby it was foreordained who should receive the Word of Life and who should disbelieve it; who should be delivered in their sins and who should be hardened in them; who should be justified and who should be condemned.'John Calvin:'For they are not all created with a similar destiny; but eternal life is foreordained for some and eternal death for others. Every man, therefore, being created for these ends, we say he is predestined either for life or death.' 'God preordained, for His own glory, and the display of His attributes of mercy and justice, a part of the human race, without any merit of their own, to eternal salvation.'GOD HAS A PLAN: Chapter 3'Since the finite creation through its whole range exists as a medium through which God manifests His glory, and since it is absolutely dependent on Him, it of itself could originate no conditions which would limit or defeat the manifestation of that glory.' p 14'It is unthinkable that a God of infinite wisdom and power would create a world without a definite plan for that world. We cannot conceive of God bringing into existence a universe without a plan which would extend to all that would be done in that universe. If God...waited until some undetermined condition was or was not fulfilled, His decrees could be neither eternal nor immutable. We know, however, that He is incapable of mistake.' pp. 20-21 abridgedTHE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD: Chapter 4'God has lost none of His power, and it is highly dishonoring to Him to suppose that He is struggling along with the human race doing the best He can, but unable to accomplish His purposes. Nothing can come to pass apart from His sovereign will; and far sooner the sun be stopped in its course than God be hindered in His will. By virtue of the fact that God has created every thing which exists, He is the absolute Owner and final Disposer of all that He has made. Amid all the apparent defeats and inconsistencies of life God actually moves on in undisturbed majesty. His omnipotence is as sure a guarantee that the course of the world will conform to His plan as is His holiness a guarantee that all His works will be right.' abridgedTHE PROVIDENCE OF GOD: Chapter 5'All things without exception, indeed, are disposed by Him, and His will is the ultimate account of all that occurs. Heaven and earth and all that is in them are the instruments through which He works His ends. Dr Warfield says, 'The writers rarely use such expressions as it rains; they instinctively speak of God sending rain.' p 31'But while the Bible repeatedly teaches that this providential control is universal, powerful, wise, and holy, it nowhere attempts to inform us how it is to be reconciled with man's free agency. All that we need to know is that God does govern His creatures and that His control over them is such that no violence is done to their natures.' p 38Boettner on Total Inability:'As human beings we know that an act of service rendered to us by someone who is at heart our enemy, does not merit our love and approbation. The Scripture statement that 'Without faith it is impossible to please God', finds it explanation in this: that faith is the foundation of all the other virtues.' p 69Boettner on the Remnant:'This is shown more plainly in Rom 11:2-5 where we read, 'God did not cast off His people whom He foreknew. Even so, then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.' p 100'The Scriptures represent Election as occurring in the past time, irrespective of merit, and altogether sovereign. Rom 9: 11,12. Arminian theology teaches that though a person does accept salvation, he may fall away again. They identify the time of salvation with the death of the believer, as if only then his salvation became certain. But it is always to the love of God that the Scriptures never weary of raising our eyes, and the biblical writers take special pains to give each believer assurance that from all eternity he has been the peculiar object of the divine choice.' pp. 95-96'Calvinists therefore hold that election precedes, and is not based upon any good works which the person does. Foreordination alone cannot rest on foreknowledge.' p 99"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Some people avoid labels for their beliefs and this includes Christians. They will particularly avoid labels for various understandings of Christian theology. But without labels, every time you want to explain your theological framework you need to launch into a lengthy discussion. But if you use terms (e.g. orthodox, liberal, reformed and evangelical) much can be conveyed immediately.The Reformed label for a particular understanding of Christian theology has seen a resurgence in recent decades. But exactly what is Reformed theology? Basically it is the understanding that God is sovereign in the salvation of man (i.e. every Christian was predestined to be a Christian long before they lived). And it is called Reformed because it was a key teaching of the Reformation. Of course the Reformers taught much more than predestination, but believing in God's complete sovereignty in salvation is essential if one wishes to call themselves Reformed.So what is entailed in the Reformed doctrine of predestination? Boettner's book is an old but helpful defense of the Reformed doctrine of Predestination. Initially in the book Boettner asserts key doctrines concerning God's planning, sovereignty, providence and foreknowledge. Then he moves on to teach the five points of Calvinism:(i) Total inability/depravity;(ii) Unconditional election;(iii) Limited atonement;(iv) Efficacious/Irresistible grace;(v) Perseverance of the saints.Then Boettner answers common objections against Reformed doctrine:(i) it is fatalism;(ii) it is illogical;(iii) it makes God the author of sin;(iv) it discourages motivation to exertion;(v) it represents God as unjustly partial;(vi) it is unfavourable to good morality;(vii) it precedes a sincere offer of the gospel;(viii) it contradicts the universalistic Scripture passages.Next Boettner teaches about other relevant issues including the harmony of Reformed doctrine with science and Islam. The book then closes with a quick review of Calvinism in church history.My only problem with the book is that it briefly promotes post-millennial eschatology and seems to be ignorant of Reformed Baptists.Nevertheless, if you are trying to understand what exactly is Reformed theology, Boettner's book is an excellent and convincing treatment of the subject."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is one of the best and most scholarly works on the Reformed faith one can read. Boettner is truly one of the modern Church's top theologians. This work should be in the library of every student of theology. It should be placed right next to Calvin's institutes and the works of Warfield, Berkhof, Dabney, and Hodge. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"The Reformed Doctrine Of PredestinationBe aware that there are two Kindle editions of this text. The .99 one is not Kindle friendly. The $2.50 edition is the better cyber edition as the table of contents are accessible to direct you to a specific chapter as opposed to having to page/flip through each chapter until you've found the one you wish to read. I would, at the same time, recommend this text to anyone interested in, new to reformed theology, or a veteran to the subject."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"If you want a very clear explanation of the doctrine of predestination, you will be hard pressed to read any other book that does as good a job as this one does. Boettner lays out the case for the doctrine and uses ample scripture and cogent reasoning to support it. Not only does Boettner cover predestination in particular, but he also deals with reformed theology in general; specifically he has a detailed discussion of the 5 points of Calvinism.If I were to criticize this book, I would have liked to have seen a fuller treatment of reformed theology. While the 5 points of the Calvinistic system are foundational, they do not cover the entire breadth of reformed theology.With all that said, I would like to list the topics that Boettner covers in this book:1) God's plan; sovereignty; providence; foreknowledge; authority of the scripture2) Five points of Calvinism : total inability; unconditional election; limited atonement; efficacious grace; perseverance of the saints3) Objections : fatalism; God the author of sin; discourages good works; God as respecter of persons; unfavorable to morality; precludes a sincere offer of the gospel; contradicts universalistic passages4) Salvation by grace; personal assurance; predestination for the physical world; comparison with Islam5) Practical importance of predestination6) Calvinism in historyAs you can see, a lot of ground is covered in this book. I think it is worth everyone's serious attention and consideration. Boettner makes a very strong case and to me at least, he is convincing. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Our pastor recommended this book written by an old friend of his.

I see there is another Kindle edition, published by New Century and advertised as having an improved table of contents.The lack of any table of contents (not to mention a linked table of contents) is a serious problem with this edition. Moreover, this edition for some reason lacks the section divisions and headings that are in the original. Thus, for example, when one gets to Chapter XV, one sees the title \\"It Is Fatalism\\" without realizing that this is the first chapter in Section III, \\"Objections Commonly Urged Against the Reformed Doctrine of Predestination.\\" (I only found out about the section divisions and headings via the \\"Look Inside\\" feature that Amazon makes available for print editions.)This Kindle edition also lacks linked footnotes, but they are provided at the end of each chapter, which is the next best thing. There are a fair number of typos, a common problem with Kindle editions that (fortunately) most publishers seem to be getting under control.The content itself is very good, as other reviewers have pointed out. If you want a Kindle edition, however, I would suggest trying the New Century edition first."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is a sound exposition of the biblical doctrine of predestination.It is the only book from Loraine Boettner I have read,in my view,it shouldbe essential reading for any christian regarding this great doctrine."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"unabashedly Calvinist,Boettner works thru this subject with continual references to Holy Scripture.very engaging.highly recommended.the kindle edition replaces my well-worn hard-copy.his text on Roman Catholicism is also first-rate!"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"I was an Arminian who didn't understand Calvinism. After reading The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination I was convinced that the Reformed position is the most Biblical. It lays the case for Calvinism before the reader in such clear language that he can not misunderstand what the Refomed position really teaches. It is very persuasive in refuting the arguments against predestination while laying a solid biblical foundation for it's teachings. Boettner is very thorough in his use of Scripture to support his arguments. Anyone wishing to understand Calvinism must read this book. Boettner's arguments are so powerful that they demand your assent. This book was life changing."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Anyone interested in the Reformed faith (or Calvinism) should start here. It is easy to read and suited for the layperson. The book is divided into six sections: In the first section he deals with terms and concepts related to predestination (e.g., the sovereignty of God, the providence of God, the foreknowledge of God, etc.). The first section is an excellent start-off point for the reader. The second section deals with the five points (or TULIP). Boettner does an excellent job explaining what each of the five points mean (and what it does NOT mean). The third section deals with common objections presented by non-Calvinists against the Calvinistic understanding of predestination. Boettner, again, does a fine job refuting the typical arguments of non-Calvinists. The fourth section deals with issues of salvation by grace, personal assurance, predestination in the physical world, etc. The fifth chapter deals with the practical importance of the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination. Finally, the sixth chapter deals with the history of Calvinism. The chapters are well written and makes a good case for the Calvinistic system. Boettner presents his arguments well and anticipants and responds to possible objections in each chapter. The only problem I have with this book is its postmillennial bias (this is especially evident in his final chapter on the history of Calvinism). This is the only downfall of the book. In order for Boettner to relieve the \\"harsher\\" aspects of predestination, he advocates the idea that in the end more people will be in heaven than in hell. Of course, we should let the Bible speak for itself and not try to sugar-coat it with hypotheses to \\"soften\\" difficult truths taught in the Bible. Another downfall of the book is its age. Many contemporary readers will find that some of the issues that Boettner brings up are obsolete. Overall, though, a good introductory level book on the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Loraine Boettner's book explains clearly that God is 100% sovereign and accomplishes what He purposed BEFORE the world was made. People will allow God to be sovereign in everything but the affairs of man, especially in salvation. This book refutes point by point the arguments against the absolute sovereignty of God. This book clears up one of the main arguments of Arminians--that if God is the ultimate means by which ALL things happen, even bad things--this makes God the author of evil. This Arminian argument is swept away by Boettner's clear explanation concerning the absolute RIGHT that God has with HIS creatures to do as He decides. This leaves us totally in awe of God's holiness. We are reduced to humility and thankfulness for the grace that God exercised in our individuaL lives. EVERY christian should be required to read this book before entering any debate concerning God's dealings with sinful mankind. Boettner sets out explaining the doctrine and then in section III he takes on the obvious objections to the doctrine. Read this book first."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"After reading this book you will have a better understanding of what Calvinism is and what it is not. The book goes into not only a defense for it but also the practical aspects of Calvinism. From explaining each point of this doctrine to answering questions about predestination in it relationship to this doctrine. It goes to the subject of man's \\"Freewill\\" and God's foreknowledge. Everything you every wanted to know about Calvinism is in this book. It could very well be known as a systematic theology of Calvinism.Great study on the doctrines of Grace.\\"To God Alone Be The Glory\\" because of his amazing Grace"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"I read this book many years ago and have since re-read it several times. Each time I pick it up I discover new truths. This is simply because much of what Boettner writes is so concise that you tend to underappreciate the depths of his explanations on the first reading - he is that good! Boettner packs more into one paragraph than many authors are able to do with an entire chapter! Make no mistake, a second reading will be required to \\"get\\" many of these concepts, perhaps the most difficult in all of theology. I am certain that I still have not gotten everything to be gotten out of this fantastic book. Also of note are the sections that offer counter arguments to the typical Arminianistic or \\"free-will\\" objections. These are pretty good answers on the whole and I have used them successfully with the opposing campers -- very useful counterpoints. Here's a tip for you, if you think of this book as a good \\"college level\\" course in Calvinism, then consider picking up \\"Still Sovereign\\" edited by Schreiner and Ware, which would be at a \\"graduate\\" level. Both books are highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is the book that convinced me of the &quot;predestinatory&quot; claims of reformed doctrine.

He shows that those who object to the doctrine cannot escape from its implications if they believe the Bible to be authoritative.He also shows that denying the Bible's teaching that God is sovereign greatly devalues the God of the Bible, and leaves us in a much worse position.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Dr. Boettner's book is one of the best works I have ever read on the doctrine of predestination from a Reformed perspective. The book is not a book that debates and ignores the issues but takes the reader directly to the Word of God as the source for its foundation.Whether you are a Calvinist or an Arminian, you would do yourself well to purchase this book and digest the meat found therein. The book, while covering a rather deep subject, remains quite easy to read and the content of Dr. Boettner's thoughts flow together easily.A great book!"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"\\"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination\\" is the most thorough and well argued explanation and defense of this doctrine I have ever read. It is based on scripture with lots of helpful quotes and extended explanations from some of the greatest theologians from Augustine forward to the early twentieth century. Boettner argues with the passion of a convert, but uses reason and sound analysis to present an excellent case. If you want to know what Reformed Christians and Presbyterians believe about God's sovereignty I highly recommend this book.One problem: Dr. Boettner is so gung-ho and excited about Reformed theology and Presbyterianism that to those who are not convinced some of this book comes across like a Calvinistic pep rally. If you are not a convinced Calvinist hear him out because there is a lot of good food for thought here."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is the most reasonable, thorough and concise explanations I have ever read on the topic of election and predestination.

This is a very good book on the subject of Reform theology and predestination. Though I am not a Calvinist because of it, but because of my own studies in the scriptures. My daughter came home from colledge and told me she was a Calvinist. I decided I would do a thourgh study and show her why she was wrong, of course first I had to find out exactly what Calvinism was. I did that then I started in Genesis and worked my way through the bible, I found not only could I not disprove the doctrine of Calvinism but must embrace it. This book is a very well presented explanation of this doctrine. I highly recomend it. I also highly recomend R. C. Sproul's book \\"What is Reform Theology?\\". Oh and to the contrary of one of the one star reviewers R. C. Sproul does not say God is the author of sin but he says the opposite. This book presents a true understanding of the scriptures. When I aproached this subject I did it with a disire to find the truth, if you do the same I believe you will come to the same conclusion I did."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Perhaps the most comprehensive modern work on one of the bible's most contoversial subjects. I read this book as a staunch anti Calvinist, anti predestinarian but I read it very prayerfully as I do all serious doctrinal books. And I came away a staunch believer in this BIBLICAL doctrine. And I became a bit appalled at myself and most of the modern church for misrepresenting it, failing to consider it, and understand it - what a disservice to truth.Since I read this i've read all Boettner's books - the millennium is his other greatest book. I now buy this book 4 or 5 at a time and give it to Christian friends. And have come away knowing that those who disregard and disbelieve this doctrine have gone to great strides to isogete, twist and ignore scripture's teaching and they do so at their own peril. The historical misrepresentation of this doctrine should be considered an affront to the church."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Armininism is the theology god of today.

And two leaders who sing the The Declaration of Independence in 1776 were Calvinist.But all the documents, history of Calvinism, and theological (Biblical) proof are true and well written it's logical and totally Biblical.

The fact that God has a right to do with us or to us what he pleases because he is God makes him no less evil.If God created ALL then that includes evil.

However, when I go back to the scripture, the whole system seems to fall apart. The whole theme of Hebrews and much of 2 Peter deal with the apostasy of a believer(s)--not 'apparent apostasy or a scenario that could never really happen to a real believer'--but true bonifide apostasy!I could go on and on but I no longer see the point. For the Arminian view has truly won out in the arena of ideas. I have come to realize that 1) True Calvinist are rare and hard to find within Christendom and 2) they have become the theological Amish of the protestant world-fun to look at but never really seriously considered by the thinking world of the protestant faith."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"My daughter started drawing and wanted this book to help her draw the characters.

I would not recommend this at all, beginner or advanced."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"The author, in the introduction, calls this book \\"a complete and thorough guide to drawing the world of shoujo manga.\\" I think that's a bit too optimistic, especially considering that it's only 143 pages. There are several helpful hints and tips in this book, but I think this book would be best if read in conjunction with other manga how-to books and plenty of actual manga. The book's various sections are: the basics (things like heads, profiles, hairstyles, bodies, etc.), poses, bishies, the magical girl style, other popular shoujo styles, cool clothes, and design details.These sections sound great, but everthing is covered VERY briefly - the step-by-step instructions are very short and would probably be, at best, only marginally helpful for beginners. The best part about this book is the artwork, although, as one reviewer wrote, even that has its issues. Much of the artwork, although nicely colored, does not really look that good - it's nice, however, that the artwork varies in style, so that it doesn't appear that all manga art looks the same. Still, I think this book would've benefitted from using examples from actual manga and discussing how those examples reinforce the book's hints and tips. At the very least, \\"further reading\\" lists at the ends of each section might have been nice.As with many how-to art books, this book seems to assume that its readers have some previous drawing knowledge, so I wouldn't recommend this book for absolute beginners, but if you've tried to draw manga characters and have been having problems, this book might help you out. Or it might not. While it covers quite a few drawing hints and tips, some of which I, for instance, found very helpful, there is an aweful lot it doesn't cover. If you can afford it, it might be good to get this book along with other \\"how to draw manga\\" (or even \\"how to draw\\") books, but if you can't, you might want to look for a more thorough book."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"This book gos over everything you need to know when drawing manga. It goes over hands, facial features, female AND male characters, diffrent hair types, bodys, Chibi, design detail, and a whole lot more. If you dont want to get a million books going into great detail with just one subject, then i suggest you get this book. It really helps with trying to create your own unique manga characters as well. I suggest you go out and get this book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"All art books are faced with striking a balance between how much space to devote to 'the basics' ( figure ,perspective, shading, color theory ,etc) and the specific aspects of a narrowly focused subject. (what are the proportions of a typical manga 'bisho' boy? What is a good creative process for designing a tranforming mecha?).This title winds up with four stars because of what it DOESN'T try to do. It doesn't try to take you from stick figures to Masamune Shirow in one book like his first two titles. And yes this IS a lousy book for beginners, because beginners need a focus on 'the basics' and 'the basics' are worth a lot more than one book.This book is for intermediate+ amatuer artist who want a solid sourcebook for the design elements of the shoujo manga genre. Even a professional aritst who wanted a 'instant expert' guide would find it useful.As for the quality of the art in the book, yeah, they don't do it like Clamp, but that may be to the good. If they did, the relative beginners might be a bit intimidated! I find the style of the books art give the whole thing an air of 'Hey I can do that', which makes you want to wade right in. Especially since they show a lont of the art with the multi-stage construction drawings with it.So I would say the book is well worth it. As long as you know what it's trying to do."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"Christopher Hart has written an excellent book. He captured the essence of Shoujo, its beauty, grace, and subtlety. This book contains a great deal of information that will help the beginning and advanced artist. It is also beautiful to look at.

His treatment of colors is top notch."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"We bought this book for our 9 year old daughter a year ago and she attacked it studiously.

She has a thorough grasp of things like perspective, shading, and motion, all of which she learned through the instruction in this particular book.This book would be a great place to start for anyone [high school reading level and up] who wants to learn this lovely style of art.

From facial angles to foreshortening (which I had no idea how to do before I purchased this book. It also helped with shadows and clothing folds.It contains a section on the beloved chibis and it covers male characters. It even had Bishies(beautifully drawn male characters)Some of the art work is great!The cons are that it doesn't go into great detail and a few of the pictures look like they were done by a first grader.All in all I like this book very much and for a 144 pages it's a steal."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"While this book was quite helpful in my case, I suspect that it would not be suitable for the absolute beginner. A bit of expierence is probably needed to glean the full benefits of this work. Now that being said, I feel there is a great amount that can be learned from this books. As with all of Christopher Hart's book, it is quite detailed and their is an abundance of text to go along with the actual drawing and coloring. The techniques Hart illustrates actually work. I like to work on individual aspects of figures, isolating different areas such as eyes, mouth, nose, etc. This works well for me and with this work, the author has given us plenty of information. No one book can do it all and the serious student of this art form will want many. This is just another valuable work to add to your collection.

I do highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"Manga Mania Shoujo is a wonderful book that can really help you, it helped me.The book has tutorials on head shapes,eyes,a bit on hair, and a nice section on on shoujo genre types.Parents who are worried about getting \\"how to draw hentai(manga porn)\\" for their kids need not worry,there is no nudity present.The book could be better though.The lessons seem a little rushed since theyre so short,just filling 1 or 2 pages.Iwould have liked some of the art to have been more detailed too. The art isnt bad, but it sometimes looks a bit plain or americanized or ametureish.The rest of the art is simply astounding(especially the chapter intro pics).Many(if not all) of the artpics incorporate just about all the techniques and info you will find in the book, from the lace and ruffles to the roses and and ribbons.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"I recently purchased this book, and have been quite pleased with it!

Yes, okay, Christopher Hart's PERSONALLY done pictures do look that way. Yes.

This new incarnation, however, takes an entirely different tact, combining fantastic literary stories with equally talented artists for something that is far more entertainment than education.Also, while these are \\"comic books,\\" the illustrators are far more \\"New Yorker\\" than \\"Fantastic Four.\\" Creative, individualistic and highly stylized, each artist leaves their own distinctive mark on their story, creating a unique experience, a collaboration between author and artist.This 3rd Edition of \\"Graphic Classics: Volume 1 - Edgar Allan Poe\\" assembles nine short stories and three poems of the master, including his most famous works as well as some less well-known. Each is given a different treatment, ranging from illustrated text pieces to full comic strips. Each is of very high quality, making this book highly recommended.Included in this volume are:\\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" - My first Edgar Allan Poe story, that I was assigned to read in Jr. High School, is still a provocative and powerful piece. Artist Rick Geary gives us a straight-forward rendition, including a lovingly detailed picture of The Eye.\\"King Pest\\" - A story of plague-ridden London, where two hapless sailors find themselves guests at the table of the King and Queen of pestilence. Anton Emdin's grotesque illustrations add a nice comic flair to the tale.\\"The Premature Burial\\" - A claustrophobic tale of fear of premature burial, and how we often create the demon's that haunt us. Joe Ollman does a splendid job of creating atmosphere, and the panic of being buried alive.\\"El Dorado\\" - This one I liked a lot. A semi-humorous cartoons style brings the point of the sad poem home even more fiercely.\\"Spirits of the Dead\\" - A surrealistic adaptation of a quiet Poe poem, ruminating on death.\\"The Imp of the Perverse\\" - Like \\"The Tell-tale Heart,\\" a story of the sting of guilt, and how a perfect murder is never as perfect as we would like to think.\\"The Raven\\" - A new adaptation of Poe's masterpiece, this is an assemble version with a different artist doing a different stanza. It comes off beautifully, allowing Poe's words to be the true star of the show.\\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" - A text-and-pictures adaptation,full of the stunning delights of Propero's hidden Bohemia, and the plague of the Red Death that intrudes on their party.\\"Never Bet the Devil Your Head\\" - A wild and funny adaptation of a wild and funny story. An excellent ending.\\"Hop-Frog\\" - The text is presented in its entirety, and the artists is so completely well-suited to this story that I think I will forever see the foolish fat king and his eight fat friends as portrayed by artist Lisa K. Weber.\\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" - My favorite Poe story is well treated, keeping the essential dialog and tension, even while being distilled down to a few pages.\\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" - Mostly a text-and-pictures piece with some dialog, the artist captures the haunted Roderic Usher's lonely fate. As well as his sisters'."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 1: Edgar Allan Poe - 2nd Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"Now in a newly revised and substantially enlarged fourth edition, the Eureka Productions graphic novelization of the stories of Edgar Allan Poe continues to document their 'Graphic Classics' series as one of the very best. Eleven stories are represented along with a diversity of artists doing the illustrations for them. Featured are The Pit and the Pendulum; William Wilson; The Tell-Tale heart; The Black Cat; never Bet the Devil Your Head; The Cask of Amontillado; The Fall of the House of usher; The Premature Burial; The Imp of the Perverse; The Raven; and Annabel Lee.

Having read all of Tom Pompluns' classic compilations, I have often thought \`Why not get mainstream artists? I'm sure John Byrne would do one for him? Hey, Steranko? What about Wiacek? Or Perez?'. But, call me slow, this collection of stories has opened the door.The tales he has chosen to adapt, and the artists he has assigned the work to, work. Why? In a twisted way, the sheer esoteric nature of the Poe, Twain, Stevenson, Doyle, Bierce, and Lovecraft stories match the highly stylized artwork from Geary, Weber, Howarth, Knight, Shaw and others. Put a story like King Pest into the hands of Frank Brunner, and you have a masterful piece, that may miss the off mark. Brunner is fantasy. Pest is satire, at its' best. Neal Adams doing the Cask of Amontilado would be a visual feast, but the art would overshadow the terror of the story. Some of the art in this volume does not necessarily make the tale sing, but it does put the onus onto the writer and as a team, it either does, or does not work.Most of these work. This volume includes The Premature Burial, Imp of the Perverse, King Pest, The Tell Tale Heart, Masque of the Red Death, Hop Frog, Never Bet the Devil Your Head, Cask of Amontilado, Fall of the House of Usher, and the Raven. A couple of these are reprints but 40 of the 144 pages are new. Because of the new material, the book has a \`new' feel to it.Of the stories here, I had never heard of half of them. King Pest is a hoot. Hop Frog is delightful. The Imp of the Perverse is perverse. And the Premature Burial is masterful. Material from a genius like Poe should never be forgotten.What the heck Tom, I bet Steranko would do a cover!!Tim Lasiuta"},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 1: Edgar Allan Poe - 2nd Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"I teach English to Speakers of Other Languages, and like to use graphic novels to help clarify more difficult writing and themes. We started with \\"The Black Cat,\\" which was great. the pictures very expressive, but not overly gory. \\"The Raven\\" graphics were more abstract and were difficult to follow, but it is well done. It did give a great visual for the concept of internal conflict. I showed a video of Price reciting the poem as he went through the motions, and my students have decided to draw their own graphics, which is outstanding. I recommend this book, and graphic novels for making the text accessible and motivating people to read classics."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 1: Edgar Allan Poe - 2nd Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"I loved the idea of this. I was so looking foward to getting this collection of Poe's works in Graphic Novel form. Most of the artistic renderings are pretty cool and have that dark, comic feel but of all works, \\"The Raven\\", Which...I'll be honest, is the piece I was looking forward to the most, I was sorely disappointed. The \\"Raven\\" artwork in the beginning of the book is a bit deceptive as to what you'll actually be experiencing with that one. Well, more than a bit really. Over the top abstract imagery is what you'll experience in reality. Not what I was wanting at all. The book is interesting, just wish they'd stuck to kinda the traditional dark comic graphic style visually throughout and forewent the impressionism this time around."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 1: Edgar Allan Poe - 2nd Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"It was nice to read a poe's work. The art work is interesting. I would not say it is the best drawn Graphic novel i've ever seen but poe's writing is always great to read."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 1: Edgar Allan Poe - 2nd Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"An anthology of graphic adaptations of some of Edgar Allan Poe's works, both short stories and poems. Each story is written/illustrated by different people such as Rick Geary, Carlo Vegara, Matt Howarth and others resulting in a wide variety of artist styles throughout the book. Most of Poe's works collected here are his most famous but there are a few lesser known ones as well.There are quite a lot of changes to this 4th edition with the removal of, mostly, the shorter lesser known works and the addition of a few poems but especially two major long works. First, but most importantly; all my favourites from the 3rd edition are still present. As I said in that review,\\"My favourites were Rick Geary's retelling of \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" as I am fond of his work. I also enjoyed \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\" by Tom Pomplum and Lance Tooks which I had never heard of before. I also enjoyed Pedro Lopez' rendition of \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" as that is one of my favourite Poe stories and the adaptation was well done.\\"What has been removed are: King Pest, Eldorado (a poem), Spirits of the Dead (a poem), The Masque of Red Death, and Hop-Frog. The only one of these I deeply regret the removal of is The Masque of Red Death and to a much lesser degree Hop-Frog.The additions are mostly very strong. The Black Cat returns after its removal from the 3rd edition. The two new long pieces are The Pit and the Pendulum and William Wilson. The Pit and the Pendulum is worth the price of admission. It has been incredibly rendered in all its eerie glory by David Hontiveros and Carlo Vergara. Another of my favourite stories that has been presented in a terrifyingly creepy and atmospheric manner. This one joins my favourites in the entire book. William Wilson is a strange story to begin with but the artwork is gorgeously detailed and atmospheric; I love the portrait of Poe on the wall in the last frame. Not one of my favourite stories but adapted to graphic form very well and certainly worth the removal of Hop-Frog. Also new to this addition are the poems In a Sequestered Churchyard Where Once Poe Walk'd by H.P. Lovecraft, and Annabel Lee. The Raven is not new but the illustrations have been redone by J.B. Bonivert and I have to say I am not pleased with them at all. I don't know what you call this type of art but it is plain weird (almost farcical to me) and totally distracts from the somber, eerie tone of the poem. On the other hand, Bonivert illustrates the new Annabel Lee and is much more successful using a fairy tale theme to the art that grows darker frame by frame.If you already have a previous volume I think this one is well worth adding to your collection just for the addition of \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\" alone. If you don't have this volume, what are you waiting for? This series is a great way to sample the author's work if you are unfamiliar with it and if you are a fan of Poe's it brings his work to another level by reading it in the graphic format."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 1: Edgar Allan Poe - 2nd Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"Like the writings of his fellow American fantasists Edgar Rice Burroughs, H.P. Lovecraft, and Robert E. Howard, the work of Edgar Allan Poe cries out to be illustrated; so it's no wonder the folks at Eureka Productions chose to begin their series of Graphic Classics with a collection of illistrated tales and poems by this master of the macabre. They've hardly stinted on the talent, either - artists include the great Richard Corben (creator of the character Den seen in the filmHeavy Metal (Collector's Edition)), the insane and ingenious Maxom Crumb (known from the excellent Terry Zwigoff filmCrumb (Special Edition)and younger brother of underground comix great Robert), and Alan Moore collaborator John Coulthart (The Haunter of the Dark: And Other Grotesque Visions). Award-winning writer Joe R. Landsdale (The Bottoms) provides the introduction.This collection strikes me as an incredibly useful book - teachers can use it as a remarkably faithful and accessible introduction to one of the giants of American literature; comics fans, to introduce themselves to a marvellous storyteller; and Poe aficianados can see some the greatest talents currently working in the fields of comics and illustration. Oh... and if you're somebody who just enjoys a good scary story, you'll have a lot of fun with this, too - and who doesn't like a good scary story?"},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 1: Edgar Allan Poe - 2nd Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"Great artistry behind one of the best poets of modern time.

His song, co-written with his brother John Leonard Rancher, &quot;Chemotherapy&quot; should be played from the rooftops as much for its mighty hooks as for the all too common woeful paean to cancer/premature death that it is. I play it often and Mr. Reader's woven story provides the insight to know just what a rocky road Billy walked to evoke the high pitch of emotion and faith the song harpoons the heart with.Billy's music, especially post-cancer-is some of the most heartfelt and soulful I have ever heard. I am blessed to have seen Billy perform many times-including his last performance when he could not stand and even movement was painful- and have tapes of many live performances, including the final live video of Billy's Christmas message to the world,&quot;Make Love, Not War&quot; that Mr. Reader chronicles so well.This book will fill in many of the blanks for those who lived through Billy's time and will acquaint strangers with a mighty soul who, save for his music and Bill Reader's lovely book, may never have known him."},{"Title":"Rocky road: The legendary life and times of Billy Rancher","review":"Bill Reader deserves so much credit making this an accurate book.I appreciated Bills' thoroughness in describing the people and what was going on at the time.

For years I carried the book in my car, and my friends and I would read portions to each other as we drove around town.

Our concern is with human beings while you Conservatives are preoccupied with the preservation of economic privilege and status...Such statements, from friend and foe alike do great injustice to the Conservative point of view. Conservatism is NOT an economic theory, though is has economic implications. The shoe is precisely on the other foot: it is Socialism that subordinates all other considerations to man's material well being. It is Conservatism that puts material things in their proper place--that has a structured view of the human being and of human society, in which economics plays only a subsidary role.The root difference between Conservatives and Liberals of today is that Conservatives take account of the WHOLE man, while the Liberals tend to look only at the material side of man's nature.\\"I'd agree that a much better name for this book in the current political climate would be \\"The Conscience of a Libertarian\\"Goldwater goes onto talk about the peril's of power, states' rights, civil rights, freedom and the farmer, and freedom for labor each presented with zeal and clarity and providing unique and relevant wisdom for any American.The problem that I've always found with Libertarianism is that it takes a bit longer to explain fully than the democrat(I want to take your money to help others) or republican(I want to cut taxes to increase freedom but tell you how to live your life), but once someone understands the Libertarian position, I rarely here a truly compelling argument that stops someone from entertaining the idea.The arguements I hear are those who really wans to take money from the better off to give from the worse off(the left) or really want want to tell you how to live your personal life(right).Read this book as it as it a classic political text.I suggest it to:Libertarians: to confirm the republican party once held dear many of your believesRepublicans: to remember who you are and what once made you greatDemocrats: to see why true conservatism is an a political philosophy that makes a lot of sense"},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"The book is great, the concept everlasting, but why the hell is RFK's scum bag son writing an afterword? Its hilarious that presently Goldwater is seen for all his greatness in the eyes of the Lefties, but during his heyday was the most hated Conservative of them all. They called him evil, a racist, a war monger, but like Lincoln and soon Reagan, the Liberals like to hijack a good conservative or republican and say he was a democrat all along. Just wait Eisenhower is next. But seriously how can a man whose family has done more damage to conservatism, higher taxes, advancements of welfare, abuse of civil rights, and appeasement to the Soviet Union, come out in defense of Goldwater whilst castigating Bush? Someone at the height of hypocrisy that's who. For gods sake they have a chapter on the Cold War when his Uncle Ted, was capitulating and working with the soviets. But on the real though, some kids might think that the Cold War section is outdated, but I can replace the words soviet with Islam and its almost the exact thing we are doing today.

Buchanan, Reagan, and just about every modern conservative since has probably been influenced by Goldwater."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"\\"The challenge to Conservatives today is quite simply to demonstrate the bearing of a proven philosophy on the problems of our own time,\\" notes Barry Goldwater in his introduction. The problems from 1960 that Mr. Goldwater chose as topics for his book were: States' Rights, Civil Rights, Freedom for the Farmer, Freedom for Labor, Taxes and Spending, The Welfare State, Education and the Soviet Menace.His thoughts later became political gospel for conservative activists and a measuring stick against which politicians were held to see if they were truly conservative. One such prominent conservative activist, Phyllis Schlafly, stated: \\"It is hard to overestimate the importance of Barry Goldwater to the conservative movement. If there hadn't been a Barry Goldwater, there wouldn't have been a Ronald Reagan.\\"A closer look at what Mr. Goldwater wrote in 1960 convinces one that he would still have plenty to say today. His barbs would target both Democrats and Republicans. Perhaps it's discovering the barbs he would have tossed at today's Republicans that makes reading this book full of surprises.States' rights formed a cornerstone to Barry Goldwater's conservative thought. Although the States' rights to permit slavery were ended by war and constitutional amendment, Goldwater saw no such restrictions on a state's right to keep racially segregated schools. Simply put: \\"no powers regarding education were given the federal government\\" and \\"it has never been seriously argued ... that the authors of the Fourteenth Amendment intended to alter the Constitutional scheme with regard to education. ... I therefore support all efforts by the States ... to preserve their rightful powers over education.\\" (p.35) The Bush Administration supports a court challenge to the University of Michigan's policy of giving African Americans racial preferences in admissions. Mr. Goldwater would shout \\"NO\\" to this interference. You can't have it both ways: supporting States' rights when they result in segregated schools, and opposing them when they result in greater African American enrolments.Goldwater further proclaimed: \\"federal intervention in education is unconstitutional\\" and \\"the alleged need for federal funds (for education) has never been convincingly demonstrated.\\" (p. 79) It's doubtful if Barry Goldwater would have supported the Bush Administration's much touted educational initiative, the \\"No Child Left Behind Act,\\" which involves the federal government in policy-making and funding.Forty years ago Barry Goldwater led the conservative attack on federal tax and related spending policies. Faced with the Bush Administration's tax cuts and its disregard for ensuing deficits, Barry would be fuming. He wrote: \\"While there is something to be said for the proposition that spending will never be reduced so long as there is money in the federal treasury, I believe that as a practical matter spending cuts must come before tax cuts. If we reduce taxes before firm, principled decisions are made about expenditures, we will court deficit spending and the inflationary effects that invariably follow.\\" (p. 65)Finally, Goldwater called for \\"prompt and final termination of the farm subsidy program.\\" (p. 43) He considered it unconstitutional. Last May President Bush boosted U.S. crop and dairy subsidies by 67 percent by signing a $51.7 billion farm law.Mr. Goldwater's analysis of the Soviet menace also makes fascinating reading in our post-Soviet world.First, he opposed the U.S. halt to nuclear testing. Tests were \\"needed to develop tactical nuclear weapons for possible use in limited wars\\" (p. 112). Barry Goldwater believed that limited nuclear wars were almost inevitable, for they provided our only answer to superior Communist conventional military power. Moreover, the U.S. government was tricked into halting tests. \\"Our government was originally pushed into suspending tests by Communist-induced hysteria on the subject of radio-active fallout.\\" (p.113). I'm sure Mr. Goldwater would be among the first to rejoice that his worst fears were wrong.Second, Barry Goldwater opposed our official exchange programs with the Soviet Union, even though they received major support in some Republican circles (Eisenhower, Nixon and Kissenger). Exchanges would lull Americans into accepting Communism and reduce our willingness to make sacrifices to halt Communist expansion. (p.108) I think, however, it can now be argued that these exchange programs played a major role in undermining the Soviet Union by creating a core of internal opposition. Many Soviet citizens who saw the West first hand on official exchanges later risked the \\"knock on the door\\" in opposing Communism. They are the unsung individuals who \\"won\\" the Cold War. Ironically, Mr. Goldwater's vocal opposition to these exchange programs probably made it easier to gain support for them within the Soviet bureaucracy.Upon finishing Mr. Goldwater's book, it appears to me that Conservatives are still being challenged to \\"demonstrate the bearing of a proven philosophy\\" today, especially to many Republicans. On turning the last page, I was left wondering, if the Bush Administration fails so many of Goldwater's litmus tests for Conservatism, who are the Conservatives today?"},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"At just over 100 pages, this brisk handbook for Conservative political thought impressed me by its constant recourse to the sanctity of the US Constitution, and by its thorough enumeration of the ways in which the federal government has trespassed into areas forbidden it by that same founding document. It is clear that these repeated violations of the Constitution, carried out by both Democrats and Republicans (as Goldwater assiduously points out), have spoiled the Senator's good mood. Yet Goldwater has written here a gentleman's treatise. There is no partisan venom, just good, clean, political argumentation from a man who feared, in 1960, that decades of growth in federal power had taken the nation down the wrong path in several areas of public policy, and that this same growth in government was already strangulating individual freedom and sapping the souls of those dependent on government welfare.Goldwater presents what he perceives to be a striking contrast between the mode of thought of politicians in the 1960s and that of the radiant group who founded this country. On the one hand, at least one Republican of Goldwater's generation was quoted as saying \\"The underlying philosophy. . .is that if a job has to be done to meet the needs of the people, and no one else can do it, then it is the proper function of the federal government.\\" Goldwater shows how this kind of intellectually lazy rhetoric is actually a declaration of the first principle of absolutism--that the State is competent to do all things--and is a repudiation of the Constitution itself, which defines many spheres of activity (education, agriculture, even some forms of foreign aid) as being expressly outside the power of the federal government.There are some real gems here, particularly Goldwater's grasp of the beginnings of judicial over-reach and the Supreme Court's end run around democracy and local decision-making. The 1954 Brown v. Board decision to desegregate public schools might well have been motivated by the best intentions, but it was, Goldwater reminds us, an un-Constitutional intrusion by a branch of the federal government into a domain that is off-limits to federal power. Indeed, the majority opinion in Brown v. Board acknowledged that the Court's decision long-jumped over the Constitution, since the \\"equal protection\\" clause in the 14th Amendment, which the Court used to strike down desegregation of schools, didn't apply to education. As Goldwater writes, \\"In effect, the Court said that what matters is not the ideas of the men who wrote the Constitution, but the Court's ideas.\\" Of course, Americans tend to ignore the abuse of 1954 because segregation was so odious, but the lesson is that once a citizenry permits the Court to impose its ideas exta-legally, the same thing will happen in the future, but producing, potentially, wildly contested rulings.Goldwater concludes this book with a brief (actually, it's one of the longer chapters in the book) chapter on \\"The Soviet Menace\\". I believe it would be fascinating to sit down with someone versed in military tactics/military history/Cold War history to discuss the merits of Goldwater's proposals for defeating the Soviet Union. There is no question Mr. Goldwater espoused a hard-line, aggressive, offensive-minded policy, kind of like throwing two punches at the Russian Bear for every paw swipe he took at us. Goldwater goes on record as saying he likely would have used tactical nuclear weapons to assists the Hungarians in 1956. Whoa, damn. . .that's a slippery slope that I personally might not have been willing to ascend had I been a voter when Barry Goldwater ran for president.In closing, let me just say that is a great tutorial for conservative thought, with conservative principles lucidly explained in the context of certain policy issues (education, agriculture, taxation) that were front-and-center when Goldwater wrote this book. Mr. Goldwater strikes me as a rugged individual who does not compromise on principle. This book was a delight to read."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue. -Barry Goldwater (1964 Republican Convention Acceptance Speech)If, as Oscar Wilde opined, homosexuality is \\"the love that dare not speak its name,\\" then we might say that Conservatism is \\"the political philosophy that dare not speak the truth.\\" Liberals are wont to bathe the masses in comforting but demonstrably false platitudes, because at the root of their political philosophy they maintain a series of fictions, like: (1) we're all essentially equal--all differences in intelligence, ability, etc. are a function of external factors and these external factors can be corrected by government; or, (2) all problems, both international and domestic, are soluble by government action because basically we all really have each others best interests at heart, we just sometimes need a push from Big Brother to realize it; and so on. Conservatism meanwhile is based on a set of somewhat ugly truths, derived from hard experience: (1) the natural state of man, like that of other animals, is one of competition, not cooperation; (2) it is because this competition was so brutal, often fatal, that men reluctantly gave up some measure of freedom, in order to establish a government to protect them from one another; (3) government, foreign and domestic, is now the greatest threat to man, because those governments will seek ever increasing levels of control over human behavior; and so on. Obviously, conservatives are left with a harder sell here.Therefore, while conservative academics express themselves openly, you very seldom hear conservative politicians present their ideas in simple unvarnished fashion; for the most part it gets dressed up in warm fuzzy language. Every once in a while though, especially in times of great crisis, someone will step forward and actually enunciated conservative values in blunt terms--modern instances include: Herbert Hoover in his post presidency phase; Charles Lindbergh and the America First movement; George S. Patton during WWII; Robert Taft after the War; Barry Goldwater in the early '60s; Ronald Reagan from 1962 to 1988; and Alan Keyes today. Significantly, most of these men were either destroyed personally or were denied the opportunity to exercise real power, either by voters or by party power brokers. For all the noble cant about how voters wish that politicians were more truthful, their actions at the voting booth tend to indicate the opposite. They would much rather be comforted than confronted.It is against this backdrop that we must consider Barry Goldwater's seminal treatise The Conscience of a Conservative. And it is only once we understand these circumstances that we can appreciate how significant a book it was; in fact, it may be the single most important written work of ideology ever produced by a practicing American politician of any real stature. Considered first merely in terms of the audience it reached, only Tom Paine's pamphlets can be said to provide it any competition for popularity. Adjusted for population size, it is probably true that Paine's Common Sense is the best selling political treatise in the nation's history, but it is also true that Paine, though obviously political, was not truly a politician, at least not an office seeker. It is also the case that Presidents and presidential contenders have written bestselling books dealing with politics, but they tend not to be ideological. Instead they are wifty things like JFK's ghost written bit of self serving puffery, Profiles in Courage, or Nixon's eminently forgettable, Six Crises. Of course, ex-President Ulysses S. Grant wrote one of the great memoirs of all time, but he did not even deal with his presidency therein. The GOP did issue its Contract with America prior to the 1994 Congressional elections (a document which borrowed from Goldwater's book and philosophy), but there was no single national candidate behind that text (and its elements had been tested in opinion polls prior to inclusion in the final draft). No, there has really only been one great political treatise promulgated by a single man and then used as a campaign platform. For that reason alone, you would think this book would still be in print and be a subject of academic study.Even more remarkable is the fact that almost all of the book is still topical today. On the very first page, Goldwater talks about his annoyance at Republican leaders who feel compelled to call themselves \\"progressive Conservatives\\" or, as he quotes then Vice President Nixon: \\"Republican candidates should be economic conservatives, but conservatives with a heart.\\" This discussion so closely parallels current Conservative angst over George W. Bush's use of the term \\"compassionate Conservative\\" that it's almost spooky. In his discussion of taxes, he comes out in favor of a flat tax in terms that presage Steve Forbes:I believe that the requirements of justice here are perfectly clear: government has a right to claim an equal percentage of each man's wealth, and no more.Pessimism is a sort of occupational hazard for conservatives. There's a tendency to say that things are always in decline from an imagined ideal point in the past. But men like Goldwater and Reagan recast conservatism in a much more forward looking mold and made it a philosophy of human progress and their vision has largely prevailed. We won the Cold War, cut and flattened taxes, reformed Welfare, started returning power to the states, etc., etc., etc... But as you read this book and realize that we're still fighting all of the same fights, you realize how little has actually been accomplished. I still believe that Goldwater is largely right--the future of America will be basically fiscally conservative and socially libertarian--but it will always be a struggle, one we're often losing. This slender impassioned polemic remains an important statement of the principles which should guide our public policy and its very immediacy and relevance amply demonstrate Goldwater's continuing political significance. He is without a doubt the most influential losing candidate in the history of presidential politics, one of the seminal figures in American political thought in the second half of the 20th Century, and his influence may well extend far into the 21st Century.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"While written over four decades ago, this book is still topical today, and not surprisingly so. For anyone interested in politics, it is a necessary read. In all honesty, any liberal should read this book to get an understanding of the conservative mindset. While, I, as a conservative, disagree on a few points with Goldwater, I still found the book enlightening and a worthwhile read. It strenghtened my own arguments and my own conservatism. The same will be the case for a liberal who reads this book. It's true what they say: keep your friends close and your enemies closer. If you are in any way interested in politics, you owe to yourself to give this book a read.Goldwater's writing style is simple and straightforward. It is very logical and stays to the point. Impressively, he is able to maintain the attention of the reader without using significant humor or anecdotes. He tells you what he believes and leaves it for you to decide.Perhaps the best part of this book is that it is not a forum for liberal bashing or conservative praising. The truth is that he is critical of both sides. He doesn't absolve Republicans who have engaged in the expansion of the government as he doesn't absolve likeminded Democrats. He warns of the Soviet threat and the dangers of Communism. He simply states what he believes and what he has observed. While it is simple in flavor, you will appreciate the fact that it really doesn't have a political agenda, especially now, over four decades later.It's short, concise, and to the point. Read it, especially the first chapter. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"...can be found in this short volume by the late Arizona Senator and former Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Though the present writer has read numerous works since coming across the volume by the late Senator currently being reviewed, this is the one that first begin impressing upon his (at the time quite youthful) mind the logic behind the authentically conservative view of the world, of mankind, and of the core differences between liberal socialism and authentic conservatism. In shorthand, the differences between those views can be well distinguished by noting what the Constitution actually allows for the federal government to do and and what it is not allowed to do.The authentic conservative recognizes the restrictions (and if change is desired moves to do this through proper channels such as amending the Constitution) while the liberal socialist merely seeks to impose their views on others without respect for the rule of law in society. Whatever pretentions exist among those who think they are genuinely conservative in their outlooks but in varying ways are not (such as President Bush or Patrick Buchanan to name two examples), this is the book that for all intensive purposes ignited the modern conservative movement.For it is The Conscience of a Conservative probably deserves a good share of the credit for Ronald Reagan (i) abandoning the Democratic Party in 1962 (ii) giving the defining speech \\"a time for choosing\\" in October of 1964 in support of Goldwater's candidacy for president and (iii) provided a solid foundation for Reagan to cultivate his own conservative outlook in his tenure as governor of California and in two major campaigns for president. (In 1976 and again in 1980 when he won the first of his two terms as president.)It bears noting that while there is more to conservative philosophy than what is noted in this book, what is noted here is a good overview -showing the applicability of conservative principles to a host of issues outlined in chapters with titles such as \\"States' Rights\\", \\"Civil Rights\\", \\"Freedom for the Farmer\\", \\"Freedom for Labor\\", \\"Taxes and Spending\\", \\"The Welfare State\\", and \\"Education.\\" A previous reviewer quoted a part of the book which this writer wants to reproduce here with some brief comments as they pertain to events subsequent to this book's initial publication runs:\\"While there is something to be said for the proposition that spending will never be reduced so long as there is money in the federal treasury, I believe that as a practical matter spending cuts must come before tax cuts. If we reduce taxes before firm, principled decisions are made about expenditures, we will court deficit spending and the inflationary effects that invariably follow.\\" (p. 65)This observation proved to be prophetic in what happened in the 1980's with the budget deficits. (Though not with inflation which came down dramatically in that decade.) Those who know their history are aware that President Reagan proposed a combination of across the board tax cuts. However, that was intended merely to spur on the economy in the short term and not as a long-term proposition in and of itself. The long term proposition for handling the deficit was raising taxes and cutting spending simultaneously -indeed President Reagan got Congress to agree to $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in taxes raised in 1982. Of course the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives never followed through with the promised spending cuts. And when taxes are cut and spending is not reduced at the same time, even when the dynamic (as opposed to static) effects that tax cuts have on an economy are considered, with evils such as \\"base line budgeting\\" in place long-term deficits are an inevitability.Senator Goldwater recognized the problems of not equating tax cuts with spending cuts decades ago -only one of the many areas where this book proves itself to be somewhat prophetic. And it is nearly impossible to see the late Senator Goldwater being at all be happy with how a Republican controlled Congress and Republican president are handling these matters in 2005. Indeed, Senator Goldwater would not recognize himself in the Republican Party of today anymore than his friend the late Senator Hubert Humphrey would recognize himself in the Democratic Party of today. And this book contains ample instruction on how far these parties have strayed from their original principles. (As Goldwater notes towards the beginning of the book) the discomforting tendency of the Republican Party to mimic the Democratic Party preceding the publication of this book by a few decades.)It was said that President Reagan in his last years did not remember much but he *did* remember not receiving those $3 in spending cuts from Congress for every $1 in tax raises he agreed to in the early 1980's. In light of how the Democrats pulled the same screwjob on President Bush Sr., one would think at some point the Republicans would wise up. They were on the receiving end of tax cuts without spending cuts accompanying them on two different occasions. We have seen them in the past four years do precisely what the Democrats did in the 1980's and 1990's. And since they have complete control of the purse strings, there is no excuse for what they are doing.Unfortunately, the Republicans only seem to fight for core conservative principles when they are in a congressional minority. This is a trackrecord that had better change soon if they want to avoid losing control of Congress -particularly since attempts to get power back with running on conservative principles will backfire when their opponents point out just how unconservative the Republican congresses of the past four years (with a Republican president) have really been. (Though in truth they accomplished next to nothing of an authentically conservative agenda since taking control in 1994 -their rhetoric to the contrary notwithstanding.) However, as this is detracting from the purpose of this review and this writer is looking like the Libertarian he is not, a short summation is in order for the benefit of those who read this review and are considering acquiring this book.In summary, this book is a good starting reference for the authentic conservative position on many subjects. And authentic conservatism is something that seems to escape most people today who refer to themselves as \\"conservatives.\\" With the exception of the final chapter of the book (titled \\"The Soviet Menace\\": a good read for historical perspective in the post-USSR world if nothing else these days), the rest of the book with only the most minor of editing could be reissued and be as serviceable a work in 2005 as it was in 1960. The only question remaining is if those with pretentions towards being \\"conservative\\" are really ready to listen to these things in 2005 that they were (to a significant extent) unwilling to listen to in 1960, 1970, 1980, or 1990."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"Don't be fooled by the brevity of this book. Goldwater managed to hit a home run with his synopsis of conservative values. Many of today's conservatives owe their involvement in conservatism to Barry Goldwater. He is a forgotten hero.Goldwater was derided in the 1980s for turning off social conservatives. Yet, the 1980s revealed Goldwater for what he really was - a libertarian. He was consistent in his belief that government ought not to be involved in our lives in any way, shape, or form. That included our bedrooms as well as our wallets.He was a visionary who had keen insight on virtually every topic imaginable. Reading his three-decade-old book today is like reading yesterday's news. It is still pertinent and applicable. And there is still much to be learned from what he said and did.No conservative can possibly go without reading this book. It is historical - a building block towards the Reagan 80s and the GOP Congress 90s.

However, even as I do come from another time(i'm currently in my early twenties) and another position i do believe that i can fairly and objectively review this artifact of political history.Having an interest in writers like Allan Bloom(Closing of the American Mind) and Saul Bellow(and generally the U. of Chicago/historical neoconservative crowd), a older retired friend of mine suggested I take up a reading of classic conservative literature to gain perspective. I must admit, I was born into liberal perspective(born into a vegetarian interacial non-religious family does that to you), so i've always had to do a bit of work of understanding the other side. So here it goes...I must admit being impressed with the lucid nature of the arguementation and reasoning, along with the strong will and character that Mr. Goldwater worked to present in facing the troubles of the time he was writing. While some of the arguements come off as quite antiquated(such as the \\"states rights\\" position on segragation), others are quite timely. What really struck me was the question of whether or not today Mr. Goldwaters positions would fly with the modern republican party. I'm a political junkie and I rarely hear a arguement for the rights of states anymore. I can't imagine a modern politican citing Aristotle either. I can go as far as to say, there are things he's says that I like the position of, but today I can't imagine that the republican party today would have much of anything to do with them. It's interesting to me to consider where American politics might be today if the conservative political arena had kept a clear libertarian tone and not moved toward the often bizzare culture war idenity movement it seems to have metamorphasized into today.Overall the tone is easy to read, and moves along quite rapidly. I enjoyed alot of the writing on facing the Soviet Union. The SU came tumbling down when I was in kindergarden, so its a mindset that almost no one in my generation has a clear working memory of. So besides the historical, I liked that he had a clear moral sense that didn't reek of vanity and stubborness, but more of someone who refused to water down a platform of opposition to the cruelty of Statlinism."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"This edition is of very low quality.

I bought a few weeks ago on Amazon, and my copy visually resembles that shown here, but publisher is identified differently. Anyway, don't buy it."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"This new edition of the modern classic statement of conservative principles is both welcome and important.As the forward by George Will and the afterward by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., both point out, the principles of conservatism-- and even the very label \\"conservative\\"-- have been hijacked by the modern Republican party's leaders. They both correctly point out that Barry Goldwater would be horrified by what is happening today in the name of conservatism. That's because as he saw it, the single function of the American system should be to maximize the freedom enjoyed as a birthright by every individual in order to allow each individual to achieve to his or her maximum potential.Obviously, it's possible to disagree with some (or even most) of the specific positions Goldwater takes. But it's not really possible to disagree with his definition of and explication of conservative principles. Equally obviously, there is virtually nothing being done in the name of conservatism today that fits the definition Goldwater establishes, mostly because the \\"big government conservatives\\" and the religious social conservatives they are allied with are interested in expanding government power over individuals in order to achieve the social aims they seek. The neoconservative chicken-hawks are interested in projecting American military power to every corner of the world to achieve the geopolitical aims they seek.None of these people have the least interest in maximizing individual liberty. The enormity of the opportunity that was lost as the conservative movement that Goldwater galvanized was hijacked is staggering.In addition, Goldwater was an exemplar of the kind of politics that simply don't exist today. He was passionate in his beliefs, often abrupt and even abrasive in his delivery, and occasionally profane. But he was never mean, small, or personally insulting. Indeed, in the run-up to the 1964 election, Goldwater and President John Kennedy were thinking of travelling together around the country to engage in dozens of debates about the issues of the day. What an odd idea: the people running for President should talk about the issues and argue directly with one another! No swift-boat ads, no religious tub-thumping, no dirty tricks; just real political dialog.What could have been..."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"As the political season is upon us, I recently decided to read Barry Goldwater's \\"The Conscience of a Conservative.\\" I was a bit surprised at what I read. There was little concern for the social agenda which has dominated conservative conversations in recent years. One might argue that back in 1960 at the book's writing, the \\"culture wars\\" were not on anyone's radar screen. Even in later life, however, Goldwater sparred intensely with religious and social conservatives. Their agenda does not seem to be Goldwater's.Goldwater's agenda is freedom. His primary observation of human nature is its diversity. Each human being is unique, and it is the responsibility of each individual to realize his or her full potential. When government must exercise control, that action should occur at the most local level possible. Politics, for Goldwater, is \\"the art of achieving the maximum amount of freedom for individuals that is consistent with the maintenance of the social order\\" (pg 5). In modern parlance, Goldwater is probably more libertarian than conservative.Every other concern of Goldwater flows out of this agenda of freedom--the defeat of the Soviet Union, his reverence for the rule of law, the importance of federalism, his opposition to federal welfare programs, and his disagreement with court decisions and legislation on desegregation. The last is probably the most controversial. Goldwater agrees with the proposition that racial segregation in schools is wrong, but he believes that Brown vs. Board of Education is wrongly decided as an encroachment of the federal courts on what is a state issue. For some, they view Goldwater's position as an issue in semantics hiding racism. Others saw a man who desegregated his family department stores and worked to end segregation in the Arizona National Guard and in the schools and restaurants of Phoenix. Those facts, alas, are not in the book. Nonetheless, one still wonders how the agenda of freedom applied to unenforced civil right laws dating back to Reconstruction or the judicial activism of \\"separate but equal.\\"In the preface of my edition, George Will suggests that Goldwater's conservatism was greatly influenced by his Arizona upbringing. The spirit of the West certainly promotes individualism and a desire for limitless opportunity. Perhaps, being raised in Texas, I found some attraction in Goldwater's agenda of freedom. Moreover, I agree with Goldwater that there are human needs for which the government cannot provide. Unfortunately, since this book was about government, Goldwater had little to say about meeting those needs. Goldwater is silent on what is most important. Similarly, the Declaration of Independence hails the importance of the \\"pursuit of happiness\\" but is silent on what happiness actually is. Apparently, the individual has the freedom to decide. This isn't a criticism of the book, but it reminds me that politics isn't the source of my salvation. Instead, a free society merely gives me the opportunity to seek it."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"Being a conservative is something a person should be proud of.

It's hard to make sense of the many conflicting \\"Conservative\\" arguments put forth by so many these days, so I wanted a succinct, carefully-thought treatise. I'm coming from a Liberal approach but hopefully with an open mind.Mr. Goldwater is right in many of the things he says, particularly about individual freedoms and the Constitutionally-mandated limit of the scope of the federal government (the 10th. amendment), but he is wrong about accusing liberals of being concerned with only people's material well-bring. In fact, therein lies the main problem.Given the zeitgeist of the United States today, the less-powerful members of society don't stand a chance without government protection. I look at government in the same way as I look at a football referee: he is there to insure that the rules are followed so that the game is played fairly and that the players are protected, within reason, from serious harm. What would happen if the power of the referee was minimized to the point that only the most brutal players -- those who want the referee's role to be as limited as possible -- succeeded? It's fine to believe in the saintly character of all people, but it's just not reality.Conservatives want the federal government to be as small a part of their lives as possible, but are the states so beneficent? Most of the states today have more people living in them today than were living in the entire country in 1789, so shouldn't they be regarded with the same fear as the federal government of the late eighteenth century?I agree that (all) government should be as limited as possible, but unfortunately in the complex country and world that we live in today, that role is by necessity large and complex. Trade should be restricted as little as possible, but are the states and/or the people equipped to control enormous businesses that are corrupt, seeking to maximize their profits in any way possible? Who caused the current financial crisis? Corrupt banks, investment houses, and insurance companies that did as they wished with peoples' money. It's unrealistic to think that all fifty states would protect their people from these corporate predators. Think Delaware.) Are the states and/or the people equipped to combat both domestic and international terrorism? Are the states and/or the people equipped to build and maintain the interstate highway system or air travel? Are they equipped to combat sophisticated criminals that operate in cyberspace, where there are no political boundaries?I could go on and on but, along with Mr. Goldwater, I believe in the greatness of this country and its HONEST, DECENT, CARING people. In a far better country and world he would be right, but until the people and the states take it upon themselves to conduct affairs as though there was no need for a referee, the federal government must do its utmost to allow all people the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.Conscience of a Conservative is a great, inspiring book that contains much wisdom, but it's not the answer."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"This book is clear and to the point.

Of course, the specifics in the book are dated, given the era of its writing, but the essential ideas and his stated reasons for them ring true to the issues of today. Goldwater's explanation of his views also puts paid to the idea that he was \\"mean\\" or a racist: his views may not have set well with everyone, but his views were formed through his belief in limited government and maximum individual freedom.This was a fast read and a long overdue one.

There is a reason that, after Reagan's 1980 election, George Will wrote about Goldwater's 1964 race for the White House that Goldwater actually &#34;won, it just took 16 years to count the votes.&#34;The Conscience of a Conservative is a slim read -- barely 80 pages -- but it nonetheless offers up a profound and thorough defense of American conservatism. Not a defense of the Republican party, to be clear -- Goldwater has some harsh words for some of his fellow Republicans. Instead, this is a defense of conservative thinking, complete with a strong defense of federalism and limited government.Inevitably, some of the issues Goldwater tackles are now dated; communism, for example, features prominently, because it was a defining issue of Goldwater's time in politics. Likewise, the budget numbers that horrified Goldwater are obsolete -- the updated numbers are many times larger and far more disturbing. Goldwater's approach to the issues, however, doesn't depend on the arithmetic; he is focused on sustaining liberty and the American system of government on a philosophical level, rather than focusing on the minutiae of particular policies.Anyone who thinks they know what conservatives believe needs to read this book. If you are a conservative, this book will help you sharpen your views and root them more deeply in a strong historical tradition. If you are not a conservative, this book will challenge you to understand and confront -- or accept -- actual conservatism, not the weak, populist fluff that so often passes for conservatism in the politics of the early 21st century."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"The binding on the book was a little torn, but hey, it was a great price for the minimal damage done to the actual binding itself.

We cannot forget these principles."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"Goldwater assessed the trajectory of the nation in the early 60's, noting how far we were straying from the Constitution and prophetically projecting where the tact would take us. I can forgive the liberals and Rockefeller Republicans for not believing Goldwater was right back then, but with a half a century of hindsight at our disposal, there is no forgiving anyone who does not roll up their sleeves and help me restore our Constitution. This book is a great way to start.I'm so fed up with both political parties that I'm taking 6 months to get a website up to run for Congress as a fierce independent on a grassroots, compromise platform. I want to get the far left (WBAI, The Nation, the Green Party, Bernie Sanders, Dennis Kucinich, etc.) and the far right (Ron Paul, the Tea Party, the John Birch Society, and Constitutionalists of all stripes) to work together to finally collapse the political duopoly that we have for so many decades allowed to micromanage our lives from DC.We need to wrest control of our children's education, our healthcare, and our welfare back from DC and deal with those real life, complex problems on the state level, where there is wide leeway to tinker with socialism. And we need to bring most of our troops home and stop trying to run and feed the world from DC - when there's a good reason to go to war, Congress can declare it and we should fight it to win, and when another nation needs our help, we are free as individuals to send them our money or join one of the many private groups helping our fellow earthlings all over the globe. We simply cannot continue to do it - we are broke.As vital as all of that is, wresting control of our money supply back from the private bankers is the single most critical issue facing our nation - this economic pestilence is a direct result of their monopoly grip over our currency. Both parties collude with those silk suits and allow them to conjure our money out of nothing with a few strokes of a keyboard. The trillions of fiat dollars they flood our economy with inflated the prices of stocks in the 90's - they call it the Dot.com Bubble. They \\"fixed\\" that by flooding the economy with trillions more, inflating the Housing Bubble (though it was much more complex than that). They \\"fixed\\" that by flooding the economy with trillions more, further destroying the dollar and leading to the soaring prices of commodities (gold, silver, food, and fuel).At each stage, the Wall St and corporate gamblers kept their winnings at the roulette wheel, but Main St bailed them out when their bets collapsed, as they always do (the bailouts started way back - Long-term Capital Management in the 80's, the Mexican Peso Bailouts in the 90's...) The far left is justified in decrying this total abuse of the powers we granted to the fedgov via the Constitution, though they are dead wrong to call it capitalism - it is NOT; it is corporatism.If a doctor misdiagnoses the heroine addict's problem as withdrawal, then more heroin is the sensible cure, but while it surely makes the patient feel better for a while, it is in fact only exacerbating the problem. The Federal Reserve has us hooked on fiat money. It's how the democrats pay for the Welfare State that they sell to liberals for their votes, and it's how the neocon wing of the republican party pays for the Warfare State it uses to buy votes from erstwhile conservatives. I want to go to Congress and help put an end to it."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"Even though Barry Goldwater's \\"Conscience of a Conservative\\" is over 40 years old it is a timeless articulation and explanation of conservative ideas and philosophy.

Goldwater was a principled man who voted his conscience even though it hurt politically. After reading this book, I came to disagree with him on some things. First, education of a young adult may be up to the state, but as the southern states were doing in the sixties and seventies, it was not fair to segregate and then make unequal educational facilities available to each group. I thought his views on negotiating with the Soviet Union also very extreme. He was for confrontation which might have resulted in a nuclear holocaust.This is an OK read on the conservative political agenda. I don't agree with all the points, and think it extreme in some cases. However Goldwater made his point as a political opponent of liberalism."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"As much as most of the posts here would like it to be, this \\"book\\" wasn't written by Barry Goldwater. It was pressed upon him by 1960 Draft Goldwater conservatives, namely one L. Brent Bozell, who wrote it in 6 weeks and was \\"skimmed\\" by and eventually approved by Goldwater. Bozell was in the forefront of those who had to drag Barry kicking and screaming to the nomination 4 years later. This info can be gleaned from \\"Before The Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus\\" by Rick Perlstein. The book does encapsulate mid '50s conservative thought and is very interesting if you try to compare this philosophy with present-day political \\"conservatives\\" who are anything but. Goldwater would be rolling in his grave if any politician of today tried to wrap themselves in his flag. It seems today's \\"conservatives\\" are only interested in winning elections (by any means) and staying in power (by any means). In other words, the only thing they are conserving is the status quo. Many of his proscriptions were very popular with the people but were hard to put into practice as it would mean rolling back gov't programs that many considered sacrosanct. Today, Conscience of a Conservative could be read by many as a welcome return to \\"true conservatism\\" and if things get any worse in these times, people may wake up to a great realization that we need to get back to basic, simple government as envisioned by democracy's founders."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"THE CONSCIENCE OF A CONSERVATIVE represents the touchstone of modern conservatism. In 1960, clearly and articulately, Barry Goldwater made the conservative case on many modern issues: the role of the federal government, federal fiscal policy, tax policy, foreign affairs (although dated now), the welfare state, and many others.Goldwater believed that economic, political, religious and social freedoms were intertwined and dependant upon one another. For example, free markets were as necessary to a free society as the right to vote and infringement upon one was infringement upon them all. Goldwater was not alone. Towering intellects like economists Hayek, Friedman, Hazlitt and others argued the very same case with profound results.In the late sixties, another voice would take up these arguments: Ronald Reagan. Building upon the conservative foundation of Goldwater, Reagan would initiate the Tax Reform Act of 1982 and America would enter a period of economic growth never before seen in the world. The principles that Goldwater espoused and the policies of monetarism, lower taxes (supply side economics), and fiscal restraint fueled an economic engine which is still running.Goldwater was not a policy wonk. He was a conservative with a heart for others and compassion and love for his country. His battle cry was. \\"Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice and moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\\" But he didn't let his passion for freedom blind him to the beliefs of others. He valued debate and respected the conflict of differing opinions; he was a gentleman about discourse and politics.Goldwater issued a warning about America's enemies when he said, \\"The real cause of the deterioration can be simply stated. Our enemies have understood the nature of the conflict and we have not. They are determined to win the conflict and we are not.\\" These words are as chilling a warning today about America's enemies as they were about Communism fifty years ago.Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and George Will both pay tribute to Goldwater in this 2007 version which are worth reading. As for Goldwater, I pray we will see his like again."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"Barry Goldwater was a bit before my time, but watching the recent HBO documentary on his career piqued my interest.

Some people suggest that, since the draft of the book was written by the late Brent Bozell (whose son, Brent Bozell III, is the head of the media-watchdog organization, the Media Research Center), credit for the book belongs more to Bozell than Goldwater.Bozell studied Goldwater's writings and listened carefully to his speeches. He wrote this book in close coordination with Goldwater Conscience of a Conservative is pure Barry Goldwater, circa 1960.

You can read it in an afternoon, but think about it for a long time."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"Unlike most of the books coming from modern politicians, this book is short, very succint, and although it speaks of what were current affairs in 1960, the examples chosen still stand out as relevant and a good explanation of the problems exposed.But this book is great not because it flows well and is readily understandable despite the distance. This book is great because almost every one of the dangers that Senator Goldwater warns about, is still there, and is still worsening. The federal government encroachment, the addiction to taxing and spending and to creating new social programs, the threats to economic freedom from subsidies to inefficiency and disproportionate power of unions (but not of the workers), the increasing interference on education, a foreign policy planning and execution that doesn't serve American interests (although Communism is no longer a world threat or a threat to the USA), and through it all, patent disregard for the Constitution, for its text and for the reasons why it was written with the words it was written. All of them, also, dangers that both parties were guilty of feeding already in his time as they still are in ours.Seeing the current state of America, its society, its government, and its relations with the rest of the world, it's eerie to see how a prescient conservative with a clear mind was already predicting the world we live in, and how still more than 50 years later so many still refuse to listen and refuse to act. It also makes it all the more interesting to consider what would have been the consequences of a Goldwater victory in the 1964 Presidential election; and all the sadder that it didn't come to pass. After Goldwater, over 50 years have passed and even with all the problems he spotted in 1960 worsening, America and the free world are still surviving, if battered. But do we have 50 more years to waste?"},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"This is the classical statement of conservative thought prior to the current neo-conservativism. There is much for todays liberals and conservatives to learn from Goldwater."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"Half a century ago, Barry Goldwater wrote the defining document of political conservatism. John Dean claims that hisConservatives Without Conscience, originally planned to have Goldwater as a co-author, is an update of this book. But it is too personal, petty, and small-p political to qualify.Senator Goldwater's reminds readers of the principles of conservatism upon which he believes his country was founded. Concerned about New Deal and Fair Deal policies and an increasing liberalism in both the Democratic and Republican parties, Goldwater urges readers to counter these trends. \\"This book is an attempt to bridge the gap between theory and practice. ...to show the connection between Conservative principles so widely espoused, and Conservative action, so generally neglected.\\"Goldwater discusses the problems with Federal concentration of power, the rights left to state and local government by the Constitution, and the roles that the Federal government should--and should not--play with respect to civil rights. He laments the destructive effects of subsidies which reward farmers for not producing. Goldwater's warnings about the concentration of power and funds in the hands of union leaders remains as relevant now as when originally written. Taxation is addressed next, with an emphasis on the evils of confiscation. A closing chapter discusses the dangers of communism and the Soviet Union--threats which have thankfully been neutralized.Some key quotes:- \\"...the first principle of totalitarianism: that the State is competent to do all things and is limited in what it actually does only by the will of those who control the State.\\"- \\"A sociologist writes a paper proposing to abolish some inequity, or a politician makes a speech about it--and, behold, a new \`civil right' is born!\\"- \\"We have seen that unions perform their natural function when... association with the union is voluntary; the union confines its activities to collective bargaining; [and] the bargaining is conducted with the employer of the workers concerned.\\"- \\"The Red Cross benefits all of us, directly or indirectly, but no one suggests that Red Cross donations be compulsory. It is one thing to say that a man should contribute to an association that is purportedly acting in his interest; it is quite another thing to say that he must do so.\\"- \\"We have been led to look upon taxation as merely a problem of public financing: How much money does the government need?\\"- \\"The only way to curtail spending substantially, is to eliminate the programs on which excess spending is consumed.\\"One need not agree with Goldwater to benefit from this book. Both conservatives and liberals will find it a useful outline of early conservative thought, untainted by the agenda of any current politician. It is an interesting exercise to compare this book to Paul Krugman'sThe Conscience of a Liberal. They are well-matched guides to the roots of present-day political thought."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"I though that this was a thought provoking book for its age. Mr. Goldwater has some interesting perspectives on education, taxes, welfare, and the general role of the federal government. This book also proves that the same problems are keeping this country from being even greater than it is."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"I finished reading The Conscience of a Conservative on 28 January, 2009. The edition I read was published by Princeton University Press, edited by CC Goldwater and contained a new forward by George F. Will and a new afterword by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.First off, I should have read this book long ago. It would have saved me a lot of time and trouble. Senator Goldwater put on paper his ideas on conservatism back in 1960. He discussed states rights, civil rights, freedom for the farmer and for labor, taxes and spending, the welfare state, education, and the most overwhelming concern of that time, the Soviet menace.What I find remarkable is that everything he said back in 1960 is pertinent in 2009, including the Soviet menace. Just replace the word Soviet with Islam Fascism and everything he wrote is still true.In a nutshell, what Senator Goldwater is stating is that the Federal Government is involved in areas of our lives that not only it has no business being in but is also against the United States Constitution.The Preamble of the United States Constitution states \\"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\\"The U. S. Constitution Online web site - http://www.usconstitution.net/ - explains the term \\"domestic Tranquility\\" as \\"One of the concerns of the Framers was that the government prior to that under the Constitution was unable, by force or persuasion, to quell rebellion or quarrels amongst the states. The government watched in horror as Shay's Rebellion transpired just before the Convention, and some states had very nearly gone to war with each other over territory (such as between Pennsylvania and Connecticut over Wilkes-Barre). One of the main goals of the Convention, then, was to ensure the federal government had powers to squash rebellion and to smooth tensions between states.\\" The site also states \\"Welfare\\" as \\"Welfare in today's context also means organized efforts on the part of public or private organizations to benefit the poor, or simply public assistance. This is not the meaning of the word as used in the Constitution.\\"Senator Goldwater's argument is twofold. One - the Constitution means what it says and we risk being a unique nation by not following this document and two - the Constitution is not a living document. It does not change according to the times. If you want the Federal Government to do something that is not in the Constitution, than there are procedures set forth in the document in order to do that. The most prominent example of this is the use of the term \\"...promote the general Welfare.\\" Today's politicians - Republicans and Democrats - take that to mean they can legislate in order to help the citizens. That is not what the Founders meant.Notice also in the Preamble that it is the \\"People\\" that formed the Federal Government, not the other way around. Too many liberals and leftists conveniently forget this fact.Senator Goldwater also references the Tenth Amendment which states - \\"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\\" Basically, the Supreme Court twisted this amendment which allowed the Federal Government to get involved in the business of the states.The only item that taints this book is the afterword provided by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. He uses the afterword to write a diatribe against President George W. Bush. In my opinion this afterword add nothing to the book even though RFK, Jr., attempts to make the point that if Senator Goldwater were alive today, he would side with the Democrats against today's Republicans. RFK, Jr., - as well as many others - tends to miss the main point of Senator Goldwater. He was not siding with Democrats or Republicans when he wrote this book. He sided with the U. S. Constitution and the United States of America.I am sure that Senator Goldwater would be appalled at today's Republican Party - as many conservatives are as indicated in the 2008 General Election. He would probably be appalled at how the Republican Party voted to extend Medicare and Medicaid just as sure he would be appalled at how his successor - Senator John S. McCain - pushed through an anti-First Amendment law, at how a Republican President signed it, and how the Supreme Court upheld it. I cannot say with certainty if Senator Goldwater would be appalled at how President Bush ordered our intelligence agencies to listen in on calls coming in from overseas but I am sure he would be upset about Robert F.

But it's not just the politics: it's the idea that Man is not just a political or econimic animal, but a spiritual creature in need of freedom to prosper. The opening salvo of this slim volume is still the standard by which I judge candidates (woe to them!). Goldwater asks: Where is the candidate who will say, 'I am not interested in government efficiency, because I maen to reduce it's size. I am not interested in whether legislation is needed until I have determined if it is Constitutionally permissible. I will not pass new laws until I have repealed old ones that have outlived their usefullness or that do violence to the Constitution. If I shall be attached for neglecting my constituents' 'interests,' I shall reply that I was informed that their interest was liberty, and on behalf of liberty I am doing the best that I can.'

Further the Tea Party movement has caused many to search out and learn more about what American conservatism is all about.Yes, many have started reading books about the Founding Fathers which is a great start in educating ones self about the truth as it pertains to our Constitution and what it stands for. Our nation and its founding documents, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were not written by wide eye radicals of their day; these great documents were written by men of great intellect, who were conservative in their thoughts.The precepts of Thomas Jefferson and the other founders were the basis of American conservatism as articulated by the late Senator Barry Goldwater.When Goldwater wrote The Consceience of a Conservative in 1960, he in the intervening 15 years from the end of WW 2 had a clear cut vision of the destructive path of which liberalism was taking the nation. Everything that he wrote and warned about 50 years ago has come to past as we find our nation on the edge of falling into the ash heap of fallen empires.What Goldwater wrote and spoke about served as the stage for Ronald Reagan to stand upon and lead America out of the failed policies of liberalism.If one is truly interested in understanding why conservatism as articulated by Barry Goldwater is the best plan to restore America to its place of exceptionalism on the world stage, then read The Conscience of a Conservative.

He lost though, and the government adopted huge programs that are still costing America to this day. Goldwater's brand of libertarian/conservative politics were responsible, compassionate, and not a burden on the American public. The large welfare state, wasteful education programs, inefficient social security programs, and other government controlled entities would not have been created had Goldwater's policies been accepted. He clearly explains why the federal government should stay out of the lives of the people and business, not only because it is for the good of the society, but the Constitution calls for it as well. Goldwater believed in expanding states' rights and letting liberty and freedom with responsibility be the norm in society, not a far-reaching goal.

It is definitely that and more. Goldwater's overriding idea is the most liberty for the individual balanced by the rule of law. I found his critique of union still on spot for today. His views on dealing with communism are from a position of strength, still a good idea for today dealing with radical Islamic terrorists. I may be unusual but I read the afterward by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and had to chuckle. The first part of his afterward was fine, a tribute to Barry Goldwater, the man. But the last half of it I could see the spittle flying from his lips as he went into a diatribe against the current administration. A short paragraph on how he thought the current crop of conservatives aren't following Goldwater's ideas would have been fine and expected from a Kennedy but half of the afterward?

I don't see defining political parties, just a lot of political opportunists and demagogues. In reading and rereading 'Conscience of a Conservative', I keep reminding myself of the real possibilities that could come about if enough people knew more about this man and encorporated his ideals into their own.

And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue. -Barry Goldwater (1964 Republican Convention Acceptance Speech)If, as Oscar Wilde opined, homosexuality is \\"the love that dare not speak its name,\\" then we might say that Conservatism is \\"the political philosophy that dare not speak the truth.\\" Liberals are wont to bathe the masses in comforting but demonstrably false platitudes, because at the root of their political philosophy they maintain a series of fictions, like: (1) we're all essentially equal--all differences in intelligence, ability, etc. are a function of external factors and these external factors can be corrected by government; or, (2) all problems, both international and domestic, are soluble by government action because basically we all really have each others best interests at heart, we just sometimes need a push from Big Brother to realize it; and so on. Conservatism meanwhile is based on a set of somewhat ugly truths, derived from hard experience: (1) the natural state of man, like that of other animals, is one of competition, not cooperation; (2) it is because this competition was so brutal, often fatal, that men reluctantly gave up some measure of freedom, in order to establish a government to protect them from one another; (3) government, foreign and domestic, is now the greatest threat to man, because those governments will seek ever increasing levels of control over human behavior; and so on. Obviously, conservatives are left with a harder sell here.Therefore, while conservative academics express themselves openly, you very seldom hear conservative politicians present their ideas in simple unvarnished fashion; for the most part it gets dressed up in warm fuzzy language. Every once in a while though, especially in times of great crisis, someone will step forward and actually enunciated conservative values in blunt terms--modern instances include: Herbert Hoover in his post presidency phase; Charles Lindbergh and the America First movement; George S. Patton during WWII; Robert Taft after the War; Barry Goldwater in the early '60s; Ronald Reagan from 1962 to 1988; and Alan Keyes today. Significantly, most of these men were either destroyed personally or were denied the opportunity to exercise real power, either by voters or by party power brokers. For all the noble cant about how voters wish that politicians were more truthful, their actions at the voting booth tend to indicate the opposite. They would much rather be comforted than confronted.It is against this backdrop that we must consider Barry Goldwater's seminal treatise The Conscience of a Conservative. And it is only once we understand these circumstances that we can appreciate how significant a book it was; in fact, it may be the single most important written work of ideology ever produced by a practicing American politician of any real stature. Considered first merely in terms of the audience it reached, only Tom Paine's pamphlets can be said to provide it any competition for popularity. Adjusted for population size, it is probably true that Paine's Common Sense is the best selling political treatise in the nation's history, but it is also true that Paine, though obviously political, was not truly a politician, at least not an office seeker. It is also the case that Presidents and presidential contenders have written bestselling books dealing with politics, but they tend not to be ideological. Instead they are wifty things like JFK's ghost written bit of self serving puffery, Profiles in Courage, or Nixon's eminently forgettable, Six Crises. Of course, ex-President Ulysses S. Grant wrote one of the great memoirs of all time, but he did not even deal with his presidency therein. The GOP did issue its Contract with America prior to the 1994 Congressional elections (a document which borrowed from Goldwater's book and philosophy), but there was no single national candidate behind that text. No, there has really only been one great political treatise promulgated by a single man and then used as a campaign platform. For that reason alone, you would think this book would still be in print and be a subject of academic study.Even more remarkable is the fact that almost all of the book is still topical today. On the very first page, Goldwater talks about his annoyance at Republican leaders who feel compelled to call themselves \\"progressive Conservatives\\" or, as he quotes then Vice President Nixon: \\"Republican candidates should be economic conservatives, but conservatives with a heart.\\" This discussion so closely parallels current Conservative angst over George W. Bush's use of the term \\"compassionate Conservative\\" that it's almost spooky. In his discussion of taxes, he comes out in favor of a flat tax in terms that presage Steve Forbes:I believe that the requirements of justice here are perfectly clear: government has a right to claim an equal percentage of each man's wealth, and no more.(Bear in mind that he was saying this at a time when top tax rates went as high as 90%.) He goes on to discuss the education crisis--that's right, the crisis in our schools is entering at least its sixth decade (I assume we would carbon date it around the time of the Sputnik launch). In the section on the Welfare State, he correctly forecasts that the dependency of the poor on government largesse would ultimately degrade them and turn them into virtual wards of the state. In assessing the now defunct Communist threat he wisely foresaw that disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union would be a dead end for the West and that the only way out of the Cold War was to confront the Russians and win it. And while the USSR is obviously gone, in a section that could be reissued today by Pat Buchanan, he concludes by questioning the value of the United Nations, entangling alliances and foreign aid and demands that we adopt one standard in the area of Foreign Policy: is the action helpful to the United States?GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"In 1964, Barry Goldwater produced a superb treatise that calls for smaller, limited government, compliance with the U.S. Constitution, lower taxes and lower spending. He identified the first principle of totalitarianism: that the state is competent to do all things and is limited in what it actually does only by the will of those who control the state. In contrast Conservatives believe that we are morally and legally obliged to comply with the U.S.Constitution ensuring the concept of limited government.Goldwater then identifies that neither of the two main parties, Republican or Democrat, maintain a meaningful commitment to States Rights and the 10th Amendment, which is a prohibitory rule of law, recognizing State jurisdiction in certain areas: \\"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\\"Goldwater very succinctly explains the \\"Conservative position\\" related to numerous issues to include:CIVIL RIGHTS - Unless a right is incorporated in the law it is not a civil right and is not enforceable by the instruments of the civil law.FREEDOM FOR THE FARMER - No power over agriculture was given to any branch of national government.FREEDOM FOR LABOR - Conservatives favor State right to work laws which forbid contracts that make union membership a condition of employment.TAXES AND SPENDING - One of the foremost precepts of natural law is man's right to the possession and use of his property and earnings. Property and freedom are inseparable.THE WELFARE STATE - Marxist objective is to socialize the means of production (and) intend to subordinate the individual to the state, buying votes with promises of \\"free\\" federal benefits: housing, school aid, medical, hospitalization and retirement.EDUCATION - Federal intervention in education is unconstitutional.Whether you are Republican or Democrat, this book is concise primer on American politics that is as relevant today as it was in 1964.I read an early edition while attending USMA at West Point and Goldwater transformed my childish views on politics to an adult understanding of key issues.Tea Party Revival: The Conscience of a Conservative Reborn: The Tea Party Revolt Against Unconstrained Spending and Growth of the Federal Government"},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"I have always liked Barry Goldwater's famous statement that \\"extremism in pursuit of liberty is no vice.\\" Many of my friends were horrified at this statement, which implies that we should seek victory over rather than coexistence with the Soviet Union. I deeply appreciate that Goldwater, Reagan, and other American conservatives rejected this pusillanimous position in favor of pressing a struggle for democracy over totalitarianism.I have also been curious concerning the philosophical and moral foundations of various political philosophies, including liberalism and conservatism. This brought me to read this 1960 publication, which reignited the American conservative movement. The book was ghostwritten by Goldwater's speechwriter of the 1950's, J. Brent Bozell, Jr., and hence probably reflected Goldwater's positions better than Goldwater could have written himself.\\"Conservatives,\\" says Goldwater, \\"take account of the whole man, while the Liberals tend to look only at the material side of man's nature.\\" (p. 6) This critique of American Liberals seems quite apposite to me. Of course, both Liberals and Conservatives value freedom and democracy, but Liberals seem to obsess over the distribution of income and wealth, as though more equal is always better, and have less income that someone else is prima facie unfair and personally debilitating. Contemporary American Liberals have taken to talking of family values and dropping the God-word whenever possible, but at least until Barack Obama, it has been unclear whether American Liberals have any really vision except redistributing wealth to the \\"middle-classes.\\"Goldwater continually preaches the importance of \\"individual responsibility\\" in this tract, and faults the Left for wanting to place the responsibility for well-being on the state rather than the individual. He argues repeatedly that when state power is extended in such manner as bureaucracy replaces individual initiative, freedom will inevitably be compromised. Indeed, Goldwater's most important critique of increasing the size and the power of the state is that this will undermine individual liberties. I find this a curious and unsupportable claim. Of course, in the era of Communist totalitarian regimes, many would find this argument plausible. But it is not. I don't see any reason that the state could not assume an extensive level of power without compromising freedom, provided we are careful to limit the state's jurisdiction and to maintain a high level of freedom of the press and association. \\"Politics\\" says Goldwater, \\"is the art of achieving the maximum amount of freedom for individuals that is consistent with the maintenance of the social order.\\" (p. 7) This sounds plausible to me, and indeed eloquent. However, it is not clear that freedom is ever in conflict with the maintenance of social order.Much of Goldwater's argument relates directly to political issues of the day (e.g., farm price supports, the role of labor unions, states' rights) and are unexceptional, if characteristically conservative (e.g., school segregation is evil, but we have no right to interfere with Louisiana and Mississippi). His general stance is \\"conservative\\" in a sense that today would render him politically irrelevant. \\"The government must begin to withdraw,\\" he asserts, \\"from a whole series of programs that are outside it constitutional mandate---from social welfare programs, education... and all the other activities that can be better performed by lower levels of government or by private institutions or by individuals.\\" (p. 44) Of course, who could possibly disagree? The problem is to identify exactly when such activities \\"can be better performed\\" by actors other than the Federal Government. I take this to be a case-by-case empirical question, not one of basic political philosophy.Like virtually all contemporary conservatives, Goldwater is strong on freedom, a great critic of government bloat and pandering to special interests, but shows no compassion for the poor and has no vision of how we might create a society in which all members have the conditions necessary for them to develop their full potential as human beings. It is fine to say that people are responsible for their own well-being, but in what sense are poor children raised in debilitating circumstances responsible for their own failures? How about giving people a second chance? How about attacking the roots of poverty and social pathology? For Barry Goldwater these are not even interesting questions. They believe that simply cutting back on the welfare state will undermine the causes of persistent social pathology. I wish this were true, but it is not."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"This book would probably be better titled today, \\"The Conscience of a Libertarian.\\" At least from my experience, the \\"Conservative\\" he speaks of is in little resemblance to those claiming Conservatism today. His ideas, many of which I adhere to, get the stink-eye when discussing in every day life.It is nearly impossible to get anyone to admit that America is (at least Constitutionally) a Republic. The Federal Gov't isn't sovereign. Federal aid does not come \\"free.\\" A strong nation depends on States' Rights. Civil Rights are not Human Rights, but rights that have already been incorporated into law. Our nation is governed by the Rule of Law not men. Corporations like Unions should not participate in politics. Corporations and Unions should not have monopolistic control. Federal programs are not authorized by the Constitution. The Federal Government is not authorized to set up a Welfare State. Federal aid in education- or any program- leads to Federal control.The Goldwater vision of America is Constitutionally honorable at heart, but impossible in practice. I say impossible because I believe that America has already crossed the Rubicon. Goldwater's chapter on The Welfare State and Notes on Education show the brilliance of his foresight.His last chapter on foreign policy, namely Russia, has my jury still out. Goldwater argues that we should take a more offensive approach towards International Communism. Today, we have the vantage point of the Vietnam experience as opposed to Goldwater's pre-Vietnam horizon. I don't know what the answer is in regards to Communism, but I do agree with Goldwater that we should not welcome it onto our shores as if it is just another political theory. We should not give foreign aid to those who claim Communist neutrality. And that a weak American economy will be ripe for Communist subversion.I don't believe that the Cold War has necessarily ended. As he so predicts on the last page that Communists will continue to lay down one challenge after another; limiting the choices to all-out war or limited retreat. I think we may witness this move by Russia in the very near future regarding Iran's nuclear power. I hope that American representatives will exercise strong leadership."},{"Title":"The conscience of a Conservative","review":"In 1964, Barry Goldwater produced a superb treatise that calls for smaller, limited government, compliance with the U.S. Constitution, lower taxes and lower spending.

I for one, think that it is man's inate desire to be free of government. Surely, we need rules and guidelines for our society, but the best kind of government is the government you don't even know is there.Barry Goldwater lays much of this reasoning out in this book. While he justifies his positions in light of the times in which he lived, the principals are no less relevant today, where our government (led by both Republicans and Democrats) is becoming ever bigger and more intrusive in our lives. This book is an argument against the socialist state. The first nine chapters lay out these principals across such topics as education, labor and the rights of state governments. The last chapter, dealing with the Soviet menance (as it was in 1960) is enlightening on two points. The first being the obvious connection to the stance that Ronald Reagan took to win the cold war duing his presidency. The second point being the speculation of how a Barry Goldwater presidency in 1964 would have played out. I'll be honest and say that a true conflict between the US and the USSR could have been a possibility (as you read this chapter, you'll see what I mean).

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Precision Pool","review":"This book contains a lot of great information like most pool books, but the errors in this book are the worst I've ever seen in a pool book. I'm baffled at what I'm looking at here. Either Kanov and Stauch are not real players, or some one else wrote pages 35-37 on \\"Fraction Theory,\\" referring to fraction aiming. The illustrations are horribly and inexcusably wrong.For instance, on page 36 it says a half ball hit is a 45 degree cut, when it's actually 30 degrees. That's 15 degrees off, a 50% error. But it shows a line of aim going from the center of the cue ball to a nickel-size target (which is wrong) on the object ball halfway between the center and the edge of the object ball (which is wrong) resulting in about a 3/4 ball hit (give or take a nickel radius, lol) which is about a 15 degree cut angle... Yea. It's like a math teacher saying \\"the square root of 4 is 9\\" while pointing to a hamster labelled \\"carrots.\\" FAIL.So, they got that much wrong all in one diagram. In other words, it's NOT just a typo. The diagrams on pages 35-37 are all consistently fundamentally wrong and extremely misleading to anyone who is just learning how to aim. Who ever wrote this, doesn't know how to aim. Seriously, I can't believe this book is still for sale. I hope the new editions are better, but you're better off buying Phil Capelle, or Robert Byrne, or pretty much any other book. Pool books should allow you to skip years by providing knowledge that otherwise takes years to figure out.

This is a book I can use to develop my skills.

Now my 29-year-old son has moved back in with his pool table, and he and his friends want me to play.

It was so helpful I returned the book and bought it at Amazon, so it can continue helping me long-term. It even helps my son, who plays well enough not to be embarrassed at a bar or pool room.For me I found pocketing balls where you have to hit the target ball off-center was very difficult. Now I can get all but the most extreme cases. Soon I'll learn how to do combinations, which I've never done once successfully.My only complaint is it doesn't give you practice set-ups so you can easily try and retry whatever is a problem. For example, I put a ball at every intersection of the white markers (plus right in front of the side pockets). Then I go up and down the table, always placing the cue ball where it isn't a straight-on shot. Doing this over and over, seeing with how few shots I can sink 14 balls, has made me far better at everyday situations.I heartily recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"Even if, as the author now admits, the main argument was a bit overplayed, this is a delightful rant, bristling with wit and wisdom and marvelous asides.

Cheers."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"Pick up any copy of the Federalist Papers, the articles addressed to the citizens of New York in 1787 on the subject of the Constitution, and you will find unmistakable references to Republican Rome. The authors of the Federalist Papers (and the framers of the Constitution), Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, each had a Classical education which shaped the core of their philosophy.Why then, is Classical education gradually disappearing from high schools and colleges? Why do teachers and professors refer to Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Thucydides, Tacitus and others as \\"dead White males?\\" Authors Victor Davis Hanson and John Heath explore these questions in their book, Who Killed Homer.Hanson and Heath do a good job of explaining the Greek and Roman origins of American political thought, and convincingly warn that our citizens are rapidly becoming illiterate about the ideas that gave birth to modern republican government and free market economics. The authors perform a public service, putting together reading lists of Classical authors, and discussing interpretations of key writings by Classical authors that demonstrate the undeniable Greek origins of Western civilization.The authors also offer a explanation for the demise of Classical learning -- academic careerism, and to a lesser extent, ideology have polluted the pure teaching of the Classics. While plausible, this argument often degenerates into mud-slinging, as Hanson and Heath settle scores with scholars whom they accuse of destroying their field. Sometimes, the score-settling gets out of hand, as Hanson and Heath specifically name the scholars they are criticizing, and even accuse one scholar of literally hounding another to his grave. This gossipy material actually detracts from their argument and is not appropriate for the audience the authors are trying to reach.This book would be more effective if the authors did not take so much time focusing on their opponents and critics and instead stuck to the principles of their argument. The Classics are an essential part of any high school and college curriculum.

It is quite possible to graduate without the slightest knowledge of the monumental geniuses of the Classic world who founded our civilization.It is important to contrast the Greek intellectual stance of continuing questioning and seeking with that of Islamic scholars who maintain that all important questions have been asked and answered and further questioning is blasphemous and harmful.It is not a coincidence that science has prospered in the West.Our students cannot appreciate the value of our Constitution without understanding the it was the product of minds steeped in the thought of classical Greece.Particularly now I fear for my country.

If the university is compromised, then so are the people who are educated there, who then in turn try to educate the lower levels in K-12--look where we are. We need to ask not just who killed Homer, but why we keep stabbing him over and over again."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"In WHO KILLED HOMER, Victor Davis Hanson and John Heath address the pressing issue of the rapid demise and death of classical Greek learning in the west. At the time of its publishing (2001), the dire straits that Greek thought and culture found itself in have not improved a whit. If anything, the trend is toward a total obliteration of the very foundation of western civilization. Hanson and Heath have plenty of blame to lay and fingers to point, but the bulk of their ire is surprisingly enough directed at their colleagues, all of whom were charged with keeping the immortal spark of classical learning alive. They are especially angry when their colleagues insist that there is nothing wrong at all with their profession. Such misguided academics most often point to the geometric increase in scholarly articles published and conferences attended. And that, Hanson and Heath insist, is precisely the point. The scholarly articles are written in the most opaque jargon-ridden prose imaginable with no one reading them. The conferences are attended mostly by senior tenured professors of Greek and Latin who hand over their few teaching duties to underpaid and overworked teaching assistants who can only dream of the day when they too will be able to enter the sheltered life of a tenured academic when they know only too well that with the shrinking pool of college students who choose classics as a major that that scenario is very likely not to occur. And it is not simply laziness or cupidity that has caused today's teachers of classics to abandon the very barricades that were their responsibilities to maintain. Much of the problem they see as a changing mindset in the very viability and desirability of thinking like the ancient Greeks. Hanson and Heath charge modern modes of thought like post-modernism, cynicism, nihilism, and skepticism as the collective root cause in subverting a two thousand year tradition in the belief of Eternal Truths like beauty, justice, and patriotism into a witches' brew of deconstructive thought that insists that there is no solid linguistic, cultural, or historical groundfloor under our feet. All that we used to call Traditional Values are now to be seen as slipping and sliding in ways that suggest that there was nothing special or enduring about the ancient Greeks at all. They note that it is trendy for cultural relativists to insist that all cultures in all ages are equally viable and worthy of emulation. If so, then why study classics in the first place. The answer, Heath and Hanson insist, is that the relativists are wrong. When Homer was writing his ILLIAD, there was nothing like Greek ideals of polis or thought available anywhere else in the world. This, of course, does not sit well with those who decry the United States as the primary source of all the world's evil. Those who claim that are also the same ones who deny Greece as the initial and irreplaceable source of current western concepts like egalitarianism, property rights, and religious tolerance.As bad as things are, Hanson and Heath do not think them hopeless. In their concluding chapter, \\"What We Could Do,\\" they list alternatives to the dissolution of their profession. Among them:1) Re-introduce the classics into high school and college curriculums2) Have senior tenured classics professors attend fewer conferences and teach more undergraduate classes3) Reduce the time to complete a Phd in classics to five years or less4) Scrap the traditional doctoral dissertation in favor of several broad papers of Greek culture5) Give tenure only to those who teach a lot rather than publish a lot6) Re-acquire the belief that the Greeks were a special people who have a great deal to say that is relevant today.On the down side, both Hanson and Heath do not believe that any of their suggestions will be implemented anytime soon. As a result, when future Greek classes will be attended only by the doddering senior professors who will preside over a legion of empty seats, then it will be evident even to these soon to be retired professors that their profession has already gone the way of the dodo."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"It's no surprise to me that some people wish to suppress and villify this book. On the other hand, it is equally no surprise to me that this book has its defenders. All in all, I think one should make up their own mind about it as I have done. Read it yourself and come to your own conclusion. One thing's for sure, one way or the other this book WILL have implications. &quot;BRING HOMER BACK TO THE PEOPLE, OR THE PEOPLE WILL TAKE HIM BACK ON THEIR OWN OF NECESSITY&quot; seems to be the latent message in this well-written and honest book. I wholeheartedly endorse this book."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"Hanson and Heath describe in devastating detail the unfortunate turn to obscurity and irrelevance taken by the new generation of classics departments under the influence of postmodernist and radical leftist trends in the university. While similar problems afflict other areas in the liberal arts, the authors explain why it is particularly troubling in the case of classics, arguing passionately for the importance of understanding the ancient Greek and Roman heritage of Western civilization.One cannot help but agree with their critique, as well as with the basic recommendation of restoring knowledge of the classics to the average university student; however, the authors go too far in advising that the entire university curriculum be restructured around the classics, including the learning of Greek and Latin.Although Hanson and Heath are no doubt correct in insisting that the classics are best understood when read in their original languages, they can be understood well enough in translation. And while the authors are equally right that learning a difficult language like Greek helps one to develop a logical and disciplined mind, this objective would be accomplished as well through increased emphasis on mathematics, which would also have more practical dividends.On the whole, a very interesting book, though somewhat over the top, readily recommended to anyone interested in the direction university education is going."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"I found the book articulate, clear, a pleasure to read, and in general a good example of the virtues of studying classical rhetoric (heh!). On the other hand, like many others who have covered the same turf recently, I think that the authors missed the point by choosing to blame the usual suspects: feminists, revisionists, and all the other -ists.I attended graduate school in the humanities in the late '60's and early '70's, at what was universally regarded as one of the best schools in my field (if not THE best). In the preceding decade, as both faculties and enrollments boomed, universities had begun to model all departments on the paradigm of the sciences. I'm not sure whether this came from desire to give those departments more credibility in a world where science had become a god, or to make it easier for the bureaucratic bean-counters by basing (say) tenure or hiring decisions on the same criteria in all departments. But the upshot was that &quot;academic excellence&quot; became a game in which faculty members competed for points (publications, citations, invited papers), and students were a mere sideshow to the REAL work that went into creating a successful academic career. As an undergraduate during this era, I, like many of my peers, was completely turned off: an academic discipline that I felt was deeply relevant to today's world had been turned into a pseudo-science intelligible only to insiders.Too many authors write as if academia in the '50's and early '60's was a sort of Golden Age that fell into ruins as various politicized special-interest groups pursued their own agendas under the rubric of &quot;relevance.&quot; In fact, if academia hadn't previously turned itself into an esoteric game in which irrelevance was a criterion of &quot;academic excellence,&quot; the special-interest groups wouldn't have stood a chance. I feel that in this book Hanson and Heath went for the cheap, popular targets and completely missed the main point."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"As someone who is trying to learn Greek on my own I was quite impressed by the author's analysis of Greek grammar and what a learner of this language can expect in the way of challenges to be overcome. Moreover the author's thrilling discussion of what Greek civilization has contributed to life as we know it today is the sort of information which can instill even the most reluctant student with a desire to plug ahead to discover what treasures Greek has in store for her. Finally the list of books which the authors have suggested we read will almost certainly enrich our knowledge of the ancient Greek world without our having to acheive a doctorate to do it: this is a great book to buy and read right away."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"This book is refreshing and fascinating. However, I do wish that classicists of all kinds would stop drawing battle lines about the origins of western culture and the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" within the Greeks themselves. We might take a lesson from Herodotus, who happily wandered around the entire Mediterranean recording observations about all the civilizations he encountered and the origins of various Greek customs (many of which he derives from much-maligned Egypt). Herodotus brought to his work a warm sense of humor, an open-mindedness, and a genuine, passionate interest. Nor did he seek to be an obscure specialist. In his day he performed his histories publicly to large audiences-he investigated, and spoke to, everyone.We might also take a lesson from Thucydides, whose methods were different from Herodotus' but who recorded the events of the Peloponnesian war for much the same reason that Herodotus wrote about the Persian war: \\"in the belief that it was going to be a great war and more worth writing about than any of those which had taken place in the past.\\" Thucydides was not a propagandist but a clear-eyed observer of the complex workings of power and war. The moral questions he confronted-about the uses of empire, the value of peace, the meaning of justice, the nobility or inhumanity of war, the abuse of power-are ones Greek culture had been addressing since the conflict of Achilles and Agamemnon in the Iliad and ones we should still be considering today. The moral dilemmas of the Roman empire-the exchange of direct political participation and freedom for peace and material prosperity, the accumulation of wealth, the value or danger of mass entertainment, the fantasy of the simple life, the place of a mercenary army (just to name a few)-are also timely. I have a problem with certain professors of today not because they criticize the Greeks and Romans (the ancients criticized themselves extensively already), but because they wrap themselves in jargon and excuse inaction by talking of subjectivity. They do not confront, as the Greeks and Romans did, what I still consider the most essential, troubling, frightening, important questions of human existence: the burden of power, the meaning of responsibility, how much power and responsibility the individual citizen should have, and what, truly, is the best kind of life."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"A reviewer below, who describes himself as a cognitive psychologist with an interest in classics, said that this book convinced him not to waste four years studying Greek just to understand the nuances lost in translation; programming languages and other applied fields are worthier of the student's time. I must applaud a cognitive psychologist for taking an interest in classics, but his view exemplifies the problem with our university education that the authors of WHO KILLED HOMER aim to attack in the first place. Being in the field of cognitive science myself, I am quite familiar with the simple-mindedness, not to say ignorance and arrogance, so common among its practitioners. The view expressed by our cognitive psychologist seems quite typical. Whether or not one should devote time to the study of Greek is a matter of choice; surely the student can decide for herself. But to say that it is not inherently worthwhile as programming languages is mistaken, and to say that people only study Greek due to cognitive dissonance is exceptionally stupid. (The very concept of cognitive dissonance is neither original nor helpful, perhaps useful for social psychologists for their problematic predictions but will disappear altogether from textbooks in about 50 yrs as a historical relic of the bad old days of psychology in its primitive phase.) How can our scientifically minded psychologist be so certain about the value of something he himself never studied? Perhaps the nuances lost in translation are the truly important ones; perhaps those with such faith in translation should not claim that they have understood the classics; perhaps Greek is not as difficult as the numbers (350 verb forms) would suggest. The truth is: the professional practioners and naive friends of classics cause more harm to the discipline than its true enemies. WHO KILLED HOMER? would be worth reading if only for this reason."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"It is difficult to describe this marvelous and passionate exposition on the love of learning. Drives the reader to consider a substantial investment in the Loeb Classic library."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":". . . The first question Hanson and Heath answer: Yes, in the next generation. Already, departments of Classics in US colleges turn out three times more PhD.s than can be employed, and existing positions (in some cases entire existing departments) are being eliminated rather than filled by budget-trimming administrators. Who cares, or ought to? The authors argue we ALL should, since Western civilization--love it or hate it--is now, thanks to the spread of technology developed by western science, as well as the global reach of market capitalism and consumerism, the dominant pattern of culture on earth, and it owes this dominance in large part to what the Greeks gave it at its birth 2,500 years ago. Not to mention the fact that the history and examples of the Greek and Roman experiments in shared government had much to do with the design of our own; that representative democracy is enjoying a renascence in the world following a century of totalitarian experiments; that the study of classics (if done right) is conducive to clarity and discipline of thought and expression and the inculcation of an ethic of personal responsibility--where modern education and indeed society at large seem to have given up on these ideals altogether. If the Greeks and Romans have so much to teach us, it's largely the fault of the people who teach Classics in colleges and universities that we haven't heard about it. Apropos their thesis the authors quote Yeats: &quot;The best lack all conviction, while the worst/Are full of passionate intensity.&quot; While most hard-working professors of classics don't necessarily hate and avoid their students, focus on narrow, philological, highly exoteric specialist studies of no conceivable interest to anyone but themselves, skip class in order to jet off to network and schmooze at academic conferences (at departmental expense), or write taxpayer-subsidized, turgid, unread and unreadable fashionably-leftist tomes in an opaque, post-structuralese dialect, these besetting sins are common enough among those who run departments, select books for publication, hire professors, and in general set the agenda for the profession (argue the authors) that the the study of classics--as measured by dwindling enrollments in classes at all levels for decades now--is practically dead now in this country, and will by simple attrition disappear from US higher education in the next ten years or so. Hanson and Heath drop napalm in prose on varying types of those whom they view as narrowly-focused, self-interested careerists, indeed as the murderers of their profession and as traitors to both the society they study and the one they live in. Names are named, incriminating and revealing incidents of public record and personal observation are passed on, and passages from prominent, recently-published books in classical scholarship which seem to have no discernible or possible sense are quoted and allowed to stand with a minimum of comment. But their most magnificent vitriolic writing is saved for those learned, subsidized custodians of out shared past who simply lack enthusiasm for passing on knowledge of the Greeks and their achievements (N.B., the authors are Hellenists--that is, specialists in Greek language and culture--and their personal experiences as such provide much material), and who seem to despise as bad form the combination of learning and passion in those who actually do have it. Hanson compares these alleged drones to a particular late scholar of wide learning and generous spirit, Eugene Vanderpool by name (one which students of classical archaeology will have surely run across), and concludes, &quot;[t]o be brutal, it would have been a rare bargain to push twenty of them off the Acropolis to give that gasping septuagenarian one more year or two of air&quot; (p. 176). No weasel words elsewhere in the book, either. No quarter is given or prisoners taken: this is a declaration of war to the knife, and knife to the hilt--which is what makes it so worth reading. Especially if you do care about classics, as a current or former teacher or student, and whether you agree with their indictment of the discipline they clearly love and are proud to serve or violently don't, you've got to read this book: you're implicated in it, somewhere."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"Just a couple of thoughts after many long reviews: The prose is too cute and verbose. These are intelligent men, so I assume they picked this style on purpose. Too often I felt they continued to bludgeon a corpse with their gritted-teeth humor.The middle section, about who did the killing of Homer, was not nearly as interesting as the beginning and end (which are more about the Greeks). Write something inciting and enticing and student will come to it, demanding something of value. Whine over your colleagues, and you may drive some away.

As useless as an understanding of Attic Greek currently is, they should know that no one chooses a degree for being difficult and unprofitable. One of the traits that they apparently admire most about the Greeks is a healthy pragmatism and common sense, and attaining a doctorate in classical studies seems to contradict any notion of either. :)On the other hand, I can sympathize with their frustrations in trying to teach an uninterested and uninformed student, who views college solely as an income multiplier. I can certainly applaud the courage it takes to defend a system based on absolutes in an environment which recognizes no absolutes but the nonexistence of absolutes. For many of my professors in fuzzy studies, concepts and facts had to packaged carefully to avoid all possibility of slighting the cultural identity of someone in the class. We had the &quot;black Socrates&quot; argument once, and insubstantial as the entire issue was, this argument raged across four entire class periods in charges against the professor for bias and serving racism.I appreciate their candor, even if I agree with the opposition on several points. However, I think it's good enough, just for encouraging a future generation of academics to damn encoded language and stand behind something which they know to be unfashionably true. God knows too little of what we learn in college has any real application in life, but that would be a lesson worth learning for anyone."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"If you want to enhance your defenses against the onslaught of multiculturalism, you can't go wrong with this book.

The second half of the book focuses on what is happening in the universities today, and should serve to raise the hackles of anyone who cares about education."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"Although I'm not a classicist (I'm a cognitive psychologist at a teaching university), much of my &quot;fun&quot; reading is in the classics - it's something of a hobby. With that proviso, I can't bring myself to recommend this book or its assertions.Classics as a field is dead. True. However, the authors are kidding themselves if they think that this is due to the way classics is taught (or not taught). The argument that students should take Greek or Latin is based on an incorrect assumption of positive transference from the language to whatever else the student is pursuing. Research shows that this doesn't work in reality - a big problem for the approach the authors are taking.On a positive note, the authors convinced me not to study Greek. The idea that it is worth the time to spend four years studying a language in order to better understand a nuance in translation is criminal! My students (hell, all students) would be much better off spending four years learning programming languages.I believe classics are dead at the college level because of the students, not the teachers. I can see where a good professor (like Hanson) can &quot;create&quot; a thriving classics program, but to appreciate classical literature, one really has to have lived a more complete life than the average 18-year-old American. The discipline just isn't as inherently interesting for students as more applied areas of study.A few other points from a psychologist: 1) the book treats psychology as if it were counseling, and bad counseling at that! 2) learning Greek is essentially cognitive dissonance - the more difficult the trial, the more valued the experience. This shouldn't be confused with the actual merit of what is learned. 3) Freud was wrong; the catharsis that Hanson &amp; Heath feel in backbiting successful (grant-wise) colleagues only leads to more anger. Stop the insanity!I'll stop now by saying that I'm a great admirer of Hanson's other works (I'm not familiar with any by Heath). The Western Way of War is a gem, and Hanson's work with The Landmark Thucydides created a wonderful classics experience."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"I cannot understand why the authors of this book, like so many other &quot;conservatives,&quot; feel the need to condemn non-western cultures as a means of celebrating Classical civilization. The authors' disdain for multiculturalism notwithstanding, we DO like in a multicultural world, and that must be part of our educational system. There is no good reason to say that this or that culture was less than adequate just because we prefer (as I do) the Classical world. Also, the authors' position that fifth-century Athens represented some sort of spontaneous generation completely contradicts all the good work of M.L. West and others who have shown the important linkages between Classical Greece and the Near East. I wish someone could present a coherent argument in favor of a traditional approach to education (like Great Books) without coming off sounding like Aristophanes, Allen Bloom, Rush Limbaugh, Jerry Fallwell, and this book's authors."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"WHO KILLED HOMER is a tract by Victor Davis Hanson and John Heath seeking to change the contemporary method of teaching and researching Classics--which is facing a decline in popularity among the average student--turning it towards the political and moral ideals the authors hold. For these two, the Greek world (Rome and Latin literature is present here only as an afterthought) is seen as a paragon of political, social, and ethical organization whose lessons undergraduate students must learn. Hanson feels that America is facing \\"balkanisation\\", so from the Greeks the youth of today should see that it is desirable for the life of the \\"polis\\" to speak a single language and shun outside cultural traits (including, presumably, such innocent things as food, music, and clothing) just as the Greeks spoke Greek and despised the Persians. They also suggest that Greek literature contains moral insights that the writing of other eras cannot impart, and so is the only basis for a solid education.The first objection I have against WHO KILLED HOMER is that this idea of classical Greece as worthy of emulating is simply a misinterpretation of the Western heritage. It is the confluence of the ancient world and the grace of Christianity that created the society we know today; only after Christianity entered the life of the Empire do we find a meaningful guide to thought and action. If we want to form the morals of our children, we'd do better teaching them the Church Fathers and the history of Byzantium than the incomplete thought of Athens. Hanson and Heath have raised up the Greek thinkers almost as idols, seeing them not as occasionally interesting intellectual figures, but as the solution to all our problems.Hanson and Heath feel that research has ruined the university, and that there is little value in much of recent publications. The authors want all research to be on broad, generalized topics that even non-specialists can understand, but in the end it seems that they simply don't understand the value of criticism and haven't learned its terminology, therefore it scares them. While I have seen poor theses appear in print, I've discovered that even the most obscure and specialized studies are occasionally useful to me as a student. I don't care much for ancient literature, but I do read quite a bit of 20th-century poetry and prose, and the close criticism written about my favourite authors has only helped me appreciate even more what they wrote, not led me astray into meaninglessness. My own experience as a knowledge-hungry young person leads me to see that research is valuable and instructive.Hanson and Heath would prefer to see an end to publication, and recommend heavy teaching loads for faculty. This would be disastrous, for the traditional system of lecturing only draws faculty away from research and demotivates students. I'd rather get everything by drawing together all the many resources in the library than by having to come in and listen to a single boring lecturer every day. Similarly, I'm sure my lecturers would be happy to concentrate on research instead of wasting their own and students' time with classes. Less lecturing is the key to happy, motivated, and successful students and productive faculty, one simply needs to see how much more educated undergraduates turn out in countries were class attendance is not mandatory, but where clear study goals are given and the final exams are rigorous. There's a reason why most of our most brilliant professionals are immigrants trained abroad before coming to the U.S. for graduate education, and our productivity would tank if Hanson's plans succeeded.Another serious fault of the authors' thesis is that they assume the only reason to read Greek is to understand the thoughts of classical writers. That may be true for Classics majors, but there are many students who take Greek as part of their training in comparative Indo-European linguistics. I could really care less about ancient literature or Plato's philosophy, but I still need a grounding in Greek grammar, ideally in a diachronic context. Were the ideals of Hanson and Heath put into effect, the entire field of Indo-European studies would disappear. Is limiting the possibilities of what one can get out of the material really an improvement for scholarship? And if I have to \\"think like a Greek\\" when I study Greek, do the authors think I should also be sacrificing to Agni and Indra in Sanskrit classes?The writing style here is quite annoying, at times being a screed and always being too passionate and unstable. As one Classics professor has said, Hanson's texts attempt to speak persuasively instead of authoritatively. Furthermore, the authors make digressions into other complaints they have about modern life that strays from the central thesis, as when they rage against free verse and claim it is \\"non-poetry\\" written by \\"non-poets\\". All in all, I see little value in the book, since the claims of the authors that Greek civilization is the only thing truly worth of study is simply false to most people. One can sympathize with their plea that general writing and representing Classics to the public is worthy of respect, but this is wiped out by their raging against specialized research. All in all, a problematic work."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"The authors of this book claim that the study of the classics (Greek and Roman) is dying, or already dead, in American universities. This may very well be true. But beyond that, I failed to get their point.First they argue that no other civilizations have anything better to offer for an explanation of the life we live today than the classical Western ideas of Greece and Rome. No argument there. That is why the West is dominant in the world and why others envy us and many wish to emulate us (or destroy us).One chapter quotes many books and articles by modern classicists. These quotations are laughable in their incomprehensibility. This, I believe, is the authors' point, and it is well taken. But so what? No one but other academic classicists could read this stuff, and they probably don't understand it either.They seem to believe that no professor of classics actually wants to teach but only to find ways to get time off (with pay) to write incomprehensible books and articles.The authors have a lot of spleen to vent in regard to the study and teaching of the classics, and they've vented it. I hope they feel better. They have my sympathy, but it's unlikely that their book will have any practical effect.They go on to say how difficult it is to learn Greek or Latin and that without visiting ancient sites and soaking up classical history, the student can't really \\"know\\" classics. It seems a lot of work for someone who just wants a college education to secure a better job. Most people can't afford to luxuriate in the classics for four years only to find themselves without a usable degree."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"There used to be a time when philologists had an intimate knowledge of world literature. For instance, if you read Erich Auerbach's classic \\"Mimesis\\" you enjoy the book of an grand old man of letters who like a souvereign displays his careful and passionate readings of the classics, and gives you thoughtful reasons why Homer could not survive. Compared to this grand old tradition Victor Hanson's book is thin-lipped and merely offers cheap polemics. One misses refinement and culture."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"First. I have yet to read the book. This will be a quick response to some of the reviews. Undoubtedly our current civilization is founded on the basic ideas first expounded in Greek by Greeks. However, these ideas were profoundly influenced by admixture of ideas first expounded by Semites in Hebrew, and later by Arabs in Arabic. The original works have all been translated into modern languages many many times. No need to learn the languages to get the basic ideas, especially if you consult multiple sources. Second. The discipline required to learn Greek, Latin (and well, why not Sanskrit while we're at it) will produce a way of thinking that is much more likely to be organized, coherent, and thereby more influential. The discipline required to advance in mathematics will also produce this type of thinking in terms of organizing thought, but not necessarily in expressing those thoughts. Better to do math and language. Best still to do advanced math, using Russian texts, and really twitch and tweak the dendrons. Third, to sum, my father, a minister, once told me that any church to which I belonged was as good as any other. What mattered was my own dedication to that church, and the depth of my belief in its teachings. I love Greek, I love math, I am dismally inadequate in both fields, but find great joy in the pursuit anyway."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"In a typical neoclassicist's manner Mr. Hanson avoids talking about the Jewish-Christian basis of western culture. This is a problem because the actual reason for the decay of the Greek and Roman classics is not that they have been made unattractive by classics departments but that already in antiquity people found something more challenging in Jewish and Christian culture. The 'death of Homer' is not a modern phenomenon. The following books are a few examples of the vast literature on the subject: Michael Walzer, Exodus and Revolution; Walter Wink, Engaging the Powers; Ramsay MacMullen, Christianizing the Roman Empire."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"It may seem that another reader&#65533;s review of this book is superfluous. The battle lines are clearly drawn. You either hate Hanson or you love him. When I say that I love him, I am simply saving those who hate him the trouble of reading further.But for those of you who are new to the debate, there may be some value in reading on. Victor Davis Hanson emerged on the scene in the early 1980s with a wonderful little book called &#65533;The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece&#65533;. This readable, engaging tome was taken up by, among others, John Keegan who embraced some of the ideas and began to publicise them.&#65533;Who Killed Homer&#65533; emerged much later. It is a brilliant polemic &#65533; a fact that is often missed by the critics who belabour Hanson with the charge of being too controversial &#65533; I think that was rather the point. Hanson wrote in despair and anger. He despaired of the state of education in our colleges and universities. And he has written an impassioned, polemical diatribe on the subject. As Stephen Ozment remarked, &#65533;this is a book for anyone who has loved or hated a college or university&#65533;.Like Bernard Knox who as a young man lashed out at the excessive technicality of classical studies (after reading an extended study in a classical journal entitled &#65533;The Carrot in Ancient Greece&#65533;), Hanson is incensed at the dearth of true learning at universities. He would have us go back to general principals. He would have professors stop publishing and start TEACHING.First and foremost, Hanson makes the case for Greek civilisation. However we get our Greek, he would say, we must get it. Western Culture, he says, is largely founded on Greek ideas, filtered through intervening civilisations and systems of thought. I despair of the school curriculum I see these days. My young nephews are offered, through something called &#65533;social studies&#65533;, the fleeting opportunity in Grade 4 and 5 to learn about ancient cultures. The problem is that it is left to the teacher to decide WHICH cultures they study. It is entirely possible for students in Ontario to go through school without EVER studying Greek or Roman history. And whatever benefits may be derived from the study of meso-american culture or Chinese culture, they pale beside the importance of those which can be obtained through a study of the Greeks. For the study of other cultures does not speak to the core values of western civilisation. The values which, transmitted down through the centuries to us from the Greeks, have made our culture (for the time being) the dominant culture in the world.Here is Hanson on the subject: &#65533;Yet as magnificent and accessible as the Odyssey is, the Iliad is the greater poem, the more difficult and important challenge to teachers of Greek, who, if they be teachers or Greek at all, must teach the Iliad and teach it frequently. Most subsequent Greek ideas &#65533; learning comes through pain, reason is checked by fate, men are social creatures, the truth only emerges through dissent and open criticism, human life is tragically short and therefore comes with obligations, characters is a matter of matching words with deeds, the most dangerous animal is the natural beast within us, religion is separate from and subordinate to political authority, private property should be immune from government coercion, even aristocratic leaders ignore the will of the assembly at their peril &#65533; start with Homer, especially the Iliad, but never again are they presented so honestly, and without either apology or elaboration.&#65533; And these Greek values, he maintains were UNIQUE in the world. Democracy, free speech, separation of church and state, a civilian army &#65533; these idea (and others) ALL began in Greece and nowhere else. And yet the general public in the west knows less about itss origins that EVER before.The dust jacket notes, &#65533;&#65533;the formal study of the origins of Western Culture is disappearing from American life at precisely the time when it is most needed to explain, guide and warn the public about both the wonders and dangers of their own culture.&#65533;What you will come away with from this book, if you have an open mind at all, is either a new (or perhaps renewed) appreciation for Greek culture. You will want to read the Iliad again and you will want your children to read it."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"I've gotten a kick out of reading others' impressions of this book. As a former Classics B.A., I can sympathize with lots of sides of this argument, and so the book comes off a little bombastic. That said, the message that classical education should be saved from extinction is a very important one, and deserves as wide an audience as possible.The issue is relevant to everyone, on one of any number of levels: the importance of history, the value of translation, the psychological insights into ancient culture and therefore human nature, I can go on. Studying ancient languages,as a general exercise, can serve a valuable individual, and en masse cultural purpose in the pursuit of meaning and the construction of better ways of living for the present. It runs the gamut of educational value: as philosophy, as politcal science, as psychology. I think most people, at least in theory, would agree with this.All the authors are saying is that the value of studying ancient languages is simply not being preserved by any particular stewards, as in centuries past. They are concentrating on Greek and Latin because those ancient languages are the key to understanding our Western culture. They are not saying that Chinese or South American ancient languages are less import PER SE, they are simply saying that Greek and Latin are the MOST RELEVANT languages to our Western culutre, whose values have influenced more and more cultures across the world. These values- democracy, equality, freedom, etc.- are taken for granted by my post-Vietnam generation, and so studying their roots may not seem very PRACTICAL. But one can only hope that some cultural awakening may open more young peoples' eyes to the value of understanding the past and the rich intangible personal rewards of initimately knowing an ancient text.Which brings me to the point of contention most fervently drawn out by the authors: that the intrinsic value of classical stewardship (as &quot;the keepers of the flame&quot;) seems to have been lost in a selfish, uppity, ridiculously esoteric publishing game that leads the profession, and its subject matter, into a dead end. Although it is important to find new ways of looking at things to reach new understanding, the authors seem to suggest that it's more important at this point in time to abandon the incestuous pursuit of arcane, often boring and largely irrelevant dintinctions and &quot;discoveries&quot; and re-assume the duty of passing on tradition.I'm not saying that comparative studies of literature and language are without purpose; rather, the degree to which it has become the focus of Classics departments in the US seems to have reached the point of absurdity. Granted, there is intense competition for very few jobs, so who could be blamed for scraping the bottom of the intellectual barrel for kernels of academic novelty? But at what price? Whatever it is, it's too great. That seems to be what the authors are saying, and I think the authors say it courageously. The need for this book being great as it is, its sometimes extreme tone and POV can be overlooked.On a personal note, If there were more jobs in academe, especially Classics, I would have probably foregone the business world. But there is a culutral amnesia that belittles the value of understanding the past, and thus the demand for Classics classes is just low. This book is very valuable, in that it courageously draws first blood against the cultural forces threatening the preservation of the historical roots of the West."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"The core of WKH? (as Hanson and Heath charmingly call their own book) is a savage indictment of university Classicists. The answer to the question \\"who killed Homer and why?\\" is classicists, and for filthy lucre. For money, career, fame and professional advancement, classicists have betrayed the Greeks by preferring academic heights to actual teaching, by turning Classical Greece into one more subject for multiculturalist, postmodernist, queer theorist, what-have-you studies, by ignoring the greatness and uniqueness of Greek culture and not caring what the Greeks actually have to say. The professors don't live like Greeks, they fail to match word and deed. So disinterested grad students (with their eyes firmly on the professorial heights) do all the actual teaching, and the students aren't coming anymore.And Hanson and Heath confess that they don't believe that university Classics can be saved.(Incidentally, the authors make it pretty clear that taking the Greeks seriously is antithetical -- and may be a good antidote -- to nonsensical multiculturalism. There is truth, there is virtue, and all things are not equal.)Interestingly, this core is sandwiched between introductory chapters which set out the unique importance of the Greeks and also the history of Classical Studies, emphasizing the sometimes revolutionary contributions of amateur classicists and a closing chapter giving an introductory syllabus and commentary to aspiring amateur classicists, ten books by Greeks and ten books about Greeks. Hanson and Heath say they hope for another Homer, but they seem to be sending out a homing beacon to another Schliemann, Parry or Ventris.Good for them. Their devastating scorched earth criticism and their fluent, accessible writing make this book a fun read as well as a compelling one."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"This an excellently researched and written book which keeps the reader's interest strong from the beginning to the end. I come from an Economics background with a strong amateur interest in ancient greek history and mythology, but after reading this book my experience during the six years of studies in Canadian and American Universities came back to me to remind me of the problems and challenges facing higher academic education, which I had sensed back then(early 80's). I feel there is a common pathology in all academia in the west and the lack of proper classical training, from the early years, may account for that. The book offers an excellent account of the contribution of greek wisdom to western culture, and for modern Greeks (it has already been translated in modern Greek)it is also useful to see that they are not the only inheritors of ancient Greece, and rightly so, language and customs apart. In addition, the book answers accurately to the recent resurgence of the supposedly &quot;afro-asiatic&quot; roots of classical civilisation and gives the right perspective to the whole debate. This book should form a basis for a reexamination of university education and all education for that matter. By stressing our common western heritage, feeling proud of it, we can interact more fruitfully with the other traditions in the world. Cultural mix-ups do not offer solutions to problems facing the world today. The forces of ignorance, superstition and the irrational loom large. The world has benefited by the Greek spirit and should not discard it too easily, in view on new &quot;millennia&quot; promising ideas.

Although much of the diagnosis is open to debate, perhaps faulty on several points, the controversy has perhaps obscured the basically accurate point the authors seem to be making, that of the passage of a great tradition of learning. The author's indictment of the method of teaching certainly rings true. I arrived with a lot of advanced placement and my knowledge of classics peaked the first week of my freshman year as I ended in a permanent huff over pedantic Wilamowitz style philology and disappointed that that was all there was going to be. So university was at least an opportunity to educate myself in the Western tradition by ignoring the professors. Majoring in classics was a big risk, what a waste.This is such a provocative and interesting book that one need not agree at all points to find it important reading. And it is strange and sad a high tech civilization seems both unaware and indifferent to the disappearance of this form of education. Part of the problem is that for all its science modern society has no coherent view of history and the authors attempt to rescue the study of Greece from faddish theory is convincing. Their 'utopian' proposal to remedy the university graduate scene is radical indeed, small wonder irate colleagues counterattacked.This book raises questions beyond its basic thesis. We need a new type of university educational system, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"An immensely amusing critique of higher education in general and classical eduction in particular.

I recommend this book to all parents before they take out a third mortgage to send Jack or Jill off to Ivy League U only to have them emerge five years later no wiser than before, and any enthusiasm for true intellectual achievement beaten out of them by the pretentious mediocrities who infest the professoriate.My ultimate accolade for this work: Juvenal couldn't have said it better."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"Victor David Hanson's and John Heath's devastating expose of the Anglo classicist establishment, 'Who Killed Homer? - The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom' (San Francisco: Encounter Books, 2001. ISBN 1893554260) is a book which infuriated classicists because - and as an ex-academic myself I can vouch for this - what it tells us about them and about their utterly baleful influence on our culture happens to be true.Classicists as a class are here accused of being idle, arrogant, greedy, irresponsible, amoral careerists. They are cads who care little if anything for Greek thought and who have nothing but the most extreme contempt, not only for the general public which pays their salaries, but even for their students since they would rather disburden themselves of the distasteful task of teaching by passing it to an underclass of slaves known as 'graduate teaching assistants' while (when not gadding about the world on an endless round of international 'conferences,' i.e. mutual back-slapping canape-munching cocktail-slurping gabfests) they themselves engage in what they fondly describe as 'research' (i.e. the scribbling of esoteric monographs on utterly trivial matters which no-one is ever going to read) since they would blanch at the thought of actually doing something useful.The laziness, greed, and arrogance of these elitists have pretty well destroyed the classics as a subject of study and hence as a profession. Many of their former colleagues and most of their ex-students are now flipping burgers or driving taxis, and I think one may confidently predict that it won't be long before the remainder of this elite are looking for similar work since no society can be expected to indefinitely support such a useless class of parasites.Since their collective efforts have helped to effectively undermine and destroy the foundations of Western Civilization, the demise of classical education being simply one facet of the larger ongoing demise of the West, one wonders if they will perhaps feel a twinge of remorse for what they have done when the tentacles of the New Dark Age they have helped to spawn reach out to coil about them ...?"},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

The Greco-Roman tradition gave us the foundation for our own form of a Democratic Republic. While it is the PC fashion now to criticize the Greeks for their treatment of women and slaves let us not forget that many countries/cultures still engage in slavery (West Africa), or brutal treatment of women (Islamic). As so elegantly pointed out, the *only* culture which took major steps to eradicate these inequities were the Western ones and most specifically the United States.Even in Ancient Greece, many voices (Aristophanes, Euripides) can be read as speaking out against social injustice. If we let the classics die in our colleges and universities upon the sacrificial altar of feminism, multiculturalism, or political correctness, we will have lost part of the American soul and more importantly - our intellectual heritage!

The first is the role of the classics in contemporary academic life. The other two issues involve us all.In the first, Hanson and Heath offer a sustained argument on the problem of post-modernism. They explore the issues of historical research and reasoned evidence in contrast with interpretive assertion and critical theory.They also consider the relationship between research and teaching. This issue heads the agenda of the formerly independent schools of art and design that are now developing university-level programs.Hanson and Heath assert that university education requires reverence for truth, a concept of the good life, a model of appropriate education, and an understanding of how education gives rise to excellence in societies and individuals. These arguments demand the attention of everyone who teaches at university. The authors call for a rebirth of the concrete Greek values of public discourse and democracy, even though they neglect the equally vital abstract virtues of theoretical inquiry and scientific speculation.This is a sustained argument from reasoned evidence.

My only regret about WKH? is that it escaped my notice for ten years. As I told my wife, I felt that the book had been written about my own experience, or that I had actually written it myself. On almost every page it now has numerous highlights and many margin notes, some as simple as \\"Amen!\\"The authors make a strong, clear case for the value of Greek and Roman thought in the modern age. Along the way they make much deserved attacks on the academic institution of America's institutions, with its obscure and pointless writings, emphasis on fringe issues, general failure to embody the values of what it claims to teach. I can agree wholeheartedly with almost everything the authors say because I have been there. The issues they attack, and even some of the very professors whom they charge with dereliction of academic duty, served to end my own pursuit of a Ph.D. in Classics some years ago thanks to their focus on things that did not truly matter.If you want an encomium of Greco-Roman learning, if you want solid reasons why the Greeks and Romans matter very much today, this book is required reading.

Certainly other cultures have contributed to the American miracle but we MUST understand the Greeks and Romans in order to understand where we have been and where we are going.

An informative and well researched piece."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"Rarely have I encountered a book wherein the answer to a question posed by its rhetorical -- but well-intended and no doubt provocative -- title is so obvious. Merely reading the cover jacket will inform a potential reader who \\"killed\\" the ancient Greek poet; one needn't slog through over three hundred pages to solve this mystery. Furthermore, the questioning title assumes a fact I wholeheartedly reject: that Homer is \\"dead\\" -- a concept (as it must be) that the authors never actually define beyond his near-disappearance from the collegiate curriculum.To that end, I doubt it'd be giving away much to tell you that -- according to Hanson and Heath -- Homer's killing took place in that nest of vipers itself, the modern university. Being professors they cover this familiar territory quite well, recounting seemingly every folio of recent classics scholarship that wouldn't be out of place in a Woody Allen spoof: everything from \\"feminine subjectivity in the Odyssey\\" to the homoerotic breakdown between Achilles and Patroclus. The authors go further and posit solid reasons for this tawdry state of affairs, and while their culprits -- academic infighting and privilege, multiculturalism, subjective historicism, devaluation of the humanities -- are not terribly surprising they still benefit from a fresh airing, especially in this context. The introduction itself describes a sordid little tale of how their initial paperback publisher balked at its *own printing* at the last minute, apparently strong-armed by a clutch of academics whose delicacies were bruised in the first edition. On more than one occasion, I got the impression the authors -- both in writing this book and toiling within their respective classics departments -- were characters in their own Greek tragedy.And perhaps that was at least partly their intention, for when they arrive at remedies Hanson and Heath fall back on Greek wisdom itself. Reviving the study of Homer by \\"thinking like a Greek\\" and having professors actually *model their behavior* by centuries-old standards might seem a quaint piece of overreach. But the authors appear quite serious, and given their intricate detailing of the university's suffering due to the loss of Greek wisdom they have little choice but to recommend harsh remedies. I was rather disappointed they didn't consider more pragmatic alternatives, from both the \\"demand\\" (e.g., introducing the epics to a younger audience) and \\"supply\\" (suggesting more wholesale university reform) sides. I understand that college is their turf -- but I wish they betrayed more knowledge that it's not the *only* turf.A few other pitfalls tarnish the author's case. Organization is not a strong suit: five languid chapters read like extended (albeit interesting) essays and one is even entitled \\"Who Killed Homer - and Why\\". (Isn't that the name of the book?) Curiously missing among the chapters, however, is a more serious omission: any *consequences* of Homer's \\"death\\". (Wholesale elimination of Classics departments? The final death knell of classical wisdom? A new dark ages?) I'm aware this comes perilously close to reviewing a book the authors *didn't* write -- but given the dramatic problems and remedies discussed, this seemed an especially curious oversight.But \\"Who Killed Homer?\\" is still worthwhile reading for both its withering indictment of university practices and detailing of the cavalcade of rude jokes that now pass for classics scholarship. Its bibliography and suggestions for \\"when all we can do is read\\" are also more than welcome and might even inspire a healthy number of non-students to tackle the Greeks (and Romans). In fact, if enough readers outside the ivory towers surmount the tasks of understanding classics and even applying their teaching to their lives -- another topic Hanson and Heath consider far too briefly -- their demise at universities might just be nothing more than another nail in that overpriced, coddled, and increasingly irrelevant coffin."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"Victor Hanson's polemic \\"Who Killed Homer?\\" is a convincing but exhausting explanation of why and how Classicists are ruining the teaching of Greek and why and how it should be changed. Hanson gives evidence of how perverted the study of classics has become (\\"there are now five or six Classics professors in the country for every senior Classics major, over thirty articles and books each year for every graduating student\\"). He describes the abandonment of undergraduate teaching and the abuse of faculty privileges.The section I found especially interesting was his defense of why we should learn and study the Greeks. In short, Greek civilization is the wellspring from which all of Western civilization flows, and since Western civilization is both the most dominant civilization in the world and the civilization that characterizes our country, it is worth dedicating serious effort to. Greek knowledge can enrich our lives and build up our character.The tone of his book is aggressive; Hanson knows who his enemy is and attacks without hesitation. If you find such reading off-putting, then you won't like this book, but I found it invigorating to read the thoughts of someone who can back up his ideas and is unafraid to stand behind them. Reading this book has bolstered my interest in the classics, but also importantly, helped me to become better attuned to the pitfalls (or sinkholes!) of academia."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"If you are on a Classics faculty somewhere, you will either love this or hate it. If you're a layman, chances are you will find it riveting. A well-written, devastating critique by two insiders."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"It is unfortunate, if not surprising, that this book's hostile and hyperbolic claims are cloaked in engaging and clever rhetoric. What this rhetoric cannot disguise, however, are the authors' unexamined prejudices. To be sure, they are operating within the finest tradition of Classical rhetoric--that tradition being to lament the loss of an ancient, poorly-defined golden age, to blame modern decline on ethical degeneracy rather than complex social, political, or economic forces, and to offer an absurd straw man as whipping boy.The authors argue that Classicists themselves are to blame for the decline of the humanities in this country and vigorously argue for the cultural superiority, indeed almost the perfection, of the Greeks. Their savage attacks on contemporary scholarship reveal a troubling oversimplification, even ignorance, both of the scholarly theories and of the social history involved . Any reader at all acquainted with Greek history and literature will, for example, be surprised to learn that the Greeks were early women's libbers and that, for Greek women, \\"the veiled, mutilated, and secluded were not the norm\\"(57)--despite all the evidence of women's confinement to the house, their restriction from public space, their inability to practice a trade or enter into legal and financial agreements, and their lifelong dependence on a \\"kurios\\" (literally, \\"master\\") who virtually owned them. The authors' argument that Homer articulates a clear, uncomplicated, ethical worldview would appear laughable to any reader of the Iliad. Homer's men may say 'He is better by far than you' (50) but the question of who is indeed the better man--Agamemnon? Achilles? Hector?--is constantly raised and never resolved. The authors' claims of cultural superiority border on the jingoist, the nationalist, even the racist. Everything good, democratic, and modern about our civilization--including Classical Liberalism, Christianity, and even gunpowder--comes from the Greeks. The Romans, the Jews, and the Chinese might have something to say about these claims.Even more unfortunately, the authors'--justified--concern about the current state of Classics teaching and research is wasted on ad hominem critiques of individual scholars of Classics and on an attack on the profession as a whole. The larger, and very serious problems, of American higher education in all fields of the humanities are ignored. As a graduate student in Classics, I was disturbed to find that, by seeking to better understand and interpret the texts I love, I am apparently betraying them and I was astonished to discover that I am doing so for monetary gain. My checking account suggests otherwise."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"The authors and I agree about just one thing: Greek is a beautiful language, well worth learning. Sorry, two things: start with Lattimore's translations and Dodds' The Greeks and the Irrational, and if they don't fire your imagination, forget it.However, it's tragic that a book so eager to defend the magnificence of Greek culture should have been written by such illiterates. The prose is deeply dull, and the authors are fond of making idiotic pronouncements; at one point, they say that no-one has written about the grim side of farming since Hesiod, a claim that would leave Thomas Hardy and Mary Webb surprised, as well as Tolstoy. Their outline of the pastoral tradition mysteriously excludes Theocritus, too, even though his take on hill-farming is far less misty than Virgil's. One could go on nitpicking forever, but the main objection must be that they make Greek seem much more difficult than it really is; this we don't need. Moreover, their whole thesis is that we should learn Greek in order to be more like the Greeks. This leads to a highly selective portrait of the Greeks; presumably the authors don't really want us to spend all our money on flutegirls and shellfish.... hold on, we already do that. As for the continuous warfare, the empire-building, and the trimmers at Delphi and the dummies at Sparta, and lastly the slaves (to paraphrase MacNeice) forget it. What the authors never consider is that the practices we all like about the Greeks might actually be inseparable from what we don't like. A better motivation for studying Greek is simply to hav eth supreme cultural experience of reading epic and tragedy in the original. Oh, and the Gospels too.This book is Culture for Hicks. Dump this dullsville polemic and get Homer out again. Or try Ted Hughes's marvellous Tales from Ovid."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"I have great respect for Mr.Hanson as a classicist.The teachings of the ancient Greeks (and Romans to a lesser extent) have been corrupted by materialist, post-modernist, and amateaur \\"scholars\\" in the past 40 years. The worst of these are the feminists, who use the seclusion of Athenian women to make war on Greek thought and culture. For these women, I have this to say: Have you ever asked Athenian women whether they were upset by the position they had? Maybe they were happy to be housewives and to take care of their husbands and children. There are many examples of famous female poets, teachers, and artists from ancient Greece so no one has the right to say that women were abused by men who did not allow them to have a career. Those who were truly worthy of praise received praise. It is clear that feminist scholars don't have anything to prove so they go out and about trying to destroy real knowledge. Their targets are not only the ancient Greek classics but also later European philosophy. It is clear that whatever they do to destroy classical thought, the classics will endure and rise above them."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"As a Classics grad student, I have to say I do not recognize the Classics departments he describes in this book. The Classics scholars I know (and I've met many of them; it's a small field) are dedicated fair-minded scholars, not 'careerists.' Furthermore, Classics was one of the first areas of the humanities to acknowledge the debt the West owes to the East (back before it was fashionable) and if Hanson thinks the venerated M.L West was some dippy postmodernist, he'll have to go through me. Finally, Classicists have never gone wholesale for the New Historicism/cultural relativism that has paralyzed, say, academic English departments. The whole academic world needs to be dipped for these ticks, but Classics less than most.I think Hanson is endorsing the same antique parody of the Classics field that our multicultural critics use against us: tweedy, irrelevant conservative white supremacists. Classics has not been like this since the days of Basil Gildersleeve. Classical scholars of the 20th century have achieved the difficult feat of balancing progressive ideas with sober scepticism, and they deserve some kudos for it.Let's let Victor Hanson go duke it out with Martin Bernal, and let the rest of us go back to teaching, writing and keeping the flame alive."},{"Title":"Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom","review":"After many years of teaching and then reading \\"Who Killed Homer' it is easy to see how the bible and God's Word is defiled. The bible has been added to for hundreds of years and the verses have be rewritten to say what the church corporate business interest desire. The poeple in the churches and bible studies are being taught stuff that is being passed through men filtering God's word of any truth. What passes through the churches is the stuff of Fantasy Christianity. In the sciences, mathmatics, law and busieness such stuff as \\"Who Killed Homer\\" could never happen. They have standards that cause the student to profit. The same sort of lazy people have sunk \\"Who Killed Homer\\". Lazy places attract the lazy. The money is too good to pass up. Christianity has been long ago poured as concrete. It can't be changed. The lies are built in for money. They don't need to learn any more. They don't need to get paid any more for what they do. They get paid too much as it is considering what little truth escapes. Seminaries have to be a joke to those who run them. God is used as a bean bag to play other games. Truth has no place in Fantasy Christianity. Surely the Pew Warmers have no idea what the bible says. Fantasy Christisnity has been around since the Greek Constantine' enthusiastic mother. The last honest man was Augustine and then Roman Catholicism died and it continues to die a slow death. However Fantassy Christianity wants to be just like Catholicism. \\"Who Killed Homer\\" is the format for who is killing Christ all the while they give God the Big Middle Finger. Unbelief is giving God the Big Middle Finger. There is no recourse to unbelief. Unfortunately Fantasy Christianity finds God a myth as do our famous Athiest. They show it every time they give God the Big Middle Finger. \\"Who Killed Homer: will open any eye who read it.

I usually am not too enamored of short story collections, since I don't appreciate starting anew every few pages in a book. But this book is an exception. I was amazed at how quickly one became caught up in each story. The first story is The First Seven Years, and is a most touching story, setting the reader up most felicitously for enjoyment of each of the following 12 stories."},{"Title":"THE MAGIC BARREL","review":"This set of stories surprises one with breadth of understanding which it exhibits.

And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."},{"Title":"THE MAGIC BARREL","review":"These stories are pervaded with a certain sadness and disappointment, a sense of life as largely a trial in suffering. They are also however deep in a kind of quiet beauty, a unique language of slightly Yiddishized American colloquial restraint. The title story, and the most famous one tells of the hopes and disappointments of poor Jews seeking to find their ' bashert' their destined mate. It touches upon the world of tormented souls selling illusions to themselves and others. It really moves us with the sense of how the dreams of life turn bitterness into greater bitterness, with longing disappointment beauty. These stories are for those who are willing to read and take inspiration from the sadnesses of life, that nonetheless enrich our human meaning."},{"Title":"THE MAGIC BARREL","review":"These stories about New York, even when read fifty years later by someone like me from a totally different demographic, in Los Angeles, are still relevant. There are universal self-loathing themes for all immigrants, at all times. I wouldn't call it immigrant lit, but it's more like human diaspora lit, the transience of people, and how people make sense, however limited, of the world around them. Strongly recommend. Malamud is able to make writing about trash untrashy, but not in a falsely glorifying way, but in a humanizing way. These are real short stories, not failed novellas."},{"Title":"THE MAGIC BARREL","review":"I wasn't sure about this book but decided to give it a shot and I am so happy I did.

He writes very well indeed. These 13 stories, mainly about first-generation Jewish immigrants in America, but also about visitors to Italy from America, capture so much of life in a society where one is an outsider---that feeling of \\"being here but not here\\", or of living in a country, but not belonging. The wasted ex-coffee salesman, the harassed landlord, the loner rabbinical student, they all seem to pulsate with failure, with uncertainty, and fatal mistakes. Ah, this is a book about life all right, but it's a book in which the vision is almost tunnel vision. Every single story, without exception, deals with people who cannot rise to their own imaginations of themselves. They meet frustration, failure, death or disappointment, they are deflected from any purpose they might have once had. They are melancholy shades of fruitless endeavor. Does even one reach his ambition ? (They are all male.) No, the student doesn't find a house in Rome, the would-be art critic abandons his research, the would-be lover lies about his Jewish origins and loses the beautiful girl, the buyer on credit never pays back, the so-called reader never reads, the shoemaker allows his daughter to marry an unsuitable man. Only once, after humiliating an angel to tears, does an old man admit his mistake and save his wife from death, and this occurs in the only fantasy among the thirteen. Most of the characters lose, their labors come to naught, they grow wiser, but sadder. I would assume that Malamud himself felt an outsider everywhere, comfortable nowhere. If that is not true, his dreams must have been filled with worry, because this is a most melancholy collection. Does anyone smile ? Does anyone laugh ? Does anyone dash down the street radiant with love ? No. Life is full of personal shortcomings, a bald spot, a stubborn rejection of family, an inability to swim or make money. Frustration and lies run rampant--people certainly do shoot themselves in the foot again and again. Life is a tragedy, life always ends in disappointment-these are truths told in half the literature of the world, but there is more to our humble existence than that. Even when Malamud writes a humorous story, it is filled with underlying doubt in human nature, concentrating on the tendency of people to try to be what they are not. If you want thirteen superb stories to illustrate that sad point of view, here they are. If you think life is more of a mixed bag, then perhaps this book will only depress you."},{"Title":"THE MAGIC BARREL","review":"'The Magic Barrel' by Malamud contains several (mostly) entertaining short stories involving Jewish (/Yiddish) characters from the 1950s. He captures a culture and way of life today's generation has no memory of.

Recommended."},{"Title":"THE MAGIC BARREL","review":"This is a very strange book. There are a lot of small messages that Mr. Malamud delivers in each of his stories. Everything from the mistreatment of others to stealing. He covers many different aspects of life that can help make people better citizens of the world.I did not enjoy his style of writing though. It was dull, and very dry. There was no excitment in any of his stories and I found it hard to keep myself reading. I can see how somebody else might enjoy it though... if you're the type that likes dull, dry stories, Malamud is the guy for you."},{"Title":"THE MAGIC BARREL","review":"&quot;The Magic Barrel&quot; was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is &quot;sad,&quot; that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."},{"Title":"THE MAGIC BARREL","review":"I was looking for a hard to find book in large print.

Hopefully, sisters won't give up on all black men, because all of us are not knuckleheads even though it may seem like it.

It was very comforting to know and feel that I am not alone in all my dating experiences and the pressure that is sometimes placed on us women to get married.But what I think makes this book such a wonderful anthology, is the fact that editor, Taigi Smith included a talking back section for the brothers.

Not as long either, mercifully. Some insightful stuff here, and great photos. I am beginning to appreciate and even like abstract art."},{"Title":"On Abstract Art","review":"A woman cuts up bits of paper and makes a tacky collage that would disgrace the aesthetic judgement of a pre-schooler; a man paints a big red dot, a big yellow dot, and - wait for it - a small black dot; another man drops bits of torn paper and glues them on a sheet of paper where they fall; another man (famously) paints vertical and horizontal straight lines and fills some of the squares with primary colors; a woman puts rows of bricks on the floor in straight lines that would be extremely thrilling if it wasn't so mind-numbingly boring; and, to cap it all, a man paints a white square on a white square - duh!It's all supposed to mean something. For Briony Few, the the writer, it means a chance to spout over-intellectualized jargon that usually boils away to nothing. For example:Human figures and objects have been expelled from the pictures but there is always at least one body which remains in this scene and that is the spectators.This means that someone is looking at a picture that doesn't have any people in it. Great. I guess this is how they earn their money in academia. This book is a good example of what is quite common in art history and criticism, the pose of knowledge instead of its communication.The history of modern art can be divided into two clear movements. First there was a move towards increasing explicitness in art which climaxed in the efforts of Surrealists like Dali to drag the processes of the mind out into the daylight. This tended to strip away the veils of mystery and made art almost unnecessary, so this was quickly followed by a move to mask and hide the subject of paintings as we see in the work of Miro and his three dots, abstract expressionists like Pollock, and colorfield painters like Rothko.When I read a book like Fer's I realise that the same process has occurred in art criticism. For every critic like Martica Sawin (Surrealism in Exile) who do what they can to make the processes of art history transparent, there are countless others like Fer who do what they can with their lardy, tautological, and over-conditional and ambiguous jargon to mask and veil the true history of art. People like this are driven by the same motives as medieval guilds and the Magic Circle. They want to retain control of their area of expertise by preventing their audience, customers, or readers, from finding out about it. We are simply supposed to read this book and 'sense' their knowledge without being allowed to understand it. Understanding whatever clear ideas such writers as Fer have, would reduce them to the the intellectual minnows they are."},{"Title":"Race of Scorpions","review":"Dunnett keeps the plot turning and twisting all through this book; expect to mutter a number of amazed exclamations along the way. She does all without losing depth or compassion in her characters, and without a speck of lost credibility in the plotline. This is a fascinating journey through part of Christianity's most troubled history, and one has to wonder if the series' setting hinges on the events in this particular book. The fictional characters are so real and engrossing as to nearly outshadow the huge and wonderful historical setting. An engrossing, moving, unpredictable, and completely unforgettable book."},{"Title":"Race of Scorpions","review":"Dorothy Dunnett never disappoints her faithful readers. This, third in the Niccolo series is a wonderful book that depicts the unsettledness of the Island of Cyprus. We learn that this tempestuous island has always been an important one because of its strategic location. I enjoyed this book, because we actually got to see some of the mask come off Nicolo in his encounter with his Katelina. In true Dunnett fashion, this encounter did not take place in a private and safe bedchamber, but in a place where nature abounded, as well as danger. The history that we find out in this book is also equally interesting and true to what actually happened. This is certainly another great series."},{"Title":"Race of Scorpions","review":"This is the third book in the House of Niccolo series. We join Nicholas as he is trying to move to a new stage of his life after the tumultuous events of Trebizond. Alas, Nicholas and his skills are too well known and he is being courted by many while still being hunted by his enemies.During this particular journey, Nicholas becomes involved in the battle for Cyprus between the Lusignan 'Scorpions' Carlotta and James. At the same time, Nicholas becomes involved in all manner of affairs and events and also discovers some truths along the way.Highly recommended. Lady Dunnett brings the history of this period alive while at the same time continuing to develop an enigmatic hero whose skills and abilities (and possibly an occasional flaw) are magnificently showcased.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Race of Scorpions","review":"This book has all of the interesting aspects of the previous two, such as politics and fighting, plus there is more romance though still not quite enough. I am disappointed in that even after reading the first three books of the series I still don't feel like I know the main character. The only other complaint I have is the lack of explanation as to how Niccolo has survived all of his injures without the least problem. Perhaps there is some magic involved? Even with today's medicine, someone with Niccolo's injures would at least have some trouble with their arms or legs. The story is none-the-less quite engaging especially in seeing how Niccolo gets out of all his difficulties."},{"Title":"Race of Scorpions","review":"Ah, the frustrating pleasure of reading a Dorothy Dunnett novel :-) Her writing is dense, her plots are complex, and her characters (especially the male ones, which IMO are infinitely easier to like than the female ones) are nothing short of psychological studies. Often, while reading this book, I felt like I was way in over my head. And yet, I kept going, and the reward of Dunnett's writing, and her story, are well worth the effort, in my view.In this third part of the eight-part Niccolo series, Nicholas is kidnapped and taken to Cyprus to fight with King James for control of the island, against his legitimate half-sister Carlotta. We meet the engaging courtesan Primaflora, who becomes Nicholas's mistress. We also see some old friends, such as Tobias the physician and Captain Astorre and the faithful Loppe. We meet Nicholas's cousin Diniz, and are reacquainted with the vengeful Katelina van Borselen.But the vortex, as always, is the dynamic, ingenius, amazing Nicholas vander Poele. In this chapter of the story, we see how Nicholas deals with the stress of so many demands. We see how he deals with the love of two women whom he does not love in return, and the guilt associated with that. We follow him as he tries to play two sides (and sometimes more) of a dangerous game, all so that he can come out the winner. Nicholas is difficult to understand, but fascinating to read about. And in Race of Scorpions, Dunnett ensures that readers will not fail to follow him into his next adventure."},{"Title":"Race of Scorpions","review":"On this, the third chapter in the Niccolo series, we fin Nicholas has been &quot;kidnapped&quot; by the 'presumptuous' King of Cyprus who is actually trying to recover his kingdom from his sister.Nicholas is able to help the king and at the same time obtain franchises in his dye works and sugar fields. He meets with Katelina, the mother of his only child, only to lose her once more after they reconcile. Finally, once the island is secure to King Zacco, Nicholas is allowed to return to Venice, where he faces once more his rival family, the de St Pol and Riberac.In this chapter of the story the author makes great use of description in her scenes and they are so vivid! the characters, the settings everything is so masterfully blended with reality and fiction.I loved this book and I have already started the fourth chapter.

But while his slightly older sisters neglect their duty, he helps his younger sisters save an injured princess.The story starts there, and never stops moving forward. Jerin has been raised unconventionally for his world. He reads, writes, and knows self-defense as well as tactics and strategy. His kind heart and bravery stand him in good stead as he faces moral and physical danger, and overcomes it.Other reviews have focused on the astonishing world-building Wen Spencer did for A Brother's Price, and then get caught up in the political and moral implications of the world, rather than seeing the story as a very fun tale with a resourceful young hero. Because they disagree with the politics of the story, they have marked the tale lower. It seems to me that this story was written as a reaction to some of the \\"feminist utopia\\" fiction that was written in the 1970s and 1980s. It's not so much a \\"nurture determines all\\" world as it is a world where everyone is human, with human ambitions, frailties, and gifts.Although the prose isn't as jewel-like as the Ukiah Oregon books, I still intend to keep this book, and re-read it many times. The story is a rollicking adventure story with a plucky young thing, determined to protect both his new family and his birth family."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Wen Spencer, the innovative author of Tinker and the Alien Taste series, has once again rung changes on the historical bodice ripper plot of the family daughter sold to enhance the family fortune.In this case, the female roles are reversed, with men being the protected and virginal ones, and the women serving as soldiers, butchers, bakers, candlestick makers and rulers. Spencer is so matter-of-fact with the milieu that we are left with questions only after the story is over. Why is the ratio of women to men so skewed? How did these women create a society like this, with approximately early 19th century tech?Wen's writing is so good that you don't really start asking those questions while you are reading the book. Like time bombs they only occur to you afterward. Wen invokes a nearly indestructible willing suspension of disbelief, and does it so easily that it is hardly noticeable.I'm looking forward to a sequel. Please let there be a sequel.Walt Boyes, the Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I thought this an original and thoughtful novel. The concept of a female dominated society with a shortage of males was intriguing to me, because of the realism. Many people (both female and male) have voiced the opinion that if only women were in charge of the world, the world would be a far better place. Obviously the author of this book, doesn't buy that concept. The world portrayed in this novel is as screwed up as any male dominated society in our own history. What with brothers being sold to multiple wives or worse being sold to a slave brothel (called a crib in this book).With many novels I tend to imagine myself in the settings that are portrayed, NOT WITH THIS ONE. I'm a guy, living in that world sounds like a d**n scary thing to do. I enjoyed the book, but wouldn't want to live there. I hope that this is the first of a series. I would really like the author to explore the relationships between countries and the impact that the female/male ratio has on those political relationships.The technological level portrayed in the books seems to be a mix of American West (Post Civil War) and the Civil War period. The author seems to present the fabled fast draw skill of the American West as being a necessary skill of her Queensland soldier in the novel. It might be that in her envisioned world, more emphasis is placed on the warrior attribute (the lone fighter), than the idea of organized and disciplined soldiers. As I said earlier, I hope there are more explorations into this world."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Spencer doesn't do much inquiry into What the Sexes are Really Like in her world of scarce men; I'm wildly entertained by what readers, e.g. my fellow reviewers, find plausible and what overturns our assumptions.Like a couple of other reviewers, I was exactly as annoyed by this plot as I am by romance novels that think it's fine for the world to be sexist as long as one pretty protagonist is saved by Love (and Money). For any guy who doesn't want to live in Jeris' world... well, no, join the club.Unlike some other readers, I think this is SF; the science she's playing with is sociobiology. In Spencer's alternate history (????? most of this is my deductions), somewhere around the European discovery of the New World syphilis mutated to attack male infants, which is why so few men are born and sexual diseases are so terrifying. I would guess that humanity was nearly wiped out. This is the more plausible because syphilis was a scourge in our history too.The socio- part of socio-biology describes how human culture adapts, and adapts to, human biology. The husband-buying, the male prostitution, are like the management of female fertility in our world. Spencer noticed that male fertility is, you might say, easier to share, and her families of sisters who work and marry together have a lot of biological paralells: bees, lionesses. Culture, law, and economy follow sister-logic, which follows natural selection. It isn't rockets, but it's science."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Love Wen Spencer. Love her stories. This book, actually, is pretty good. It's not Spencer's fault that the book left an unpleasant aftertaste. As a feminist, you'd think I'd just say \\"You go, Girl\\" to any writer who turned the tables so completely on gender roles and stereotypes. You'd think! The lead character is beautiful, feisty, naive, beddable (sp?) and perfectly happy with a future filled with the propagation and rearing of the species. The romantic interest (no spoilers here!) is commanding, authoritative, and seduces the lead character in a matter of oh, 5 sentences. From which a Great Love is born. The dizzying spin on the story is, of course, that the lead character is a boy, and the romantic interest a woman. But, the very things that make me crazy when it's a female protagonist, are making me crazy here with a male. I don't like to read about the diminishment of anybody, and the condescension of the dominant women toward the submissive male was just as infuriating as it would be in the reverse. Maybe I would have felt better if the love story had been at all developed. Spencer does not do love stories well, which is very odd. Often the romantic interest is attractive and interesting, but Spencer just will not generate any mood or atmosphere in which you can see love grow. Nope, love just is, which makes for a boring love story. Fortunately, the love angle is the least important element of Spencer's interesting tales. This book is worth purchasing, because Spencer always entertains. Unlike the Oregon and Tinker books, however, it is not a keeper. If the genre had more good authors like WS, this books rating would be lower. Since most of the books out there are crap, I'm grading this one on a curve."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"The founding premise of the book, what would a society dominated by woman be like? Is hardly new in speculative fiction. However Spencer built a convincing and believable alterative world based on the \\"simple fact\\" of an imbalance in female and male births numbers. The females outnumber the males by a factor of ten or twenty and the rest of the book is a logical continuation of that basis premise. Including incest, male brothels, venereal diseases, buying and trading brothers for husbands and kidnappings by the sisters who can't afford to pay a brothers price for a husband of their ownThe world in \\"A Brother's Price\\" is a fascinating mix of the American west ca 1860 and regency England, with steamboats, six-shooters theaters and ballrooms. Also it is far from a paradise or utopia as the basic human nature of hate, greed, hope and love is unchanged and it is those emotions that fuel the actions of the books characters and make them believable and their actions convincing and understandable."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Suspend disbelief, and you're okay.\\"Brother's Price\\" is the second departure novel from the Ukiah Oregon novels and in this reviewer's opinion, not as well written or explained as Ukiah's stories or \\"Tinker.\\"In \\"Brother's Price\\" women far outnumber men. The few males who are born are wed to households of women and serve as the father to many children. The title refers to the 'bride price' of a male child.\\"Brother's Price\\" is told from the point of view of Jerin Whistler, a young male coming of age and about to be sold, and Princess Ren, one of the women soon to be one of the Queens of the Realm. They exist in a beginning Industrial Age--germs have just been detected, they are capable of forming steel into ships.We open with Jerin taking a grave risk, he urges his sisters to rescue a soldier who was found injured near their spring by outlaws. Turns out, the soldier is a Princess of the Realm. They're due to be rewarded by 'sponsorship' of their family into Royal Court. This means, the handsome Jerin is going to receive a lot of attention and hopefully, a good price.The Whistlers have just managed to score a coup--purchase of a store. Land generally is held in families for generations, but the unlucky Picker family lost their man and was barely able to hold onto their fortune, so their store's being sold for their old age. Jerin must fetch a high price, else his family might be ruined, too---the expense of the store would be what they would spend on a husband to start a new generation.Meanwhile, both Princess Ren and Jerin need to find out who is stealing valuable cannons and attacking their soldiers. The future of the Realm and both families may depend on this knowledge.Just read the book. Don't wonder why or how the situation got as it is. That takes the fun out of the reading. The pacing is off in this novel. Without giving away too much of the plot, the court manipulations are too long and drawn out. We get to the point where Jerin discovers a key fact too late in the novel. The last chapters are real page turners, but properly written, the whole book could and should be a page turner."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"After reading the other reviews I don't think I have much to add, except that this book was a fun read. I am one who puts books down after 40-50 pages if I don't like them, and this was one I read from beginning to end, smiling at the cliches, and enjoying it thoroughly. It is interesting to think about what might happen in a world where women outnumber men something like 40 or 50 to 1 (or even more, that wasn't clear). Yes, fertile men would be prized, fought for, purchased, or won. Yes, biologically it makes sense for a family of 10+ sisters to marry one man they can all agree on and that man to father all their children.I'm not as sure as another reviewer that physiology would make Wen Spencer's scenario implausible. Maybe one man can overcome one woman - but 5 or 10 or more women???? And if men are sheltered, kept in a version of purdah, spoiled and pampered and not taught to read or do much besides home-making and nurturing, it stands to (Spencer's) reason that women would invent and develop steam boats, rifled cast-iron cannon (one shudders at the cost of the failures until they found something that worked), and the beginnings of indoor plumbing.All in all, if you accept Spencer's world as presented (and if you read SF, you *should* be starting with that attitude), the story works. It is a retelling of the virtuous, brave, beautiful prince(ss), educated in ways not the norm to the prince(ss)'s gender, kidnapped by the evil plotters, escaping through our hero's own cleverness, and reunited with the prince(ss)'s faithful, loving spouse(s). As one who enjoys regency romances almost as much as SF, fantasy, S&S;, etc., Spencer's book is a well-written take-off of romance, with a twist that works because Spencer is a good craftswoman. SF - yes, unless you don't consider alternate history SF.A good, page-turning read after you accept Spencer's world premise."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I normally don't read sci-fi, and I picked this up on accident thinking it was fantasy. I knew it had romantic elements in it after reading a praising review in Romantic Times Magazine.This really wasn't sci-fi, which was OK with me. The only thing that made it sci-fi was that they had guns and steam engines. People still ride around on horses, etc. The female dominated society could go either sf or fantasy.I felt like I was reading a male romance novel. What guy wouldn't want to be screwed by 30 women? The only difference with this and a normal romance novel was a love of guns and warfare. As a girl though, who am I to say no to a little romance? Ok maybe not a little.Just like a romance novel, the reader is supposed to assume its entirely possible for people to fall in love after 5 minutes. Even worse, 10 girls fall in love with the same man after hardly debating the issue. Lets face it- girls (me included) can hardly figure out what shirt to wear in the space of time it took for all these girls to swoon over the male lead.Considering I'm not adverse to reading your basic romance novel, I didn't mind all of this. It was enjoyable enough to pass the time with, but not an award-winner by any means. But for those of you looking for an exciting, action-filled sci-fi story, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Imagine a world where women have trouble giving birth to mal children because of an extremely high rate of still births and miscarriages. Women rule the world, run the factories and farms, and keep the males hidden to protect them from desperate females who are husband thieves. Men are considered property with no rights whatsoever. They are sold to wives of their family's choosing.Jerin Whistler is luckier than most because his family loves him and want to make a match for him that will make him happy. That chance comes when he helps rescue a female on his property who had been attacked. It turns out she is a royal princess and her sister Ren comes to find her. Ren falls in love with the handsome Jerin who shares her feelings. Because they have royal blood flowing through their veins Jerin is considered eligible to be the prince consort. When they get to the capital, all Ren's sisters agree to the match but there is a plot to overthrow the crown and Jerin is caught in the crosshairs.When it comes to fresh, innovative storytelling, almost nobody is better than Wen Spencer. In a world where men are cosseted and hidden away because they are so rare, the hero accepts his lot in life as the norm since that is how it has always been. Feminists are going to take this book as their symbol because the author proves women can do what are traditional male roles in our world. Once the audience starts this novel, they will find it absolutely impossible to put down.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"i purchased this novel after reading some of the authors other works. Given the consistency of his other novels, I fully expected this to be constructed in a similar manner.I was thoroughly surprised and pleased to find that mr. Spencer had constructed a completely new world and peopled it with characters who were both interesting and complex.This book is interesting if, one only contemplates he dynamics of the society which Mr. Spencer has designed. I feel that the author has, with this novel, greatly expanded the range of his writing skills beyond the mayhem which many authors feel to be necessary to make a work commercially successful.I completely enjoyed reading this book and can only hope that it will continue as a series."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Sounds like a simple change in the world - the ratio of men to women - but Spencer makes this into a compelling, sexy coming-of-age story that's full of action, intrigue, and upended gender roles. What makes that last so interesting is that it's done without preaching - it just is. Boys do housework and are protected by the women, that's just the way things are. Nobody lectures the reader - it just is. Great speculative fiction, and an awesome read."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Growing up in a society where men are rare and treated as stud commodity, Jerin Whistler, launches a turn of events when he mutually falls in love with a princess during a rescue.Considering how intrigued I was with it's description, I thought I'd give A Brother's Price a try after seeing the positive responses to it. First of all, I'll be honest, as disorienting as this book was, it really got me thinking of the subconscious way our society has accept the subjective natures of defining roles to our gender. Why is it taken for granted for males to be in the military, the clergy, or in leadership roles? The gender reversal was something that, in true science fiction fashion, was used to reflect the problems of our society in an alternate setting.However, minus this gender \\"twist\\", the plot itself falls far short of engaging. Specifically, if it wasn't for this reversal of roles, this plot could easily come from any generic story in the romance section. Protagonist rescues royalty and falls in love/need to overcome noble opposition to win hand in marriage/uncovers a plot that threatens to destablize the Kingdom (or in this case Queensland). Unfortunatly, all this \\"suspense\\" that's built up from the book description turns to be for the most part non-crucial events. In additon, however admirable the social message of the book is, it doesn't help the story if it's used in such a blunt manner. Do they need to constantly emphasize Jerin's femininity to the point that he's basically the female streotype of the romance novels? Also, why is this society the way it is? Where's the rational? Are they from Earth (thus the use of words like Stetson or k'lamor) or is this an alternate universe? What is it about this book, other than the reversed roles, that makes this science fiction/fantasy?Where other books seem to use this situation with deftness to help enliven the plot for a potent story, it's feels like this book used a standard plot to help advance the setting instead."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This book is positively fascinating. The author, Wen Spencer, draws you into her world and forces you to take on the outlook of fantasy where women are in control and men are their property, gender flipping history. While it does have its flaws such as the characters coming off as two dimensional at best instead of well rounded, though this can be explained by the multitude of characters Wen Spencer presents, the book itself is strong in its concepts and I enjoyed reading every second of it."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"amazing story; Wen Spencer makes you believe in this world and i wish there were more about these characters!

So many stories twist one aspect of our \\"normal\\" world - like adding magic - and do not carry things through to their logical ends. This story just changed one thing during the civil war era - the ratio of men to women, and went from there.A love story, good politics, adventure, and world building. I rarely re-read stories and I think I have re-read this one five times so far.Note because of the world building this seems like a sci-fi space opera romance story, but in many ways it is closer to a political thriller set in the Steamboat era."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"A Brother's Price by Wen Spencer envisions an alternate world where only one birth in twenty or so is male. In a world where males are so rare in human society, females have taken a dominant role in governance, and daily affairs.The author explores this world through the eyes of one Jerin Whistler, a sixteen year old boy who is being groomed for marriage for a \\"brother's price,\\" in the form of either cash or a husband swap (one unmarried male exchanged for another). Due to the lack of males to go around in this society, the family structure is matriarchal in nature and marriage is polygamous, where one husband is shared among any number of sisters-wives.In A Brother's Price, the story takes off when a princess is rescued and brought back to the Whistler's home, and Jerin is eventually enmeshed in a power struggle with the fate of a kingdom hanging in the balance! The author does a masterful job weaving background information about the Whistlers and matriarchal world into the story, while developing a young romance story between a seeming commoner and a princess. A Brother's Price is a gender bender Cinderella story sans the glass slipper!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"The book is set in an alternate reality, comparable to 16th, 17th century. The big difference in this world is a gender reversal. Women greatly outnumber the men, so they are the dominant sex and men are considered property. A family's fortune is actually decided by how many males they birth.The protagonist is Jerin Whistler, a male of worth, from a warrior family. His family might not have the most spotless of histories (they \\"stole\\" their first male) but they have become a family of good standing and a bit of wealth, because the females of his family have given birth to four sons. Those four sons are a great prize and it actually means that his sisters can trade or sell Jerin to get a husband of their own. This \\"sale\\" is called A Brother's Price.Jerin is beautiful, well tempered and from a good family so the sister's know they will fetch a great price or trade for him. He is of age so all of his sisters are very hopeful of a good sale.The story gets interesting when a stranger is wounded on their land. Jerin finds the woman while accompanied by younger sisters, so he shirks propriety and assists the beautiful stranger, instead of leaving her for dead. Jerin takes the stranger into the family's home and cares for her. Soon after, the strangers family comes for her and the Whistlers discover Jerin saved the life of the princess Odelia. When one of the princess' take a liking to Jerin his whole world is turned upside down...I highly recommend this book to fantasy lovers. It is a unique take on gender roles and propriety. Spencer is a wonderful author and I love most of what she has written. This is one of my favorite of hers, but I do like Tinker a wee bit more - I think it is the elves. Always a sucker for pointy ears."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"A Brother's PriceI love Wen Spencer's books, but this one threw me for a loop. She reversed the common set up of Men over Women and made the Women act like men. It was so odd that I had to read it twice in one day!!! Well written and funny. It remains one of my favorite books by her!!!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"The main character is naive male on a homestead filled with sisters. He finds love and fulfillment in a science fiction world that discriminates against him and males in general. The unusual technology levels (frontier with advanced medical) and the 'why' of the society are treated as backdrops; the romance comes first.Formula based political intrigue involving powerful women is the main plot. Gender issues and the harem-like family dynamic dominate (wanted more more sci-fic, less estrogen). Wen relied too much on gender bending to make the story good, instead of plotting and setting. The story was 'meh', though a couple action scenes were exciting. I finished it out of curiosity regarding the world building, as opposed to being hooked on the plot or characters. I didn't like Jerin (the main male character), especially when he used baby talk.Conclusion: borrow it from a library unless you enjoy historical romance. The 'shoujo' in the title refers to a Japanese anime-like influence present. I could easily see this made into a graphic novel marketed at teenage girls someday."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This may be the first and only time that I'll say this, so everyone should take advantage of it-I was wrong, my mother was right. &lt;Sigh> For years, my mother has been urging me to read fantasy and science fiction novels, to branch out of my safe cocoon of romance books and thrillers. She's touted the works of Wen Spencer as being some of the best, and yes, now that I've had the privilege of reading A BROTHER'S PRICE, I announce to the world that my mom was, as usual, correct.Kudos to Ms. Spencer for getting me so worked up with this book that I'm now compelled to seek out her entire backlist! With A BROTHER'S PRICE, we enter a world in which it's not oil, gold, or money that have the highest monetary value, but men. Men, as in male children born to mothers-an event that happens so rarely that male offspring are often hidden from everyone but immediate family, and that many of these children are treated as a commodity, bought, sold, traded, and sometimes stolen outright.For the women of Wen Spencer's make-believe world-which, by the way, reads as oh-so-probable-having a male child is cause for celebration, joy, and secrecy. Due to miscarriages, still births, and unexplained circumstances, women have no trouble giving birth to a multitude of female offspring, but a boy is a very rare occurrence indeed.For Jerin Whistler, a boy who's near to coming of age and the dreadful thought of being sold into a marriage of his sisters' choosing, taking care of a multitude of younger siblings isn't enough of a life. Taking care of the family farm-when's he let out of his sisters' sight-isn't the kind of life he'd imagined for himself, either. But with so many siblings, the majority of whom are girls, Jerin sees no other life but allowing himself to be sold into marriage for a \\"brother's price,\\" gaining his sisters monetary gain to continue their way of life.When a mysterious young woman named Ren is left for dead in the wilderness of the Whistler property, Jerin knows that it's his duty to bring the woman to safety and ease her back to health. What a surprise it is when he discovers that the beautiful Ren, for whom he's quickly falling in love, is none other than Princess Rennsellaer. For Jerin's family, all of whom are well-meaning despite their sometimes crass attitudes, Jerin's rescue of a true-blooded Princess is the chance they've been waiting for. All they need to do is return Ren to her royal family, arrange for her marriage to Jerin, and the family will be set for life.As most stories go, however, nothing is ever that simple. Jerin finds himself swept up into royal politics, where some women will stop at nothing to make sure that men are never allowed into positions of power. As Ren and Jerin grow more deeply in love, as tempers rise within the royal family, and as continued attempts to kidnap the Princess need to be thwarted, Jerin realizes that marrying for love might not be as easy as he'd hoped.I loved this book! A twist on the typical royal princess who wants to wait for her \\"one true love,\\" Wen Spencer's world of too many women and too few men is all too believable. Jerin is a hero that anyone would be proud of, not only for his bravery and devotion, but for his desire to do whatever it takes to keep those he loves safe.To my mom, thanks again for being right! And to Ms. Spencer, thanks for such a fabulous book, definitely worthy of its 5 Blue Ribbon rating!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Many of the reviews for this book have been negative because this story is for the most part a bodice ripper type romance novel with a gender twist. This is true and that is not so bad a thng. This is light, fluffy,easy reading at its best. I found the gender reversals sort of fun. Jerin for the most part is, well, a girl. Sure he may be an XY but essentially Spencer has written a fairly typical female romance novel heroine and made her a HIM. The funny thing is, the women in the novel are still womanly, even though they are strong women. Reading the story caused my brain to wander off into some interesting directions. I really wanted to know more about how this world defined Masculine and Feminine. Many readers have commented on teh lack of development of the romancce between the leads. Well, if you have read romance novels before, contrivance is simply part of the game. There doesn't have to be a reason for the characters to fall for one another. My other point is, Jerin, the lead, is a 15 yo boy. Most boys that age equate sexual attraction with love so I did not find his reaction to these women that out of character. I will admit that the reaction of the female leads to Jerin was a bit unnerving. Ren I am sure is at least 25, 10 yrs older then Jerin. That did sort of clash with my reader sensibilities. All that being said, I would recommend this book to any Spencer fan."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"What would happen if the birth ratio of men to women was 1 to 20 instead of the present 1 to 1 (approximately)?

I wish the POD people would get their act in gear !"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I have called this an \\"alternate history\\" because to me it read more like an historical novel (kind of late 1800's with touches of frontier culture but also some machinery and such) instead of a fantasy novel, though I can see why many might call it a fantasy novel. In this society, not many males are born, so the ones who are are kept safe at home by hordes of related \\"sister wives\\", I guess, only it's not like that at all. The women are very dynamic and powerful and the male characters have a lot of the traditional female traits you can find in historical romances. But at the same time they are also strong and inventive. As I do read a lot of romance, too, I just found this reversal to be fascinating.Anyway, the hero of the story is a brother who lives with a large, healthy group of ladies who I think don't currently have a \\"husband\\" between them. But groups of ladies can barter with their brothers or sons and use them to get husbands or lots of money or what have you. That's where the title comes from. The hero and some of his younger sisters end up rescuing a female soldier because all the older women are off doing other things. The hero is supposed to stay in the house where he can be protected since husband-snatching is not at all uncommon. But he rescues this lady anyway, and she turns out to be a royal princess in addition to a soldier--she also turns out to be interested in him! What follows is a lot of political intrigue and adventure.This book is not smutty even though the premise might sound like it would be smutty. It's very good and creative, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"If you want a book that blows your mind away this is it! It is presented in the form a harlequin novel, but is actually a speculative fiction. What would a society that has only one man for every eight to ten women be like? From this basic principle Wen Spencer challenges the notions of what we percieve as male and female qualities. The people presented, both male or female, each have there own unique personalities, but are still a product of their society, and it shows.A book that can be read many, many times. I am curently reading the book for the fourth time and I keep discovering how well thought out and complex this world really is. Speculative fiction tend to present a somewhat simplified world and people, but not this book. It attempts to present to us a human world in all it's complexity. The world and the people presented could of course be much more elaborate, but there's a limit to how much you can do in only threehundred pages. But for all it's treehundred pages it does it remakably well."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a book as much as this one.I'm also a reader of romance, and I really liked the love story between the main character and one of the princesses, even if it probably can't be considered a romance by normal standards.The role-inversion between males and females was very well done, and the males' limited rights in society had logical reasons behind them. We can be sympathetic to both the boy/man who wants to be free, and the women who absolutely need men to father the next generation.Is there a sequel? If not, Wen Spencer, please write one!!!Or, better yet, write the prequel (if that's the word) of Jerin's grandfather!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"What would happen if only 1 or 10 or so children were male? Wen Spencer never gives us exact figures in \\"A Brother's Price\\" but given the families we meet a 10% rate seems reasonable. Genetics wise how long could such a system last? Spencer doesn't answer that question either nor how long things have been in this way nor why they are that way in his fantasy novel. Those questions are the reason I took one star from the rating because I'd love to know the answers. Otherwise the character of Jerin, soon to be groom to a large number of wives, his sisters, his potential wives' families and their interactions are well written and kept me interested. However without the answers to my above questions I didn't quite buy into the political intrigues. That's ok because an examination of sex ratios and social dynamics was interesting and entertaining enough."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"My first Wen Spencer book - it won't be my last! Fully detailed character-driven and \\"believeable\\" fantasy/romantic story. It was satisfying for even those of us who aren't Fantasy or romance readers! It filled an evening (and into the early morning hours)that would have been wasted watching mindless television. Thanks for working hard and using your talent, Ms. Spencer."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Wen Spencer writes an interesting book. Its exactly opposite your usual expections and presents the reader with a new world to explore. I found it entertaining enough to read through it quite fast."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"As usual, I thoroughly enjoyed Wen Spencer's writing. Turning the gender-specific roles topsy turvy was interesting, and tricky to do. My only complaint, which I always find in Spencer's tales, is that the romance is just too abrupt. We meet, we fall in love, that's it. But with that fairly minor exception, it's a really good read. I read it in one sitting. Literally."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"A Brother's Price takes an interesting view on a possible alternate world. A world where Men are rare and Women wear the pants. The book follows a variety of characters and postulates a world setting that is both interesting, and at the same time not overbearing. The story is the key, the world and the paradigm of a scarcity of men, merely ways of adding additional depth to the story. And the story itself is interesting. While not overly complex, some pieces of the storyline are visible to the reader early on, it takes the reader into another world and constantly flips your perspective. The use of the word she every time you expect he, the descriptions of men as creatures of fashion and property, the rough and tumble personalities of the female characters. All of these send you down roads of thought that are as philosophically interesting as the book and story itself is light and fun.Regardless of the Author's intent, though I am quite sure she intended a great deal of the thought provocation, this book will easily provoke you to reconsider your views of male/female stereotypes, and also engage you in a fun story of the Heroine plunging headlong in to save her beloved from the events while he resourcefully attempts to get back to her.Wen also doesn't stint on the romance and I for one almost miss the fact that there is no real equivalent to a bodice for men in her world setting for one of her characters to rip.Entertaining and Thought Provoking is what I would call this book and I can only say that it is an excellent read and a book you will find difficult to put down. It isn't for somebody looking purely for romance, or purely for fantasy, but rather for the reader who likes to think, enjoy and laugh."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"A story where roles are reversed. A world of amazons where women share a husband and the husband is valued. After all the usual stories featuring dominating alpha males, \\"A Brother's Price\\" is refreshing and a novelty. The opening of the story takes a little time to get use to. Jerin cooking, looking after the kids while his sisters take up weapons on horsebacks...But once you get use to the reversal of roles \\"A Brother's Price\\" is great fun and even touching.I do not find any feminism in the story. On the contrary \\"A Brother's price\\" appeals to the maternal side of me. A world where us women protect the men folk definitely appeals to me! And the characters are charming, Jerin absolutely adorable and the princesses equally delightful. Some reviewers have difficulty accepting the roles reversal but this is friction and I am glad for Spencer's creativity. How about a sequel!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This is a romance novel. All the conventions are here, love at first sight (mutual, of course), georgeous protagonist, evil doings in the background, kidnappings, murder, exotic locales,... with one ...slight... difference. Our plucky heroine is actually our plucky hero and the to-die-for mate is actually mates as in 10 royal sisters looking for a husband. A beautiful, gentrified male with royal blood only 2 generations back and a slightly unconventional upbringing makes a fine target for romantic machinations. Throw in some dynastic in-fighting a la eastern Europe and the plot thickens.Ms. Spencer also follows the basic rule for all good alternate history writers and only asks that the reader accept one alteration to the world we know. Her alteration is that males are born in a 1 in 10 or 20 birth ratio. All the other changes in the society flow from that one change.This is a fun book. Watching Wen Spencer take the conventions of the romance novel and turn them inside out without sliding into parody is part of the fun. Writing to format can be a straightjacket or liberating for a writer. Ms. Spencer took the liberties...lots of them."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"What a strange role reversal. The men are pampered, raise the children, give the comfort (kissing the booboos), and generally have the soft hearts. They wrap their arms around the female's neck and seek comfort and strength by cuddling into her body. I know. . . it sounds so feminine. You wouldn't think you could become involve in such a novel. You wouldn't think you could picture a such a man attractive, yet, you do.In this strange world, based in a time period similar to the 19th century, men are EXTREMELY rare. Whole groups of sisters that can number as many as 10 to 30 women will share a husband in order to have offspring. The results would be another huge brode of girl siblings, with the hopes of perhaps one boy (more than that and the family was considered lucky and rich). The women guard there men by keeping them hidden away from any other woman not a sister or mother under guard. Meanwhile, the women are the ones who rule, work, fight, and labor.Jerin Whistler's family is one of the lucky ones. He may have over 25 female siblings, but he is also the oldest of four brothers, too. His sisters protect their commodity with all their force. He and his brothers are their only chance of purchasing their own husbands to share in the future. Because the wealth of four brothers, they will be able to split the sisters in two to three groups. Each group sharing one husband they will get after selling or trading a brother for. Jerin will be coming of age for marriage in only a few months (he'll be turning 16!) when a stranger is attacked on their land. With the elder sisters and mothers gone, it is up to Jerin and a younger sister (for protection) to bring the stranger home and out of danger. Little do they all realize, she's also a princess, and her and her sisters will change all their lives.I could not put this novel down. I started reading in the evening and the next thing I knew it, it was four in the morning!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This is that rare thing - a stand-alone novel. A nice change from the trilogies, quadrologies, decalogies and so forth that flood the market today.However, A Brother's Price paints such an intriguing picture of a human society where women outnumber men by about 20:1 that you would really rather like it if the author kept writing in this universe, just to help figure out the whys and wherefores!The plot is fairly standard (if usually seen with reversed sexes)- hero is married off to royalty for family advantage, uncovers dastardly plot, is kidnapped, escapes with plucky courage, is caught again, menaced and finally rescued by wives - but the questions raised by the background society don't occur until you have finished the book, so adeptly is your belief suspended. Standard plot or not, though, the hero is appealing and sympathetic enough that you worry about him and hope he gets his 'happy ever after'.I found this book well worth the wait, and will hope for further books about the society depicted."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"A BROTHER'S PRICE is a delightful read. If you like both romance and SF, as I do, you will almost certainly be delighted! I enjoyed it thoroughly. Someone gave me a copy, and I did not think from the cover that I would like it. After letting the book gather dust on a bookshelf for a few months, I picked it up yesterday and put it down only when I had to.A BROTHER'S PRICE plays around with gender questions, postulating a world in which humans reproduce far fewer men than women. Men have become a rare, prized, expensive commodity. There are other authors who have taken a more serious look at gender questions (Octavia Butler, for example).A BROTHER'S PRICE is a more light, playful foray into this territory, emphasizing action and adventure. It never gets bogged down by taking all this too seriously. It is a delightfully light, quick fantasy read. Though it plays with some big questions, it avoids any peachiness or prescriptiveness. Mostly, this is good fantasy adventure with a delightful cast of characters and setting.I recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"In the title of this review, I call it light and smooth. A Brother's Price is light because it is easy to read and doesn't raise too many hard questions. While reading it, I just slid into the world. That's why I call it smooth.Just like with Tinker, Wen Spencer doesn't use exposition, encyclopedia entries or long history discussions between characters to create her world. She throws the reader into her new world with just enough hints to figure out what's going on.In A Brother's Price, we are tossed into a world of horses, rifles, steamboats, and by the way, it's controlled by women, because there are 30 women to every man. The story itself is a romance/adventure. The princess is rescued, she and her sister fall in love with the oldest brother of the family that rescued the princess, he's invited to court so that the royal sisters can romance him and politics and danger follow.It's a fun read with a happy ending: my favorite kind."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"It's nice to find a book that completely stands out in the fantasy genre. A Brother's Price is an extremely original romance ( and please do not mistake this for anything but a romance).As the summery and other reviews will say, it is based in a world where there the birth of a baby boy is rare. In this world, women rule though clans of sisters and men are nothing but pieces of property.I enjoyed all of the little details that Wen Spencer put into the novel. Landmarks are named after females, the fairy tales and nursery rhymes also have strong female influences.The plot itself is filled with clich&eacute;s. If it weren't for the gender switch, they would be unforgivable. By far the most interesting part was when the Whistlers came to the palace for the first time and the actual courtship began. The ending mad dash and subsequent \`damsel rescue' paled for me.After a bit, it did get a little creepy especially when the author would write the man having bows in his long hair and acting like a silly little - well-- girl. What is the point of writing a female dominated society when all the women end up doing is acting like men?Anyway, my advice to readers who are thinking about this book is to once again remember that this is a romance novel... and a rather silly one at that. The whole idea of the gender switch is silly in itself so you need to approach the book with a very light heart and be ready to forgive a few small plot holes."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"What if birth/infant mortality rates result in a disproportion of one male to more than twenty females? Wen Spencer speculates that a society with such a background would not give rise to a feminist utopia. There would still be war and crime, murder, mayhem and betrayal. Men would become precious commodities.Set against this backdrop, A Brother's Price tells the tale of a plucky, young hero who finds and wins love with his wives despite husband raids and a plot against the throne. I read this book in one day and am about to commence a re-read. Wen Spencer has created a believable world with engaging characters. I look forward to reading whatever she writes next!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This book tells the story of young man in a culture where the majority of male children are stillborn. It explores what such a culture, one necessarily dominated by women would be like. As well as focusing on the life of the main Character.It is an excellent book filled with lots of intrigue,politics and action.I only give it 4 stars because while the action was good and the social interactions great. The main character was of necessity kept out of the fore front of what action was taking place.Still despite this minor detraction A Brother's Price is an excellent book and a good read.I'd recomend buying a copy, if you go to the book store without something specific in mind, then this would be a good book to pick up.The Deposed King"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I have to say that this book surprised me. Unless I missed something, the blurb on the jacket, which is different from that on Amazon, barely hints at what this story is really about.Much like others have pointed out, this is a romance novel. Except in this novel the docile beauty being dominated and seduced is a man. In this alternative universe men are few and far between, do all the women's work, and are made to \\"service\\" anywhere from a handful to 30 women who are all sisters coming from the same family. At every turn we are reminded if anyone should get their hands on a stray husband or unattached man, then they're surely going to get raped. *rolls eyes*I can't say I didn't enjoy this book because it's total fanservice. Spencer is giving women what she thinkgs we all want- a twist on the old romance genre that will kick things up a notch. And it does, however there are more holes left open than in any romance novel I've ever read, and this one is just as forgettable (if not more so).I opened this book hoping for a stand alone fantasy novel that might actually leave me going, \\"wow, what a great read.\\" Instead it's a fast read that while well structured, could have used a lot of development. It's as contrived as all romance novels, but had Spencer maybe added an extra hundred, two-hundred pages, then this could have added some dimension to the novel where I could instead say, \\"what an awesome romance novel\\"A fun read, but it is what it is and I can't rate it higher than that."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Wen Spencer always creates an interesting read. This one is not her best but is still worthy of being read because it explores the concept of gender reversal i.e. the roles of men and women in society are reversed. The author doesn't explain the reasons for this but implies that is is due to a scarcity of men.The female characters are better developed and more interesting than the male. All of the woman have strong personalities. The main flaw in the book is that Jerin, the male protogonist, is supposed to be a young male approaching marriage age. He vacillates between being a juvenile and an adult male. His relationship with older women comes off as a little creepy and unsettling.The author does get kudos for exploring an unusual plot premise whose twist is a worthwile read but not one that you will want to stay up all night to finish."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Is this great literature? Oh no. Not in the slightest. Just read the cover blurb and you should know better!Is this great Sci-Fi? Nooooo, not really. In fact, other than the gender imbalance, I'm hard-pressed to find any science-fictional elements here at all. I'm highly tempted to label this one \\"Speculative Alternate History Romance.\\"So, that established, how was it?Well, as the only example of Speculative Alternate History Romance (hereafter: SAHR) I have encountered, I found it quite enjoyable.Quick downsides:The characters are drawn in very broad strokes, little detail, and much stereotyping. Secondary characters are likewise, but worse. No real character-building here, other than the main cast. Future SAHRs take note: even minor characters can be multi-faceted.The main conceit is ignored as to cause and possible fixes. The world itself is drawn in sketchy fashion: the homestead, the city, the slums, the river... No real details of place and time anchor the story.That combined with the the odd colloquialisms (Stetsons? Six-shooters? chaps?) do add to the western feel, but they also make the world seem a little unbalanced. How did the American West get turned into a hereditary monarchy of sister-queens? Where on earth (or not) are we? If they had been missing, and the western feel put in through character or other more subtle touches, that off-balance feeling might not have been niggling at my brain while I read. Again, potential SAHR writers, take care to establish the changes and underlying intelligence about why your world is so different.The gender switch is amusing, but some of the particulars are a little overblown, and a little stereotyped. I know that's hard to reconcile, because she is purposefully playing directly against type for both men and women, but I felt that this story had the women come off as managing their new roles a lot better than the men do, and that's unfortunate. As I imagine them, SAHRs shouldn't have to be a man-bashing genre.Quick positives:The dialogue is written fairly well, and the interactions between characters are mostly believable (the initial 'romance' scenes are a little heavy-handed). I liked what little we saw of the world, and the plot kept to a very quick pace, so I never had time to think about what wasn't there. The main clan and their introduction to the city was a finely written section, and the few males in the story had distinctive characters (even the one who wasn't really IN the story.)Overall, an amusingly light read. Jerin is a sweetheart, and I enjoyed the quick visit to his odd world. Maybe I'll write a SAHR myself!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"PRICE is a nice reworking of a very old SF trope: what if there were a LOT more women than men? In this case, 15 or 20:1, in a well-drawn mid-19th C. tech-level civilization. Here, large families of (nominal) sisters dominate the PRICE polity. These families hope for male offspring that they can sell (at age 16), then purchase a group-husband for the family. The lead family here is the Whistlers, war-heroes who've parlayed a land-grant to prosperity, and who snatched an orphaned prince for their husband in the last dynastic war...The ensuing hijinx employ a good deal of romance-novel female (and male) wish-fulfillment fantasies, both sexual and non, in a not-terribly-plausible plot that moves briskly to the inevitable happy, passionate ending. Characters are economically sketched, and the action is nonstop. Recommended for light reading, but don't expect the premises to stand up to close inspection. \\"B+\\", maybe \\"A-\\".Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"synopsis: farm boy does good. saves princess. lots of political intrigue. Princess saves and marries boy. lives happily ever after.All in all, pretty good bodice ripper romance novel. I have read very few so can't compare. I found it in SF section. Its only sf in the sense of alternate history. The tech levels are a bit mismatched but easy to ignore. The problems exist where the author beats one over the head to point out that the jobs are done by the females (while not subtle, it is perhaps necessary as I needed to reframe my perceptions of the society). Also, there are strange pauses in the story where a backstory/substory is inserted or explained - like those movies about someone on a distant planet and all of a sudden there is a cut to a professor explaining the solar system and planets. This made the story drag in places - especially the explanation for the theater which was given about 5 times with more detail each time - more than I cared to know. There were a couple of strange things like going over the 100-foot waterfall and surviving - hmmm. And the fact that a hardened, ruthless, full-of-hate criminal who was going to be executed didn't kill one of her most hated enemies that she had at her mercy. Sure she would die doing it - but she was going to die anyway.There was lots of sex. There was a secret passage in the castle. Castle security was lax. Kind of creepy to think that he plays with the little children who were almost like his younger sisters and they are his wives too - and later his lovers.I liked the fact that life was valued and female infanticide was not acceptable practice. It was also nice that the male character was mostly moral - perhaps as much as he could be given his circumstances as pampered pet (this was even pondered in the book).Definitely a 'chick flick'. A nice read."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Wen Spencer is an artist in creating captivating worlds that remove you from reality. A Brothers Price is such an interesting twist on gender roles that I really wish she would write more in this universe. But she seems to have had her moment of inspiration and is no longer interested in visiting this part of her mind again. Sad."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I have very high expectations for this author - she's written the Ukiah Oregon books (starting with Alien Taste) and Tinker, all of which I enjoyed immensely. Having said that, I was a little disappointed with this latest.As an avid romance reader, it wasn't the emotional element that put me off. The initial premise was good, and I was eager to read this book based on the synopsis and excerpted scenes. However, I didn't find the main female protagonist very admirable in her first encounter with the male lead, who strikes me a very young, emotionally, and thought the book moved too quickly in terms of emotional development (the hero goes from meeting various women to being \\"in love\\" with them after a couple of conversations).Nonetheless, I look forward to future books by this author who otherwise has a great knack for putting compelling characters in very unusual situtations and letting you watch them deal with it!"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Good enough for reading it once but the moment you realize the whole purporse behind the book was to write a romance where the traditional role of a plucky heroine is reserved for a male, that's the end of the fascination. Just remember any romance you ever read, substitute a witty independent but tender hearted and loving girl for a boy, mentally reverse the roles of males and females in the society and you got the whole idea.Much less interesting or entertaining than Ukia Oregon books."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I usually find Wen Spencer's work to be easy to read. The stories tend to flow smoothly and there are rarely any obvious continuity errors or characters lacking development. This book is a wonderful example of that as despite my concerns about the world and some of hte plot twists, the story itself is one I've taken the time to re-read for enjoyment.That said, the story does have a few points that will probably raise a few eyebrows. The world in this book is one where 90% or more of all children born are girls, and Wen took advantage of this twist to explore some possible gender roles if men were a scarce resource. She does make this a more pointed issue by having sexually transmitted diseases be a major concern in a pre-industrial world that doesn't have the knowledge necessary to treat the diseases, and often can't even detect the diseases ahead of time.But Wen tries to cover for most of the major reasons the social structures from this world wouldn't work. The world is pre-industrial, but not pre-gunpowder, allowing her to argue that the greater physical strength of men is less of a concern when 5-8 women are willing to throw themselves on a man, and can shoot other women who might interfere. The story mentions \\"husband raids\\" more than once and in fact the Brother of the story gets kidnapped at one point by a family of \\"sisters\\" looking for a certain type of man to be their husband.None of this takes away from the story for what it is. Its a fun fantasy with good characters and an imaginative situation. Avoid becoming too concerned with the social philosophies being thrown around and its a good read. Just be prepared to shake your head at times at the silly premises."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I could not put this book down. A very good read and a good twist on our reality."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Okay so I finished the book. I suppose I was in the right frame of mind for it, getting ready to tear into another book of Ms. Spencer \`The wolf who rules'. For what it is, it wasn't bad, an alternative reality romance novel. I unfortunately do not read romance novels, I stopped doing that a LONG time ago, but I genuinely enjoy Ms. Spencer's work and I gave it a shot... Just like any solid romance the family that the \`hero?' came from was hard working, loyal and true to a fault, they were smart and more enlightened in their treatment of the treasured and rare males than almost anyone else in the story. Jerin was handsome and built but due to the constraints of his life easily handled by the women. He falls in love easily and he does it thoroughly, but this is not science fiction. No one can convince me of this, the story was light and the ending was expected (who wants a romance where there isn't a happy ending?) but not one of my favorites by far. I upped the star count by one, because to be fair I finished it and I enjoyed it to a point. If the female characters had been given a chance at some depth this could have been rollicking fun, as it was it was okay and that is something that I could have gotten somewhere else not what I expect to get from Wen Spencer."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This world captivated me. I am sure there are some lovers of romance who would complain about the gender role reversal, because they want their heroes alpha and experienced, so I am relieved that \\"A Brother's Price\\" was not pegged as a romance at my library. However, the romance in this story is undeniable!Jerin Whistler may be bound by the laws of the matriarchal society he lives in but he is a full character, strong and passionate and everything a hero should be - he just stays at home instead of going to battle. He is also only 15/16 throughout the course of the novel. While he is certainly intelligent (his mothers and sisters have taught him things that men in his society are forbidden from doing, such as horse riding and weapon wielding, also he was well educated at home), I found his naivete about women and sex rather adorable, not at all annoying. Jerin is definitely a breath of fresh air for me. I was getting tired of macho alpha males! I'm not saying that Spencer completely abolished gender stereotypes with this book, she merely reversed them. There's no real equality at work here, but it is still a refreshing, fun fantasy.I didn't even question the gender reversal in this book. I have read books about matriarchal societies before that made me wonder, but Wen Spencer has covered all of her bases here and I find her world rather believable. Sure, I had to extend my disbelief a bit when the females could physically overpower the males, but Spencer didn't ignore biology completely. Sometimes in gender role reversal books, the women can be brutal and the men simpering, but that wasn't the case in \\"A Brother's Price.\\" Characters here have both strengths and weaknesses and most of them are delightful, down the last child in Jerin's enormous family. Other favourite characters of mine include Ren, the most prevalent princess throughout the story and a woman of both great passion and firm resolve, and Cullen, the cheeky cousin of the princesses who befriends Jerin halfway through the novel.I don't want to give away any of the plot, but I highly recommend this book if you're looking for something a bit different. It's a truly unique world and an engaging romance. I read over 200 pages of it in a couple hours, I was that motivated to finish it, and that doesn't happen often! I'm hoping Wen continues this gem of a tale, because I'm anxious to read more about Jerin, but also his little brothers and Cullen."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Before deciding to write a review I read several of the other reviews the book received, so let me start out saying that, yes, it is a romance novel. If you don't like romance novels you probably wont like this book either. However, if you like books with strong female characters you might just like this one as much as I did.So many stories seem to put women in just so the men have something worth fighting for, or rescuing, but not this story. In \\"A Brother's Price\\" the world has been turned on its head and women are in charge. The result is that all of the female characters in this story have an innate strength that is commonly lacking in other stories.One of the confusing points for many readers of this story will come in the subservient nature of the male characters. For the most part men in Ms. Spencer's world are raised without the ability to say no to whatever they're dominant sisters or wives may want. Men are property, sold or traded on every day, sometimes into situations where they commit suicide just to get away. Something to understand: to these men violence doesn't come naturally.Before you read this book you need to realize that this is not our world. The gender reversal makes the story a Science Fiction novel, but the set up is more of a Fantasy. This story could never happen in our world, one of the other reviewers pointed this out when they said that men just aren't like that. That reviewer was right, in our world and throughout our history men have always been dominant (exceptions have occurred, but they ARE EXCEPTIONS, not the rule). As a result, men from our world would never be able to exist in this story, but like I said, this isn't our world. I'm not sure of the authors intent, but I don't believe any amount of time or circumstances could entirely breed violence out of men (i.e., this is NOT the future).I have read this book four times already, each time in no more than three days, usually one. Personally, I have found it difficult to put down once I was started and would certainly recommend it. However, if you don't like romance and it makes you uncomfortable to have all of the male characters in a story as submissive characters you'd be better off avoiding this book.To sum it all up:This book is part Fantasy, part Science Fiction, and all Romance. The hardest part for most people to accept is probably the Fantasy aspect as fantasy is, by its very nature, unlike our world. What we would call improbable or even impossible is possible in fantasy, accept it or this story is unlikely to become a favorite of yours like it is for me."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I read mostly alternate universe stories, and a fantasy book every now and then. I found this one to be quite thought provoking. It really felt strange reading about dominant characters, and finding out every single one was a woman. Every single time, a soldier, a guard, or a messenger was mentioned, my brain kept substituting a male image, only to be told WRONG! It made me wonder, if the reason women don't read sci-fi/fantasy, is because they feel marginalized the way I felt reading this novel.Another positive aspect of the story, is that it is not padded - the pace is very brisk, and there is always something going on. One can easily finish the entire piece in a day.I wouldn't mind reading sequels, if there are any coming."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This book works on so many levels, it's hard to know where to start. On one hand, it's almost formula romance, with the slight twist that it's the boy who gets to be unusually plucky and courageous while his wives-to-be work to rescue him from danger. Oh, right, there's another little twist- Jerin is being wooed by no fewer than five princesses.The story is fast-paced(as all of Wen Spencer's are) and gripping. I too long for a sequel, or better still, a prequel done on the story of Jerin's kidnapped grandfather, Prince Alannon."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I think that with this book Wen Spencer does her usual good job of putting together sympathetic characters with a story that keeps you turning the pages to find out what happens next. Nevertheless, I found myself less impressed with this novel than others she's written, and I think it's because her world building is a bit weak. Basically, she just takes the gender conventions of our society--or more accurately, 19th century American society--and stands them on their heads. So, in our world, women have traditionally done the homemaking; in Spencer's story, it's the men. Women have been traditionally regarded as the weaker, less intelligent race, but in the novel, it's the men. In this novel, the dominant women have short hair, while the submissive men have long hair. Etc., etc.However, if you think about the situation that Spencer has set up, I'm not sure these conventions would actually hold up in the society she has created, where men are scarce and therefore valuable. Just as an example--would you really delegate the majority of the very hard work of homemaking for a family with wives and children that number well into the double digits to a single individual? Wouldn't that individual be more pampered precisely because he is valuable, with the drudgery of family care delegated primarily to the less valuable females in the family?If you are going to write a story that directly contradicts the basic sociological set up that we're all familiar with from our history, you have to make an effort to make sure that the society you create has its own internal logic. And for me, Spencer's story lacked a bit of that internal cohesiveness. I wish she had done more real world building, and less just writing in opposition to our gender stereotypes and conventions. So, she loses a star for me."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This is my favorite Wen Spencer, an incredibly talented writer whose works include the Ukiah Oregon science fiction and Elfhome fantasy series. This book is a stand alone.Jerin is a man (16 year old boy, really) in a world where men are rare. The title refers to the price that families get for selling their sons and brothers as husbands. This is a story we've read before, usually with women as the commodity. But rarely has an author done as well with the details as Spencer did here. Since men are rare, they are a family's most valuable property. Since they must be protected, they are the softer sex. They wear the jewelry and cosmetics and long hair; they are submissive, modest and virtuous; they take care of the home and children; they can't indulge in dangerous pasttimes that might risk their health and worth; they don't have to be educated; they live in fear of kidnapping and rape, etc. If you and a friend read this book together, you could spend a lot of time discussing the philosophical ramifications of the premise.That aside, you can just revel in a GREAT BOOK. The writing is well done, tightly plotted, a lot of action, and really likeable characters. You will love Jerin and the Whistler family.Read this book."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I'm going to write a three-part review.PART 1. OVERVIEW (Skip this if you have read several other reviews.)The book is a romance with gender role reversal. In a society where one male is born for every 10 to 20 females, males are property and act like women. They raise the children, cook, and are protected and cherished. They are usually kept ignorant. The women do all of the what used to be considered men's work. The hero is everything a traditional heroine should be. He is brave, loyal, clever, and pretty. (Yes, I mean pretty, not handsome, because that is the tone of the book.) If the book is read simply as a romance/adventure novel it follows predictable lines and is still a good read.PART 2: WHAT MAKES IT FUNEvery detail that occurs in a traditional romance takes on an additional meaning. Getting proper clothes for the ball becomes an exercise in irony, rather than the trite scene found in so many romance novels. When the women pack more serious weapons, the hero carries a derringer. Whenever I read something that would be routine for a heroine but inappropriate for a hero I got a slight jolt. This made the book more enjoyable.PART 3: WHY IT CAN'T HAPPEN (Skip this if biology and math bore you or if you do not believe in evolution.)Although it is not completely clear why the sex ratio exists in the novel, the author does make it clear that some families have a higher percentage of boys than girls. If the gender relation is hereditary it would disappear. I'm now going to do the math, so if you don't like math, stop reading. Let us assume that there are ten women who have 11 children with one father. This would replenish the population. (Nine women have one child and the tenth, at random, has two children.) The women collectively contribute half the genes of the next generation. Because there are ten women, each woman actually contributes an average of 5% of the genes for the next generation. However the man contributes 50% of the genes for the next generation. This means a male child will pass on more genetic material than a female child. Anyone who had a hereditary tendency to have male children will contribute more genetic material to future generations. These children will have more male children creating a larger percentage of the population that does not have so many female children. Eventually the population will become roughly half female.A Brother's Price is still an enjoyable book even if it can't happen."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"With Jerin nearing the age where he can be sold off as a husband, he begins to wonder what is going to happen to him. When his oldest sisters go off to visit the neighbors, he and his younger sister rescue a princess. When the princess sister, Ren shows up, Jerin falls in love with her. From there, he and his family are off to the capital, where Jerin is swept up into the country's politics. With assians searching for his soon-to-be wives, Jerin tries to keep both his old family and his new one safe.A Brother's Price has memorable characters, and a fairly good plot. However, the plot does have a few too many problems with it, and be sure to note, this is a romance novel.Despite this, this book is amazing. It shows that men can do exactly what women can do and vise versa. With men who are hidden away and told to take care of the family, many people view this as a novel before it's time.Speaking of the time period. The book seems to have a Post Civil War ear feel to it, but there are times when being an older time period would have worked better.Over all A Brother's Price is engaging, and has creative characters and a fairly good plot. Not recommend for anyone who doesn't like romance, or anyone who is younger than twelve. It is a more mature book."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This is yet another good book by Wen Spencer. Although I would have loved to have seen another book set in the world of Tinker, this book presents an interesting world as well and the first of her books that I have read that has nothing to do with Pennsylvania. The story is interesting because it is set in a place where women far out number men, and where women manage all aspects of society and men are sheltered, pampered, and the primary care giver for of the children. There are aspects of war, intrigue, fantasy, and romance wrapped up in the 310 pages of this novel."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"It was a quick read, well-written with a twist that had me intrigued from the blurb. Looking forward to seeing what else the author puts out."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"This book purports to be science fiction, but it's really a romance novel. I also couldn't help reading it with a jaundiced feminist eye.For some reason, this society is a matriarchy. For some reason, male children are rare, so groups of sisters share one husband. When they have a brother, they can sell him or trade him to another family so they can get themselves a husband. They keep men in hiding, protected, and they veil themselves in public on the extremely rare occasions they venture forth. There's probably some sort of parallel to be drawn with older Islamic customs, only backwards. And it's not really feminist, because they still treat men like gods, though the men do all the \\"women's work,\\" like cooking and raising babies.Anyway. The setting is very Wild West: the women all carry rifles and pistols, and there are husband raids. I never figured out how it was science fiction, though. Except possibly that it's speculative in the \\"what if men were rare and women were in charge?\\" part, and even then it falls short, because it left more questions unanswered than answered. (Why are men rare? Where is this set? Are they refugees from Earth?)There's some political intrigue here and there. One early matter is dropped entirely to the wayside and never resolved. The political intrigue isn't even all that good. And the missing sister's identity is obvious to everyone except the main character.The romance aspect isn't even all that good. It's repeatedly whacked over your head, in a \\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing\\" fashion. Then again, the glowing commentary from Catherine \\"jewel-tone trees and lavender sky\\" Asaro on the cover should have been a glowing red warning sign. (Had I looked at a larger image of the cover before buying, I would likely not own it. Though the description *sounded* interesting.)As an SF novel: D-As a political intrigue story: C-As a romance: C+Lois McMaster Bujold does political intrigue SF with a hint of romance better. (The Memory - Komarr - Civil Campaign arc, for example.)"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I had read the preview on Ms. Spencer's website and was eagerly anticipating this book. She has done such a great job in her other series and stories of creating characters you really enjoy getting to know, and want to read more of. In this story, however, the premise is interesting (in concept) but I went away feeling like I could have changed gendres/names/location and been reading a pretty generic and not very gripping period romance. Not terrible, but nothing great, or even very good."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"When I first picked up this book I had been wanting it for a while. The reviews had been good and the back cover made it sound interesting. However, I was sorely disappointed.The cover of the book made it appear that men played some type of role in society other than that of homemaker as it featured Jerin rescueing the princess. I started the book expecting the males to still be largely masculine, and I was shocked. Jerin was basically a woman in a man's body. He wasn't even a modern woman, more of a medieval one. He was completely helpless, seducable, and while he longed for things to change or happen, he seemed to nearly never actually do anything himself. He relied of women the entire time, and was much to feminine for me to take any liking to him.My dislike of the main character basically ruined the rest of the book for me, but I still managed to have enough disgust left over to find the repeated incest going on in Spencer's world offensive. A young man is impregnating his mother and aunts, and another his sister/cousin. Everyone was horrified, bu the fact that there were two intances seemed to imply that incestuous behavior, while frowned upon, was not exactly uncommon.Too much time is devoted to what becomes secondary events in the book, like Jaren stressing constantly over his virtue. Also, the plot in completely generic, the only original point being the male/female role reversal. As soon as the princesses entered the picture I knew immedietly that Jaren was going to end up married to them and that all would be well in the end. There was no tradgedy to give the book more realism. Everything worked out just fine in the end, and it was completely unbelievable.All in all, the only thing that prevented my from giving the book one star was the writing, which I recall as being good, the the total horribleness of everything else about the book has washed the details from my mind.If you are thinking about buying this book, dont. It is not worth your money to even pick it up from the library and risk late fee."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"Ms Spencer proved to the world she could write with the Ukiah Oregon novels. They were well written, fast-paced adventure with some original twists.What do we have here is instead the n-th role reversal romance written by a woman.There must be upward of fifty novels based on the same kind of role reversal idea which ceased to be a novelty at least fifteen years ago. Ms Spencer must have thought it would have been interesting only because she wrote it, but this was wishful thinking...Take a world where men are studs traded for, throw in a dash of soggy romance, add some cardboard dialogues and you obtain this book.Had Ms Spencer written this when she was 14, one would have thought that she might have, eventually, developed some writing skills. But now? After the Ukiah Oregon stories? Definitely not recommended, both to readers of the Pack adventures and to thos who have never read her books.The former would be very disappointed, the latter would wonder why such a fuss for what is essentially a little juvenile romance for, at best, young adults..."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I loved Tinker and the Ukiah series which is why it pains me that I disliked this.I have a hard time reading role reversal stories such as this because no one does them well. There have been societies that were matriarchal and practiced polygamy. Please study them before building your own world with these characteristics. The physiological and psychological differences between men and women do exist, even if they tend to be exaggerated in our media, and they helped created and shape the societies that exist today. This is just something I can not suspend my disbelief with."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"\\"A Brother's Price\\" is a commentary on gender roles - the 4 and 5 star reviews will add adjectives like insightful, wonderful and awesome. The setting is a medieval kingdom ruled by monarchy, and the technology level that of the Old West. \\"A Brother's Price\\" is predicated upon the potentially interesting premise that women outnumber men by approximately 25 to one.\\"A Brother's Price\\" opens with a young man, Jerid, who has 28 sisters, three younger brothers, and around a dozen mothers. His mothers and older sisters are off on vacation, most of his middle aged sisters are off visiting neighbors, and his father and grandmothers are all dead. Jerid is preparing dinner for everyone, while simultaneously looking after a dozen or so little ones -- taking care of young children is men's work. The farm is attacked, so Jerid and his younger brothers hide -- they are too valuable to risk in a fight. His younger sisters pick up guns to defend the farm. After the immediate threat is over, Jerid \\"bravely\\" helps his armed sisters carry a wounded stranger into the house. Jerid frets this entire time about the group of 30 rather repulsive women living next door. His sisters will likely sell Jerid to these women to be their husband. The wounded stranger turns out to be a princess. One of her sister princesses comes to find her, accompanied by a dozen or so guards (female, of course). Jerid hides in the kitchen and makes dinner for everyone, then goes to bed. Later that night, Jerid goes to the kitchen for a snack, meets one of the princesses, and turns all giggly. The plot continues along these lines -- mellodramatic & stereotypical.As entertainment, I found \\"A Brother's Price\\" rather dull. The author simply has the men all act like vapid ladies; has the women act like male chauvinists; substitutes each woman with a group of women; and has the society systematically subjugate men in every way imaginable. This might make for an insightful social commentary, but it makes for quite the dull fantasy novel. I expected the author to develop an imaginative world quite different from our own, but alas no. I also found the society rather insulting to women.To be fair, Spencer crafts pretty good dialog, and the writing style is easy to read. The characters don't have much depth but are internally consistent. The society has a few intersting touches, most stemming from sisters staying together their whole lives. If you don't mind the author's message, \\"A Brother's Price\\" might provide light entertainment, similar to what you would expect out of a cheap romance novel."},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"I have really enjoyed Wen's previous books, wonderfully written and with engaging characters and twisty plot lines. This new book, however, strikes me as written more for the young readers, especially teens. My main question remained unanswered - why do women outnumber men by 25-1. Genetic flaws, disease, drugs gone bad. Also, sorry, but it leaves out plain human nature, especially that of most men. They tend to be dominate, not to be dominated, no matter how they might be raised. Also, I don't see the men who might otherwise be wonderful engineers, builders, writers, etc., not allowed to express their inate abilities. If this is the beginning of a new series, there will probably be a revolt by the men somewhere in the future. Most slaves eventually do, one way or the other.It was actually a somewhat insipid book. I finished it, but probably won't read any other in a proposed series. Fun reading for teenagers, though, and perhaps making an impact on young male teens, though I don't think many of them would willingly read this.No, just not a very believable premise"},{"Title":"A Brother's Price","review":"With 2 simple changes - changing the genders back, and setting the book in, say, the Mideast - this book would be a below average historical romance aimed at the younger reader. It's basically set in the old west, so it doesn't qualify as sci-fi. The only \\"fantastic\\" premise is that males are biologically rare, and some of the social implications of that, and even those aren't earth shattering.

I know this kind of thing does happen, but I think there should have been a lot more conflict involved."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I have read only one other Elizabeth Berg, Talk Before Sleep, and fell in love with her writing after this book. For my next Berg selection I chose Until the Real Thing Comes Along and have to admit I was highly dissappointed. I give the book 2 stars only because I was able to finish the entire book in a few days as it did keep something of my attention.From the moment I started reading this book, though, I wanted to smack some reality into the main character, Patty. Patty was in love with her best friend and refused to even try to give love a shot with other men. This frustrated me as I found Patty whining more and more about her missing love life and her want for her best friend Ethan and I wanted to tell her you will never get him to marry you so stop obsessing!I continued reading the book just to find out if Patty ever found her dream man or ever had a baby, but finished the book with a feeling of dissatisfaction. I felt the book ended with an ending that was empty. I feel Berg left us with a simple ending and characters that readers could not totally connect with. I am moving on to Range of Motion and hope this one is better than Until the Real Thing Comes Along."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Have you ever wanted a relationship to work so bad you talked yourself out of all the rational reasons to leave it??? Enter Patty. Wow! I'm baffled to hear some readers say how dissapointed they were with this book due to Patty's weak character. First of all, I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it so much I read it in less than 3 days, and for me, that's rare. Not all made up characters, like real people in this world, have to be heroines who are strong, outgoing, go for the gusto kind of people. Patty is a real woman in my eyes. She knows what she wants and she's willing to ask for it (a baby), yet is vulnerable because she is so much in love with her ex-boyfriend that she's having a seriously hard time moving on to a new relationship. What woman hasn't had a hard time moving on from a previous relationship, wishing and hoping that &quot;he&quot; will just instantly &quot;change&quot; one day.

I decided to try it after being disappointed by &quot;Open House&quot;. This book sure did not make up for &quot;Open House&quot;. I found the same problems with this book. Why does Berg insist on her lead female characters being so stupid? It is very frustrating for me. They appear to be very helpless, no self-esteem and are waiting for the man to save them. What kind of crap is this?! It drives me crazy because parts of the book caused me to say, &quot;That's just how I feel&quot;, and then turn around and have the character say and do the most stupid things.

How did her so-called perfect family produce such a pathetic creature? Nothing rang true in the book--nothing. And Berg's books usually knock my socks off with their emotional truth. I do advise those of you for whom this was the first Berg book to try others before you give up on her."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"After reading Open House which I enjoyed, I immediately got several of Berg's other books. This book is a disappointment. The main character is weak and stuck feeling sorry for herself, and many of the other characters (Elaine and Mark) are not well developed. This book feels like it's from another era where women didn't know how to deal with their problems and get what they really wanted in life. Yes, Patty gets her baby, but what about dealing with all the relationship and career issues in her life?? While Berg generally promotes close female friendships, I had problems with Elaine's lack of loyalty. Aren't some bonds more sacred than getting the man?

She wants to get married and have a home life, but she can't get over her fixation with her gay former fiance. Sorry, I can't believe that any woman with an ounce of self respect would act this way. The secondary characters offered some promise, but they were never developed enough to carry the story. The mother's issues were the most interesting part of the book. If they had been more fully developed they could have added the emotional tension this story lacked. Despite my complaints about this book, I did like Berg's writing style.

Too unrealistic to believe that a gay man would become the love of someone's life and that a person could not move on from this relationship."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"In her recent books like Talk Before Sleep and Range of Motion, Elizabeth Berg has become known as a writer of &quot;buddy&quot; books. By this I mean that some of her books revolve arround women dealing with a medical crisis and the support system of the buddies who surround these women. But as many of Berg's readers also know, she has tackled other subjects such as the coming of age stories in Durable Goods and Joy School and passages in a woman's life in my favorite book of hers, The Pull of the Moon.Now, in Until the Real Thing Comes Along, Ms. Berg once again takes on a subject near and dear to many, the plight of single women who hear their biological clocks ticking away. Patty Murphy is a 30 something woman who not only feels pressure from her family about finding Mr. Right and having a baby, but also finds herself longing to settle down and become a mother. And while she dates some good prospects every now and then, she is waiting to meet a man like her friend who unfortunately for Patty is a homosexual. And when Patty and her friend make an unusual decision, the reader can't help but be curious about the outcome.This book is hardly a new subject and one would expect that in the hands of Elizabeth Berg, this books would be both witty and poignant but sadly to me as a readers it wasn't one of Berg's better books and somehow missed the mark. For me, the characters didn't ring true and I found myself listening to whining throughout the book."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Oh, my. What a disappointment. &quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; had memorable lines, and real people I wanted to know. But this Patty character in this new book was silly and rather dumb. Sorry, but Elizabeth Berg needs to find the muse she had for &quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; and lose her new one."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Not Berg's best, and I've read a bunch. A far-better book that captures and explores the straight woman/gay man dynamic much more accurately is Pretzel Logic, a novel by Lisa Rogak: it's the funny but biting story of a woman married to a man who happens to come out during their marriage."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"In many ways, I am Patty Anne. I think that's why I found myself laughing and crying throughout the reading of this book. Being in love with the gay man was interesting, but I think that what the author was conveying is the anguish of desperately wanting something or someone that we can't have. Hey, we've all been there, done that and probably read the book about it. I'd never read any of Elizabeth Berg's work before and just picked this one up on a whim. I'm glad I did. For me, it was worth the effort and I will probably pick up another of her books sometime in the near future."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I've seen several not-so-good reviews of this book so I wanted to write a good one. I'm not finished reading it yet, but I only have about 60 pages left and I've read enough of it to know that I'm thoroughly enjoying it. There are parts of the book that are laugh-out-loud funny and other parts that are so detailed and insightful that I am enjoying this novel on many levels.If you like authors whose writing is what I call \\"quirky\\" (a little on the weird side but I mean that in a good way...interesting and funny details on almost every page), you'll love this book. I know that my local library has at least three other books by this author and I intend to get every last one of them during my next trip to the library.The kind of quirky, comical, insightful writing that I like is best represented by the following book, which I actualy bought instead of borrowing it from the library, and I don't buy books very often:A Girl Named Zippy: Growing Up Small in Mooreland Indiana by Haven Kimmelhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767915054/ref=pd_sxp_f/104-1969313-5510321?v=glance&s;=booksIf you liked \\"Until the Real Thing Comes Along\\" by Elizabeth Berg, you will absolutely love \\"A Girl Named Zippy\\" by Haven Kimmel!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I got this book from the library on the recommendation of a friend. While the premise of the story was somewhat interesting, the story itself was lacking. In fact, it was so unchallenging and uninteresting that I flipped through it, missing pages at a time, and I finished the book in 15 minutes. As the mother of an active 2 year old, who stays at home, reading is the only thing that stimulates my intellect. Therefore, I can't afford to waste time on a lousy book. Needless to say, I was glad this book only comsumed 15 minutes of my time. If you want a good book, read &quot; Sister of My Heart&quot;. It is intelligent, well written, and thought provoking. Look it up and enjoy a truly good story."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I, too, loved Talk Before Sleep, and I'm enjoying The Pull of the Moon on tape at the moment. Even though Until the Real Thing Comes Along was a good, quick read, it left me feeling flat.I thought of many of my single in their 30s women friends when I read about Patty--those people who really want to have a family but can't find the right guy. I enjoyed some of Patty's characterization (the bit about her fantasy houses, relationship with the older couple), but her obsessive love for Ethan was a bit much. Get over him and move on with your life, Patty!I will keep reading Elizabeth Berg, because I know she's a talented writer, but this one was not one of her best."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along is a first-time and last-time Berg read for me! I found this ridiculous litany of whining nothing less than a total insult to women. Berg portrays her leading lady as a pathetic, incompetent, dependent dreamer of the coming of Mr. Right. I don't think there was a paragraph in the piece that didn't contain a needful rumination of Patty's empty self. And, her inaccurate description and depiction of alzheimers disease is a further insult. I couldn't stop wondering if Berg needs some in depth psychoanalysis to help her accept her own fast ticking biological clock."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"This was a great book to read as a break from studying law books. I recommend it and suggest that one read the book and the professional critics before the mindless nonsensical ramblings of those who did like it. Ignore the critics and think for yourself. You will enjoy it. I did."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Berg and her special skill at creating characters who make us exclaim, &quot;Yes, that's just like so and so!&quot; I've enjoyed some of her other books more, but I can understand the elemental pull towards motherhood (after all, I'm the author of a book for mothers, NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL). An interesting story."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"A good story about real feelings done in a sometimes funny way."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Can the main character of this book do anything but whine and feel sorry for herself? Good grief, what an annoying and unsympathetic character!Okay, so she loved a man who turned out to be gay. Tough break -- and maybe I could have sympathized if the revelation about Ethan's sexual orientation hadn't happened a decade before the events in this book! I found it impossible to feel any empathy for a character who has spent so many years mired in self-pity, dwelling on the past and refusing to accept the reality that she would never have Ethan. An irritating and pointless novel by a usually fine author."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"If I want to read Danielle Steel I will buy her books...BERG where are you on this one! What a disappoinment...PLEASE RETURN!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"i have read two other books by elizabeth berg, and i like the stories and the style of writing. it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but i think you have to understand where she is coming from.i will try any other books she might write in the future."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Elizabeth Berg is one of my favorite authors. I love her writing style, characters and plots. I've never been disappointed reading any of her books."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I like Elizabeth Berg's writing style. Her books are always easy to read and I enjoy her observations about things. Whenever I read her books I find myself remembering things that I haven't thought about in years. This, however, is not one of her better books. Instead it's tedious and silly in the extreme.Patty has never been married. The great love of her life is her high school sweetheart, Ethan. They were engaged for a while, but then Ethan realized that he was gay and broke off the relationship. However they have stayed close friends over the years and she has never got over him. Okay. But now she's THIRTY SIX. And she's still burning a candle for him, rejecting any good man who comes her way and generally hoping that one day he'll get over being gay and come back to her.It gets worse. The next paragraph contains plot spoilers, from the first half of the book.Patty rings Ethan one night at 2am and tells him that she'd really like to have a baby. So Ethan immediately jumps out of bed, tears over to her house - as you do - climbs into bed with her and says \\"let's do it!\\". Patty immediately decides she must be pregnant because she feels different, so she runs out that morning with her best friend to buy baby clothes and a baby mobile. The cynical side of me was thinking that she should have strung Ethan along for longer if she really wanted to lure him over to the straight side. But anyway. Yes, she's pregnant. Yes, from that one time. But will Ethan now decide that he's not gay? Well maybe he will... Yes, the book is THAT ridiculous.Published in 1999, this book also feels very dated now. Was it really only 11 years ago that people were installing brand new VCR machines and finding the idea of a CD player in a car outlandish?"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I have read and loved two of Elizabeth Berg's novels - Open House and Say When. Our book club chose The Art of Mending a few years ago and I was so excited to start another one of hers. Big disappointment! I picked up this one just last week thinking I'd give her another chance - and again I was sorry! It was awful! I couldn't get into any of this girl's motivations (or non-motivations as it turns out, there isn't much she really wants to do except fantasize about having the perfect marriage and kids). The dialogue, which is usually Berg's strong point, was stilted and repetitive. Not at all believable in pretty much every way - especially the part about her own family. DO NOT BOTHER!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"The two main characters, a straight woman in her thirties and a gay man in his, steal our hearts in this story. We see how much the pressures to settle down mixed with the desire to have a companion can drive two people to come together no matter the inappropriateness. Lucky for these two, they love each other even if not sexually. So, their awkward and fated attempts to become a cohabitating family end but not badly."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I've recently discovered Elizabeth Berg and have been greatly moved by 3 of her books. I was really looking forward to this one... though I am married with a child, I certainly do remember the occasional angst of my single days! HOWEVER, this book is SUCH a disappointment. The whole plot is just a cop-out and the protagonist is not very sympathetic. I suspect the book might be based in fact, which I suppose would somewhat redeem it....."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"This is the second Berg novel that I have read. The first one, \\"What We Keep\\" did not appeal to me at all, and it took me awhile before I picked up another novel by her.I was thrilled by this piece of writing! I think that in many ways, Patty relates to the average woman. I think that many of us ache to be mothers when we are pursuing a career, and many of us also lust after the wrong guys (even the gay ones). I thought that the writing was very light-hearted, and I loved the smart-mouthed Patty. I think that Berg writes her characters as \\"real\\" people, and found myself amazed that some of the things going through Patty's head, actually had gone through mine many many times.I recommend this novel. It was interesting, and I thought that the subject matter contained was interesting as well. I related to her main character, and I cried quite a bit at the end. It's funny to think this, but perhaps I had found someone whom I related to, and it was sad to let her go.It's amazing to think of the compromises that we make in order to make others dreams come true.Anyhow, get this book and read it. If you are disappointed, at least the novel is short enough where you don't feel that you wasted too much time. I don't think you'll be disappointed though. It's a page-turner."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"This story is touching and funny - I laughed out loud at some points and had to cry at others."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Have you ever wanted a relationship to work so bad you talked yourself out of all the rational reasons to leave it??? Enter Patty. Wow! I'm baffled to hear some readers say how dissapointed they were with this book due to Patty's weak character. First of all, I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it so much I read it in less than 3 days, and for me, that's rare. Not all made up characters, like real people in this world, have to be heroines who are strong, outgoing, go for the gusto kind of people. Patty is a real woman in my eyes. She knows what she wants and she's willing to ask for it (a baby), yet is vulnerable because she is so much in love with her ex-boyfriend that she's having a seriously hard time moving on to a new relationship. What woman hasn't had a hard time moving on from a previous relationship, wishing and hoping that &quot;he&quot; will just instantly &quot;change&quot; one day. Okay, maybe the marajuana experience seemed a little out of character for Patty given the fact that she won't even drink coffee while she's pregnant, but other than that, I found it touching and sad, but realistic."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I've now read three of her books, Talk Before Sleep, Range of Motion, and now this . . . Talk before Sleep is still by far the best. I keep reading her because her books are short, entertaining and easy to follow. I hope she'll write something as good as &quot;Talk&quot; soon or I'll have to give up on her.One consistently good thing about her books is the voice she gives to the main character. She is an excellent writer.While this book starts out hilariously funny, it ends on a very hop-hum sort of note, with many different plot lines left ignored (it's not that I need a happy ending, it's that I wonder why she brought up certain topics and then never followed them).For a quick fun read, this'll do, but don't pay for it. Get it at the library (sorry Amazon)."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Don't be put off by the negative reviews.I'm a big Elizabeth Berg fan and found this book to be just as wonderful as the rest. Her books touch me - I cry with a smile on my face. As usual, can't wait for the next book to come out."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Some of these reviews remind me of those of Tom Wolfe's *A Man in Full*. Just as *Bonfire of the Vanities* was impossible to follow in such a way as to make everyone (including idiots) happy, Elizabeth Berg has become a victim of her own genius. Her novels are so beautiful and so accessible that when she shows the range of her talent and builds on her previous work (instead of simpy imitating it), the result is bound to confound lesser readers. Berg's novels compare favorably with the best written in the last twenty years by or for men or women, and this is one of her best."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Elizabeth Berg is one of my favorite writers but this book seemed like a &quot;B&quot; movie script. Patty, the main character, wants a home, a husband and a baby. When given the opportunity to have all of these, she continually passes up the chance. The reader is never really clear WHY that is- the character's motivation is really weak. And why she is stuck on Ethan, her now gay, once boyfriend other than the fact that he's beautiful- who knows? Why wouldn't she want to move on? Too much dialogue, not enough character development, very sappy (did she have to throw in the Mother with Alzheimers? What was up with that?). Pass on this Berg. Try Pull of the Moon or some of her other books. Seems like she tried write a book quickly and missed the quality she captured in her other novels."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"This was my second book by Elizabeth Berg. I had read 'Pull Of The Moon' and loved it plus I had heard so much about other books by Berg.Until The Real Thing Comes Along is about a 37 year old woman, Patty, who is afraid that she will never get married and have children. Her character basically is dull. She works at a job in which she has no skill and is making no money. She is in love with someone who can't love her because he has come out of the closet. Patty doesn't deal in reality, she deals in dreams and wishes. While reading this book I couldn't believe this was a story that Berg made up. You have heard the saying, &quot;Truth is stranger than fiction?&quot; I wonder if this is a real life story written in the form of fiction? Because although the writing is great and is what keeps you reading, the story and characters are a little hard to believe. I gave it a 3 because of Berg's writing ability."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Somehow, even as an avid reader, I had never heard of Elizabeth Berg before I read this book. I settled down on my couch to read a few chapters with no particular expectation except to be pleasurably diverted on a warm summer evening. Several hours later I found that I had finished the entire book without effort or interruption. Whenever I discover a writer who has that kind of effect on me, I go into binge mode and read everything else I can find by her. Within the past 2 weeks I've also read The Pull of the Moon, Range of Motion, and Talk Before Sleep, all of them superb. Berg truly understands women and is a graceful, insightful writer, one of my new favorites. So get this book, make yourself comfortable, and immerse yourself into Elizabeth Berg's world. Once you start reading, you won't want to stop."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I read a brief summary of this book a few months ago and put it on my Christmas list: I opened it this morning and just finished it. It was a quick, easy read that I couldn't put down. Unlike the reader from Boston (&quot;Berg bashes women&quot;), I thought the main character(Patty) very accurately depicted both pregnancy and Alzheimers. I felt every bit as emotional and &quot;whiney&quot; during my pregnancy, and the accounts of her Alzheimers-stricken mother rekindled painful images of my own grandfather's battle with this debilitating disease. It was the first Berg novel I've read- and it won't be the last! I recommend it."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Patty really wants to settle down, get married, have a baby, and get that house with a white picket fence. She is in love with her best friend and former fiance, unfortunately, several years ago, Ethan broke their engagement because he's gay. Ethan even sets up Patty on a couple of blind dates, one of which is probably a good match for her, but since Ethan is in her heart, she has no room for anyone else, and he manages to marry her best friend.Patty, not wanting to accept life without Ethan, proposes that they instead have a baby since neither is in a serious relationship and both want to be parents. Ethan surprisingly goes along with it in a moment of despair, and Patty is bummed to discover that a single encounter results in a pregnancy (she wanted more practice).I really was disappointed with the storyline. I found Patty's character to be really sad and lonely and so willing to settle by wallowing in self pity. The ending only proves how sad and lonely Patty is destined to remain, particularly with her best friend so happily married and pregnant herself."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I gave this book two stars because I felt generous. When I got close to the last page, I thought \\"Will it never end?\\" I was very tempted to just chuck it, but still hoping it might get better, I pressed on. No luck-- it didn't get any better. This book is about Patty Ann Murphy, a woman who feels like a \\"runner-up in life\\"-- always coming in second. Well, no wonder. She sets herself up for failure--- she loves the wrong man, but instead of admitting it and moving on, she seems to relish the unhappiness she feels because Ethan is unavailable. This woman is a glutton for punishment. She hashes and re-hashes her feelings toward him-- I got the impression she was enjoying her misery. Then there is the baby thing--- we all love babies- or most of us do. But her fixation is almost to the point of unhealthy obsession-- and so we have pages and pages of baby discriptions. The writing is overly dramatic-- everything is phrased as if it is great drama, instead of a story where not much happens to a woman who sells real estate except she gets pregnant, then acts as if no one had ever done it before. Not a good read."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I have read only one other Elizabeth Berg, Talk Before Sleep, and fell in love with her writing after this book. For my next Berg selection I chose Until the Real Thing Comes Along and have to admit I was highly dissappointed. I give the book 3 stars only because I was able to finish the entire book in a few days as it did keep something of my attention.From the moment I started reading this book, though, I wanted to smack some reality into the main character, Patty. Patty was in love with her best friend and refused to even try to give love a shot with other men. This frustrated me as I found Patty whining more and more about her missing love life and her want for her best friend Ethan and I wanted to tell her you will never get him to marry you so stop obsessing!I continued reading the book just to find out if Patty ever found her dream man or ever had a baby, but finished the book with a feeling of dissatisfaction. I felt the book ended with an ending that was empty. I feel Berg left us with a simple ending and characters that readers could not totally connect with. I am moving on to Range of Motion and hope this one is better than Until the Real Thing Comes Along."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I started with Open House which is much deeper and more profound, but I still enjoyed this shorter book. What I like most about Berg's writing is her ability to capture personal thoughts and feelings of real people with all their vulnerabilities and problems. I agree with those who thought the mother plot was a bit much, but the central plot was very well done with the usual cast of oddball characters. I wanted to find out more about Mark, but the Ethan character was well-drawn. Now that I've read one of her best and her supposed worst (which is still quite good), I'm motivated to read her others. The writing and characters make Berg a terrific writer and her books great reads. If you don't want to read this one, at least try one of her others to see what you've been missing."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"It's painful to read the book simply because, like Patty, I also feel so much of the longing and desire to have a baby. Sometimes I do feel I want a baby more than a husband. And it strikes true when the heart rules against the sensible mind - wanting so much for the perfect one (a perfect someone for me, not the perfect man). You want to kick her and knock her head, and yes I want to kick myself too. But OK, don't judge me for that.Berg seems to know how it all feels and and she describes the emotions well. Her language is awesome and so very true.However, I have to say the storyline could be better. Certain things seem to be too convenient making it much less interesting.I'm thinking of reading her other books."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"This was certainly different than any other book I have ever read, and I found it interesting. I enjoye reading it and felt that the characters were people I had known all of my life. It was a good read. If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"A friend lent me this book, and I'm sorry to say I can't believe anyone actually likes it. It reads like nothiing more than a fleshed-out &quot;Cathy&quot; cartoon, with some sad parts thrown in for variety. The characters are all stereotypes, barely fleshed out, who come and go with all the insight of a really bad Fox sitcom. The premise is interesting-- life's runner up-- but the story has no texture, no detail, and starts to read like a parody of a &quot;single 30something woman's book.&quot; Yuck."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I can't stress enough how much I despise this book. The problem for me was the dialogue. As I was reading there was never a time when I didn't scratch my head and said, \\"Who talks like this?\\" Because of that it was impossible for me to like any of the characters. Not even the plot was that great. From one book reader to another, I strongly suggest you avoid this book at all costs."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I very much enjoyed this book.

I am an avid reader and one-time fiction writer, and I could not believe the predicability of this plot. The story and character development were much like those of a soap opera (I don't watch soap operas), and thus were hard to take seriously. The main character resembled a bad &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; rip off. It astonishes me that this writer has won awards!I don't consider myself a feminist, however, I found the main character's complete obsession with finding a man and having a baby insulting to me as a woman, and insulting to men as well. Furthermore, her &quot;love&quot; for gay-Ethan had promise at first, but come on -- I do remember learning in my first writing class that a writer much &quot;show and not tell&quot; and I could not help but think of that as I read this book.As if you could not tell, I do not recommend this book if you normally enjoy good writing."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I love most of Berg's books, but this one had no depth and was a waste of time.
