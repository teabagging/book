The author seemed to make a point that Dr. Frieda was not the saint she apeared to be in the famous book from Greenburg. In every sentence, it was reaking with some pessimistic streak, even in the depictions of the many photos I found fascinated by. I love Greenburg's book dearly, and to just know such a person as Dr. Fried existed was enough to give light to this world. I think the author of this book should have mentioned more of the fact that Friada did accomplish an enourmous amount... It was awful how the author refrained Frieda's untimely death over and over and over again, as if her life had a sad fate, despite all that she strived for. Even her work with the real Johanna Greenburg is underminded, immediately followed by a whole chapter about a patient she was unsuccessful to reach out.Not recommended, although it is the only existing book I know about her, and I rushed to the library to get it as soon as I knew it was out. Too bad."},{"Title":"TRANSMUTATION, A Novel about Eternal Love","review":"I want to focus my impressions on the excellent and suspenseful book, Transmutation by Lydia Bisanti.Transmutation is edgy and clearly written. The primary voice of the story is Rene Eagle and it has urgency and drive.It is, in part, the story of a powerful and successful international businessman with an obsession with power..He rapes, pillages and plunders because he CAN - with no thought to the consequences. Rene's relationshsip to women especially his wife, are disturbing. He is at once seductive and destructive, He acts as if there will be no outcome to his actions. That is until he is contacted by the mysterious Lucia Albedo and her dreamletter.I loved the international travel, and meetings with power brokers- exotic and beautiful locations.The women in Transmutations felt like different aspects of The Goddess that Rene needed to contact for hisevolution..His first encounter with Lucia, his twin flame, is awesome. Her mystery is what draws Rene deeper and deeper into a union with Universal awareness and himelf.Renes' initial response to Lucia's letter was that she was \\"crazy\\". This is so typical of many people's response to mediumship and psychic phenomena.Ms. Bisanti is skilled at creating and sustaining fascinating and believable characters. I also loved Angela Swann, the harbinger for Lucia.Rene's first out of body experience with Lucia is amazing. You can really feel and imagine what it was like forhim and how deeply he was affected by it.My favorite parts of the story are where Rene's healing and psychic gifts are awakened, and he is reconnectedto Source. His spiritual travels with The Master were also vivid and compelling.The mood and emotion of this book are involving and deep. There is a good balance between the world asmost people experience it and the mystery of the Universe that is within us and around us.I highly recommend Transmutations to those who enjoy a thriller and to those who are also exploringmetaphysical ideas."},{"Title":"TRANSMUTATION, A Novel about Eternal Love","review":"Transmutation is about transformation of the individual man to a Universal Man. The hero of the novel, Rene Eagle goes through a series of personal catastrophes (as seen through normal eyes) which push him over the precipice and help his ego to refine/ dissolve/ sublime.Transmutation is used in alchemy and in nuclear science. It means changing one element (a base metal like lead or iron) into another noble element (like gold). The Philosopher's Stone is a 'mythical' object which is supposed to help the alchemist to transmute a base metal like iron and lead to gold.Philosophically, it is the transmutation of an egoistic soul (which because of its limited vision is naturally selfish) into an Universal Soul (a soul which becomes the whole universe and thus has no scope for being selfish). The purpose of each soul is to transmute itself into the Universal Soul. To achieve that, the ego has to achieve a sacred union with that missing complement soul, to which it is compellingly drawn. Till then, shadows of such soul (egos that have some semblance to that real mate) will attract the individual, resulting in infatuations, addictions etc. The objectives of various prayers, meditations and other rituals is to prepare the individual ego for this sacred union, which is the real fulfilling union. Eternal Love is the natural result of such an union. Till then, the ego goes through several planes of existence.The author succeeds in bringing out these concepts well, which are not really new to eastern minds. The story is well told and grips the reader through out. Rene becomes Siva, the three-eyed God (the third eye representing true knowledge and wisdom), though the author doesn't use that specific name.The book could have been edited better, but fortunately the communication comes through. I strongly recommend this slim volume if you have any leanings towards spiritual matters. Even without the spirit, the novel is a good read."},{"Title":"What Can You Do with a Major in Biology: Real people. Real jobs.

However, geared more towards upper elementary of middle students. Not enough material for lower elementary,Great price! good product to have in school library,"},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"Very well written and updated, I especially like the way the authors have implemented MATLAB scripts in many of the more advanced matrix methods. BUT, do not use JUST this book, theory is unclear in many cases, and the proof to many of the equations (Vibrations is very math intensive) is brief, too brief in some cases. This book could easily be 200 pages longer. The main advantages of this book are that it covers many topics in advanced vibrations and over 500 end of chapter problems, many of them of higher difficulty. In short, if you already have some skills in Vibrations, this is a great book, but if you're using this text as an Intro to Vibrations, use as backup a friendlier book, such as Steidel's to get revved up. I used 3 sources for my course! By the way, I recommend Schaum's Outline for Mechanical Vibrations, many good examples there."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"The reading is alright. The chapters are short but the examples are confusing, most of the steps are cut out leaving the reader to figure out what was done. I wouldn't recommend this book if someone is really trying to learn vibrations."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"Dear fellow readers:I borrowed this book from a friend, who used it in a university course. It was said that the examples used in this book were not sufficient enough to get the grasp of the concepts. I am sorry to say that this is not the only problem with this book. Although this is very complete book from concept to application point of view, the problem lies with the road the authors have taken to explain those theories. The topics are simply skimmed over and not much elaboration given to both development of the equations and application of those equations. As mentioned above the examples did not clarify my confusion any further. This left me confused and not as clear a picture as I hoped to gather. Perhaps this book is best suited as a reference for a person who is well versed in this topic and not a novice."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"This review is for the paperback fifth edition of this book.Alright, I have read so many negative reviews of this book here. So even though this book was recommended elsewhere I was slightly apprehensive in buying it. I have read only the first 2 chapters, but I am so overwhelmed that I thought I will write a review.My rating: excellent. This book will make you think and understand the subject. But it expects a certain level of mathematical and engineering maturity (not higher than undergraduate). The problem sets are excellent. When you sit and finish through the problems you really understand the topic. Lot of times I read the text twice and made sure that I understood the topic before starting the problems. But then I had to come back and refer again and surely I will figure out some missing information. It takes time but is very rewarding. Most of all this text doesn't assume that the readers are dumb - it expects that the readers can think.What do I mean that the book expects a certain mathematical and engineering maturity? I will give a couple of examples. In the introductory chapter it has a small section on decomposition of periodic motion into Fourier series. There it expects for you to know how to integrate Integral(cos mx cos nx dx) or that Cos A cos B = 1/2[Cos(A+B) - cos(A-B)]. In second chapter to find the effective mass of a simply supported beam with a point load in the middle, it expects you to knowthat the deflection of the beam can be written as y=y_max(3(x/l)-4(x/l)^3). I mean it will straight away write y=ymax... etc. No other intermediate steps. It will also just integrate this y_max(3(x/l)-4(x/l)^3) with respect to x and write the result as 0.4857 y_max or whatever value it is. It will expect that you know how to solve differential equation into characteristic equation and particular solution. It gives a proof for solving md^x/dt^2 + cdx/dt + kx = 0 but it is better for you to have some background in differential equation (again not more that undergraduate level) to fully understand it.What do I mean that the book will make you think? For example when discussing energy methods on simple harmonic motion, it will say that due to conservation of energy T1+U1 = T2+U2 where 1 and 2 denotes two different positions of the vibrating body. By choosing 1 to be the static equilibrium position and choosing U1=0 as the reference potential energy, and 2 be the position corresponding to max disp, we have T1+0 = 0+U2. Now it says that if the system is undergoing harmonic motion then, T1 and U2 are max values and the preceding equation give rise to T_max = U_max. And that this equation will lead directly to natural frequency. It is up to you to figure out that for simple harmonic motion, x is given by x = Asin(wt+phi), v = Aw cos(wt+phi), a = -Aw^2 sin(wt+phi). So when v = 0 it implies that cos (wt+phi) = 0 and that implies that sin(wt+phi) is +- 1 so x is max (also conversely). So T_max = 1/2*m*A*w^2 , since cos (wt+phi)=+-1. Also U_max = 1/2*k*A^2, since sin(wt+phi)= +-1. So T_max = U_max gives w^2 = k/m. (We are actually eliminating sin and cos terms by taking the max values).In short, a very very good book for some one who has an undergraduate background in engineering and who is willing to think and put the effort. If you want a quick read or if you are looking for an easy book then this is probably not for you. But remember that you can only learn if you put the effort. There are a few typos for the answers at the back of the book, but that doesn't diminish the book's worth.There are 3 typos I found in answers to odd problems at the back of the book. I have finished problems of only chapter 1.Corrections for odd number answers at back:-------------------------------------------1.3) d^x/dt^2 _ max = 287.1 what is given is 278.11.11) x(t) = 1/2 + 4/pi^2( cos w1t + 1/3^2 cos 3w1t + 1/5^2 cos 5w1t + ...)(what is given is sin w1t for the first harmonic term)1.16) a_o = 2/3 (what is given is a_o = 1/3).Again I may be wrong in the typos. Kindly double check them before using it."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"This book skips steps in solving problem and has a bunch of typos. It doesn't explain concepts well. The index skips all the letter Ns. It smells bad. I wish our class had a better textbook. I don't feel like I've learned anything from this one."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"When I took this class I was utterly confused by most of the material and some of the problems made no sense whatsoever, neither the set up nor the solution. When I TA'ed the class, luckily the professor worked mainly out of a course erader made of his own notes. The bad part was he picked problems out of this book for homework. Many of the solutions are quite simple, WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM CORRECTLY, a task this book left completely up to me to explain to the students. Also, a few solutions were just plain wrong or required huge simplifications and assumptions that were not intuitive.If you have to buy this book, buy the cheapest copy out there or just photocopy the few pages you'll need.Also, where the h*ll do they get the nerve to charge so much for such a short useless book. It's a fifth edition that doesn't show much care or thought put into it.This book is typical of what's wrong in the textbook publishing industry, we students are overcharged for garbage and required to buy the newest edition of content that hasn't changed in a hundred years. It's almost as if we're paying professors for plagiarizing classical theory!I strongly recommend going elsewhere to LEARN the concepts of mechanical vibrations."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"This is easily the poorest excuse for a textbook that I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The entire book reads as though a couple of first year grad students scrapped it together in the span of a week or two. The author picks the absolute simplest, most specific problems to use as examples, and skips most of the steps needed in the derivation. The homework problems are vague, don't give proper parameters, use different terms than those given in the reading, and sometimes the answer deck doesn't even have the right answer. If you are like me, and prefer to learn out of the book than pay close attention in lecture, then do not even bother with this book, find another one and photocopy the problems from a friend. Professors: do not torture your students with this book, its not worth the paper its printed on, much less the asking price."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"The topics covered are many but the depth is zero and the examples are about 90% too short. It doesn't really help to get a picture and a solution without intermediate steps or even halfhearted explanation. This book is completely inaccessible to a student and will sit useless on the shelf as $130 bucks wasted. Disgusting."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"This text is a good introductory to vibrations with lots of topics covered. However as a text book for a class that functions primarily from material from the text it is hardly suitable. Though much is covered in a short space , and therefore the price is low, every section seems to lack cohesiveness. As far as theory goes steps in derivations are left out a lot of times and in a subject as math intensive as vibrations that can lead to a lot of confusion. The examples are few and far between and most of the examples that are presented are either rudimentary and therefore useless or so complicated they leave out tons of steps. If your class chooses this book as the required text i recommend you find another on the side with an all around more complete treatment of the subject."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"This book is very difficult to read and although you need to know a lot of physics to get to this point, the book does nothing to help expand your knowledge. It is difficult with very few examples that don't pertain to the problem sets at the end of the chapter. Some of the sections are a mere two to three pages long, which is definitely not enough information. What they explain are basic spring and mass problems, but when it comes down to it, these examples are just too basic to apply to homework or test problems. I would not recommend this book but if it is one that you are stuck with for a class, rely heavily on your professor or teaching instructor instead of the text."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"I like this text mainly because it is concise. I can understand why most students don't like it because it is concise. It might not be a good text to just read and learn all by yourself. It is best used as a textbook in a classroom setting where you have a professor who teaches it, assuming the professor is a good one who can fill in the missing details.Many vibrations texts are too lengthy and there are too much math derivations that the main topics or concepts are not easily identified. I did some research online and found that the first author of this book had already retired and the second author moved to another academic institution (she actually became an administrator at Harvard the last time I checked). In a sense, this book is already somewhat out of date in terms of its use of computer software. But the quality of the organization of materials and the flow is still there, that is why a lot of instructors still like it. It gives instructors the flexibility to supplement the text with other materials they believe are important to fill in the gaps as they see fit. You have to be an attentive student in class and take plenty of notes to be able to learn well from this book - which might not be a bad thing to begin with - who says the students have excuses not to pay attention to the instructor?Some advice for students: if you have to use this book because it is the required text, it might be a good idea to buy a used copy of Schaum's series on Mechanical Vibration by Graham Kelly (very inexpensive). Or buy another text that has more details (such as Graham Kelly's 2011 book \\"Mechanical Vibrations Theory and Applications\\"). Rao's books are also lengthy in volume and could help you fill in the gaps (if cost is an issue, you can get Rao's earlier editions). I would not agree with a lot of the comments that this book is garbage, mainly because, it is not. There are a lot of nuggets of gold in this book. You have to be diligent and academically prepared to dig them out."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"This text is AWFUL!!!

If at all possible, stay away from this book.This book likes to explain the basic algebraic steps while completely bypassing the important steps required to actually solve the problem.

Not the best textbook in the world, but not too bad either. It gives a variety of topics in each chapter, but I personally wish it would address the topics more thoroughly instead of glazing over them. This is especially true with examples. For example, it would introduce a topic then give an example using polar or cylindrical coordinates, but wouldn't even cover some of the similar problems in other coordinate systems, which can be nice especially early on in the text. While it isn't completely necessary if your class covers enough examples, it helps if your going through a fast pace class which finishes these chapters in about 3 hours of class time at most. The chapters are really dense, so this is definitely not a textbook to just read lightly once. To all those who get this for a class, good luck."},{"Title":"Theory of Vibration with Applications (5th Edition)","review":"I used a previous edition as a student, and I used this edition as an instructor.

If microclimatology interests you, and/or you want to know how and why microclimate affects you and yours, get it. It's real science, not pop science review, and parts may challenge you. But the material starts from an introduction to the behaviour of an idealised, simple surface subject to radiation of various kinds, and builds from there. Complicating factors like an atmosphere, vegetation, topology and human interventions are introduced progressively. At every step, there is fascinating experimental evidence to ponder. The treatment is certainly accessible to this amateur.One gripe: it's long past time to update the illustrations and graphs. Informative as they are, they are seriously showing their age, and some are a little hard to read due to (I take it) photo-reproduction from old journals.Overall, this is a long-term, valuable resource for my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Climate Near the Ground","review":"Based on data rather than opinion.

I used it for a project in my science class, and it had all of the information that I needed."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to James Joyce (Cambridge Companions to Literature)","review":"This second edition (2006) adds essays by Garry Leonard on \\"Dubliners,\\" Joseph Valente on sexuality, Jennifer Wicke on consumer culture, and colonialism & nationalism by Marjorie Howes. The others mostly carry over, with minimal revision if lightly updated bibliographies, from the 1990 book. The earlier essays often are barely revised, however; Seamus Deane manages to have his earlier, then-innovative \\"Joyce the Irishman\\" essay offer no bibliography with any works later than his own 1987 book. Deane fails to revise what could have been a widely read entry for a new generation of readers and critics following the scholarship that he and his colleagues in the 1980s had pioneered. Deane offers no new thoughts on Joyce to the considerable and innovative criticism of the past fifteen years, somewhat disappointingly. The post Field Day surge in critical debate in Irish Studies seems ignored.Christopher Butler gives you a lot on modernist counterparts to Joyce but less of Joyce himself within this daunting context. Joseph Valente manages to make a solid point about how Joyce took on all of sexuality as if it transgressed the norm in the Irish Catholic ethos gone haywire, as if universally any sexual manifestation was tainted by its very existence. Unfortunately, from this enticing observation the essay descends into jargon that vitiates the juice out of this potentially engrossing topic.The heavy hand of the academic interpreter does weigh down many of these essays, new and old; too fusty and theory-bound, they reflect not only the potential of younger Joyceans to suggest fresh readings but the tendency of the recent scholars minted and tenured to fall back into dense, dull, and deadly polemics that drain the vigor out of the texts they analyze. The enlightened non-professoriate for which Joyce also sought to write here lacks its contribution. The Joycean industry churns on, its own productions as the books listed at the back ironically notes-- none of the secondary listings annotated are judged as essential!Therefore, given that they are the results of devoted toilers on the Joyce assembly line, the essays vary in quality. This was in 1990 the first \\"modern\\" Companion to follow only Shakespeare & Chaucer. Now, there are dozens, and no professor let alone educated reader can keep up with even one author or genre among those Cambridge carries. The recommended reading should guide you to the best of the past few years that's been published, nonetheless. But few of these books (however necessary are guides to Ulysses and the Wake) will provide the verve of the original texts. Also, the excitement I recall that linked all of those in the Joseph Conrad Companion is here vitiated by the combination of more mundane lit-crit merged with au courant theory and polysyllabic verbiage that has made the Beckett, Irish Drama, and Irish Poetry Companions more plodding in parts.But, the best essays here deserve singling out. I rounded this up from 3 to 4, more or less, based on four or five entries whose strengths overshadow most of their competing peers. Editor Derek Attridge's encouragement in \\"Reading Joyce\\" reminds us of the multiple possibilities latent and apparent in the texts that have taught us how to understand modernism even if we have had little exposure to Joyce! His few pages should be required reading for anyone encountering the author for the first or fiftieth time. Garry Leonard's \\"Dubliners\\" chapter makes me want to read the professor's other works, for he reminds us of the care with which Joyce crafted his stories, and how much a few sentences from \\"Clay\\" can serve to illustrate the manner in which we can unlock the treasure of these enigmatic, pared-down, and endlessly suggestive tales. Similarly, Jennifer Levine beckons the nervous neophyte into the mysteries of \\"Ulysses\\" in a way that reassures the reader of the vastness of the novel, yet also grounds the ambitious narrative within a humanist, approachable, and sensible grounding in quotidian experience.Jeri Johnson gives a spirited rejoinder to any student skeptical of feminism within the texts; Jennifer Wickes reminds us how even academics forget that they too are a targeted market envisioned by Joyce himself, and how his books encompass all of the world, mass culture managing to snare us all to our evident delight (as you read about my contribution to mass-cult here on Amazon in turn) rather than any retreat into elitist retreat (even for the Wake?) or recondite experimentation.In summary, Attridge, Levine, Wickes, and especially Leonard remind us of the potential excitement that the texts hold for beginning or advanced readers. Joyce cannot exhaust, as Leonard admits in his classroom experience (about the only critic who acknowledges this crucial mode of transmission and continued reception of Joyce that surely enters the uncredited thoughts of every scholar here contributing), our ability to comprehend him. This Companion, for all of its shortcomings, does attest to the depth that great literature can offer us, the re-readings that carry us deeper into the labyrinth made by the inheritor of Dedalus."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to James Joyce (Cambridge Companions to Literature)","review":"A broad, interesting critque, which as a beginner to Joyce's works, I found extremely helpful."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Their product description was spot on.

The tortured sole that was placed in the creation was surprising human and seemed to have more feel for the human condition then any other character in the book. The interactions of everyone in the book is true to how we act even in the modern times.The story is so known but there is nothing like reading it on a dark rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I liked it but it was difficult to read on the train.Maybe I should have read it in a place where I could be able to really absorb the material.It was drawn out."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is another book currently assigned by high schools. It is an intriguing and dramatic story of the Frankenstein monster that Hollywood has yet to match. Shelley's portrayal of Victor, the tortures he experiences and the impact his creation has on his life is well described throughout the book. The effects he must face from playing god were valuable lessons then and have modern applications as well. In the middle, the story does slow in pace, but the realizations presented add significant substance to the plot and outcome. Well worth the read..."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I admit that this novel holds a special position in English literature and rightly so, but it was not as good as I had hoped. When the monster finally speaks in the story I swear his \\"voice\\" sounded just like his creator's. How could two characters from vastly different life circumstances sound indistinguishable? One was an adult born in to an educated well to do family and the other was recently and suddenly \\"awakened\\" to live in the woods as a hiddeous outcast. The monster taught himself to read Paradise Lost? Seriously? Actually that was the major flaw in the book. All the characters seemed to be interchangeable even though they should have totally different personalities.Another thing I didn't care for was the use of multiple narrators in the story. I know this was common practice in literature of the time, but not to this extent. The main narrator of the novel is telling a story to his sister about the story Frankenstein told him about his monster's story that he heard about the exploits of the family in the cottage. What is that like 5th person narration? I think this distances reader from what should be a very intense and personal story.I don't want to dismiss the contribution this has made to literature and popculture I just think that the story of how Mary Shelley wrote the story is much more interesting than the actual story Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Thanks to a string of Hollywood's idiotic executives focused on cheap thrills, decades of bonehead movies have used Frankenstein in their title, but have kept nothing of the original story. As a result, readers that grab this title seeking a horror story (gory or not) stand to be disappointed. Mary Shelley's story, which must be read in full appreciation of the style and sensibilities of the 19th century, is actually the sad story of a creature rejected by its creator. Love and love denied, revenge and forgiveness, rejection and acceptance, right and wrong - and how human judgment is tainted by appearances. In a century where image is all and beauty is mistaken for intelligence, Frankenstein's story is all too contemporary."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Written in the early 19th century, Frankenstein is a novel that is fairly easy to read and find entertainment value in even by today's standards. The rich language and Shelley's authorial style create an environment that allows the reader to totally submerse themselves into Victor's world.The story itself is presented as a story within a story within a story (an sometimes even a level or two deeper than that) as a ship captain named Walton writes letters to his sister in England about his voyage across the top of the world and the strange tale of the man (Victor Frankenstein) that he encounters there. It is Victor's story that occupies most of the novel, and though most modern readers are aware of the Hollywood version of the famous Frankenstein monster, those unfamiliar with the actual novel version are in for a great surprise in the way that the creature is depicted in the novel. Hollywood has taken so many liberties with this tale and the depictions of the characters that reading the original is almost like opening one's mind to entirely new material. Shelley presents us with an incredibly thought provoking and fleshed out tale requiring the reader to put some serious thought into the morality of intense scientific research in the area of the creation of life.With this novel, Shelley opened the door to the later development of the Science Fiction genre. In a move that is almost pure genius, Shelley avoids the need for the reader to have to suspend belief in the scientific method used to create another living being from dead tissue by allowing Victor to keep his methods undisclosed for fear that another scientist will follow his direction and make the same mistakes that he did in creating his monster.All in all a very good novel!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I think I bought my copy of Frankenstein when I was a Sophomore in High School. Pretty sad that it took me until now to finally get around to reading it (I won't tell you how many years it's been *grin*).Based on my experiences with the multiple Frankenstein movies as well as appearances in cartoons like Scooby Doo and parody's like Young Frankenstein, I thought I had a pretty good feel for exactly what I could expect from the novel. I was rather surprised with the widespread differences I encountered. Looking back on my experience with Victorian literature in general and the Gothic literature of the era in particular, I should have expected what I found, but I had let myself be tainted by the mass media translation of Frankenstein.Now that I've sufficiently digressed, let me just say that even though the novel was different than I expected, I was far from disappointed by it. I expected a terrifying horror novel filled with invigorating suspense, perilous adventure and chaotic frenzy filled action. What I got was a slower paced exploration of the soul of man, the virtues and vices of science, passion, compassion and revenge.Initially I was very confused as the first many letters (the book had a LOT of 'correspondence' sections) had nothing to do with Frankenstein, his family or his creation. Instead, I found myself growing attached to a lonely adventure seeker sailing to the far ends of the world in search of something to ignite and maintain his passion. When our good Dr. Frankenstein does enter the story, we then get his very detailed narration of his life from childhood to present.The novel is laid out with a narrative structure intended to be highly conversational either through letters or through the orally delivered story of the narrator to the listener (who then transcribes it for us, the reader). However, the language used seemed overly detailed and pretentious for a simple conversation, even from a speaker as highly educated as Victor Frankenstein. It had all the flowery and ornate elements of Victorian prose, which feels natural as far as writing goes, but whenever I was reminded that nearly the entire narrative was to have been spoken, I was taken somewhat aback.The book portrayed very well the details of the exultation and triumph felt by Victor throughout his studies and his discovery of a method to create life. His educational cycle was interesting in terms of his relation with his father and his professors. When the realization of his action finally came about, Victor's agony, fear and despair were equally well realized.I kept waiting for the mob with torches and pitchforks to appear, led by Victor once he recovered from his initial shock. Instead, the arc of the story presented itself to me and I felt compassion for the poor hated creature even before the novel presented him again for our sympathies. I was certain that Frankenstein had falsely judged the fiend and that we would surely get a type of morality text casting a spotlight on society and our lack of compassion for those less fortunate for whatever reason.My next surprise came when Frankenstein came face-to-face with his creation and had a lengthy conversation. I never expected an articulate monster, but what I had was a self-educated creature who had a huge wealth of knowledge at his disposal. At that point, it was very clear that his only disadvantage was his ghastly appearance and we were obviously supposed to feel sympathy towards him. Even when his crimes were laid bare, it was a struggle to completely condemn him.In addition to the commentary on human compassion, I enjoyed the dynamic between creator and creation. Looking at Victor as a god-like person provided an intriguing perspective. As the creator, what should his responsibilities be to his creation? What should his involvement be? I didn't necessarily go down a religious path with my thoughts, but I was curious about the concept of the creator as a provider of compassion, mercy and forgiveness.Instead, Victor looks \\"to the good of humanity\\" and rejects his own creation. The result of which spirals into disaster and makes for a fun-filled ride filled with some degree of the action and suspense that I was expecting from the book (still no villagers with pitchforks, sorry). When the novel finally drew near to its conclusion, I was a little confused as to how it was going to wrap itself up.The ending was actually strangely satisfying. As it unfolded, we once again gain some compassion for the creature and in a sense look upon Victor as a type of monster. As with anything dealing with humanity, it's not that simple. For Victor was acting in the best interests of the greater good as he perceived them and his logic was sound. Thus, as the novel ends, we can't fully condemn either creator or creation. At the same time, we can't wholly condone the actions of either.Which is why I was surprised that the ending satisfied me...because it left things unsettled and confused. But after all, that's the way humanity is...a teetering house of cards, balanced precariously on a precipice, just waiting for something to turn emotions and values to chaos.Overall, I really enjoyed Frankenstein and my only regret is that it took me so long to finally get around to it.4 out of 5 stars****"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein---The word conjures up an image of a gigantic monster out to demolish mankind and everything attributed to it,an ogre created by man bent on dissolving his maker in utter misery. \\"Frankenstein\\" has travelled over the ages to become synonymous with destrution,blood,murder,havoc,fear and everything and anything that's even remotely associated with evil. \\"Frankenstein\\" has become a cliche.And that's exactly where the greatness of the authoress Mary Shelley rests. The plot in the novel is simple enough---a young ardent man steeply soaked in \\"natural philosophy\\" creates a monster with his genius,regrets his doing,asunders it and then suffers the agony of his own architect---but the classic proportions of the tale are vividly accounted in the entwining philosophies,morals,allusions and allegories that it invokes to. It's indeed a wonder that Shelley could've exploited an innovative, simple idea to garb it into a massively broad saga at the tender age of 19,but then again, that's what you call greatness. Take Mozart for inatance. He was composing symphonies and sonatas when he was barely six!Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" begins when a friendless, doughty and resiliently ambitious seafarer Robert Walton saves a strange man from the brink of death amidst a sea of ice whose first words are:\\"Before I come on board your vessel, will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?\\" This is Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein and the whole novel revolves around him and the monster he had created. Walton writes to his sister Margaret in England about the fall of Frankenstein from greatness and as the tale unfolds from the man of science's own shivering lips, we've taken on a ride on a wave that flatters to deceives.Victor Frankenstein is a young Swiss who leaves his hometown Geneva to pursue natural philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt. His knowledge of Cornelius Agrappa, Alberta Magnus and Paracelus pushes him towards a realm beyond the confined boundaries of chemistry and two years of dedication and devotion and Professor M.Walton's \\"words of fate,enounced to destroy\\" him and he reaps a result of magnanimous proportions. He creates \\"the daemon\\", his \\"own vampire, my(his) own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to men\\", a monster whose gigantic stature,ugly features,hoarse voice and crude appearance repugnates its maker and Frankenstein denounces him. And denounces his fortune,career, family,peace of mind and charm of life.For the monster,unbaptized and solitary,comes back again and again to haunt the Swiss. It first kills his youngest brother William,then transfigures into the cause of the doom of the innocent Justine Moritz who's falsely charged with the child's murder;the ogre puts Frankenstein's childhood friend Henry Clerval to death,mortifies his father to his death-bed,destroys the life of his love Elizabeth on their wedding night,allures his creator to death's dwelling and ultimately drags himself to te inevitable end.The plot then is as plain as white paper,as ever so slightly whispered earlier, but that the scope of discussion of characters and events is as extensive as the horizon is illustriously brought to the picture as we explore the landscape of \\"Frankenstein\\". The reader cannot help but sympathise both with the creator and his creation---one repenting his \\"unhllowed arts\\" for being \\"not in deed,but in effect\\" the curse and murderer of one's family,and by extent,mankind;the other willing to harmonise oneself into the fabrication of society when one's physical features are not withstanding. The notion of Frankenstein an ignorant and languid person pets is that of a hideous fiend mustered from animation pictures and cartoons but the essence of it transcends much farther from this simple and debvastating prejudice.The theme of the novel,that of man inviting his own destruction and being chased by his own myriad forces of vices,is disturbing enough and the sophistication even more muddling. Frankenstein is a distorted harmless young man who realises his blunder when it's too late. A man shadowed by a curse he himself has raised and who loses one beloved after another is always going to transpire confusement and indecision and so does he who actually makes the novel happen. He seeks revenge but knows not how,he is compassionate towards his \\"fiend enemy\\" but refuses to show it. The reader embarks on his queerness not to fulfill his promise and manufacture female partner for his creation. Frankenstein reasons with himself that two fiends would be one too many for the world to endure and their posterity could aspire to evilry. But was he right to believe what Brutus did of Caesar in William Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\"? That \\"He would be crown'd:/How that might change his nature, there's the question.....Fashion it thus:that what he is,augmenter,/Would run to these and these extremities? That he should kill his own child and \\"sport thus with life\\"?And indeed was Frankenstein's monster as terrible and catastrophic as he deciphered him to be? In the struggle of this fiend to congregate his being with men and their ways,we find an underlying sense of pathos and self-consciouness expressed bluntly and confusedly. At one moment, the colossal beast stoops down to piti and submission:\\"Was I then a monster,a blot upon the earth,from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?\\" On another occasion,he tranmutes into a figure of abhorrence and disastrous:\\"You are my creator, but I am your master;obey\\". This juggling of self-assertion and self-submission makes the giant a confused,complex individual as well as a victim of circumstances since his motives are misconstrued. The cruel end of his strangely pleasant relationship with the cottagers and the rustic soughting \\"to destroy the saviour of his child\\" provide testimonies. The reader discerns his parallel with Shylock in Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\",whose tale too is a tragedy of circumstancs, the awkwardness and hardships of a Bohemian surviving on the fringes of human attachment.The similarities between the Creator and the Creation are in abundance and are stark. Both are equally anguished---the Creator rueing His germ of an idea to build anything so splendourly ugly and the Creation questioning his independence and the Creator's need to make him. This is the allegory,or if you will,the theme of of Shelley's darkly eerie narrative. The invokation to the first-person narrative,the plethora of similes and metaphors,the lofty diction and the intricacy of language augment to the authoress's aim to portray the dark shades of life on a more gentle and lighter backdrop. In Frankenstein's pursuit of his monster,the authoress alludes to man's constant hunt of vice in his own self,in the fiend's direct conveyance of his mortal,spiritual and moral wounds,Shelley reveals the hopelessness of the socially deprived;in the end, she hungs upon the wall the conclusion that all such chases ollide with. Herman Melville's classic \\"Moby Dick\\" ran on a similar line and it,like \\"Frankenstein\\",is a tour de force. First publisher in 1818 and set against the era of the eighteenth century, Mary Shelley's intuitive idea dressed in wondrous clothes sparkling with divine metaphysics and resonding portayal of life,truth and futility sustains a powerful impact on us even long after w've closed the book and started chasing our own Frankenstein's monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I thought this would be a lurid gothic work of sensationalism, but it is actually a sensitive and touching story of alienation and the ambiguity of creating human life. Victor Frankenstein has the ultimate case of post-partum depression, recoiling instantly from his creation as an abominatin, and then spending the rest of the novel oscillating between hatred of it, and a sense of guilty responsibility for it. The story glosses over the movie-fodder details (for instance, casually noting that Victor has discovered the secret of bestowing life on inanimate material, but never really addressing that issue or narrative) and instead is a wholly psychological novel, and a very fine and sensitive one."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \\"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and Plutarch's \\"Lives.\\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?The Thirteenth Floor"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I read Frankenstein back in 6th grade for a choice book project. It is awsome. This is better than The Oddyssey. You get a really in-depth look at the sufferings of Frankenstein and his creation. I didn't read this exact version. BUY THIS BOOK! It doesn't matter if you are 11 or 80 this is an absolute must read book!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If you've only ever seen the Frankenstein movies, you will be shocked at the story in the actual book that started it all. Rather than the cheesy, plodding monster that is out to destroy everyone, the actual Frankenstein is an intelligent creation of his creator, Victor Frankenstein (the monster himself actually has no name). The monster yearns for acceptance and companionship, but when he is constantly turned away, scorned, and chased, he decides to destory everything his creator holds dear. In this way, Frankenstein chases the monster to the ends of the earth (literally). A gripping, touching (sometimes) and thrilling book so completely different from any of the movie versions that you won't understand how Hollywood got the cheesy plots from this book. A true classic and along with Dracula, one of my all time favorite books (although this one is less a horror story and more a philosophical tale, hence the subtitle \\"The Modern Prometheus\\"). Essential reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Who knew the monster could read, speak different languages, philosophize and had feelings? I count myself in with the legions of dumb Americans who thought they knew the Frankenstein story. Hollywood dumbs us down again, but even Young Frankenstein is a classic.This is a horror story mixed into an extensive travelogue from Geneva to Scottland.In my mind, there is a chicken versus the egg question about who created who weaved in and out of the story. It also made me think that the monster was the Dr.'s punishment for self-absorbtion and the desire to play god (maybe I shouldn't clone myself). Towards the end, I had a hard time deciding which character was more wretched - the monster for being given life or the doctor who was having his life taken away.Mary Shelly did an excellent job conveying the humanism of despair between all of the characters that I think is missing in a lot of horror books. Her prose make it a nice time piece as well as nice overall canvas. One aspect missing, although I suppose it was either because of the lack of medical knowledge or to keep in the avoidance of gore with the rest of the book, was how the parts of the monster were gathered and how they were put together.It is always better to read the book than see the movie, but in this case, since they are so different, you should do yourself a favor and know what the author really wrote."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I have seen so many Frankenstein movies. As a result I expected this book to be like them. It wasn't. The monster wanted what everyone wants: to be loved, to be needed, to be appreciated, to be accepted. Frankenstein created the monster and abandoned him. It was the abandonment that started Frankenstein's creation on the road to monsterhood. The cottagers' rejection of him was the final touch that created the monster. After that he lashed out. He tormented Frankenstein as he himself was tormented. Who really was the monster Frankenstein or his creation? Everytime I here the term Frankenstein's monster I have a very different connotation of it than I did before."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a classic book. Everyone knows the story line-well at least what they've seen in the movies (which is actually pretty different from the book). A man creates a \\"monster\\" who is evil. The most interesting aspect of this book in my opinion is the monster's true personality. In contrast to the common view of the monster as a cold-blooded killer, he is really compassionate and intelligent, but because he is never accepted in society because of his horrid appearence, his loneliness causes him to go on a killing spree to get revenge against his creator for bringing him into such a cruel world. This book is an excellent read, but may be somewhat boring to some (I just read it for my senior english class and most of my class hated it!)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"All my life I have heared and seen movies about Dracula, Frankenstein and Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde. Normally I do not read horror/ science fiction but I was curious about these three and decided to find out how these literary characters attained such long lasting lives. The time spent reading the three books was worth it. It was an entertaining cultural experience.I'll leave it to the experts to try to tell you why they are classics. I don't know, but if you are always short on time, like I am, my order of preference is as listed in the first sentance above."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary was a truely great woman, braving heavy literary snobbery, her own tradgic personal life, social and moral opression to write not only a classic work of literature, but also the first ever science fiction story. A revolutionary of her time and a genius writer with a full and budding imagination."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is said to be one of the best books ever written and it has been proven time and time again. The story will scare you only if you can really get into it and you can understand everything that is going on while you are reading it. If you get lost while reading the book you will be lost through the rest of the book. It is interesting that Victor Frankenstein can come up with an idea to bring something to life by using old body parts. Mary Shelly had to have had some inspiration to come up with an idea like this one. Frankenstein has some realistic parts to it that make it more believable. This novel shows how grotesque people can be treated when they are out in the real world. Although Frankenstein did deserve what he got because he did not treat people good. It becomes quite sad that Victor and Frankenstein both follow each other scared to see what is going to happen next. Victor has to follow Frankenstein around and put his own life on hold. He cannot get married when he wants to and that is something that should not wait for anyone. Victor should not have been blamed for the murder when no one in the town knew anything about the story. There are people who go in and out of towns all of the time who can say that it was not a common bum. Although the out come is very good with all of the stress that the characters have to go through while this story is taken place. With the descriptions that Mary Shelly uses and the imaginations that people have this novel is a perfect way to expand ones mind. The movie follows the book pretty well although you can only watch Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. All of the other movies that show Frankenstein do not even come close to the real thing. When one first watches the movie or reads the book ones opinion on Frankenstein will really change."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is a classic book that everybody is aware about. However, to me the actual story was unclear for example: the creation was named after the Doctor, Frankenstein. From the start Dr. Frankenstein was a scientist and found ways to make inanimate objects become animate. From this Frankenstein was born from old apendages unporportionate to the body. After becoming deathly ill Dr. Frankenstein relized the mistake he had made creating such a monster and quickly went to destroy it. The beast had actually run away and was surviving in the wilderness and spying on a family before he was shooed away and his emotions began to take place. Meeting up with Frankenstein the doctor quaralled with him and reconsideration of his thoughts take place as he decides what to do with the monster that he has created."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book was extremely difficult and hard to read-then I got past the first 5 pages.

The only down side is that it was soo depressing! It really was! I would definitely recommend this book and don't be afraid to read this if you think it's too difficult, I'm 13!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"To me this book was great. At times it can be hard but not very often. It has a lot of deeper psychological meanings and thoughts if you take time to analyze this characters. It is a book basically about a struggle of good v. evil, but who really is the evil one, the monster or Frankenstein?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"How can a story written at the turn of the last century have direct relevance to our times? Shelley's gothic tale about the artificial creation of life depicts the risks of scientific hubris and the unanticipated consequences that can follow. It calls to mind Robert Oppenheimer's second thoughts about the creation of the atomic bomb, modern genetic researchers who are moving ever closer to human cloning, and the unanticipated environmental risks of greenhouse gasses and nuclear energy. This classic speaks to us from the past about philosophical and moral issues that apparently haven't changed as quickly as our technology."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A worthwhile read nonetheless. I just finished reading this interesting and classic work. What struck me about it was not that it was particularly scary, but that it was so very sad. The main characters seem to be truly miserable throughout most of the book, and you can feel the pain of both the monster and the creator as you read. The book is well written and the characters are well developed. The story elements may be well known, but for full effect you have to read the original. I recommend this book and edition absolutely."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is one of the most famous horror stories of all time. The novel tells the chilling story of an ambitious young scientist and his chance to play God. But the creature turns on him, and a struggle between creator and creation ensues.

As in all literature, fancy and elaborate descriptions take precedence over the action of the plot. Frankenstein is a classic horror story even though is hard to read at times."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"We rate this book four star for a few reasons,which apply to how we understood the context of the story.The book gives you a good understanding of the emotions of the creature named Frankenstein. It brings you in to all the pain and misery that the creature suffered ever since he was created by Victor Frankenstein. This is a book that will affect your outlook on life and how you treat other people. It shows examples of many emotions such as curiousity, love, kindness, and revenge. We discovered the fatal mistakes of Victor Frankenstein, when he created his monster through the blindness of ambition. Though the story was of course at times suspenseful and violent, it is also a romantic love story between Victor and his adopted sister Elizabeth."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley did a phenominal job with this book. The fact that it was only meant as a time-passer adds to the books power. The story is very well defined, and there are no hard places to follow. There are however, a few places that could be cut with no harm being done to the novel. That is to be expected with every book though. The true feelings of all of the characters can be felt throughout. Most everyone thinks of the monster as being just that, a terrible, hideous monster. That isn't the way Mary Shelley meant for him to be veiwed as though. His feelings can be felt, and they are profound. Shelley's Frankenstein is a great book. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book is profound. It is unlike the story from the horror movie; you delve into the characters and find out the reasons for the monster's fury. I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I grew up seeing Frankensteins on windows and as costumes during the Halloween season, but never did I know, until now, that Frankenstein in the novel is the man who created this abomination from body parts and some electricity, and this plot makes for an intriguing novel...certainly different than the popular images/movies of Frankenstein, and perhaps even better.Victor Frankenstein grows up thirsty for knowledge and with a penchant for the dark arts. He is studying at a university when he creates the monster that everyone knows today as Frankenstein, although in reality he is never named. The creature stands at eight-feet-tall and is grotesque in form. Horrified, Victor runs away, and soon the creature leaves the building to wander the earth. The creature is never far from Victor's tormented mind.Later, as the naive creature is repeatedly scorned and shunned by humans, he murders Victor's beloved friends and family, beginning with his brother William. Victor is guilt-ridden because the accused is innocent, and he knows that his own creation was the one who strangled the boy. Victor's health deteoriates so he retreats to the mountains, only to come face to face with the creature. There, he learns of the monster's isolation from humanity and its yearn for companionship, but Victor never really does anything about it, which leads only to more tragedy.The storyline is amazing; Shelley wrote this when she was only a teenager. Yes, the language is a bit too flowery at parts; for example, the monster has extensive, absurd vocabulary and conversations that I find a bit laughable, but flowery language was not unusual in the 19th century. I could definitely picture in my mind Victor's emaciated self (the mad scientist look), the monster's anger --he should be like Adam of the Bible but he is not--, and all Victor's beloved die off, one by one. Great classic read, if you can get past the verbose writings :)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I read this in high school, and I must say that I feel in love with this book...

This part has a somewhat boring start, but once he starts making it it goes faster. Then once hes done with this the monster is made..... and it slows down to a miserable pace.From here it will have short spurts of something exciting, like for seven pages, then it goes into a fifty page boring streak, prattling on about details you don't care about. If it wants to emphasize that Frankenstein is lonely, it takes 25 pages of examples when five would be sufficient. From about the time Frankensteins monster is born you want it to die and let the story be over with because it is so boring. Not to mention predictable. I could predict the deaths of some of the people fifty pages away! Let me just say leave this book on the shelf and don't start to read it. You'll hate the book, and yet you'll probably make yourself finish it just because you started it. At least thats the way it was with me."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is quite a departure when compared to the films based upon the book. The essence of the novel centers on the horrors experienced by Dr. Frankenstein after he disobeys the natural order of things by creating his \\"monster\\". Frankenstein recoils in horror at what he has created, and it is his own personal hell that the reader experiences, rather than the terror of the creature himself.Her use of atmosphere is astounding. I could feel the cold forest in which the creature dwells, smell the fresh cut firewood, and picture the cabin in the woods where the creature learns his lessons in humanity. While Frankenstein chases the monster through the Arctic chill, I felt almost physically cold. You can breathe the scent of the pine trees surrounding Frankenstein's residence as well.Beyond the excellent descriptions of places and things, Shelley has gifts when it comes to relating suspenseful horror through the eyes of the monster as well as Frankenstein. The doctor comes across like a desperate, oppressed soul, fleeing from his own creation. The creature is equally desperate in his longing for revenge and his unattainable quest to find peace with the world which rejects him.The story seems to be missing passages and missing information, or at least it reads in parts as if certain scenes were rushed. The creation of the monster is a good example of this, as we follow Frankenstein through his first days in the university until his much-later monster creation, all in the course of a few pages (interestingly, Shelly downplays the part about reanimating corpses, although it is clear that this is how Frankenstein did it). Immediately thereafter, Frankenstein is horrified by what he has done, and his descent into madness over the course of many months is condensed into a few sentences.Shelley, for some reason, has Frankenstein marry his adopted sister, Elizabeth. The book explains that Elizabeth and Victor treat each other as \\"cousins\\" growing up, and just for added confusion Shelley adds another adopted brother named William. I'm not clear on whether Shelley was going for an \\"incest\\" angle or not (probably not, considering the time this was written), but I couldn't help but crack a smile over the excessive cousin-adoptions-sibling-marriage thing. The storyline involving adoption after adoption seems unnecessary to say the least.Many scenes in which Frankenstein relates the bone-chilling inner torment of having been responsible for the monster who wreaks havoc are over the top and approach camp comedy. As many times as Victor cries out that he is responsible for the death and destruction around him, then backtracks without an explanation for his behavior, you'd think someone in his circle would ask him what the heck he's talking about. This never happens, although Frankenstein is somehow able to convince his family that an innocent has been accused of murder, without giving any real explanation as to why he believes it's a frame-job. This is unintentional comedy at its finest. We also have the bizarre coincidence of the monster finding a bag of books lying in the road, which lead to his very educated and worldly (yet still grotesque and probably smelly) appearance during his first confrontation with the doctor.Shelley also makes the mistake of using first person narrative for THREE different characters in the book. There were times where I wasn't sure who was speaking, in fact it took a page or two before I understood that it was the monster who was speaking in chapter 11. Maybe I was reading too fast, but the awkwardness of having three first-person narratives caught me off guard.Well, I sure did a lot of complaining about a book that earned 4 stars from me. Considering Shelley wrote \\"Frankenstein\\" when she was 19 years old in a world where women's education wasn't exactly common, this is high art. For all its flaws, \\"Frankenstein\\" was a pleasure to read for the creepy atmosphere and riveting suspense. I didn't know what to expect from the story from page to page, and Shelley paints an exceptionally clear picture of the madness surrounding the life of Frankenstein. This reader no longer has any questions regarding why this book has been popular for 180+ years; read it and you'll understand too."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I read Franenstein for a Senior English class in High School. To be honest, i wasn't personally expecting much from this book. I thought it would be a plain horror story. I had in my head a story that was simply about a monster killing people. After reading this book i realized that I was wrong! This book brought out many emotions within me. I found it very insubstantial that Victor had even created a monster. There is much more to this book than that fact. It was difficult to not feel pitty for both Victor and his monster. I would, and already have, recommended this book to a range of readers."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It is amazing that Mary Shelley was a teenager when she wrote this novel. Unfortunately, the amazement ends there. This book was based on a wonderful concept. An intelligent man creates a human-like being to compensate for his lost loves, only to watch his creature destroy more of his loved ones. Sounds catchy, ironic, and scary!! Sadly enough, each of these exciting points in the novel are only brushed upon. No detail is given to the audience regarding the actual creation of the monster. A plethora of pages are even donated to Frankensteins reaction to his creation. At this point, I checked to make sure I hadn't accidentally stuck ten pages together from the gum I was twirling in my fingers!As in all critism, good points should be expressed. I thoroughly enjoyed the monster's account of his adventures. These chapters were described wonderfully, allowing readers to feel the monster's pain. That's right, I felt badly for this destructive creature. It did not even matter that the monster's learned speech that was so fluent and intelligent was learned in the timespan of only a year or so. Dr. Frankenstein created quite an intelligent monster aparently.Perhaps if I hadn't anticipated a horrific story about a briliant scientist with messy hair chanting &quot;He's alive! He's alive!&quot; over a gigantic creature, I would have enjoyed this book more. Instead, I read a novel that would be appropriate for a segment on Saturday morning cartoons."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The idea of the book was very intelligent and interesting, dealing with rights and wrongs, accomplisments, actions and there consequences. But the book, to me, was written poorly. When reading the novel, my mind always wandered becasue of the dragging on of events. It used difficult language, uncommon words, and was saturated with too many words. The 160 page novel could have easily been shrinked down into an 100 page story. It was repititive in its ideas and difficult to concentrate on. It's not the worst book I've read for school, but I would definelty not read this book in my leisure time."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelly says it like no one else. I thought Tolstoy had the most profound writing talent before reading this book.Usually I read to kill time but this book had me make the time. In my 52 years, this has been the book that I couldn't wait to get back to. I'm deeply impressed and so happy that I chose this timeless classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"In \\"Frankenstein,\\" Mary Shelley claims that one needs to be careful at decision because according to the decision awful consequence comes. The main character, Frankenstein, decides to make creature that is similar with human being when he only has shallow knowledge about what he is going to make. Due to the fact that he builds monster with carelessness, he can't handle his beast and the creature kills his youngest brother, Williams. Also, he determines to chase monster when he is filled with rage toward the creature. He can't have proper thoughts about what he comes to conclusion. He follows the monster up to North Pole and dies. However, when he has lots of time to think about the problem and is prudent, he comes to a right decision. He have doubts about his experiment to make female monster and decides to destroy it, because it can be harmful to society. Therefore, not to face dreadful results, individual needs to spend enough time and be careful when he makes decisions."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I would recommend this book to all people with a good vocabulary and an affinity for science. It begins and ends with letter writing, but the meat of the book is of Frankenstein telling his tale. It is rife with extremely long sentences and difficult words, but also has wonderful insights of strong hatred, vengeance, love, and passion. It is at first a little hard to read, but once you get into it you can't put it down easily. So, to all you well educated children and adults, or even you who want to strengthen your vocabulary and read a superb tale of emotion and adventure at the same time, [...]. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley was ahead of her time in writing what some consider to be the first ever science fiction novel. What I found most intriguing about this book was that the main story was not defined to me until one moment at the very end. In fact, I am still unable to decide for myself whether it is what it is. A definite must read for anyone who is at all interested in fantastic fiction."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Shelley was only 18 when she wrote this?! Incredible! The reason for this being a classic is obvious--a stellar story about a mad scientist and his objectives gone awry. I've learned a lot about the time period, as well, despite the few anachronisms throughout. Shelley did a fabuous job with this novel and I hope it remains in its rightful place in the canons of literature.Word Ninja"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A tragic emotional Gothic tale of the classic mad scientist and the unnatural grotesque outcast. I feel contemptuous of Victor and extremely pitious of the monster. Poor soul, abhorred by all, including God (as Victor is his God). Some major themes in this book are Divine Nature, Passive weak women, and perhaps abortion. I see why it's a classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Having to read Frankenstein for my Freshman Honors Eng. Class, I thought it would be much more boring than it really is. The writings before the novel are splendid. As a novel,Frankenstein is an excellent book, not a Clancy, but detailed enough for me. Shelley's work on the novel is phenomonal.The novel starts out with a man by the name of Robert Walton writing letters to his dearest. Soon enough, Frankenstein is rescued in an ice flow. Soon after Frankenstein is rescued, he comes to tell his tale.I rate this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It's surprising how little this grim, melodramatic novel has in common with many of the horror movies it inspired. The theory that it's a warning of science and technology going awry is, I think, an overstatement of its prophetic capacity. Mary Shelley's novel does not appear to have much of an interest in science per se, and is less about creation than it is about the relationship between the creator and the created.The novel's structure is indirect for reasons that become apparent at its end. An English sea captain named Walton is writing letters to his sister, telling her about a man his ship has rescued from an abandoned ice floe on a polar expedition. The man's name is Victor Frankenstein, and he commences to tell Walton his Long Story...Intensely interested in science as a boy growing up in Geneva, Victor fulfilled his studies at a university and hoped to make some earth-shattering scientific breakthrough. He decides that a fascinating project would be to find a way to re-animate the dead. Collecting body parts from charnel houses and assembling them into a gigantic golem, he manages to bring this thing to life (refusing to disclose the scientific method). Fearful and regretful of the powerful outcome of his experiment, he is relieved when the monster walks mutely and mindlessly out of his apartment, never to return. Oddly enough, over the next two years, he is not concerned with where the monster has gone or what it is doing.When his youngest brother, William, is murdered, Victor suspects his monster; vacationing in the Alps a few months later, he comes across the monster, who not only has learned to talk but has become quite eloquent. The monster tells Victor that his many efforts to befriend people and enter into society have been spurned due to his frightening appearance, and his resulting loneliness and anger incited him to kill. He insists that Victor, as his creator, has an obligation to provide him with a female companion, and demands that he make one for him. However, Victor is unwilling to add to the population of violent creatures, and the monster takes his revenge out on even more of Victor's loved ones. Distraught to the point of insanity, Victor turns vigilante and pursues the monster all over the world, swearing to destroy it once and for all.\\"Frankenstein\\" is an allegorical tale of creation and examines a creator's responsibility and accountability for his creation's deeds or misdeeds. In this regard, Victor is essentially an irresponsible creator. He is not concerned with his monster's whereabouts until after one of his siblings is murdered; he could have taken responsibility for his creature immediately upon creation, but shortsightedly chose not to. The monster, on the other hand, was essentially a good creature until human society made him miserable and vengeful; in terms of his emotions, his intelligence, and his vindictiveness, he's ironically the most \\"human\\" character in the novel. Both man and monster are culpable, but the former is less excusable."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"When being told I was to read Frankenstein for a college fiction class, I was not exactly thrilled. I knew what Frankenstein was about, or so I thought. Although many movies have been made about Frankenstein, none compare to Mary Shelley's novel. Shelley captures human emotion like no movie can. The expression of anger, sorrow, and helplessness of the monster created cannot be seen in such movies. Shelley's novel ties a completely fictional idea to real life in which everyone can relate. There are many things that can be taken away from this novel aside from the whole &quot;man creating monster&quot; idea. For a look at real human emotion, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This was the first time that I actually read Frankenstein only to find out the movies of Frankenstein were all fake. If you think the book is like the movie forget about it, it's a completely different story. I did not think that I would enjoy this book the way that I did.The book starts out very boring and I did not really get into it until I was half way. I really liked the way Frankenstein was so human and at the same time such a horrible monster. The science behind it was a little too unrealistic for me at the beginning but the purpose of Frankenstein himself made that change. Science did not just give him life but also features that are scary to look at, this is the part where if you like horror, you will appreciate Frankenstein's features and appearance.Fiction is definitely a big part of this book and I personally don't like fiction but still enjoyed it. The book was nothing like I expected from the understanding that I had of what was Frankenstein. This not only introduced me to the real meanings behind the book and about the time that it was written but also about how much it explains about our societies today in one way or another.I recommend this book for those who think Frankenstein is just another fictional monster because they will have a better if not a completely different story and understanding of Frankenstein and how and why he was introduced in this world."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This was a good used book at a good price. It arrived in a timely fashion. I was pleased overall."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The beginning of the great scary books. Read the old time original supernatural/horror story. By the best of the best"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Unexpected because: 1. I didn't realize that it would be like reading Austen - similar, flowery style from a similar era, and 2. I didn't realize how different the story was from the movies. This book has themes about the responsibility of the Creator, about selfishness. I enjoyed it and am glad I read it. If you read it, be sure to get an edition with a good introduction - the background is quite interesting."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Nearly everyone alive has seen at least one version of a story about Frankenstein. Nearly all of those versions are less than faithful to Mary Shelley's original, and phenomenally creative, version. Frankenstein was the creator of the creature, not the name of the creature itself.Victor Frankenstein studies science, seeking not only to learn, but also to understand the nature of the life. His desire for knowledge leads him to seek out discredited and outdated theories of science, which he seems to couple with modern knowledge. In essence, Frankenstein appears to combine pieces of the old and the new in his quest for deeper knowledge.Using his eclectic knowledge, Frankenstein develops a technique to reanimate dead things, eventually deciding to build a human being. Shelley leaves the details ambiguous, avoiding issues with actual science. The creature that Frankenstein creates verges on hideous, and Frankenstein flees his creation. When Frankenstein returns, the creature is gone.The remainder of the novel is devoted in portions to Victor Frankenstein and his travels, and the creature and its travels. We see events first from Frankenstein's perspective, and then from the creature's perspective. While Frankenstein sees the creature as a monster, the creature at first kills by accident. Later, the creature's rage at being unable to be accepted by humans leads to psychopathic behavior on the part of the creature.The creature gives Frankenstein a chance to stop the killing by creating for the creature a female bride. Initially, Frankenstein agrees. Later, Frankenstein considers the outcome of his original actions and decides that he cannot create a bride for the creature. It is Frankenstein's decision that leads to the final scenes of the story and the poignant, nearly inevitable, ending.This novel is extremely complex in its examination of morals and the role of science. Shelley seems to portray science as a potentially evil or deadly force. Shelley does seem to mute her criticism of science by distinguishing between the outdated theories studied by Frankenstein and the relatively benign modern sciences. Thus, Shelley appears to be saying that some things man was not meant to know or do, which is a very common theme in modern science fiction (e.g., \\"Jurassic Park\\"). The result of arrogant hubris on the part of any scientist who fails to consider the morality of his or her actions is death and destruction, often prolonged, and often directed at the people the scientist loves the most.\\"Frankenstein\\" is considered by some historians, e.g., Brian Aldiss, to be the first science fiction novel. Stories and novels earlier than \\"Frankenstein\\" tended to be more fantastic, freely incorporating occult and mythological sources as the basis of events. While Shelley uses outdated or no longer pursued branches or theories of science as a source of some of Frankenstein's knowledge, which might somehow be associated with the occult, or perhaps mythology, she maintains that this knowledge is science rather than mysticism.This story meets the most fundamental tenet of science fiction: make one assumption or hypothesis, a \\"what if,\\" as it were, and build the story about this assumption or hypothesis. The hypothesis in this novel is that there is a way for flesh to be animated. The creature did seem to have nearly superhuman powers in strength and endurance, but if you can assume the ability to create life, I suppose you can assume the created life contains incredible capabilities. None of the creature's capabilities appeared to be beyond the realm of what might be possible in a human form.Regardless of whether the novel is science fiction, the novel is gothic horror, and, because of certain aspects that I did not discuss, includes elements of gothic romance. Shelley clearly roots the creature's origins in science, but because science imbued the creature with incredible capabilities, including stealth, strength, and intelligence, the creature traverses terrain with ease in weather that would thwart most humans, providing the creature with almost supernatural capabilities, a gothic trait.Shelley also first describes the creature's murders in a way intended to elicit tension and apprehension because the creature appears to be either amoral or immoral, yet another gothic attribute. Only later does Shelley explain the creature's motivations in a logical way that removes some of the horror aspect, though almost bizarrely increasing it because the creature's motivations go from being unknown and apparently random to being defined and specific, giving the creature a psychopathic characteristic.Mary Shelley was quite young when she wrote this novel, and sometimes I got the feeling that the story was on the verge of escaping her artistic control. However, her unfettered creativity provided us with an incredible work of fiction that forms the basis for many of the science fiction and horror figures we know, and love, today. Among these are the mad scientist and the \\"alien\\" creature that escapes from the creator's control and either kills indiscriminately, or seeks to kill its creator. In addition to the \\"mad\\" scientist,\\" Shelley also created the conflicted scientist who is simultaneously fascinated and repelled by the very science the scientist controls.Fans of science fiction, horror, and gothic novels should take the time to read this book for pleasure. Portions of this book may be difficult to read, but in the end, I thought the story was well worth the effort, especially the poignant end.A word of caution: Amazon has mixed the reviews of multiple versions of this novel together, as Amazon tends to do. Thus, reviews for abridged versions, children's versions, and audio versions appear mixed on the same page, in addition to various editions. I do not know which edition I am reviewing (the information at the beginning is unclear), only that the version is unabridged. If you need a specific edition, I suggest obtaining a print copy with the version specified rather than trusting to an electronic version of dubious edition.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I purchased this novel for my son for his english class. I could not see renting the books when I could purchase them and keep them for future use."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Well, this is only the second work of fiction I have reviewed and the first of its genre that I have ever read. As many may know, the novel is much different than the movie adaptation.In the novel, Frankenstein's \\"daemon\\" or \\"monster\\" is highly articulate, intelligent, and agile. A creature standing eight foot tall, he scales mountains with superhuman ease and endures temperatures and hardships that would fell a mortal man. Created by Victor Frankenstein from overly large parts (for ease of construction), the good doctor is instantly horrified by his creation and immediately abandons it. Forced to experience life without reference, and rebuffed by humanity, the creature experiences the psychological pain of being rejected for nothing more than his grotesque appearance. Over time he learns to speak and read by secretly observing a family as they teach a newly arrived immigrant the ways of society and language. He first introduces himself to the family's blind patriarch and performs many secret good deeds for them. But disaster soon follows when the sighted members of the family discover the monster and drive him away. This, along with other disastrous encounters with humanity, vow him to destroy his creator, Victor Frankenstein.However, in Chapter 10 we learn of the monster's harrowing life experiences through his own first-person narrative. And though he has unintentionally suffocated Victor's young brother, the monster vows never to kill again, if only the good doctor will make for him a bride to ease his loneliness. Although conflicted, Dr. Frankenstein reluctantly agrees and travels from Geneva to England to complete this work. However, in the midst of his second creation he sees the first monster jeering with delight in the moonlight. Frankenstein contemplates the horror he might unwittingly unleash upon mankind were he to create another terrible beast. At that thought, he destroys the half-made bride, enraging the monster who promises to destroy his creator on his wedding day. This he does by murdering his family members one by one, beginning with Dr. Frankenstein's new wife. At the last, Victor Frankenstein succumbs to grief and exposure near the arctic circle, where he has chased the monster with a view to destroy him.In the last pages, the monster encounters the ship's captain who has befriended Dr. Frankenstein in the last days of his life upon encountering him on an ice floe in polar waters. Indeed, the entire story is told through the captain's letters to his sister. The book ends with the monster confronting the captain and recounting his extreme sadness and conflict at the death of his creator. The monster leaves the captain unharmed after the creature reveals his intention to commit suicide by immolation for all the evil he has caused.By modern horror standards, the book is quite tame. Yet it leaves the reader to contemplate the unintended consequence of mankind's overreach into the affairs of God. The book is all the more remarkable considering that Mary Shelley wrote it after she turned 18 years of age, finishing it and seeing it published at age 19. Despite this, the vocabulary and polished textual style are those of a person easily twice her age, and her knowledge of the Bible, Milton and other works of literature and poetry are all the more remarkable. The book was originally written as a warning against 19th century galvanism; at the time electricity was being applied to animate corpses and many wondered at the possibility of artificial life and contemplated its theological consequences. This debate that has been renewed today in the wake of the abject failure of embryonic stem cell research (in contrast to adult stem-cell research which has shown many benefits). If good lessons are best taught through good stories, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein surely deserves to be read. All the better that the novel is less than 200 pages."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was taking an online literature class, and almost all the books were in the public domain, but reading on screens strains my eyes, Dover was a life saver!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is Mary Shelley's best (only?) work.

He is a whiny piece of s*** and I could not find any redeeming qualities in him at all.

Mary and her husband, poet Percy Shelley, poet Lord Byron, and The Vampyre writer John William Polidori (oh, to keep such literary company...) challenged each other to write a horror story. The young Mary had travelled extensively in Geneva, Switzerland and that is where much of the story is based.The novel is written in the Gothic and Romantic style of its era, yet it can also lay claim as one of the first truly science fiction novels. In classically written Gothic/Romantic tales, detailed character ponderings combine with vivid landscape descriptions to constitute lengthy sentence structure and a major portion of the story:\\"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\\"The main character, Victor Frankenstein is a young man obsessed with knowledge and the determination to create a more perfect human being. After two years of pilfering body parts, he assembles his creature. On a dark rainy night (this is a Gothic tale, after all) his scientific experiment is nearly complete and he uses his instruments (Hollywood utilized lightning bolts) to bring the creature to life.As the creature comes to life, Frankenstein realizes too late what he has done:\\"How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing, his teeth of a pearly whiteness, but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shriveled complexion and straight black lips.\\"Poor Victor is so stricken with horror that he runs out of his laboratory to his bedchamber, leaving the monster to escape and wander the countryside. Meanwhile, the exhausted young scientist descends into a wretched succession of nightmarish dreams while pondering \\"a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.\\"Since Hollywood has already spoiled the story by having the name \\"Frankenstein\\" come to mean the monster itself, and revealing to the general public that the monster goes on a killing rampage (excepting Abbot and Costello's version), I feel it is safe to tell you that much is true to the original story. However, lest you think that modern science, with eugenics and cloning, can improve on Victor's design, I suggest you read the novel to discover the ramifications of such experiments.A clue to the moral of the tale is that Shelley aptly subtitled her story\\"Or the Modern Prometheus\\" after the Greek mythological character who created an alternate man, but was then lashed to a rock to have his liver daily pecked at by an eagle as punishment."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Reason for Reading: I intend to read the upcoming non-fiction title \\"The Lady and Her Monsters\\" which is about the writing and background of the creation of the novel \\"Frankenstein\\" so I thought it would be best if I re-read the book to better appreciate the former.I am a huge Frankenstein fan! I first watched the Boris Karloff movie as a young child and have since seen it dozens of times. I've seen all the MGM sequels and have a deluxe DVD edition with commentaries, etc. I've also seen many, many different remakes, pastiches and parodies of the movie as well as reading Frankenstein themed retellings, comics and pastiches. I have read this, the original book, once before when I was quite young. It was one of the first books I took out of the library when I obtained an adult library card with special permission of my father at 12 or 13. (You had to be 14, or in highschool, to get one at the time). Needless to say at this point in time 30 years later, the movie version, specifically the James Whale (Boris Karloff) version is the one that I think of when I think of the Frankenstein story.When I went into reading this book I knew that it was a totally different story than what my mind recalls from the movies but I also remembered that it started in the Arctic with the monster relating his story to Frankenstein. So from this I was totally blown away with how incredibly different the actual story is to the conceived modern notion of the tale. The book is told in narrative form from three different points of view and is a story within a story within a story. Starting off with a mariner writing home letters to his sister as he starts an Arctic expedition and then becomes stuck in ice he recounts his tale and his meeting of Victor Frankenstein who stumbles upon them near death in his mad chase of his creature. Then Walton, the mariner, recounts the tale that Frankenstein relates to him of his life. The awful, hideous story of his wretched life. Halfway through this recounting Frankenstein stops to relate the story the creature pauses to tell him of his life story since he woke from the \\"spark of life\\" and wandered into the world on his own. Then it goes back to Frankenstein's narrative and finally ends again with Walton's letters. This way we get both Frankenstein and the creature's tales from their own mouths, in their own words as they were related to the person they spoke to.Neither Frankenstein or the creature are sympathetic which I found surprising, as in the movie I am deeply sympathetic to Karloff's monster. But in the novel, he is a vile, wicked, murdering beast who at first thinks he has human compassion but quickly is turned from having any and easily finds violence and revenge better to his suiting when he is not treated fairly by others. Frankenstein himself is simply mad, the quintessential mad scientist. Obsessed with his creation he thinks of nothing else, working in solitude day and night until he completes his reanimation of life. Upon first glimpse of this \\"life\\" he is so horrified that he runs from it and from this point on he becomes obsessed with finding it and destroying it, however the monster has developed his own lust for destroying Frankenstein and sets out to destroy him also, not bodily but in mind and soul by killing all who mean anything to him.A frightening tale that shows the futility and madness at playing God with science, even though the book mentions very little about religion. This edition I read from \\"The Whole Story\\" edition is a wonderful annotated edition which really brings the classics to life. The annotations don't particularly help explain the story any better, though there are some pictures and definitions of some items and devices one may not be familiar with. The main purpose of these annotations is to set one geographically and historically within the place and era that the book was written. Profusely illustrated with etchings and paintings of place names mentioned in the story one becomes immersed in the scenery and in this book particularly the Gothic feel comes to life. Historically we see the prisons of the time period, meet the Romantic poets and artists who shaped the life of the author and the mood which carried over into this novel. I really enjoy and recommend this edition, have several others in the series and would pick up any others I found, but unfortunately they are out of print at this time."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Great book. I truly loved this book. It was just was a amazed at how good the book is. I recommend this book to many people."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This was well formatted for Kindle. Dark, Gothic and broody at times. Shelley can still speak volumes to readers in this novel. Well written and and hopelessly addicted to this classic. READ IT."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"One of the hardest things to do when wanting to immerse oneself in some classic novels is to understand characters who react in ways that are incomprehensible to our modern sensibilities.Victor Frankenstein, the creator of the creature usually called \\"Frankenstein\\" by those of us familiar with the countless movie and cartoon variations of this tale (but called \\"the creature\\" in this book) is weak-willed (he changes his mind at the slightest provocation), fragile (every shock either sends him into an illness lasting months or into a fit of madness), thoughtless (he creates life and then leaves his creation completely alone), and almost astonishingly dumb (if somebody threatens \\"I'll see you on your wedding night,\\" wouldn't you at least consider that the threat might be against your intended and not yourself?).The book is very different than a modern reader might expect (beyond the distasteful main character). While modern science-fiction readers are accustomed to being flooded with details about the science of the book, Shelley presents Frankenstein's amazing accomplishment as a single step between inspiration and completion. He simply decides to create new life in his university appartment and does it.The creature is the revelation in this book. Incredibly articulate (he taught himself language by spying on a rich family fallen on hard times and reading books he found in the woods), he attempts to use language to forceFrankenstein to have pity on him. Unfortunately, language isn't enough to turn Frankenstein's head around. Thecreature responds by targeting all of Frankenstein's loved ones. The violence we expect from the tale is there -- it's just mixed with surprisingly philosophical discussions between Frankenstein and his creation.The book's structure isn't flawless. Frankenstein travels -- a lot -- and Shelley thinks we need detaileddescriptions of everything he sees. The narrative is a little clunky (I love an epistolary novel as much as thenext person, but why bother if every single document is going to be from the same person and in narrative style?).However, the fact that the creature is so different from what we expect is what saves the novel -- the delight ofdiscovering what he will say and do next is what keeps the reader moving through the novel.The Kindle formatting is perfectly acceptable. I read a couple of other reviewers fault the lack of white space -- but if that is very important to you, you aren't going to be happy with too many free public domain Kindle books."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This novel is one of my all-time favorite books. I was surprised by the humanity of the Monster; the traditional portrayal of Frankenstein is usually a bumbling stumbling monster, and Mary Shelley's real creation is nothing of the sort. The book is exciting, thought-provoking, and holds your attention until the very end. Read it on a stormy day."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Today the story of Frankenstein and his \\"monster\\" is thought of as a horror story, bringing to mind the performance of Boris Karloff and bolts in the neck. But the original Frankenstein, Mary Shelley's literary creation, is in fact more science fiction than horror, asking us the question of what is man in a world where science can work miracles, even with life itself? Or are there things mankind should best leave alone? The \\"monster\\" in this novel is therefore not the frightening thing, but rather a victim of the strange experiment, an involuntary resurrection, the tragic result of man tinkering with the provenance of God.It is worth noting that this question is one which is still with us today, in our world of medical miracles, and the fact that we still wrestle with questions about when to let death take its natural course shows that Shelley and her story were more than just idle speculation, but a deep examination of the question of what it is to be human. For death remains frightening today just as it was to our ancestors, and you cannot read Frankenstein without wondering if, given the same opportunity to defeat mortality, you might make the same decision these characters do."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Those of you who have preconceived notions about this story because you've seen the Hollywood film versions, read this book. You'll be pleasantly surprised. I guarantee it. This is nothing like the film and so much better. Shelley, in her brilliance, offers the hideous creature as the one to pity here. Not Frankenstein, not the townspeople, but the creature. A sad victim of his creator's selfish ambitions and the prejudices of a naive populace. In a way, a neglected and abused child, driven to acts of violence and rage as the only release from the agonizing rejection and isolation. His only real crime was his consuming need for acceptance...a friend...to love and be loved. This book was so ahead of its time when it was written. I highly recommend it. One of my favorites."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The relationship between Victor Frankenstein and his monster portrays every emotion a human will encounter in life. Despite being murderous and physically appalling, it's easy to identify with the monster's alienation and despair, which is deepened through Shelley's touching poetics and prose. \\"Frankenstein\\" contains the most effortlessly beautiful language to ever be penned. Although an early innovator in the horror and sci-fi genres, \\"Frankenstein\\" still remains a seminal piece of simple romanticism."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"An excellent read which stands the test of time. If you put Mary Shelley & Bram Stoker together in the Boxing Ring of Horror, Mary would beat Bram with both arms tied behind her back.It is not like any of the movies, including the awful \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\\" This Monster is huge, fast, intelligent, stealthy and ruthless. Most importantly, he is a Monster first and foremost. Except for some parts near the end, the story is almost entirely from Viktor's point of view, and the Monster, his nemesis, is a totally evil and horrifyingly unstoppable Enemy.All the movies make the mistake of adopting the Monster's self-pitying, self-justifying point of view right from the get-go, thereby turning him into a sort of tragic hero. While this material itself is not entirly untrue to the book, it has been presented (in the movies) at the wrong time and in the wrong context.It is, however, a thoughtful book. If you are looking for all action (or gore) with little depth or poetry, it is not for you."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"!Correction! Frankenstein is the name of the scientist - the monster that he creates is nameless and is referred to usually as a &quot;demon&quot; Moving onwards....If you have ever sat down to watch a horror movie from anything dating back to the 80s or earlier, it is usually for the purpose of getting a few laughs (those are special effects?!?),but the horror in the book is quite tangible. The most fascinating aspect of the novel is the transformation of the monster - initially the reader is repulsed at the creature, and then as they learn the monster's biography, humanitarian feelings of pity and of sympathy is all that the monster deserves. Hatred towards Frankenstein grows - due to his selfish thirst for knowledge, the downfall of him, his family, and his creation is inevitable. Easy to read, Shelley's descriptive language and moving plot keep the reader continually turning the pages to discover the next twist. Told in frames, Frankenstein is a classic - the origin of all horror."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"love, love, love this book!! it is a much prettier book than i expected, which makes me just love it more! i couldn't be happier with it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Her command and artful use of written language is truly amazing. Complex emotions are described with expressive clarity and detail. I loved how Shelly focused on the monster's strong desire to be loved and his attempts to reciprocate with compassion.This is a painful and sad story to the end but worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It seems to me that Mary Shelley's famous novel gets more relevant and more important as time goes on. As the original tale about how mankind's creations can get dangerously out of hand, \\"Frankenstein\\" is known the world over, though interestingly (as is often the case with famous novels) the basic concept has been reshaped and re-imagined so many times that the source material becomes somewhat ignored. Like J. M. Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\" (which isn't actually a children's story) and Charles Dickens's \\"Oliver Twist\\" (which isn't really about Oliver Twist), thousands of people proclaim that they know the story well of Frankenstein well - and yet on reading the actual text they discover that it is radically different from their preconceptions of it.Thus one of the most interesting things about reading Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is in realising just how many misconceptions surround the original story. For example, few realise that the name Frankenstein is not the name of the monster at all (who remains nameless throughout); but rather the doctor who created him. Likewise, the monster is not brought to life in the midst of a lightening storm, at no point is the doctor assisted by a deformed hunchback and never does he cry the words: \\"It's alive! It's alive!\\" More remarkably, our notion of Frankenstein's monster as a hulking, lumbering monster of a man is completely at odds with Shelley's description of him as a quick and agile wraith of a figure. Thanks Hollywood.It is an ideal illustration of how the surrounding mythology of a concept can warp the true content of a classic story. If you have seen any of the famous movies (whether the old black-and-white films or modern retellings such as the latest Kenneth Branagh version or [groan] Stephen Sommers' \\"Van Helsing\\") or laughed at one of the thousands of \\"Frankenstein\\" references that permeate our culture, or read similar stories that are based on the \\"Frankenstein\\" conceit of man's creation escaping his control, then do yourself a favour, make yourself a little smarter, and read the real McCoy: Mary Shelley's original story.During a holiday in 1816, Mary Shelley and her group of friends were each challenged to write a ghost-story (by none other than Lord Byron himself). Drawing inspiration from a nightmare and encouraged by her husband who saw potential in the unfolding tale, Shelley began to work diligently on what would become literary history. \\"Frankenstein\\" is a surprisingly slim novel that begins with letters from young explorer Robert Walton to his sister, describing his voyage into the Artic and the unexpected rescue of a near-dead man out of the icy sea. Walton recounts the circumstances surrounding the man's condition and rescue, and proceeds to record the strange tale that Doctor Victor Frankenstein tells him. Doctor Frankenstein once had it all; an illustrious career, a loving family and a wealthy home - all of which he threw away in the pursuit of knowledge and power.After discovering the secret of how to bring to life inanimate matter, Frankenstein is horrified by his own success when a living being emerges from his laboratory. Shunning the poor creature, it bounds away into the wilderness where the continual loathing and hatred that the human race expresses toward it turns its innocence into madness. After Frankenstein denies it a female partner with which to life out its life, the monster turns to cruel revenge and systematically begins to destroy all that Frankenstein loves. Now the two of them, creator and creation, have fled to the Artic wastelands to finally put an end to one another's misery.The book fits the genre of \\"Gothic\\" like a glove, with all the trademarks and pitfalls of what one expects from such novels. \\"Frankenstein\\" is not without its flaws, with character motivation and sensibility being skewered in order to serve the plot. For example, Frankenstein's refusal to act against his creation (especially when innocent lives are at stake) is frustrating to the point of being despicable, and the monster's acquiring of language and general knowledge simply through watching a family is a stretch of credibility to say the least - yet both these things must occur if the story is to be pushed in the direction Shelley wants it. She will often gloss over elements that are not important to the development of the plot, and as such I could not help but smile when Shelley avoids the question of how precisely Frankenstein managed to create life by having him proclaim that the information is too dangerous for him to share.But such moments are easy to accept considering the time period, the genre and the dense atmospheric horror that Shelley embodies in her work. \\"Frankenstein\\" is an immensely rewarding read that is necessary for anyone who claims to known and like the Frankenstein mythos. And in these days of cloning, stem-cell research and genetic manipulation, Shelley's cautionary tale about the dangers of playing God and meddling with life is more crucial than ever."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is definetly a lot deeper than I imagined it to be. Of course I wasn't frightened by it at all, not that I expected to be, considering today's \\"scary\\" standards, but it made me feel like the monster. Frankenstein's monster, which is an \\"ugly\\" man (to put it lightly) is capable and willing to give unconditional love, something so \\"powerful\\" and \\"beautiful\\", unlike the townspeople, \\"beautiful\\" (not monster-like) who are the \\"ugly\\" ones by attacking the monster with no reason, simply based on his appearance. Even his \\"creator,\\" who would be his master, his idol, rejects him and disregards him and his needs. Who wouldn't become a monster, if your \\"creator\\" turned their back on you?! The idea of this story is so powerful, even if the story wasn't written that great-- some gaps, like how quickly Frankenstein brings the monster to life then quickly rejects it and goes to sleep?! And the writing is a little long in the tooth, but I don't think the vocabulary is particularly difficult. A great and quick read for those interested!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I think that Frankenstein is an instructive book. It was fun reading it, and the story is very well written. You read that the monster is very ugly and therefore everybody is scared of him. I think that you shouldn't have prejudice based on looks. You should get to know someone first, before you judge him or her."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \\"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and Plutarch's \\"Lives.\\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?The Thirteenth Floor"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I love this book, and I love everything Frankenstein, even the cheesy movies. But this book is where it all started, and I think it is one of the most profound examinations of the relationship between God and man I've ever read.The creation, the \\"Monster,\\" represents humankind. The creation is constantly questioning why he was created, especially created with such deformities and faults. Haven't we all felt that way? Anyone who has ever cursed God (\\"Why did you create me this way? Why did you make life so hard?\\") would related to the creation. Eventually, the creation meets his creator, and demands to have what the creator has; here, a wife. But doesn't that represent our wish as people to overcome our hardships and have what our creator has? We humans yearn to be so much more than human!Dr. Frankenstein represents God, but unlike God, has (in the view of his creation) neglected his responsibility to his creation. He created the creation just because he could, then couldn't follow through. The Doctor is, afterall, only a man and not up the challenge of being a creator.In what ways do I feel like the creation, let down by a creator that I think has forgotten me? What do I think God's responsibility is to his creation? Is that realistic? Stuff to meditate on sometimes."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I started reading \\"Frankenstein\\" because I needed a book to read for school. I didn't know much about it except for what's in the various movie versions. It turned out to be a very dark, depressing, sad story about man with many problems, and a misunderstood outcast. When you watch the movie \\"Frankenstein\\", the monster that Frankenstein created was made out to be evil. This is not necessarily true in the book, however. In the book, you hear more of this outcast's story, as well as more of Frankenstein's story. In reading the book, you find out that the creature Victor Frankenstein created wasn't at all what the various movies presented him as. In most of the movies, the creature was presented as this illiterate, bumbling, stupid, ragefull, evil killer, but in truth, he was a kind, gentle, loving, smart creature. You also learn more about Victor's family, past, schooling, etc.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was depressing, yet insightful. It was deep as well as enlightening. I also like how the book was set up. It was made up in letters from a man to his sister. The man was captain of a ship, and he found Frankenstein dying in the ocean. The man took Victor onto his ship, and Victor told the man his story. The book is Victor's story, written down by the man in a letter to his sister. I liked this book because of what I said as well as it giving me a new view on the story, because you see, all I had known of this story before was what was said in the movies. Now that I have read the book, the movies anger me. The movies anger me because they take the book out of context. They turn a wonderful, yet depressing, tale of a man and a creature into a story about a stupid killer of a creature and a crazy doctor.All in all, this is a fantastic book that I recommend to anyone in high school or older. It is depressing, in some ways unrealistic, in some ways very realistic, but it's still worth reading. I gave it four stars. Definitely a very entertaining and interesting book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Though it must surely be impossible to choose the greatest horror story ever written, \\"Frankenstein\\", along with Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", is certainly near the top of the list. There is so much to enjoy in this book, including some incrdibly tender and poignant excerpts regarding the death of a loved one. I need not say more-if you like horror, or are looking for a great female author, you should already have read this."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Shelley's novel is so much more than a story about a monster. The whole mood of her novel is electrifying and startling. The sensation is similar to arriving at the very edge of a mountain precipice, gazing down, and feeling the enormity of life rush over you. This sense of vertigo is one of Shelley's gifts. She has the wild writer's mind and she can deliver the chills. One could argue her shocking sense of life was very similar to the later wildly popular french philosopher Jean Paul Sarte, and the theme of his sudden realization of the horror of existence. Shelley's gothic novel written in the age of romance has elements of both styles. But, it's her wild mind that makes this novel eerie, extraordinary and amazing. (Read intently and thoughtfully for best results.)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley starts off very uninteresting. In the beginning, a man writes letters to his sister in England but the story soon begins to pick up. Don't be discouraged when you read the first page or two. Give it a chance you will learn to love this story.This novel is definitely not the same as the black and white movies you may have seen. Mary Shelley shows a whole new side to the monster in her novel. There are many conflicts and themes in this story. There is love, hate, and the most obvious rage. This is a classic story of a gothic monster gone mad and even though it was written well over 100 years ago it can still scare the pants off of people today.This book touches on the main problem in society, acceptance. There are so many people out there who will change their look, their attitude and their entire lifestyle just to be accepted. This relates to me because I am now in high school and I have observed people who will do anything to be accepted. In my opinion it is ok to want to be accepted but when a person is willing to harm themselves, just to have more friends, that is not ok with me. Mary Shelley shows us the reality of life in this wonderfully touching story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book was way ahead of its time when written. It is more about prejudice and not liking people because they look different, than a monster story. The \\"monster\\" created by Frankenstein is actually a very complex character with deep thoughts about philosophy and life in general. He strives for the acceptance of his creator who virtually abandons him. The book has virtually no similarity to the movie later produced with Boris Karloff.The only problem I have with the book is that Shelly never tells you how the monster is created (unlike the \\"it's alive\\" scene with lightening and electrodes that made up the movie). A true classic that will never get old."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Unlike The Scarlet Letter, which some may find difficult to partake of, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein comes eas to any reader while maintaining the feel of a magnificent work of art. Shelley's story of a man set upon creating a being of his own is undaunting and horrifying, suspenseful and emotional. There is no doubt that this novel has received many praises by countless amounts of people, praises for its incorporation of naturistic and societal themes, the emotions of Victor Frankenstein and his creation, and a storyline that never stops moving. One will not soon forget its words after reading it, which marks this novel as a great literary achievement."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN; OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS offers a gripping portrait of the horrible suffering of a man who dares assume a god-like function. By giving animation to lifeless tissue Victor Frankenstein ascends to a peak of biblical and mythological proportions: he becomes a Creator like the God of Genesis, and parallels the Greek Prometheus in giving humankind a gift that has both marvelous and catastrophic consequences.The furor of the Being after Frankenstein abandons it in disgust and horror sharply contrasts with the lovely Alpine village setting. Shelley paints the countryside of Frankenstein's homeland with such warm and green colors that the reader longs to live in such a paradise. A family ardent in their devotion to him further enriches Victor's world. Only doom remains, however, when the Creature knows it cannot enjoy this love and beauty and determines that Frankenstein is to blame.Shelley, herself the creator as author, generates an organic whole by depicting the Being as more than just organic matter: she stresses the juxtaposition of creator and created, engaging them in dialogue together about the responsibilities one has toward the other. This face-off is one of the most memorable in literature. FRANKENSTEIN is a novel of both immense beauty and horrifying ugliness, and, as in life, it's all more than skin deep."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is the simple best book ever written (in my opinion). It relates to various sides of our lives, it is philosophical and exciting to read. It should be a must read for humanity because it teaches important lessons for life. It is very deep and emotional. Please do not think of any horror pictures that misinterpret the book, and thus mislead you."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is the real horror book. The total masterpiece! A triumph! It's just impossible to tell in words or feelings how marvelous this book is. You can feel it only by reading it. FRANKENSTEIN is so great that I read it at least once every year.

Exceptional."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It was very compelling, yet sad book. It kept you on the edge of your seat and you never wanted to put the book down. I got the book one day and read it that whole day and finished! It's not one of those books that drone on and on and on...It has excellent characters and great imagery that almost puts you into the book. I also saw the movie and I would definetly watch that if I were you, but the book is more descriptive in various ways."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"At first, the letters, the book was very boring. After I got through thoese I then could not put down the book. Mary Shelly wrote an EXCELLENT novel in which Vicor Frankenstein tried to portray G-d.

It was AMAZING!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Many people do not know that Frankenstein is not the name of the &quot;monster&quot;, but the name its creator.

It is a great novel and the Frankenstein movies don't do it justice."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a beautiful commentary on many moral issues which are still debated today. My students have just finished reading the novel and we decided to write this review together. They wanted to let other students know that even though the language is tough, the story is interesting and the topics are timeless. Many students found the story of the creature to be truly heartbreaking. In conclusion, they give it two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is probably the story which has been the most mangled in the transition from book to film. The book is much deeper and more philosophic than the traditional Boris Karlov-type movie. Victor Frankenstein is not a mad scientist and his creature is not a grunting, stiff-limbed automaton. Victor brings his creature to life and then abandons him. All other humans which the creature encounters treat him cruelly (with the exception of a blind man who can not see him.) The creature is initially pure and gentle, and becomes evil only as a response to mankind's rejection and brutality towards him.As in all great stories, the characters here can represent many things. Victor can be read as a symbol of God, a creator who may or may not at times abandon us, or of mankind itself as we acquire ever greater scientific powers, the results of which we may not be able to control. The creature may symbolize Satan, who resented and challenged his creator, or Adam, who fell from grace because of his sin, or man himself, who may become evil in response to his environment.This book is perhaps the best story of good versus evil that I have ever read. Having seen some of the movies made in the horror genre from this story, I can definitely say that &quot;the book was better.&quot;"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This wonderfully woven tale of a dream gone terribly wrong completely changed the way in which I approached reading back in highschool.

My best friend altered my thinking of the book by giving me a brief description of what occurs as the scientist Victor Frankenstein tries to unlock the powers of creating life and then assuming responsibility for his tragic mistake. I've several novels under my belt since the reading of this majestic work of art. I can't imagine what my life might have been like had I not read this book and discovered the joy of reading. Did I mention that I really like this book?!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Much like Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is a story we all think we know, but really don't. Very few films have consciously attempted to follow the novel too closely (which shouldn't detract from the excellent James Whale/Boris Karloff film, or its masterpiece-sequel, \\"The Bride of Frankenstein). Thus, everything popular culture \\"knows\\" about \\"Frankenstein\\" does not originate from literature, but from films. This is a shame, in a way, because the novel itself is, if not the progenitor, an early vessel of so many archetypes found science fiction and horror.The basic plot remained intact when transferred to other media. Swiss medical student Victor Frankenstein discovers the secret of life (which he never reveals, lest someone repeat the mistake). He then puts together a body, essentially a man, from various corpses. He then becomes horrified by the creature he has built, and abandons. The creature, suffering a great deal of neglect and abuse, still manages to get a thorough education, and learns of his lineage. After murdering Victor's younger brother, and framing the family maid, the creature tells his (admittedly) sad tale to his \\"father\\", and then demands a mate. Victor, in a panic, agrees, then thinks better of it at the last moment, destroying the new bride. In retaliation, the creature murders all of Victor's loved ones (including his wife), and leads Victor on a merry chase across the world.Most probably know that Mary Shelley wrote this book in response to a challenge issued by Lord Byron, during a vacation at Lake Geneva. (Along with this story came John Polidori's \\"The Vampyre\\", the first English vampire novel.) Most probably also know that Shelley went on to write other works of imaginative gothic fiction. Still, her modern reputation rests with this book.As stated, numerous archetypes (themes, plot lines, characters) are present here. The basic fear of what evil technology may bring along with the good is a central theme, as is the warning against playing God. So is the implicit admonition to be responsible in all things, be it during innovation or being a parent. The creature is, for all intents and purposes, an android-everyone from Gort to C-3PO owe their existence to the Frankenstein monster. And the monster that slays all but one protagonist is a staple of horror, be it traditional monster movies, like \\"Alien\\", or more realistic slasher movies like \\"Halloween\\".But, as I noted at the beginning of this review, certain of these elements have been lost in most interpretations. The creature is actually intelligent, and well-spoken, quite different from the inarticulate grunts or slow, half-sentences of the movies. Further, while the films have made lightening a staple of the creatures creation, Shelley never really explains the process. Finally, one of the staples of the films is the explanation for the creatures \\"evil\\" nature. Often, the problem lies with the brain used, which almost invariably is a criminal brain, or is damaged before implantation. In the book, the creature is really a child that's horribly neglected, but with the strength and intelligence to strike back: id without superego, and without restraints.Thus, \\"Frankenstein\\" will be a new experience for readers who know the source exclusively from the films. Unlike \\"Dracula\\", there aren't any moments where a reader might look up and suddenly realize how quiet it is in the house, or how dark it's gotten outside. In that regard, \\"Frankenstein\\" has not aged particularly well. Throughout, however, it is a moving, disturbing, depressing, but also a touching and beautiful tale. Those qualities have withstood the test of time. While it is not always a rollicking adventure, it is a rewarding read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This \\"enriched classics\\" is a bowdlerized version of Mary Shelley's original text. It eliminates passages, changes the diction, abridges the chapters, and changes the entire structure of the novel. Our school bought this edition thinking that the additional notes would be helpful to students studying the text, but there was no indication at all on Amazon's website that this version had been substantially altered by the editors.

Irene Nicastro, English teacher, The American School of The Hague."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Modern readers must jump through a number of hoops to enjoy this legendary novel. Written between 1816 and 1818, this is very much a novel of its era, and both language and ideas about plot are quite different from those of today. That aside, and unlike such contemporaries as Jane Austen, author Mary Shelly has never been greatly admired for her literary style, which is often awkward. But perhaps the biggest hurdle is that of our own expectations: while it certainly sent icy chills down the spines of 19th Century readers, FRANKENSTEIN is not a horror novel per se.While Mary Shelly might have been stylistically weak, her story was not. Nothing like it had been written before, and the concept of a student endowing life upon a humanoid creature cobbled together from charnel house parts was unexpectedly shocking to the reading public. But even more shocking were the ideas that Shelly brought to the story. Having created this thing in his own image, what--if anything--does the creator owe it? And in posing this question, Shelly very deliberately raises her novel to an even more complex level: this is not merely the conflict of man and his creation, but also a questioning of God and his responsibility toward his creation.In some respects, the book is written like the famous philosophical &quot;dialogues&quot; of the ancient world: a counterpoint of questions and arguments that do battle for the reader's acceptance. More than anything else, FRANKENSTEIN is a novel of ethics and of ideas about ideas, with Mary Shelly's themes arrayed in multiple layers throughout: God, self, society, science; responsibility to self, to society, to the things we bring to society, to the truth; life, integrity, and death--these are the ideas and issues that predominate the book, and any one expecting a horror novel pure and simple is out of luck.Mary Shelly is a rare example of a writer whose ideas clearly outstrip her literary skill--but whose ideas are so powerful that they transcend her literary limitations and continue to resonate today. And indeed, as science continues to advance, it could not be otherwise so. Mary Shelly could not see into the future of DNA research, laboratory-grown tissues, test-tube babies and the like--but between 1816 and 1818 she wrote a book about the ethical dilemmas that swirl around them. And for all its flaws, FRANKENSTEIN is perhaps even more relevant today than it was over a hundred and fifty years ago.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I've seen the movie and the many spoofs so I thought I knew the plot, but when I finally sat down to read the Mary Shelley classic, I was taken back by the intellectual undertones and concept by which the plot of the book plays out. Yes there is a scientist who creates a being and brings it to life. And yes there is a central \\"monster\\" that creates havoc. However, it is more than just a scary story. The commentary on the potential risks to society caused by technology can be taken into account today. You also learn that the \\"monster\\" is not some mindless being, but there is a back story. I'm only disappointed in the fact that it took me so long to pick up this book to read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Those who know Frankenstein only from movies and television may well be surprised to read the original book by Mary Shelley. Indeed, one may well look back to the cover to see if the book is in fact Frankenstein because the first pages consist of messages from an R. Walton to his sister concerning his expedition to the northern polar regions. Victor Frankenstein appears as a wretched creature stranded on an ice floe beside the ship. After he is rescued and recovers somewhat, he tells his incredible story to Walton, who in turn preserves the story in writing. Frankenstein reminisces about his happy childhood, particularly the close relationship between himself and his &quot;cousin&quot; Elizabeth, and then explains how his interest in discredited natural philosophy led him to create a living man of his own design. The creature is a hideous, misshapen, giant of a man who so disgusted Frankenstein upon his awakening that he fled his laboratory and residence. The creation process, it should be noted, in no way involved an elaborate machine powered by lightning such as is portrayed in the movies; in fact, beyond the fact that chemicals are involved, we are told nothing of the process. For two years, Frankenstein goes about life with a clinging sense of guilt and nervousness, hoping the creature has perished. When his little brother is murdered, though, he returns home and soon discovers that it was the monster who committed the deed. In an isolated mountainous area, the monster appears before him and explains his actions. Although the creature does nothing more than grunt in the movies, the original Frankenstein was possessed of great eloquence and intelligence, and he tells a moving story about his attempts to make a connection with a society that is revolted at the sight of him. He describes living in a small hovel at the back of a small house for many months, watching the interaction of the family inside, learning how to speak their language and eventually even learning how to read. When he eventually tries to interact with the family, he is assaulted and runs away, and it is at this point that his virtuous and peaceful nature begins to become inflamed into a torrent of hatred for mankind. When he rescues a girl from drowning, he is rewarded with a bullet in his shoulder. Each time he performs a good deed, mankind runs from him in disgust or attempts to harm him. Living in total isolation and loneliness, his one purpose in life eventually becomes tormenting his creator, and many terrible misfortunes ensue for Frankenstein, who himself eventually becomes dedicated to the sole purpose of destroying his tormentor.Both Frankenstein and his monster are tragic figures. The complete alienation of the creature makes him a very sympathetic character in many respects, and he does perform many kind deeds for humans early on. Frankenstein is an utterly pitiable character utterly destroyed by his mad decision to create the monster; he burdens his soul with responsibility for every crime the monster commits, and his inability to tell anyone his secret for so long destroys him in body, mind, and soul; everyone and everything he cares for is taken from him by his horrible creation. His tendency to bemoan his fate at every turn of the narrative can get rather tiresome, but one cannot question the depth of his turmoil. Both creator and created seem to be mirror images of each other in important ways, their fates clearly tied to one another, each soul deserving both blame and pity. There is much about human nature, both good and bad, revealed in the monster's life as well as Frankenstein's; the novel is a far cry from horror for the sake of horror. This is actually a very complex, compelling story full of human pathos; it is unfortunate that modern media have turned Frankenstein's creature into a simple, heartless, mentally deficient monster for the sake of scares and laughs."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I got the free Kindle edition from the link on the page for the Norton Critical Edition of the 1818 text. Mary Shelley made many significant edits to the book for the 1831 edition. I assumed it was the same edition because the link was from the same page. I didn't realize it was different until I went to write my assigned essay and went online to search for page numbers for the passages I wanted to quote. Many of the quotes I wanted to use don't even appear in the original version. This is a very important distinction, and I wish it had been labeled correctly so I would not have had to waste so much time looking for online versions of the correct text in order to replace the quotes I could not use from the later version. This edition is fine if you just want to read the book, but if you're reading it for school, you have more than likely been assigned the 1818 version, which is very different. The Kindle edition is also lacking in any kind of Kindle formatting, making it a hassle to find locations in the book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I always avoided reading this book because it was one of those often assigned in high school - while I enjoyed some of the books we read, I am still scarred from the Red Badge of Courage and Tess of the D'Ubervilles. When I saw Frankenstein available free on the Kindle, I figured I may as well suck it up and give it a shot. I loved it! I found it a fairly quick read, though that may be because I couldn't put it down. I apologize to high school English teachers everywhere - I will have more trust in the future!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I bought this and wish I hadn't. I looked at the reviews and no one was specific about which version it was. I will tell you, this is NOT the 1818 version - don't bother wasting your money!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Most of us are familiar with the popular conception of Frankenstein's monster: a stiff, groaning, verdant creature with bolts, stitches, and Karloff-esque features. Fewer people are aware of Mary Shelley's original intent. The literary &quot;monster&quot; is vastly different to the irradicable Hollywood interpretation. He is lucid, well-spoken, limber, and (at first) ripe with loving and moral intentions.Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a tragedy, first and foremost. Sophocles would have been proud of young Mary, only in her early 20's when she wrote this tragic tale of carelessness and consequences. Victor Frankenstein's tragic flaw is his wild thirst for knowledge, which develops into recklessness and disregard for life. He becomes consumed with exposing the secret of creation, a &quot;forbidden&quot; knowledge (thus the novel's subtitle, &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot;). He discovers it and creates a living being, but is disgusted by the outcome and disowns his creation. Thus his original act of irresponsibility breeds another. He is ultimately condemned to pay for both.The monster (he is never given a name, a stigma of his rejection by human society) is tragically flawed as well. Born a naive with a good heart he is nevertheless hideously disfigured and monstrous. Although he yearns for human companionship, his appearance dooms him to bitter isolation. The agony of rejection ignites a hatred inside of him and he declares war on humanity. He focuses his rage on Victor, his accursed creator. But the monster is painfully lonely and thus willing to leave Victor in peace in exchange for a companion, one created from human scrap, just like him. I won't divulge any more of the plot; suffice it to say it just keeps getting better.&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is just as contemporary and significant now as it was back in the early 19th century when it was published. The grandiose themes that it addresses, such as morality in modern science, the meaning of humanity, racism, etc., are still ones that we struggle with today. But more importantly, this is a fascinating and entertaining novel! I raced through it like a Newfoundland towards water! I can't say that I was completely engrossed with every passage - there was an excedingly dull section when Victor retreats to the mountains, but it only lasts for 15 pages or so. And there is a pervasive (almost overwhelming) feeling of gloom and despair throughout the bulk of the novel, which may tend to irritate some readers. But these minor faults should not prevent interested parties from reading this novel. You're reading the review, you're interested, so buy it! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"When I came across this book I had to buy it. If you're a fan of classic horror, you'll love the story that inspired the movies. But if you're looking for a couple hundred pages of grunts, growls, and \\"fire bad...arrrrggghhh!\\" don't buy this book. It's a more intelligent read than that. I won't go into the story itself, most everyone around the world is familiar with the basic premise of the Frankenstein tale.The book itself is beautiful. If you want eye candy for your bookshelf, this would satisfy any literary sweet tooth. It's a leather bound book. How can you tell it's real leather and not simulated? You stick your nose close to the binding and sniff. If it smells like a brand new pair of Buster Browns it's leather. Along with the leather binding it has quality end pages, the page edges are gilded giving them a nice sheen when the book is closed, and like a good quality bound book it has a sewn in ribbon book mark.It's been printed in fairly large print on heavy stock paper and is easy to read, but as this work of fiction was penned almost 200 years ago the reading may be a little slow until you get used to the vernacular of the early 1800's. However, there are footnotes throughout the book that define and explain certain words and references that might confuse the modern reader.This is a true literary classic, no library should be considered complete without this title in the collection. This particular edition would be a beautiful addition to anyone's book collection."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Although I've never seen any of the Frankenstein movies, I was pretty sure that just growing up in the United States I had a pretty firm cultural grasp on the Frankenstein story. It turns out I was completely wrong; this story was very surprising to me!Victor Frankenstein, a scientist, always wanted to make a mark on the world. When he was given the opportunity to do some research and experiments on his own, he applied some information he'd read in some books and reanimated a corpse. Or, possibly, a collection of corpses sewn together. Frankenstein is never completely forthcoming on how his monster came to be.Once the reanimation is successful, though, Frankenstein finds himself confronted with a huge, ugly, fully alive monster. While Frankenstein has a nervous breakdown and is ill for months, the monster is set loose on the world.By the time Frankenstein recovers and tracks down his monster, the monster has developed a startling self-awareness. He hates himself and his creator, and demands that Frankenstein somehow make things right. Frankenstein isn't sure that he can or should give into the monster's demands, though.This book was much less a scary horror story, and more a story of psychology. We are invited to think about the reasons why Frankenstein would feel compelled to create this monster in the first place, and then to think about what should be done with a creature who is self-aware and so unhappy about his place in the world. What should Frankenstein's obligation be to this monster that he created?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is a true classic novel in every sense. You have the good vs. evil and the question of how far can science take us? I was drawn in straight away and could not stop reading this compelling story of Frankenstein and his creation of the monster who was so pituful and so horrible at the same time. A must, must read. I also recommendComplete Vampire Chronicles (Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the Damned, The Tale of the body Thief)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was completely taken by surprise to find the original Frankenstein was nothing like the classic Karloff movie. It is a wonderful read. The monster is articulate, he doesn't grunt, he carries on conversations with his creator, he is menacing, misunderstood, disfigured, but he is self taught and speaks better than a lot of educated people. Amazing. Shelley's description of the surroundings, and the long travels the monster makes, in pursuit of his prey, puts the reader there. It is as if the reader is silently a part of the narration and eavesdropping on the innermost secrets of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster. Shelley eases her storytelling from incredible events to heart wrenching emotions, to intellectual processing of the information, to a battle of evil versus good intention gone hopelessly awry. In the end, it is up the reader to sort through the mad rants of Dr. Frankenstein, and to decide just where sympathy lies, with the doctor, or his monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"What makes Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein most amazing isn't the intensity of the narrative, the breadth of the science (for the early 18th century) or the fullness of her characters, for this book has all of those elements. However, Shelley's understanding that the creation of a \\"spiritual\\" (read: with a soul) being without thought to its emotional or spiritual needs is possibly one of the most inhumane acts a human can make. In the case of this story, it is Dr. Frankenstein (surely not the crazy mad scientist portrayed in the movies) whose sole passion of creating life engulfs him in a mission that turns first to horror and eventually dread and utter despair.But this book really is not about Dr. Frankenstein, but the monster he creates. A monster created with a blank slate. One that could have easily been motivated by virtue rather than evil had his creator (or any other number of people) not ignored his basic spiritual needs of love and kindness. Once this monster understands that love cannot be given to him by humans, he makes one last plea to his creator to make another creature like him, so that he will have someone to love.Frankenstien's decision on whether to create a second monster and eventual unwillingness to consent to the request is the second point of concern for the novel. Could Dr. Frankenstein have averted the disaster that was to come? Would he have prevented personal disaster at the expense of a curse on humanity? These questions the reader is left to ponder, making this one of the greatest novels ever written.The book would not be considered \\"horror\\" in the 21st century with our special effects abilities to create gore and disgust. It would be put more into the category of psychological thriller ala the movie \\"Seven\\" where the details of the actual acts are left to your imagination and the reasons behind the acts are explored more in depth."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was lucky enough to be assigned this book in my Modern Europe class. It's a quick read, moving along at a nice pace, but not jam-packed with too much action. Instead, this horror novel is one that reaches the reader on a deeper level. Victor takes an emotional journey, from the happiness and security of his childhood, to his fevered and single-minded pursuit of the creation of life, to the horror and despair at the realization of what his dream will cost him. He is the consummate Romantic hero: tragic, boldly and blindly following his own ambition, and agonizing over the loss of his own soul.There was really only one thing that bothered me about this book. One is the fact that every time something tragic happens to Victor, he falls into a debilitating fever. I know that this sort of illness was a favorite of the Romantics, but after a while, it seemed formulaic. Other than that, the book is nearly perfect: tragic hero, sympathetic yet terrifying villain, beautiful and innocent heroine, and a landscape that is just as important to the story as Victor and his monster are. I would recommend this book to any fan of contemporary horror fiction, and also to any fan of Romantic fiction or poetry. Also, if you're going to watch one of the many film adaptations of this book, I suggest watching Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Robert De Niro plays the monster, and you can't get any better than that. Besides, it's the one movie that stays almost completely true to Mary Shelley's original story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This review is about the Heritage Press edition of Frankenstein, illustrated by Everett Henry.The first version of this book with the Henry illustrations was published in 1934, in a run of 1500 copies.

A pretty, pastel lavender on linen-finished cloth interwoven with white. Decorative pigment leaf elements designed by Henry appear on the cover and spine in an odd, saturated violet (including a creepy hand, and a building.)Responding to color is a personal thing.

All of the things that I associated with Frankenstein are creations of the movie alone. No Igor, no lightning striking the body, no grave-robbing (not directly referred to anyway), no mountain laboratory, no villagers attacking the castle to burn it to the ground. Just a young college student seized with a fever to see what he is capable of creating. What he creates is a monster so terrible to look upon, that he is disgusted and horrified and flees from it. The creature is not yet a monster and only wants to be loved and cared for by its creator. But as it is attacked and maligned purely on the basis of its horrific appearance, it becomes a monster and strikes out to destroy everything its creator loves. It's a real tragedy told almost entirely as a narrative without action. It was a tough read in spots, but well worth it. I'm a big classic horror movie fan, but after reading this and Dracula, I'm a bit appalled at how far they strayed from the original."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If you haven't seen gimmicky Frankenstein paraphanelia strewn about every grocery store in sight then you've been living under a rock. Nearly everyone living in the western world is familiar with this story, at least in a Halloween movie, lame costume sort of way. Yet behind the commercial gimmicks is a genuinely human and insightful story. Ever since I've read the book(and I've read it several times) Frankenstein has kept its spot one of my favorite books of all time.In case you've been living under a rock: a gifted Swiss doctor named Victor Frankenstein creates a creature from corpses, hoping to prove that he can give life to dead matter. He succeeds in giving it the spark of life but is horrified when the thing(which is never named), awakes and reaches out for him like a child reaching out for its father. Frankenstein abandons the creature and flees, leaving the creature to its own devices. The resulting storyline follows the creature's desire for revenge on his creator, and Frankenstein's attempts to atone for what he's done. The creature, ridiculed for its horrific appearance, exacts revenge by slowly murdering those that Frankenstein holds dear.I started Frankenstein expecting a difficult read and was surprised by the ease of the passages. For a book written almost two hundred years ago this book is surprisingly easy to understand for the modern reader. Like Dumas's writing, the focus is on the admittedly awesome story, not the intricacies of the writing itself(though these are definitely there, they flow into your mind at an almost subconscious level).The sheer breadth of the issues it brings up merit reading it. Issues surrounding human hubris, the role of man as creator, and the appropriateness of man using science to play as God. That's only a short list. But thought-provoking themes aside, this is a good book. The strength of Shelley's prose lies in her characterization of the monster; though you see the havoc it wreaks, you cannot help but feel a sort of aching pity for the thing. She presents the struggle between Frankenstein and his creation as a genuine moral dilemma, handling each side with genuine sympathy. If you get this book, I hope you'll like it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Every time Frankenstein is mentioned, I'd always picture the huge green guy in the movies. When my brother-in-law introduced and encouraged me to read the book, I thought that it wasn't going to be worth the time after I saw the poorly done movies. My brother-in-law said it was one of the best books he's ever read. I told him that I'll try to find the time to read it. It has been six years and I've never touched the book. One day when I was assigned to read a pleasure book for my English class, I randomly chose whichever book that was lying around my apartment. The book was Frankenstein and I'll say that I'm glad I picked it up.The first thing that caused me to be sucked into Mary Shelley's novel is the style of writing. Frankenstein's narrative is in first person point of view. In the first part of Frankenstein, Walton, the ship captain who rescued Frankenstein, was the speaker. The narrator shifted to Frankenstein who told for the rest of the story. In other words, it was like telling a story in the story which Shelley did a great job at. In addition, I was amazed by the author's choice of words. Her vocabulary is fairly high which caused me to search in my dictionary every now and then.The greatest part about Frankenstein is the depth and analysis of the monster which Frankenstein created. Victor Frankenstein discovered the science to infuse life onto the unanimated and thus created the monster. The monster is powerful in strength and huge in size but his mind is that of a newborn. Abandoned by his own creator, the monster learned about his surroundings by himself. He learned the seasons and how to create fire. All this was done by observation. Also by observation, he noticed love and companionship are essential for life. But it was men who taught him to revenge and evil.Frankenstein an awesome book and I recommend it to anyone.

This book is nothing like what you've likely conjured in your mind from various sources over the years.

The captain eventually convinces the doctor to share his story, which becomes the novel. The monster is beautifully written, truly heartbreaking. In the interest of full disclosure, I was immediately drawn into the myriad Paradise Lost references, since that is one of my all-time favorites.I recommend this for fans of Gothic horror novels or those just curious to check out the first one.

Really, what's the point? This book is historic and mandatory reading for many high schools and a true insight into the European era it was written (1818). Language, thoughts, opinions, attitudes, social classes, locations - it's all there. It's like a time machine and that aspect of the book is fasinating. Then there's the classic elements...This is true gothic horror. It's not blood and guts and \\"shoot'em up\\" that is all too necessary to hold an audiences' attention in today's world. \\"Frankenstein\\" is psychological terror in the same vein as \\"what's hiding around the corner.\\" We follow Victor's inner thoughts and paranoia as he sinks deeper and deeper into depression, fear and finally resolve that he must kill the monster he created or die trying.As someone who was an avid reader in high school - but not the mandatory assignments, (my personal classics are more modern works) - it is quite a few years after my graduation. I picked up \\"Frankenstein\\" because it is my son's mandatory summer reader. Once I started, I couldn't put it down.But again - reviewing a classic? Okay - some may find this a lame excuse, but I only rated it 4 out of 5 stars because of my upbringing in the modern \\"shoot'em up\\" world. The meanings were all there for me - man vs God, man vs woman, etc... But there were too many coincidences within the story that made me shake my head in disbelief. Europe is a continent and not someone's neighborhood where even then it would be difficult to find someone hiding from you. But if you can shut down your reasoning and throw disbelief to the howling wind, \\"Frankenstein\\" has the fear factor to keep you awake and wondering at night who or what could be lurking around your neighborhood.One final note: For any high schooler thinking about skipping this mandatory reading assignment and watching the movie instead, just plan on testing for a GED after you wise up. The Boris Karloff version sticks to the book about as closely as the Abbott and Costello film. In fact, check out Gene Wilder in \\"Young Frankenstein\\" and write your report on that one.

Thus, most people confuse the fact that Frankenstein isn't the name of the monster, but rather the man who created the monster. This story is the perfect example of a horror story and thriller while having a hint of a love theme. Mary Shelley has an excellent story attributed to her name. The reader will quickly fall in love with Frankenstein and his monster if they truly understand the situations they must endure and conquer. Frankenstein is a classic that should be read by anyone who hasn't already.Zachary B.

Frankenstein was the first book, and I think it was an interesting way to start this kind of challenge.

Great book! Can't get over it, Many Thanks for the Publishers for bringing back this timeless classic. 5 stars all the way."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is a beautiful hardbound edition of a true and timeless classic of Western Literature. A story with great depth, it can be read on several levels: as a tale of horror bred by science, or, at a deeper symbolic level, as an indictment of God the Creator for his abandonment of the Human Race. What is the nature of consciousness, of self-awareness or of life itself? What is the Soul? Does it even exist? What is the Knowledge of Right and Wrong? These are all questions addressed, either directly or obliquely, in the text. I differ with the publisher only in its selection of the dust jacket illustration (bid deal, right?). This is a novel which must be read in the context of its time, the very early 19th century and the dawn of modern science (generation and application of electricity). The dust jacket illustration might lead a reader to assume a much later time. Also, contrary to the impression left by the picture, the story is not about goofy anatomical mistakes. It's not comical, and it's not a farce. The Creature does not have his \\"head on backwards\\" - in any sense of the word. He is born an outcast and learns to hate a Society which hates him merely on sight alone. I made a present of this volume to my niece, a high school student aspiring to a career in fiction, but I judiciously removed the absurd dust jacket before sending it. Great reasons for purchasing this edition are the inclusion of a scholarly introduction, along with a detailed chronology of the author's life bringing attention to other achievements in the literature of the time juxtaposed with contemporaneous world and political events. Burn the dust cover but buy the book. No one's perfect."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I am on a quest to read classic literature. Frankenstein wasn't at the top of my list, or even near the top probably, but my best friend continued to encourage me to read it as it is one of her very favorite books.Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus (Penguin Classics)This classic book has inspired no fewer than fifty films. It definitely has a firm place in classic literature and in culture. I had no idea that Mary Shelley was the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. They married when she was age 18/19 years old, in 1816. It was upon a dare, by Lord Byron, to write a ghost story, that Mary Shelley wrote the novel. I like that she didnt just write a \\"ghost story\\" and developed a plot-line like no other before.The review I am in the midst of writing, here, is going to be a mixed bag. I must say that I was quite surprised that the story was written in such a way that it was not difficult for me to finish; not a drudgery as I read it. I somehow felt compelled to read it. I suppose I would say that her writing style is very agreeable. The story is written in the form of a person retelling the story he has been told, in letter form, to a far-off loved one. Writing a story in this manner required an additional back-story. Shelley gave this story the same attention to depth as she gave the main one. I like that; so many of today's authors just do not write in this manner.Overall, however, I do have issues with the story. The premise of the story is that Dr. Victor Frankenstein is on a quest to create life. I think that in order to indulge the story one must suspend reality and choose to believe that man can create life, even in the late 1700s. Done. I do, however take great issue with the fact that in the story Dr. Frankenstein has finally succeeded in creating life when, all of a sudden, he looks at the creature he has created and, aghast, decides he has created something too hideous to allow it to be. Does he destroy it though? Nope; that would end the story. He allows it to remain \\"alive\\" and falls asleep. This of course, comes back to haunt him. The monster leaves, unhindered.Frankenstein learns language and the ability to read through watching a small family without their knowledge. I enjoyed this part of the story. He views them with great longing. His only wish is for communion. Human communtion? Why, he isn't human. But at the very least, human communion would provide him with some form of relationship, his deepest desire. Even his own creator chose not to commune with him. One of the characters from this portion of the book is blind and that gives the \\"monster\\" an opprotunity to speak with him, hoping that he can gain favor with him and then with the rest of his family. This character quickly recognizes the \\"monster's\\" true circumstances and it is summed up well in his words here:\\"Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.\\" Pg 91The next part of the story with which I take issue is that Frankenstein sets off on a long trek and somehow ends up in Geneva and on the property of the Frankensteins without any stated assistance in finding it. That's a bit neat, isn't it? Pretty unbelieavable; there again, it allows for the progression of the story.When the \\"monster\\" finally has an opportunity to speak with Frankenstein he says this:\\"God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image' but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am slitary and abhorred.\\" Pg 88He pleads with Frankenstein to create a female for him, one as equally hideous as he, as a mate with whom he can share love and life. He wants only to be accepted and have a person whom he can accept. Love...isn't that the desire of all people? And wasn't he created in the image of humanity? He offers that they will go live in the farthest reaches of the north where they will bother and be bothered by no one.\\"It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.\\" Ppg 98\\"Let me see that I excite the of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!\\" Pg 99Frankenstein's monster is so adamant of his need for a mate that he threatens to take vengeance upon Frankenstein if he does not concede to his request/demand. At once Frankenstein agrees that he will create a mate for him; the story progresses a bit, and, voila, Frankenstein rethinks his impulsive decision and determines he will not create another being. Queue the scary music. The monster vowed vengeance if a mate is not created for him; he followed him from Ingolstadt to Geneva; can engeance not be imagined by Frankenstein at this point?Vengeance...it arrives. There is death, and more death. Eventually, Frankenstein ends up chasing the monster to far reaches of the north. Did I say \\"vengeance\\". It doesn't take a lot to figure out what happens next does it?It's easy for me to pick away at the threads of a story. I am not a writer, am I? And so, I feel it would be unfair for me to do so without also finding praise where it is worthy. As I said, the story was compellingly written. I did not avoid or put off reading it once I began. I am glad I read it.And the premise...the creation of life by man. What a premise! It is one that only has greater implications today; perhaps moreso than Shelley could have ever even imagined. She wrote this stunningly well for it to have been written in the early 1800s.What if man could create life? Just because one can do something it does not mean it is something that should be done. Truly, I only believe that God can create life, eternal life, life with a soul. Science has been used by man, to do many things that have direct connections to life. Transplants are just one of those things; there is also research in the lab, on the cellular level. Scary stuff. Yes, the result of some of these things can be great good; it can also be great devastation, as this novel, in great foresight, warns.My husband and I had an interesting conversation with regard to all of this. Frankenstein initially was only sorry he created the \\"monster\\" because of its hideousness. Really? Isn't that fantastic?! He was sorry he created something so ugly! That begs the question that my husband raised: \\"If you could create aesthetically pleasing, beautiful life, would it then be okay to do so?\\" I hardly think so. And that is wherein lies much of the inherent beauty of this novel; it causes great thought.Some of my favorite lines from the book are:\\"A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a tranistory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not be enslaed, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\\" Pg 32\\"Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.\\" Pg 133It's only been days since I finished reading the novel. While it was still very fresh in my mind I wished to watch a well acclaimed movie version of it. I watched 1994's release \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" starring: Robert DeNiro, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hulce, Helena Bonham Carter. A bit of artistic license was taken with the story but not so much that the essence of the story was changed. In fact, I feel that it played out quite well. I was afriad it would be way too gory for me. It had its moments but I think it was handled well given the subject and necessity of including a certain amount of gore. The cultural significance of Frankenstein does not end with the questions it brings up. Immediately after watching the film our children and I were turned on an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show and who was mentioned? Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book was the forerunner and the predecessor of the moder sci-fi novel.

Driven by an insatiable desire to bring back the spark of life, he is disgusted and repulsed by his final creation and casts the creature out. This hideous being, denied even the smallest show of kindness or love, pleads with his creator for a symbol of compassion.

The reader of the audiobook is quite good and very dramatic. There is never a dull moment. The reader captures very well the emotional nuances of all the characters, from the beast's feelings of loneliness, isolation, rejection and resulting bitterness and anger to the revulsion of those who meet him to the creator's fear of his own creation, thirst for revenege and eventual finding of permanent peace. All and all an excellent well told story that will never bore and keeps the reader enthralled through its approximately three hour length.

Overall this was a good book that would have been better with a more experienced author and less complicated writing."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. The only thing I didn't like is how she made the book third person (its really told by the sailor Robert Walton, and not Victor Frankenstein, which people seem to misunderstand.) Besides that, the book is very well paced, and I found it very easy to understand. For you readers out there who said they had diffuculty in understanding the book you should pick up Cliff Notes or go to sparknotes.com to help you aid your understanding of this book, instead of declaring its &quot;garbage&quot; because you have failed to understand this brilliant womans messsage. Anyways the book is about how the monster represents a modern Adam and how mankind in general faces the dilemma of how to cope with our existence. This book left me heart-broken and in tears at the end. I felt horribly sorry for the monster who was more human this his juvenile and ignorant (yes, despite all the masters brilliance, he was ignorant) creator Victor Frankenstein. Definitely read this, the book is exquisite :)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelly's Frankenstien was not at all what I expected it to be. The book is plagued with so much emotion. Throughout the book there is neglect, the desire to belong and be accepted, revenge, and consiquences. The story of the monster's experiences himself almost bring a tear to your eyes. You discover that all the monster ever wanted was to be loved and accepted. To summarize the book briefly would do it injustice; the entire book from begining to end offers so much to be learned."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A great story about Frankenstein!I found it very interesting and easy to understand. It kept my interest and I felt compassion for Frankenstein. He did not asked to be created by Victor, but Victor wanted to come up with a new creation to man-kind. Then after Victor created this monster, he finally realized that it was a very bad mistake. &quot;That is what got me hooked&quot; Frankenstein was not known or understood by the villagers and the mean things they did to him was only because of the way he looked. This books makes you think about several things; one being don't creat something without putting a lot of thought into it, becuase it could seriously back fire on you and the pain you can bring to others as well as your self. And last don't judge someone by the way they look, because even Frankenstein had a heart that felt pain, anger, humility and sadness. Thank you.

How amazing, unfair and so different from today that a woman so young could undergo so much heartbreak. For me it is essential to know the context the author was living in so as to appreciate the book. She lost her mother, three children, a husband and she herself only lived to fifty-three. It must have been easy for her to imagine Frankenstein's suffering when the Creature took his loved ones. Geneva is a spooky place in Winter with all those &quot;angoissants&quot; mountains.

This book is uneven, boring, wordy, and Mary Shelley is unable to express simple emotions like sorrow and pain in words. While this novel is generally thought-provoking, it could have been much, much better. Although it may have been a breakthrough at the time, today it simply fades into the background."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"In &quot;Frankenstein&quot; Mary Shelly has created not only one of the most enduring of Gothic stories, but also a uniquely feminine tale of the horror of childbirth and its attendent responsibilities.While the later film versions of the story have tended to couch the telling of this story in terms of scientific over-reaching and the hubris of man who aspires to the powers of God, the original novel actually contains very little of this theme, with the famous creation scene actually occuring in one terse paragraph. There are no spark shedding electrodes or arcing bolts of electricity in Shelly's original story, only the birth of the creature, and Frankenstein's rejection of his monsterous offspring.It's hard to read &quot;Frankenstein&quot; without recognizing it's author as a young woman who had suffered at least one miscarriage. The entire work, although written from a masculine perspective, and set in a world of masculine domination, consistently deals with themes of parental abandonment and responsibiltity. The sin of Frankenstein in Shelly's original work is not his aspiration to godlike power over life and death, but his refusal to regard his artifical progeny with the nurturing and unconditional love any parent owes to his or her child.For fans both of later cinematic retellings of this story, as well as fans of the Gothic novel and those interested in reading a true nightmare myth of feminine construction, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a true classic that cannot be reccommended highly enough."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Another school assignment. I can't see why they bother. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a passable book: it has a plot; it has characters which aren't quite engaging as a whole, but some of them manage well enough. The thing is, there isn't much to find in this novel besides story. However, there's some. The real horror is not the monster, but the failings of humankind, and to a lesser extent the price science exacts upon nature, and ultimately the price nature exacts upon the idiots who went too far.Victor Frankenstein is such an idiot. A little too passionate (a little too like Mary Shelley's husband Percy Bysshe Shelley), he isolates himself from the people that love him, obsesses over chemistry and natural philosophy, and creates a monster from scraps of bodies recovered from charnel houses. Victor's philophobic. He ends up, one way or another, killing those that love him; because he cannot give his own creation the love and kindness it needs. Here is where Mary Shelley succeeds: she makes it clear all the while that he is a human; and because the story is narrated by him you get some sort of a glimpse into the way he was thinking. And he didn't think too differently from the average person you might meet on the street. That's scary.However, the characters are so dull that I didn't care when they were killed. Shelley does things so amazingly lame: oh no! he/she's dead, Victor laments, Victor doesn't get sense knocked into him. Count the deaths. Then look over what you've read. You will realize you saw each of them coming. And not just because you've heard a lot about this book in the first place.Yes, there's a lot of the author in here. And there's even some of her husband, the infamous Percy. The appearance of the word &quot;endeavor&quot; every other page was, I think, part of his attempt to make &quot;Frankenstein&quot; more worthy of the Romantics of the time. It was written by his 19 year old wife, whose vocabulary was apparently not so extensive as his own, so he looked on it as his duty to poke around with the manuscript. Oh, if only he'd buggered off!Teachers stumbling upon this review: please, please, make your students read stuff like &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (a building block of Mary Shelley's and mentioned in the novel) by John Milton, much more interesting stuff. Slap before them a summary of this novel. They'll get it. Allow them to read this thing on their own time if ever they so wish. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was praised by Sir Walter Scott: how &quot;deep&quot; can it be?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a typical novel from the romantic period. The story is based on the conflict of a scientist with the results of his work. But Frankenstein is far more than that: It is the story of two individuals (Frankenstein and his &quot;monster&quot;) and their acceptance and behavior in society, and of course, the novel contains a lot of latent psychological information (what would Freud have said about that?). However, it is typical for the age of romanticism that the feelings and thoughts of the individuum are at the center of the plot (see e.g. the works by Byron or by the German authors Eichendorff and Novalis). This holds as well for the music composed during that time (Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, ...). Mary Shelley describes in great detail the innermost feelings of Frankenstein and his &quot;wretch&quot; and how they changed from one minute to the other, and what made them change their moods, and why and how, and who was around etc. This actually - because presented through the entire book - makes the reading of the highly interesting story rather tedious. Story: 5 stars, Fun: 1 star"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Yes, since the story was written a while ago, the language and slowness do tend to become tiresome at times. However, the actual meaning of the story is quite important (especially because of who wrote it and when SHE wrote it.)

If you can get past the idea that this book is about alienation from God (the product of sick minds that are into the perverted psychobabble) this is a good story that could be viewed as a warning against technology, and also as a warning against people rejecting others on the basis of appearance. I personally liked the way it was written; it was a bit wordy, but I like big vocabularies. It is fairly short and generates a moderate atmosphere of suspense, but don't expect edge-of-your-seat excitement and vivid accounts of mayhem and death. It is a clean, dignified book, which is just the way I like it.

Just to explain what the product isn't: it isn't a book on tape. What it is: is a dramatization of the story with many different voice acters, sound effects and original music. The story is brought to life through the characters and the action. What you don't get is some English guy reading to you out of the book.Remember, this is an adaption, which means the story is presented in a media other than the original novel. Some changes, of course, had to be made. With Frankenstein, there were a couple unique problems. One is, the book does not tell the reader how the monster was created, which I believe is important in a dramatization. You will find in my adaption the science behind the miracle of re-animation. Secondly, Victor Frankenstein created the monster much in seclusion without other characters around with whom to communicate. The novel uses long passages and chapters of exposition to deliver this information to the reader. In my adaption, I've had to expand a minor character, Professor Waldman, to provide dramatization, suspense and rising conflict. Likewise, in the novel, the monster learns language by hiding in a wood shed adjoined to a house where he observes its occupants for many weeks. This information is skirted over very quickly in my adaption because the emphasis is--as it should be--on the relationship between Victor Frankenstein and his monster.

The story's plot united three exciting elements: horror, action, and romance. Mary Shelly did a spectacular job on this one. This novel kept the reading light on all night and into the early hours of the morning. I was pleased to find excitement on every page. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story, but has patience. I mean you must get through the beginning of the book to get to the interesting parts. Trust me it's worth it. Doctor Frankenstein actually created an artificial life form in a laboratory. We someday might be able to do this. The question this book made me think of is what would happen? Frankenstein created a thing that was supposed to be so good, but turned out to be so bad. This book was a real thriller."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. It is the most brilliantly written and smart book which exposes the state of human nature as well as any work of fiction. Human nature has the inherent need to feel love and belongingness and Mary Shelly is able to recognize this at age 18. BRILLIANT."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

The author knows alot about the state of human nature, the eternal yearning to belong, and she masterfully puts this idea to life in Frankenstein. Very well written and engrossing plot."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A classic thriller written by Mary Shelley and heartbreaking terrifying story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I adored Mary Shelley's portrayal of the characters. Victor Frankenstein is a genius with great compassion for humans yet he is also mankind's worst enemy for creating a monster who can destroy them. He is both the villian and the hero, an aspect that is rarely seen. The monster is shrouded by mystery and pain. Being the embodiment of sorrow and human sufferring, he is an amazing symbol of human nature. Mary Shelley captures every emotion felt by her characters so accurately that you can feel the moster's anger and taste Frankenstein's revenge. This is a tremendous novel that reaches out to the reader in an infinite amount of ways. Shelley's use of characters is merely a scratch on surface of the depth and skill in which her themes are written in. A must read for anyone who appreciates fine literature."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"as i was reading this book, i noticed that in some places the words just never seemed to end. The story line was very interesting. i read this book because i had seen the movie and my teacher said it was gothic. the way some things were described really blew me away in a sense that i would have never thought of things like that before. really good book, yet the ending was kind of a drop off."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It's been almost 30 years since I've detested a book this much. I didn't think anything could be worse then Kafka's \\"The Metamorphosis\\". Seems I'm never too old to be wrong. This time, I don't have the excuse that I was forced to read this for high school lit. class. Oh no, this time I read this of my own volition and for fun. Yeah, fun. Kinda like sticking bamboo shoots between my fingernails type of fun. Watching paint dry fun. Going to an Air Supply concert fun.OK, to be fair, I need to tell you what I liked about this....Well, Mary Shelley was a teen when she wrote this. Color me impressed. At 19 I was just looking for my next college boyfriend, not penning the great English classic. Kudos to Mary for that.Otherwise, I can't think of anything to admire in this book, apart from the fact that it's the only book in my reading history where I actually noted EVERY SINGLE PAGE NUMBER and mentally counted down the time I'd be finished.Why did I persist, you may ask? Well, at the point where the pain became mind numbing, I decided to channel my inner John McCain and just survive the torture. Figured it would make me a better, stronger reader. Might even make me enjoy a re-read of Breaking Dawn....(well, no it wouldn't, but you get the idea).Frankenstein is a classic alright. A classic melodrama. Complete with a wimpy, vaporish, trembling prima donna main character and a pseudo monster whose only sin is being uglier then Bernie Madoff in cell block D. After the upteenth tremble/jerk/gasp/faint/start from our mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, I could only sign in relief that he wasn't a Rabbi about to perform a bris circumcism - oy vey!Were we supposed to be outraged at the monster's killing spree? By the books end, I was merely miffed that the creature murdered the wrong Frankenstein sibling. He would have saved himself a good deal of traveling (and saved me a good deal of suffering) had he snuffed out his \\"maker\\" before he could high-tail it out of the \\"birthing room\\".I'm sure that the fans of this book will say that I didn't understand the deeper, symbolic nuances of this book, and I'm sure that they are right. At this point in my life, all I know is what I like and don't like in a book, and as far as I'm concerned, this book is unadulterated, mind-numbing crap. But that's just me. Your mileage will vary!In conclusion, despite what I've written, I am glad I read this. I've been looking for a better punishment for my 14-soon-to-be-15 year old, and now I can easily say, when she gets sassy and goes all teenage-postal, that she is grounded for a week AND must read and write a report on Shelley's Frankenstein.....that ought to keep her on the straight and narrow until she leaves for college!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is one book that you shouldn't even spend the light of day to even read. The reason towards this is because it was dull boring and put me to sleep. I had to read this for school and didn't think the beginng was so bad but then I hit the bad spot it was the worse thing I ever read. It has its good points but few of them. Just don't waste your time on this."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I saw this book on here so I decided to get it. BIG MISTAKE! After reading the first 5 chapters I couldn't go on. The story, well how do I put this is...BORING! There are too many words which people wouldn't use in their everyday language, which was hard for me to understand. Also the plot was very slow and tiresome. I do not recommend this book to anyone. But if you haven't slept for a while this is a book that will put you to sleep after the first chapter."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Great god! This novel is written so poorly, ssslllooowww, plodding, dry, dragging, flowery chapters. For those of you who are searching for a novel rich in literary content, bristling with metaphor and imagery, and full of gripping suspense, you've come to the WRONG place. This novel possesses none of these. Take it from me, a seasoned man of literature. If you're searching for strong philosphical ideas, on the other hand, you may have yourself a match! You'll have to possess superhuman patience and the inner desire to remain awake, however......."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The big monster with bolts sticking out of his neck, little vocabulary, frightening everybody in his path. He is brought to life in a spooky laboratory with lightning flashing and the mad scientist hovering over him with the joy of accomplishment. This is what we think of when we hear the name Frankenstein. I would like to tell you the book was this exiting, but I can't. The first problem with this story was it's very slow pace. You find yourself looking ahead to see if any action or \\"horror\\" (since it is called a \\"horror story\\") is coming up. And why do they call it a \\"horror story\\"? The most horrific scenes in the book are when the monster kills somebody, and you could always see them coming from a mile away. One more reason I believe this book is worthy of a low rating is the unbelievable nature of the story. I know that it's a fictional story, but at least make the characters act somewhat realistic. For example, when Victor leaves his wife alone in bed on their honeymoon, it never even crosses his mind that the monster might kill her. Or the fact the monster has super human strength, speed, and quickness. How does a gathering of dead limbs and organs produce super human strength?I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 40. It's pace is way too slow for the modern worlds fast pace and it leaves you wondering, \\"Why didn't I just watch the movie\\"."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"if you want to read this book, you will need knowledge of five words; reverence, countenence; ardour; odious; benevolence. sure, there are good points to be made in this book. Like, nature being all theraputic and how man can alienate himself from man. The abscure way that mary shelley brings these points across to the reader, is repetitive and inane. This book could easily be 50 pages long, it would be a great read on the crapper, but since it is not 50 pages, just read the cliffs notes, otherwise youre wasting your time. This book is totally sketch."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley wrote this book when she was 18 and it really shows. This was the one of the worst books I have ever read, seriously I would rather read the berstein bears. Mary Shelley uses a lot of fancy words and complicated sentence stucture but the book really doesn't say anything. There is no underlying message, it seems that she creates scenes to move her plot along, for instance the monster must learn how to talk and read so he camps out in someones shed and observes them for months without detection, it just so happens that there is a foreign woman at t the house learning how to speak French. What a coincidence. The plot is not justified, Victor hates the monster because .... I don't know he isn't the evil spawn of satan or anything, and then there is the monster drove to kill because he was lonely? Come on now. Shelley tries to reach emotional climaxes and moving passages but she didn't have anything to say. The book was boring, it had a bland and combined a very vague writing style full of tautology with not much content, and a &quot;sissy&quot; plot, not at all scary or even plausible"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Happily for movie-goers, Frankenstein movies resemble this book only slightly. The pathos (for the movie and the book) is launched when Victor Frankenstein, a young college student, creates a live monster from \\"dead parts.\\" However, I was surprised to find that Mary Shelley's novel provides no hint of how Victor, after much unexplained experimentation, \\"creates life\\" and animates a collection of bones and other unspecified ingredients. Further, she fails to explain how the monster is able to quickly and easily become a fluent speaker, reader, and writer with no instruction. She asks us to accept that the monster, at 8 feet tall, moves undetected, through much of Europe, for years. The plot is so obviously contrived that the novel fails the most basic test of fiction. Shelley did not move me to suspend disbelief.Furthermore, all of her characters speak in the same voice. Parents, children, Victor, the monster, and the narrator/ship captain all sound the same.Unfortunately, we are reminded repeatedly that Victor is very, very, very tortured and that the monster is very, very, very hideous and evil.I am sure that in her era, Shelly's style was more accepted, even expected. The overwrought melodrama, the endless agony, and illness and death resulting from torturous melancholia are all Victorian hallmarks. However, her failures as a writer of fiction made this a difficult, unrewarding read for me. I allow 3 stars for the dynasty of horror and comedic films that arose from her kernel of a good tale."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I knew little of the story when I picked up this book. In fact, I was one of those people who thought the monster's name was Frankenstein. Whoops... Anyways, I found that the narrative structure of the book to be distracting, the stereotypical characters annoying, and the monster actually coming alive (taking place in less than a paragraph) to be a let down."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was forced into reading this for my senior AP humanities class over the summer. I began about three weeks before school started, and it took me a week to get though, despite being a relatively short book. I literally almost fell asleep every ten pages. Mary Shelley almost as much in need of a good editor as friggin' Frank Norris with his stupid novel McTeague. She spend eons talking about how lovely the mountains are, then spends around five seconds explaining the birth of The Monster. This tendancy to skip over the exciting parts as though they were unimportant may have been intentional (that's what my humanites teacher tells me) but it still bored me. Also, I don't really care what the mountains looked like. Victor Frankenstein whines his way through the entire novel, which is really irritating because everything that happens to him is his own fault. When it comes to the development of The Monster, Mary Shelley seems to think that somehow, magically, The Monster knows way too much. Too many convient things happen. For example, he just happens to hang out behind a hut housing several very nice peasants, and they never notice? Yeah, right. Also, he just happens to find three very important and significant texts that have striking parallels to his own situation? Again, yeah right. It reached the point of ludicrocity. I sincerley did not enjoy this book, and though I know that it may partially be Percy Shelley's fault (evidently, he was her editor), and I know that Mary Shelley had many miscarriages and children's deaths and this book is about that and blah blah blah, I will never enjoy it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I chose the title of my review especially for those who are interested in the background of stories and the way things eventually turned out. We have trilogies and trilogies of trilogies (\\"Star Wars'), prequels and sequels galore.In this work Mary Shelley set out a great deal of exposition about Frankenstein, his family, his friends, his passions and obsessions. Some of the relationships revealed may seem strange to the modern reader -- it is not much of a spoiler, set out early in the novel, to tell you that Victor Frankenstein's long intended bride, Elizabeth, was brought up virtually as his sister; the suggestion of constructive incest even being mentioned in the course of the book.It is a very long time before we see the \\"monster,\\" but once he appears we learn his life from his creation, his feelings, his sorrows, his opinions, his hopes and dreams, all in his own words, which are mostly lost on his creator. In the end, in fact, the monster delivers a touching soliloquy, appropriate to the feeling of tragedy that pervades the story, and we're left to wonder whose tragedy it was, Victor's or his creation's.I found Mary Shelley's Frankenstein startling in the extent to which it differed both from the movies and the popular conceptions of the story. The differences go way beyond what we usually expect from turning a novel into a movie. Tod Browning took a number of liberties with Dracula, but re-reading the original doesn't cause one to feel he is reading a different story.Frankenstein is a morality tale, and the sinner throughout is Frankenstein first and his creation second. It could be called a study of what happens when someone is driven to follow his passion (to create life) and then to reject it as soon as the desire is fulfilled. The creation (I hesitate to say \\"monster,\\" though the creature self-describes himself that way) is brought into a world not knowing who he is, what he is or, importantly, why he is. He wants to be loved, or at least accepted, and is rejected top to bottom, first of all by his creator. He is intelligent and moral, and asks only another of his kind (his \\"bride\\") and he will leave Frankenstein and the human world in peace. Unfortunately Frankenstein has all the complex moral qualms after his creation lives that were completely overlooked beforehand.The creature could almost approach total sympathy if not for his unfortunate habit of murdering completely innocent people because of his anger at Frankenstein.There is a modern spin that can be placed on the story; comparing this or that scientific manipulation of life has long been compared to Frankenstein's work. Perhaps the problem is that the concept of treating life as a commodity, as Frankenstein clearly did, no longer shocks as much as it used to."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I think like almost every American kid, I grew up \\"Frankenstein\\" on the movie screen. And I think I've seen them all: Boris Karloff, the silent version, \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" \\"Bride of Frankenstein,\\" \\"Frankenstein vs The Mummy,\\" etc. I really thought I knew this story - the monster and the creator.Turns out, I didn't know anything. Mary Shelley was very young woman when she wrote this piece, and her immaturity in writing does reflect within the pages. More on that later. This novel is important, as it ushered in a genre never before experienced: science fiction. Although this genre would become more advanced and developed, this novel broke ground, so to speak. What is unfortunate is Mary Shelley had a concept (such as re-animating a corpse), but didn't have the knowledge or understanding of how those concepts might be realized, so there are gaps. For example, the reader goes from A to C and is never truly given an explanation for B.However, that's where imagination comes in, and the greater part of the story is not how certain concepts are realized, but a much larger moral issue. The question is: if humans have the capacity to defy the laws nature and play creator, should humans take on that role or should there be a code of morality to be considered? I do think this moral issue is also addressed in the movies I've seen, but not to such a large degree as it is in the book.The variances between the book and the movies are astounding. If you've seen the myriad movies made of \\"Frankenstein,\\" and believe you know the story, think again. The movie is really nothing like the book. The book offers so much more understanding of the \\"monster\\" - what he thinks, what he feels, and why he does what he does.The writing style is a bit obtuse and outdated, but then, this was written during the gothic period. Also, Mary Shelley was quite young, and was not as seasoned a writer and it shows. Still, the novel is short and fairly easy to read, and the character and personality Mrs. Shelley gives the \\"monster\\" is well worth it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It is most unfortunate that this was the height of frightening literature then.By todays standards however it would be considered laughable.Older folks can still appreciate the beautiful way Shelley wrote her masterpiece.The use of language and the victorian way of speaking is quite charming and took some time to get used to.I should have read it years ago but only got to it recently.I felt I had to and was glad I did. Of course when one does actually read it one finds nothing of what Hollywood turned it into and now I know why. Deep down it is a story not of horror, even though one can feel the distant and at times rather close sense of dread the monster instills in Dr. Frankenstein but moreover it is a story of love.All this creation wanted was to love and be loved,to trust and be trusted, to live some semblance of a normal life. Alas, his horrific countenance proved his undoing,repulsive to all and even to himself. His want for normalcy,his ability to educate himself and to think in terms of future goals yet was forced into murder to obtain it is a lesson to be learned by all.I fear that with the exception of english majors and the literary curious, books like these are destined for extinction.What typical kid today would want to read it and if begun would finish it without going to cliff notes. This novel must be read cover to cover to be properly understood.It is and will always be a classic.I enjoyed it and highly encourage others to read it too especially the younger generation who might dismiss it after a few pages but should stick it out. They just don't write them like this anymore.I know there are other editions out there with more to offer the Frankenstein expert but this edition was just fine by me.Plus it begins and ends in the deep, dark,frozen wastes of the Arctic which was also a plus for a guy who digs the polar regions as much as I do."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I am an ardent cynic when it comes to \\"classics.\\" I think many people will read a book or hear a song, and if it is old, they will call it a classic. Then this \\"classic,\\" whether it is good or not, must be respected because of its age. I feel this way about the pioneers of Rock, who all made horrible music, but paved the way for good modern Rock and Metal. I feel this way about old movies, which were all terrible, but paved the way for today's movies. And I certainly felt that way about Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was a painfully boring and pointless book. Classics, in my opinion, must stand on their own in modern times. If have to start make excuses for a book, as if it is a senior citizen crapping the bed, it isn't a classic. It's crap. Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, is a book worthy of this label, \\"classic.\\" Before reading further: SPOILER ALERT! There aren't any twists which I'm going to reveal, but SPOILER ALERT nonetheless. The book is told in three tiers. First is present day (for when the book was written) on a vessel in the arctic. A man writes to his sister while on a years-long journey of discovery. He stumbles upon Victor Frankenstein, a gaunt, emaciated and emotionally destroyed man, whose fatigue should have killed him. The second tier is told through Victor Frankenstein's story of his misfortune, beginning with his wonderful childhood, continuing with his creation of the Monster, and ending with his chase of the Monster in the Arctic. Within Frankenstein's story, the third and most revealing tier of the story is laid. Frankenstein's Monster tells of his unfortunate beginnings when he was innocent and harmless inside.The book tells a tale of love, ambition, adventure, obsession. She delves into the nature of humans and why we do good and bad things. Unlike many writers of her time, she does not inject her book with meaningless religious crap, save some understandable references. Where in Bram Stoker's Dracula, prayers may as well have been used in place of punctuation, Mary Shelley uses spirituality and the supernatural not as Deus Ex Machina tools to make her job easier, but as a way to reveal her characters' state of mind. When is a man more desperate than when he starts to believe that his dreams are windows into Heaven where his poor loved ones reside? I cannot recommend this book enough for anyone who wants to try some classics on for size. Out of the classics I've recently read, including War of the Worlds, The Island of Dr. Moreau, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Alice in Wonderland, Frankenstein is probably my favorite."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Alright, I'll admit it - up until roughly a year ago I was a complete literary ignoramus. Then I started reading books and since then I've found a new addiction, classic literature. I was one of those people that thought Frankenstein was the monster and I figured the original story would be as laughable as the old clips of those classic Frankenstein movie with the mad scientist (\\"IT'S ALIIIIIIVE!\\"). As it turns out, his is a very harrowing tale and it's completely different than I imagined it to be. Thankfully.This is one of those occasions where I really don't want to sum up the plot because you might be like me and I'd hate to spoil anything for you. The plot twists come early and the line between who is the 'good guy' and who is the 'bad guy' are quickly blurred. Until about half way through (maybe a little further) I truly didn't know which way this tale was heading!Here's a tiny bit, just the beginning--Captain Robert Walton is set out to explore the North Pole. His ship is eventually incased in ice when he discovers a man from Geneva named Victor Frankenstein. Victor spills his tale. Victor is a scientist who created and then immediately abandoned a living abomination.That's it. i don't want to give anything significant away.I love this book but I just couldn't give it five stars. The main reason is because it bogs down a bit in areas. The worst example of this is when the monster is telling Victor his tale about a family he was spying on so he could learn more about human nature, how to speak, how to emote, etc. This is all interesting, but then he digs into this family's history and goes into a MASSIVE digression spanning pages upon pages about whom is marrying whom, all their relationships, etc - minutia to the extreme and it's all for naught. This section could have been cut down drastically without risk because when it all boils down, none of these details on this family matter and none of it is all that interesting.Aside from the complaint above I found this novel to be quite good. Much better than I thought it was going to be! Definitely check this one out. Aside from the dreadfully boring section I mentioned above this would have been an easy five, which I rarely give."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Many of the main ideas of Romanticism are seen in Mary Shelley's book Frankenstein. The romantic period is characterized by a movement and departure away from scientific and rational ideas, in literature, ideology, and art. The artwork from the romantic era strove to capture and represent the sublime, the experience of nature, and the personalization of these experiences. This particular work of Mary Shelley is a story that is not from her own personal experience nor written in her own voice. This work is about a quest to achieve the sublime. Through the use of emotionally stirring words and a creative, gothic mood, Mary Shelley creates a romantic piece of artwork that drives one towards personal discovery and romantic ideology. Frankenstein is about Dr. Victor Frankenstein's quest to create a living being out of raw materials in his laboratory. With an emphasis on a \\"new way of seeing things\\", Dr. Victor Frankenstein applied imagination and creative thinking in order to better understand the world, perfect the vision of human beings, and better characterize the society in which we live. Being the dreamer, who is preoccupied by the sublime, suggest Dr. Victor Frankenstein and this novel, as a wonderful romantic work."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"\\"Frankenstein\\" is a classic of Gothic literature that has boasted several spin-off books and movies. This particular edition rounds out at about 200 pages, and it was a quick read for me. It's not terribly fast-paced by today's standards, but it is engaging. The title character, Victor Frankenstein, grows up with an affinity for science and is determined to make his mark on humanity. He scavenges for human body parts until he is able to create, and bring to life, a new creation. As soon his creation comes to life, however, Victor is horrified by what he refers to as \\"the monster.\\"The novel is a frame story, and Victor's tale is conveyed by a ship's captain who finds him wandering in the North. The story of the monster is told mostly from Victor Frankenstein's point of view, but in some longer parts the monster narrates his experiences to Victor. For me, the monster's story was the most riveting part of the novel--I found Victor's character a bit annoying at times. The novel as a whole emphasizes the potential dangers of science, but it also brings to light themes of the dire consequences when the \\"created\\" is neglected or, worse, treated ill. The monster's character starts out as quite a sympathetic one, until he meets with the horror and revulsion of human beings he encounters. This raises issues about the consequences of intolerance that are relevant today; the enduring themes of the novel help to make it a classic.While those who prefer a fast-paced plot may be a bit bored with this, fans of earlier Gothic literature will enjoy the ride. This edition has useful end notes as well as a helpful scholarly introduction (best read after the novel is finished due to spoilers) and biographical information about the author. Additional commentary and questions for discussion are also provided."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"There are a gazillion ebook editions of Frankenstein out there.FrankensteinThis Penguin Classics version is a fantastic ebook -- not just of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but I mean the ebook formatting.First, this is a scholarly edition.

I won't go into the details of Shelly's masterpiece in this review, but deal in what I think makes this a timeless classic that hangs on to readers today.The character of Victor Frankenstein, a man obsessed with making a difference in the studies of life and death. It is his blind devotion to his studies over life and death, that leads to tragedy for his family and friends later in the story. Shelly takes us on a journey that shows us the frailty of our lives and the motives that drive us to achieve no matter the cost. Victor, even though he is a character, is within everyone. He is the blind ambition that throws away love for the sake of fame and immortality, and the utter lack of responsibility for his actions once the deed is done. This character is versatile, because it lingers in people, perhaps even someone you know.Just as haunting is Victor's creation, the Monster. Racked with questions about his identity and guilt for a life unwanted, the Monster is just as much a part of our lives as Victor. Forget about the rheumatoid Karloff of the Universal Classics, this Monster is so much more. Memories implanted by the mind or the parts of the whole, surprise Victor's creation and lead him on his journey for answers. A Monster that can speak and play music, a humbling yet violent creation asking for justification from his creator, an answer to the question: Why?This is a human tale.Yes there is drama and horror, but the human message is one that should be remembered and savored because it is a cautionary tale that tells how expendable life really is when one embarks on gaining knowledge and the frailty of the human soul when confronted by the deeds they have committed. To lose one's soul chasing after an obsession and then to seek redemption all too late.I know this does not cover the wealth that is Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, or Modern Prometheus, but as I have stated this review is what I think makes it a timeless classic that should be embraced by readers of all ages today."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"As a child I was terrified of the old Frankenstein monster movies (the cause of several nightmares), but I don't regret reading this book for a moment. In fact, I should have read it years ago, as I wrongly assumed the book and the movies were alike. I can only recall two similarities in the entire book - including Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein version :). I don't believe I'm giving anything away by naming instances: 1) Dr. Frankenstein creates a \\"being,\\" 2) His creation meets up with a blind man.Even though I had to read many sentences - some 7 lines long - two or three times in order to glean their meaning, I cannot recommend this book enough. If you're looking for mayhem and gore, you'll be disappointed. If you enjoy plots regarding mans' faults, failures and struggles with choices and consequences - you won't be. That a book approaching two centuries old is still relevant is recommendation enough.I only wish someone would make a movie based on the real story, as it is so beautifully and meaningfully written. Although a great portion of the book is introspection on the part of Dr. Frankenstein, I think a movie relaying the heart of the story could still be done creatively.Give it a try and see if you don't end up questioning who the real monstor is in the story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"First off, let me get this out of the way - this is not what I expected. When one refers to Frankenstein, the image conjured up is always the square headed, green skinned Karloff with bolts through his neck (at least, for us non eggheads :P). I am so glad that I read this book just to see who and what Frankenstein's monster really was before Hollywood got ahold of him.There is a mysterious feeling surrounding this book when you know how it came to be. Read the Author's Introduction if you read nothing else. Their talks on the subjects of the day ring in the background of Frankestein and, since we are after all dealing with Byron and Shelly in the background, one can almost feel the mood that must have been present that summer.As for the content of the book, the main question I find interesting is that reviewer/critic Harold Bloom said that the greatest paradox was that Frankenstein's monster had more 'humanity' than his human creator. It is a good angle from which to read the book. Frankenstein (the creator) works feverishly to learn the secret of resurrection and once he succeeds, abandons his progeny to a cruel world that can not see his inner beauty for his gruesome appearance. The spurned creature turns to his creator and threatens him into helping him by creating a mate so that he can have some solace in the world. With this he would be peaceful. Are his acts the acts of a monster or of a man pushed too far? Honestly, the book itself brings up the questions but I didn't see that they were answered. Of course, I might be missing it. Regardless, it is fun to read and you owe it to yourself to find out what Hollywood jipped you out of."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book is scary - in a good way. As set apart from the typical notion of Frankenstein as a green monster with nails sticking out of his head, the true daemon was pale yellow, with flowing black hair. While many people have interpreted the novel in different ways, I feel it depicts three main points:1) Excessive desire for knowledge is not a good thing, as it leads to a lower appreciation of the beauty of the world. As a child, Victor Frankenstein enjoyed looking on the beautiful mountains and hills of his native Switzerland, but then he got deep into science and the secret of life. And this led him to a gloominess in life, and a lack of wonder at the world. While working on creating the creature, he says, \\"It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.\\"2) Man's sinfulness always passes down to his creation, and the results are horrific. I am a Christian who believes man is sinful at heart, and I saw a dramatic illustration of this principle in &lt;i>Frankenstein&lt;/i>. The sins of Victor Frankenstein passed down to his creature, and eventually it destroyed his friends, his family, and even himself. Says Frankenstein, \\"I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done [his murder of Frankenstein's brother], nearly in the light of &lt;i>my own vampire, my own spirit&lt;/i> let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.\\"3) Man is responsible to care for the things he creates, or else the results are dreadful. Once Frankenstein breathed life into his creature, he immediately was struck with horror and regret at what he had done, and he abdicated his responsibility to guide it. The creature consequently turned into a miserable, vengeful brute. He says, \\"I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\\"I believe this novel is worth reading to gain a sense of horror at these points. It should lead us to continually appreciate the world's beauty, to always repent of our sin, and to take care of our creations, especially our children.If you don't read the book for these points, then just read it for a good story. It's truly fantastic. :-)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The image that most of us have when hearing the name \\"Frankenstein\\" is a huge lumbering monster with little or no intelligence. This is the image I had when first reading Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein or the Modern Prometheus.\\" Nothing could have been further from the truth.The story starts with letters between a man and his sister over his choice to explore the artic region. While trapped in ice, this main and the crew of his ship meet with the infamous Mr. Frankenstein. From here, Frankenstein tells the horrid story of how is attempt to play God backfired.His story starts with young Frankenstein first leaving his home and the family and friend he loves so much. He is headed off to a university to study the natural sciences. During his time here, his reputation grows until he is one of the most respected members of the university. It is by chance that he happens to stumble upon the secret of creating life from that which is lifeless. After many months of solitude in his labratory, Frankenstein is able to successfully create a living being. The problem is that his creation is too hideous to behold. Frankenstein immediately shuns his creation as does the rest of society.From here, Frankenstein gives the long account on how the creature came to be his ultimate tormentor, shadowing him wherever he travelled, giving Frankenstein's heart no time for rest.What surprised me most about this story was just how human Frankenstein's creation was. He learned to speak and feel emotions just like a human being. He did not start out as an evil creature wanting to wreak havok on humans. It was society's reaction to him that drove him to vile actions. Even his \\"God,\\" his creator, Mr. Frankenstein, had forsaken him. A lot of references to \\"Paradise Lost\\" by John Milton were thrown into the story which added an interesting parallel between the Judeo-Christian creation of man and Frankenstein's creation.Before reading this book you should try to cast off any preconceived notions you have about Frankenstein. You won't find any dimwitted brutes in this story, only some extremely tormented individuals who are brought to the brink of madness."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If you are expecting the novel Frankenstein to be like horror scenes depicted in the movies, you better think again. Instead, Mary Shelly allows the reader to create more images in his or her own mind. Today, we are so brainwashed to violence and gory images on television, that we sometimes forget what \\"real\\" horror used to be like. When you read Frankenstein don't forget that Mary Shelly wrote the book in the 1880's in a time of social unrest. The writing style is different, and the pace of the novel is not as up to date as modern books. Her descriptive words allow the reader to create the monster in his or her own mind, without actually seeing it. When Shelly writes, her words give such detailed images of what is going to happen next. For example, when something \\"bad\\" is going to happen, Shelly generates a spooky and mysterious setting.One of the major themes throughout the book is science technology. When Victor creates the monster, he is challenging science, and therefore challenging God. When the creature awakes, Victor realizes that he has just done a \\"horrible\\" thing. He is disgusted with the thing he created, which led him to feel extreme guilt and compete rejection of the monster. Is it science that led him to self destruction? Shelly wonders how far will technological advances go before a man becomes too dependent on technology? Science destroys his life because the monster dominates him, and Victor winds up being a slave to his own creation.What was also interesting about the novel was how Shelly made the reader feel sympathetic for the monster. After all aren't we supposed to hate this thing? She portrayed the creature as a \\"normal human\\", showing love and affection. The creature's ugliness deterred anyone from coming close to him, and made him feel like an outsider. This rejection from society made the monster sad and helpless. His only revenge was to engage in destruction. This is when the \\"real\\" monster is created. After reading parts of the novel I felt bad for the monster, in a way I never thought I would.Although slow paced, Mary Shelly's style of writing will allow you to take on different dimensions and force you to develop your own profound ideas about the topics discussed in the novel. I think Frankenstein is a great Romantic classic for anyone who has a imagination."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Written almost two centuries ago, Shelley's science-fiction/horror novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; retains its powerful messages and questions to this very day.A devoted scientist, Victor Frankenstein, attempts to return to life a body he has constructed from various human parts. He succeeds, only to realize the hideousness of his creation, and subsequently flee.Confused but sympathetic, Frankenstein's monster finds himself shunned by humans. Eventually, a series of tragedies turns him against humanity, and he turns his thoughts to seeking revenge on his creator for not providing him with either protection or companionship. Meanwhile, Frankenstein is determined to protect himself and his family, while removing his mistake from the world. The two spend the latter portion of the novel in a drawn-out duel, spiralling towards misery for both of them.Shelley's work raises profound questions about the limits of science, its requirements for wisdom as well as intelligence, the responsibilities of parents, and the nature of revenge - quite an accomplishment for a novel of only 250 pgs. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"There is no quantifying the impact of Frankenstein. Whatever it is about, it commands a heavy reaction about loss, tragedy, love, innocence, true Christianity, ethics and personhood.Cloning in this scientific age might not be as challenged as Shelley's world was. On one hand, we have a beast, sans a mother's womb to birth from, on the other, we have a wretched society of bigotry and anger... The monster's ardent natural morality mixed with ID-like needs and a child's tenderness tears at the reader. Is he real? Is he, despite his innocence, like an unborn baby, free to be aborted? Or, is he validly human, as human as you or I, or like that fetus moments after it leaves the womb, kind and gentle, yet ignorant?A great catapult toward discussion and analysis, or just a plain old good read, but not without impact.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"In her classic novel Frankenstein, Mary Shelley creates a fascinating, thoroughly engrossing story about a young scientist who gives life to an inanimate creature. Through their relationship, Shelley explores the pinnacle of human achievement and at the same time the depths of degradation.It is difficult to precisely define the relationship between Frankenstein and the monster because Shelley presents the dynamic combination of a father to a son, a creator to a subject, a master to a slave and vice versa. Their relationship seems to evolve through time and through their associations with each other. Initially, when the monster confronts Frankenstein, we witness the creator/creation perspective. &quot;Yet, you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?&quot; In this exchange, the monster accuses Frankenstein of rejecting his own creation, but more importantly, he claims kinship with his creator, resolutely binding himself to Frankenstein and compelling Frankenstein to confront his own deeds and the consequences of his actions. It seems as though the monster is more aware of responsibility and devotion of one creature to another than the scientist. When the monster begins to describe his experiences with life, new sensations with nature, his fears and trepidation about associating with humans, his very survival against all odds, he takes on the role of a lost child. The relationship between Frankenstein and the monster resembles that of a father to a son, albeit a father who has neglected the parental responsibility to love, nurture and care for his offspring. The relationship even resembles that of a mother to a son, but in this context, it is Mary Shelley who is the creator of the monster through her incredible imagination. Shelley stirs our sentiments as readers, compelling us to feel for all the characters involved in this gruesome and powerfully moving story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I'm a long time fan of classic creature features. I grew up on the stuff. Saturday Monster Theater, my hometown station called it. Every Saturday afternoon at 2pm you could find me rooted two feet from the television, rods and cones soaking in the black and white flickering images of mummies and werewolves and monsters and creatures from boggy swamps. It was a genuine passion that resulted in many nightmares and a heightened imagination (and, I like to think, a warped sense of humor). One of my favorites was Frankenstein. The creature embodied the spirit of the boogey man that strode leisurely through my dreams while I ran against Jupiter's gravity. I watched it every time it played. I was around six before my dad told me that Frankenstein wasn't the monster's name. That is not truly the case in Shelley's novel - the monster moniker fits well on several characters. Hers is not the kind of gritty fright you get from The Evil Dead or the kind of nerve-fraying suspense Scream offered. In fact, it is a novel in the truest sense. It was written nearly 200 years ago in a time when it took writers years to perfect a masterpiece. It was crafted in an age when stories were told around campfires and not on the brain-sucking portal to the mindless world of programming directors and slathering yes-men. It is not concise and if you're looking for a relaxing, fast paced read to pass an afternoon, then you can stop reading now because this tome has meat. I do not believe in revealing plot in a review, so suffice it to say that this is a novel of love, obsession, vengeance and ignorance. It burrows into the psychology of a man and a \\"wretched creature\\" and you'll be surprised at what turns up. Though the most common school of thought seems to be that this novel is a twisted analogy of God and man, creator and creation, I believe it is almost a testimony against prejudice. I'm not a Shelley scholar, but this screams from the pages louder than Mae Clark from our Zenith console twenty-five years ago. A slighter lesson is that, if we confront our demons too late, we hurt the ones we love. But it is truly the story and not any theme or correlating allegory that makes this a novel worth reading. For me, it's always the story. And I will reveal none of this one here. I will say that there is no Boris Karloff lurking behind a tree within Shelley's romantically articulated pages. If you're looking for a literary companion to your childhood memories of the black and white horror staples, you won't find it here. But you're apt to find a lot more."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"There are, of course, umpteen book editions of this all-time classic. Why choose this one? Because it has a very well written introduction that does much to establish a sense of the personal challenges that Mary Shelly faced while writing this gothic, incredibly prescient tale.Mary Shelly had experienced her share of tragic circumstances, and she knew the pains of loss of life, and how our deeply embedded desires to overcome grief can lead us to hope for -- life out of death. And to think that she was only 19 when she wrote this book, one that is, if anything, more relevant to our times than to hers! I won't give anything away here, except to say that knowing something of this young author's personal circumstances really heightens appreciation for the book as well as her literary talents. I commend the New York Public Library for publishing this fine edition.The comperhensive introduction also traces the history of various adaptations of the novel, including of course, the James Wale films from the 1930s. It appropriately points out how many of these adaptations completely missed key elements of the story. In that respect, I must admit it is fun to read the young readers' reviews, and sense their excitement in discovering the deeper levels of meaning in this story. Keep at it young readers -- you'll gain more and more from this novel as you read it over at different stages in your lives!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I read Frankenstein for a class called Realism and Romance and I loved it. I began to feel sympathy for the monster and understood why he became so angry with his heartless creator, Frankenstein who abandoned him and left him on his own. The violent reactions the monster receives from the human characters in the story reflect a truth about human nature in that we are repulsed by ugly things whether people, animal, or things (like fecal matter). The human characters' negative reactions toward the lonely monster is a reflection of their own prejudice and true inner ugliness. Let's face it, if you are outwardly beautiful or pretty, you will be treated better than people who are average or unattractive. Mary Shelley's story defines this truth to its utmost extremity."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Greatest book ever written in my opinion, but I'm writing this review to warn people that once again Amazon has inaccurate information. This is the THIRD Kindle Frankenstein I have bought from Amazon claiming to be the ORIGINAL version. All three have NOT been the original. They are the 1831 revised edition."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"When people think of horror, the image of Boris Karloff's Frankenstein can generally be expected to pop into their heads, usually within the first minute of the word \\"horror\\"s utterance.Yet Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is not horror. It is science-fiction - and, for that matter, one of the first works of science-fiction ever written, as well as one of the most brilliant. While many of the nineteenth-century authors who boldly dove into the realm of the unknown came back with fascinating baubels that are now horribly dated, \\"Frankenstein\\" maintains its power and prescience in three ways:1) Its foremost theme is that of life itself - what is it that separates inanimate tissue from its living counterpart, and what in turn can give sentience to what might otherwise be a mindless organism. The answers to these questions have not yet been discovered, and are indeed probably in greater controversy today than they were in Shelley's own time.2) Another aspect timeless aspect of this book is its exploration into the responsibilities of creation - not merely scientific creation, but of any sort of creation, of any situation in which a human being with an idea sees it through to the finish, only to find that unexpected consequences await him/her.3) The drama itself - of a man fleeing from a monster, and of a monster trying desperately to assert his manhood - is as poignant as it is profound, and the reader who isn't moved by the plights of both these characters lacks either the heart to care or the brain to understand.It is a shame that people today associate the word Frankenstein with cheap and formulaic horror films. Indeed, there is a fair amount of irony that Frankenstein is often thought of as a run-of-the-mill hideous monster, when indeed it was precisely that sort of knee-jerk superficiality and intolerance that Shelley herself was trying to combat. Either way, Frankenstein is one of those rare books that managed to create its own genre without later being dated by countless similar efforts. No matter how great future science fictions writers may become, they will always walk in the shadow of Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I bought this book and I have had problems with the version. I have reason to believe that this is the original version from 1818, although many schools call for Shelley's revised 1831 version. However, the version isn't stated anywhere in the book.Subtle differences in the two texts include Elizabeth's relation to Victor (she is a cousin in this novel, an orphan in the 1831 version), the chapter organization (part of this version's chapter 1 is the other's chapter 2), and various other minor occurences (in the other version, Victor and Walton discuss the seriousness of the journey and the possible loss of sailors, which doesn't occur in the 1818 book).If you are buying this book for school, I would advise checking version's because the subtle differences can really mess you up on tests and reading checks."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was required to read this book in college for my information technology & society course. At first I was hesitant, for I was not generally a fan of books that I was required to read in class, with the exception of \\"The Importance of Being Earnest.\\" However, I found that, as with \\"Earnest\\", I was pleasantly surprised. I became so absorbed in the book that it only took me two days to read it. \\"Frankenstein\\" is a story that questions ethics, society and relationships. It is dark in the same way as \\"Dracula,\\" but unlike \\"Dracula\\", which is also a fine book, there is an undertone of tenderness and sadness.

The instant that I began reading this book I became totally enthralled. I would go well beyond the assigned chapter yearning to know what would happen next. The characters are very well developed and you are able to feel what Victor and the monster feel.Readers should keep in mind that this book was written in the 1800's. So, if you're looking for chainsaw slashing, blood, and gore, look elsewhere. But, if you're looking for a classic novel of intelligence, love, alienation, and desperation-this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Before reading this book, I thought I had a fairly good understanding of what it was about (which is primarily why I was hesitant to actually read it). A mad scientist somehow created a monster in his lab. The monster, commonly (however, incorrectly) referrred to as Frankenstein, had green skin, was about seven feet tall, had bolts in his neck etc. And I recalled something about him being pursued through the streets by an angry fire-wielding mob.What surprised me most about this book is how little of what I had always heard about it was actually true. The monster that most people refer to as Frankenstein actually has no name. He was created by a man whose last name is Frankenstein. There is a brief description of him, but no mentioning of neck bolts or green skin. Furthermore, there is no scene where a mob of people chases after him with fire. This was not, as I had previously been lead to believe, a horror novel. It is, rather, a book dealing with the themes of love, desire, acceptance, ignorance, resentment and revenge.The following is a brief summary of the plot, so if you don't want to know what this is about I would advise you to not read this portion of my review: Frankenstein (the scientist, not monster) is a man deeply interested in science. One day he discovers how to give life to inanimate objects, and decides to assemble a being from various body parts. When he imparts this creature with life he is horrified at what he has created and flees. It isn't long before the \\"monster\\" learns that all people are horrified and appalled by his existence, and is driven to live in the woods. He ends up living outside of a family's home where he is able to observe them through a window. Through his observation, he is able to learn to speak and read perfect English. He feels a love for this family who are completely oblivious to his existence and feels a deep desire to establish a relationship with them. When he finally gets up the courage to meet them, they are of course terrified of him and drive him away. Sometime after this, the monster, devastated by humanity's unwillinglness to accept him and filled with resentment towards his maker who has forsaken him, decides to lash otu in revenge toward Frankenstein. He systematically kills off Frankenstein's family one by one. It then becomes Frankenstein's only goal in life to eradicate the menace he created.This book is surprising in that it didn't really seem like a horror novel at all. Sure, the monster is composed of the body parts of corpses, but he is very much a human character, complete with a full spectrum of emotions. He desires love and companionship from human beings just like we all do, but he is denied this. This is a sad story, but not at all scary. The writing style is very unique in that it is extremely non-descriptive. In a way, I think that is a good thing. I've read far too many books that are too long-winded. This book is concise and to the point. The author did not use twenty pages to describe the look of the monster's left toenail. With so little detail, this book does require a little imagination but there's nothing wrong with that. Overall, it's a decent read but doesn't seem to have held up too well over time. I imagine that when this book was released it actually was considered scary, but in 2004 it really isn't. So if it's a horror novel you're looking for, I suggest looking elsewhere. But if you're interested in a book that explores the desire/need for acceptance and companionship and what happens when it is denied, this is a pretty good choice.

No, I was not forced to read this. I read it far before it was on the reading list. Just wanted to clear that up. Back to the review. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is an intriguing autobiography of a man obsessed with tampering with the laws of nature by reversing them. This novel shows how man deals with failure and loss. Unfortunatly, Victor Frankenstein dealt with failure and loss the wrong way and... Wait, I don't want to give away the ending. Anyway, Mary Shelley creates a clever plot and adds some gruesome happenings and romance, combining the three to make one of the most famous horror stories. Unfortunatly, for those of you still hooked to video games and fast-paced action, you may have a difficult time reading this for it tends to drag out at some points. But that's how literature is, you'll just have to deal with it. Apart from that, I would definitly recommend this book to just about anyone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is a fantastic work of classic literature. I think few people realize just how different the novel is from the archetype version of the story most people are familiar with. You know, the cheesy green monster with the bolts in the neck, flat head and elevator shoes with the moral not to play God. Oh, yes, and the creature in that idea usually only grunts or says things like \\"Fiiire Bad!\\"That is NOT what Frankenstein, the novel, is. In the novel the creature has yellow eyes, tightly drawn skin, long black hair, is very agile, and is highly intelligent. The creature is hyper intelligent. Within minutes of his creation he figured out how to dress himself and only months after that he could speak, read and write, more articulately than his own creator. He was even quoting Milton. Many people remember the moral not to play God but few remember that there is a secondary moral. The creature had to forgive his creator for how he treated him, for abandoning him, and for not preparing him for the cruelties of the world. He had to learn that revenge would bring him no peace but only perpetuate a cycle of anger and revenge.There is also the message of responsibility to one's child and the importance of keeping one's promises (which Victor breaks several times in the course of the story and only causes more trouble for everyone invovled).The creature is tragic. This is a brilliant work of literature by a impressively creative woman. What she created was a story that will last through the ages, a combination of science, alchemy and parent / child metaphors that reaches us on a very basic level. Read the classic novel if you have not yet done so already."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN is as relevant today as it was during its initial publication in 1818. The story, butchered by Hollywood renditions, chronicles a young doctor Frankenstein who discovers how to reanimate life. He attempts to create the perfect being: tall, athletic, and free from disease. Instead, when the being comes to life, the result is hideous and grotesque. The doctor flees his lab and his creation only to find his life haunted by his rejected creation. Modern retellings of this story hold that the monster (who is often inappropriately called \\"Frankenstein\\",) is a lumbering idiot who is afraid of fire. These versions focus on the horror of the monster. The 1818 version of Frankenstein's creation is a smart, nimble creature who has become a wretch after finding rejection at every corner of the world.Shelley's original narrative focuses on the horror of being rejected or cast out of the world. The book often references and evokes Milton's PARADISE LOST, and for good reason. There are similar themes at work here -- similar ideas about creation, rejection, and the yearning to find meaning in our lives.The Kindle edition is a pretty good public domain copy. The formatting is great. There's two introductions: one from Wendy Steiner, and another from the author herself. There are a few instances in which letters and characters did not translate correctly to the electronic edition (some ol's that format as d's, etc). Other than a few instances of this, this version is very readable and contains few errors.I'd recommend this book to anyone who has even a cursory interest in FRANKENSTEIN -- the tale told here is infinitely more interesting and fascinating than the monsters of Hollywood. Because FRANKENSTEIN is available through the public domain, Amazon is offering this eBook for free. It's easier to access this great book now than it ever has been before. What are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Everybody ought to read this book at some point in their lives. ITs such a part of our culture. Naturally the book has NEVER been represented by the movies, not even Kenneth Branagh's MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN, tho the 1931 classic hits the mood right on. Anyway, the book will overwhelm you when you read it. Once you get past the ornate language, and the \\"romantic\\" literary influence of the German gothic movement's fascination by suicides, ghosts,and various vampire-like themes, the story really is affecting. (Shelly, Lord Byron and Mary entertained themselves when they were hanging out around Lake Geneva by reading translations of German gothic horror stories.) One wonders how a 19 year old woman pulls this book out of her conscousness. Well, read Mary Shelly's biographical information sometime. Her mother died giving birth to her. Then, while she had started to write the novel, her half sister committed suicide. Right after that, Shelly's WIFE committed suicide--WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT--due to Mary running off with her husband. Plus while she was writing, Mary miscarried her first child. Mary had three children by Shelly altogether, but only one lived for any time, tho he also died as a child. Post partem depression severely affected Mary, after her first still born baby. (Her depressions over these deaths became so severe, she'd stop writting for periods of time.)Given the confusion of guilt and depression, Mary could have very easily felt responsible for the death of her mother because of her own birth, then the suicide of Percy's first wife and their unborn child, Mary's own first child's stillbirth, and finally her half sister's suicide. (Who knows if Mary's half sister left some kind of note blaming Mary for ruining her social standing in London, for running off with Shelly.) Whatever the circumstances, guilt plays a part in every tragic death. Surrounded by so much tragic death, and Mary's depression, guilt over at least SOME of these deaths certainly consumed Mary's mind. Its not at all hard to draw a line between the severe, maddening guilt of Victor Frankenstein, for the people his monster murdered, and guilt Mary felt over the deaths just mentioned. Perhaps even the destruction of the female monster, was Mary's desire to tear her own self to pieces and bury them at sea, to keep any more monsters (ie tragic deaths) from occuring.One thing that strikes you when you read the book, is how much GUILT OVER DEATH is much more of a theme, than the typical theme you usually encounter. (If man tries to play God, he suffers the consequences.) Maybe by refusing the Church's moral stance against adultery, Mary's \\"alter ego\\" felt she was playing God with what 1819 society viewed as God's commandments. Out of divine punishment, Mary could easily have felt her first baby died at birth, because Percy Shelly's unborn child died, when his wife committed suicide.(India's religious ideas were popular at the time as well, so karmic retribution may have been naggin at mary's conscience, adding fuel to the flames of compunction.) Some people see FEAR OF STILL BIRTH as the central theme of the story. Giving birth to something dead, is certainly what Victor did by creating his monster, as well as Mary when her baby was born dead. For me, this story's theme is more about a mother's GUILT that accompanies still birth, as well as GUILT felt when other people die, as a consequence of one's personal decisions. Given that her first child's death, Shelly's first wife and unborn child, and her half sister all died while Mary was writing this book, it would be nearly impossible NOT to see Victor's guilt as a mirror to Mary's own guilt. IF this emotional realism were not present in the heart of the novel, it would not affect as many people the extent that it has, for hundreds of years.Mary's own destiny was just like the Victor/monster character. After Shelly died when Mary was 24, she never married again. SHe put herself into a cold, barren emotional wasteland, never marrying again or having more children. At the end of the story, Victor and the Monster end up in the frozen wastelands of the North Pole. (A symbol for Mary's own emotion distance from humanity.) By that time in the story, the Monster and Victor were emotionally indistinguishable. The monster claimed to feel as much sorrow, guilt and sadness, as well as emotional rage and anger, as Victor did over the various deaths of his family and friends. NO doubt Mary was feeling as guilt ridden, if not enraged at the vagaries of Fate, that the Monster and its creator felt as well. The monster reflects his creator Victor, and Mary reflects her creation, the Novel FRANKENSTEIN. And this mirror within a mirror works so well, because when it comes to tragic death, GUILT will always drive the survivors crazy. The REAL FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER is Mary's Guilt for the deaths she endured, and even caused by proxy, while writing the novel. SHe must have known this on some level, and therefore refused to give the monster a name. How can you put a name to such a hideous monster, that is essencially your own soul? (The PICTURE OF DORIAN GREY works the same way symbolically.)The power of guilt within all humanity, will cause this book to resonate for as long as there are people who will feel guilty over tragic deaths of those closest to them. That is the real fear of this monster...its not of defying God, its not fear of the dead, its fear of GUILT over the deaths of others."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This paperback, published by Simon and Schuster, is NOT a bowdlerized edition.

He takes him aboard ship, EAGERLY befriends him and nurses him to health like Florence Nightengale.

Though difficult to get close to, he does latch clingingly to those who manage to connect with him. He finds success as a student at the University of Ingostadt. There, author Mary Shelley lets us know in the vaguest way possible that, Victor discovers the \\"secret of life.\\" He develops a God complex and vows to create a new race of beings who will worship him. His only successful subject, patched together from dead body parts, is \\"The Monster.\\" Victor immediately abhors this wretch and casts him out, realizing that this was a really bad idea to begin with.Just when Frankenstein thinks he can just go on his merry way and live life like nothing ever happened, news reaches him of his little brother having been killed. When Victor returns home for the funeral, the monster seeks him out and takes over the story, eloquently spinning a dreadful yarn about loss and abandonment. The Monster is not happy at all with Victor, his god, creator, master, who sent him away out of disgust at his physical form. The Monster is expressed as being 8 feet tall, disfigured in the face and able to move at superhuman speed. None of this reminds me of Boris Karloff, making the novel a stranger story than the movies.The Monster reveals to Victor that he did kill his brother, that he learned to speak and read no thanks to him and that his benevolent nature had been twisted into something cruel and terrible thanks to society's intolerance for people who look differently. Pissed off at having to live life in hiding, the Monster says that he will kill everyone Victor loves unless his \\"god\\" does this for him:make him a mate - someone as gruesome as he is, to live happily with, refusing the rest of the world in peace.All three voices - Walton's, Frankenstein's and the Monster's are well done but Shelley doesn't step into the male role very well at all. Some of the dialogue between seemingly heterosexual men could come right out of a novel with Fabio splashed on the cover. But I felt sorry for the Monster and I think Frankenstein was a jerk and had it coming. I'm still very awed at how different the novel is from the movies, which were apparently adapted from the stage plays. I think I better appreciate the novel, an instant success upon publication."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Somehow, 175 years after it was first written, this story keeps holding our attention. Not just that, it says more to our modern world than it ever said before.Popularized versions of this story lack all the depth of Shelley's original. Yes, her monster was physically huge, powerful, and respulsive. In her version, though, he's a thinking, feeling, and deeply intelligent person. He is deeply hurt by the universal, unreasoning loathing that judges only his face - even from the man who created him. The creation has a majestic capacity for affection but, in a credible transformation of emotional alchemy, that whole capacity turns to rage. He is not an image of hate, but a mirror of it.The hubristic biotechnologist has an immediacy today that Shelley could scarcely have imagined. So, I think, does the vengeful lashing out by people who feel they have suffered grievous wrongs, leading to a deadly spiral of increasing hatred by all parties. I just hope that current readers will take the time needed to absorb this book properly - it was never paced for today's ADD-driven generation.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is recommended for anyone interested in contrasting the 'original' version of the story with the (mostly) better-known film versions from Universal and others. The novel is anything but a 'mad scientist' yarn, with a great deal of soul-searching from both the title character and his creation. As noted in other reviews, the language is the typically 'flowery' prose of the early 18th century, and there are several instance of paragraphs being restated just a few lines apart(presumably Shelley rewrote some paragraphs over the course of several years, without eliminating the originals).I thought there was a bit too much time spent on some of the minor supporting characters, all of whom seemed to have deep, complex backstories usually found in TV soap operas. Once Frankenstein and the monster finish their lengthy 'flashback sequence' storytelling, the action picks up, and the basic 'man vs. monster' conflict takes over, enhanced by each character trying to reconcile their actions with their own 'inner demons'.The scientific plausibility is questionable at best, and some may not like the less than clear-cut explanation behind Frankenstein's 'creative process'. I think the ambiguity can be set aside for the sake of an entertaining story. If you can make it through the middle chapters of the book(AKA, 'the bit with the family in the cottage'), you'll be won over by 'Frankenstein'."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, written in 1818 is amazing in part because it is still so readable and enjoyable. Based on my vast experience with bad horror interpretations of monsters, I expected this book to be dull with a main character who was both slow and stupid. Not so. Shelly creates a monster who possesses a reasonable IQ and incredible physical abilities. This book has a good plot, dialogue and fast-paced story. It is easy to read, understand and has an unanticipated ending. Highly recommend for middle school and above."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is a little book that is a very creditable effort for a nineteen-year-old author to have written. It is not a masterpiece, per se, and it bears almost no relation to the famous Universal films. The style is very 19th century, with florid prose, melodrama, and epistles, but it isn't boring (nor is it particularly scary). You'll be better off having read it than not, however, and it'll take a day at most."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"... you create it, you name it, or else.Shelley's Frankenstein is impressively written. Frankenstein is just so much more than a tale of a madman's obsession with his ambition and his creation of a monster. This novel encompasses human life and philosophy. Not only is this a story containing all elements of literature, it holds hidden meanings and truths that apply to life. An excellent job is done in tying the novel into other matters beyond the actual storyline. The message is relatable and interpretable, which makes for good discussion and meditation. This novel is a beautiful example of popular and debatable questions being aroused in the form of simple literature. The overall theme was clearly brought out through the text. This book has a purpose. While reading, one is taught that all actions have consequences. If you step out of bounds, you will pay. Frankenstein is truly a classic. If you have not read it, you are missing out."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Like a lot of people who avoid this book because they think they are familiar with the story, I continually passed this classic over until I had to read it for a class.I was absolutely humbled and astonished that a girl of twenty-one could write such a fantastic story.This book is not about some monsterish ogre who skulks the earth searching for victims...not at first. This was a being given life by an overzealous scientist and then promptly abandoned because of his outer ugliness.Victor Frankenstein's monster lives in solitude and finds ways to learn language etc... but what he really craves is love and some kind of mutual contact. This book says so much about the importance society places on appearances. Every time the \\"monster\\" tries to reach out to someone he is beheld with the utmost horror and disdain. He begs his creator to make him a female counterpart so that he may no longer be lonely. It is when the creator, Victor Frankenstein, selfishly refuses this favor that his creation torments everyone Victor loves.This book necessarily makes one think about what they would do if they were the monster. There is logic, if not vengence in his actions. What he does to his creator is justified in his own mind, and you may very well find that you feel the same way.This is a quick one or two day read and I highly recommend it as a classic that will enrich your overall reading experience."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I guess I based my presumption of this book on all the movies. Frankenstein is not the creature who I thought he was. I found myself feeling sorry for him. Wishing that someone would reach out to him. Mary Shelley left it to your imagination on really what he looked like. I enjoyed this portion to. The book was exquisitely written. I felt I was actually transported to this era. Enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is a wildly imaginative book by a brilliant author, Mary Shelley. Shelley, way ahead of her time, writes a story very different from those seen in modern horror movies. She uses the technique of reeling her readers in and then playing with them. In Frankenstein, the character Victor is a curious person; he yearns to learn the secrets of the earth. Attempting to fulfill his desire he comes up with the insane notion to recreate life after it has been destroyed. Of course, afterwards he sincerely regrets it since the monster he creates wreaks havoc. Shelley shows the horror of the aftermath of playing creator and sends a chill down the spine. Shelley forces readers to rethink their own lives and desires. I read Frankenstein not as a piece of fiction, but as a piece of Biological Literature.There is a very short amount of time in the book that talks about Biology, but when it is discussed, it is almost as if Victor is able to use his brief education in human life to bring a creature to life using electricity and parts that are pieced together. Conveniently enough, Victor never reveals his secret to life, in case someone were to repeat what he did and create another monster like his. This, we know, is completely impossible, and since Shelley herself had no education in biology, we know that she was using a literary device known widely as \\"black box science\\", in which something works because the author tells the reader that it does--a truth universally acknowledged.There are several scientists in recent years who are attempting to follow in Victor's footsteps and are trying to grow blood cells and skin tissues from corpses, in an attempt to prolong life or even cheat death. Their success rate will be questionable, of course, but their reasoning is seemingly much more noble than that of Victor Frankenstein.It was an excellently written book in terms of fictional appeal, but in the way of biology, it is quite lacking.

After re-reading it, I still feel the same. This book is the story of Dr. Frankenstein and the monster that he created. Immediately repulsed, Dr. Frankenstein rejects the monster, leaving it to roam Europe on its own. After hiding near a family, the monster learns how to talk and communicate and realizes that he is missing companionship. When Dr. Frankenstein refuses to create a companion for him, the monster begins killing his family. Overall, this is a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is one of the key templates of modern fiction, setting into motion narratives regarding anxiety about science and creation, power over nature, and more saliently anxiety over reproduction, particularly male anxiety. The novel revolves around an implicit and typical family romance that can be found in many gothic novels - the temptation or possibility of incestuous relationship and its sublimation and avoidance. There is also a fairly radical revolutionary subtext in the novel inspired in part by Mary Shelley's father William Godwin (his own fictional works are mirror images of Frankenstein in many ways)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I had to read this book for a class I am taking, and although I did not enjoy the content of the book, it was a great deal for me as I downloaded it to the Kindle App on my phone for free, and had the book to take with me to read wherever I went."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Written as a letter from Dr. Frankenstein to his sister about his creation and experiences with his monster, \\"Frankenstein\\" is an experience every person can identify with. Throughout the book, Dr. Frankenstein deals with his remorse for creating such a wretched creature, and the monster abhors Dr. Frankenstein for the same reason.Hollywood representations of the monster known as Frankenstein, as well as the relationship between the monster and Dr. Frankenstein are very mistaken. Frankenstein does not arise from a table to act like a mindless zombie, Dr. Frankenstein does not scream \\"He's alive! He's alive,\\" and their relationship is not one of a mad scientist creating a beast that will do his destructive bidding.In fact, he is a very learned creature, and he received his education from Plutarch's \\"Lives,\\" Goethe's \\"Sorrows of Wurther,\\" and Milton's \\"Paradise Lost.\\" It is only after much scorn that Frankenstein turns into a destructive monster, perhaps best emulated by the transition in psyche of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lechter.For those who want an adventurous read about rape and murder, Frankenstein offers no such thing. This book, which at times seems more like a prequel to common Frankenstein movies, fluctuates about as much as the sea from which Dr. Frankenstein writes it. At no time does Shelley, who wrote Frankenstein at only 17, offer her readers a cliffhanger; though, with every page she writes with enough maturity to reveal the monsters all humans are either in danger of becoming or creating."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein's monster was hiding in the wods next to a cabin occupied by a couple.

Frankenstein wasn't at the top of my list, or even near the top probably, but my best friend continued to encourage me to read it as it is one of her very favorite books.Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus (Penguin Classics)This classic book has inspired no fewer than fifty films. It definitely has a firm place in classic literature and in culture. I had no idea that Mary Shelley was the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. They married when she was age 18/19 years old, in 1816. It was upon a dare, by Lord Byron, to write a ghost story, that Mary Shelley wrote the novel. I like that she didnt just write a \\"ghost story\\" and developed a plot-line like no other before.The review I am in the midst of writing, here, is going to be a mixed bag. I must say that I was quite surprised that the story was written in such a way that it was not difficult for me to finish; not a drudgery as I read it. I somehow felt compelled to read it. I suppose I would say that her writing style is very agreeable. The story is written in the form of a person retelling the story he has been told, in letter form, to a far-off loved one. Writing a story in this manner required an additional back-story. Shelley gave this story the same attention to depth as she gave the main one. I like that; so many of today's authors just do not write in this manner.Overall, however, I do have issues with the story. The premise of the story is that Dr. Victor Frankenstein is on a quest to create life. I think that in order to indulge the story one must suspend reality and choose to believe that man can create life, even in the late 1700s. Done. I do, however take great issue with the fact that in the story Dr. Frankenstein has finally succeeded in creating life when, all of a sudden, he looks at the creature he has created and, aghast, decides he has created something too hideous to allow it to be. Does he destroy it though? Nope; that would end the story. He allows it to remain \\"alive\\" and falls asleep. This of course, comes back to haunt him. The monster leaves, unhindered.Frankenstein learns language and the ability to read through watching a small family without their knowledge. I enjoyed this part of the story. He views them with great longing. His only wish is for communion. Human communtion? Why, he isn't human. But at the very least, human communion would provide him with some form of relationship, his deepest desire. Even his own creator chose not to commune with him. One of the characters from this portion of the book is blind and that gives the \\"monster\\" an opprotunity to speak with him, hoping that he can gain favor with him and then with the rest of his family. This character quickly recognizes the \\"monster's\\" true circumstances and it is summed up well in his words here:\\"Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.\\" Pg 91The next part of the story with which I take issue is that Frankenstein sets off on a long trek and somehow ends up in Geneva and on the property of the Frankensteins without any stated assistance in finding it. That's a bit neat, isn't it? Pretty unbelieavable; there again, it allows for the progression of the story.When the \\"monster\\" finally has an opportunity to speak with Frankenstein he says this:\\"God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image' but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am slitary and abhorred.\\" Pg 88He pleads with Frankenstein to create a female for him, one as equally hideous as he, as a mate with whom he can share love and life. He wants only to be accepted and have a person whom he can accept. Love...isn't that the desire of all people? And wasn't he created in the image of humanity? He offers that they will go live in the farthest reaches of the north where they will bother and be bothered by no one.\\"It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.\\" Ppg 98\\"Let me see that I excite the of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!\\" Pg 99Frankenstein's monster is so adamant of his need for a mate that he threatens to take vengeance upon Frankenstein if he does not concede to his request/demand. At once Frankenstein agrees that he will create a mate for him; the story progresses a bit, and, voila, Frankenstein rethinks his impulsive decision and determines he will not create another being. Queue the scary music. The monster vowed vengeance if a mate is not created for him; he followed him from Ingolstadt to Geneva; can engeance not be imagined by Frankenstein at this point?Vengeance...it arrives. There is death, and more death. Eventually, Frankenstein ends up chasing the monster to far reaches of the north. Did I say \\"vengeance\\". It doesn't take a lot to figure out what happens next does it?It's easy for me to pick away at the threads of a story. I am not a writer, am I? And so, I feel it would be unfair for me to do so without also finding praise where it is worthy. As I said, the story was compellingly written. I did not avoid or put off reading it once I began. I am glad I read it.And the premise...the creation of life by man. What a premise! It is one that only has greater implications today; perhaps moreso than Shelley could have ever even imagined. She wrote this stunningly well for it to have been written in the early 1800s.What if man could create life? Just because one can do something it does not mean it is something that should be done. Truly, I only believe that God can create life, eternal life, life with a soul. Science has been used by man, to do many things that have direct connections to life. Transplants are just one of those things; there is also research in the lab, on the cellular level. Scary stuff. Yes, the result of some of these things can be great good; it can also be great devastation, as this novel, in great foresight, warns.My husband and I had an interesting conversation with regard to all of this. Frankenstein initially was only sorry he created the \\"monster\\" because of its hideousness. Really? Isn't that fantastic?! He was sorry he created something so ugly! That begs the question that my husband raised: \\"If you could create aesthetically pleasing, beautiful life, would it then be okay to do so?\\" I hardly think so. And that is wherein lies much of the inherent beauty of this novel; it causes great thought.Some of my favorite lines from the book are:\\"A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a tranistory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not be enslaed, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\\" Pg 32\\"Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.\\" Pg 133It's only been days since I finished reading the novel. While it was still very fresh in my mind I wished to watch a well acclaimed movie version of it. I watched 1994's release \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" starring: Robert DeNiro, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hulce, Helena Bonham Carter. A bit of artistic license was taken with the story but not so much that the essence of the story was changed. In fact, I feel that it played out quite well. I was afriad it would be way too gory for me. It had its moments but I think it was handled well given the subject and necessity of including a certain amount of gore. The cultural significance of Frankenstein does not end with the questions it brings up. Immediately after watching the film our children and I were turned on an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show and who was mentioned? Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"When it comes to classic horror stories, this one tops them all. Even the most superficial reader could enjoy the thrill that swarms throughout this book, but it also contains many interesting ideas about what it means to be a monster, the pain and responsibility that comes with knowledge, and the emotional effects being an outcast can have on one. It makes you contemplate the power of love. I enjoyed this from start to finish."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It often occurs that the movie version of a classic novel differs greatly from the book, but in this case the difference was astounding. The original B&W movie bears almost no resemblance at all to the book. The \\"monster\\" is actually benevolent and good-natured, and becomes violent only after being mistreated. The novel focuses much more on Dr. Frankenstein's personal struggles with his own actions. Worth reading just to set the record straight. (I read the Kindle German translation.)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Free is always good. Good book. Sad in a way. If you haven't read it, what are you waiting for? Get to it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Although written in the 1800s....this book has powerfully relevant messages for the modern world. Shelley's style add to the effect of this captivating story. She warns of the dangers of over ambition and science while high lighting the importance of relationships."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This classic horror tale has, a bit surprisingly, its greatest horrors as horrors of the mind. To be sure, there are some horrible events, but the most severe horrors are those that transpire within the minds of Victor Frankenstein, and again surprisingly, to his creation, also referred to as his monster or daemon. The story is well known. An excited young Frankenstein believes he has deduced the means to create life. Shelley is mercifully scant with the details of his collecting parts and induing (a word Shelley likes and uses more than once) life. The tale is told by a sea captain in the Arctic Ocean, recorded as Frankenstein told it to him. As a young man, Frankenstein himself has a sharp mind and a positive spirit, and a family that's brought him up in a serene Geneva environment. The gist of the story is the excitement leading to Frankenstein's creation, and the sequelae of that action. The creation is not initially a brute. An intrinsic part of the story is how he becomes one. Influencing that transition strongly is the effect of rejection and isolation based only on external appearance. Also intrinsic is the effect this creation has on its creator. Both Frankenstein and the monster face issues of sanity, both of them losing it to one degree or another as the book progresses. The details are yours to read. The writing is lovely and clear to the modern reader. Issues involved in the story include the causes and effects of being socially isolated, the responsibilities a creator has to his creation and society, particularly when those responsibilities conflict, and to what degree one is bound by one's commitment in the face of uncertainty about it. In some ways, the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation changes over time, becoming almost synergistic or symbiotic. Well sequenced, clearly told, and provoking strong emotion in the reader to go with strong emotion in the characters, most often Frankenstein, but also the monster. Brilliant and worthy of its status as a classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Very good book, gave me a clear understanding of the movie I feared so much as a child.

She anticipated some of the themes in 20th century science fiction novels -- the danger of technology released from any ethical concerns and the unintended consequences of scientific experiments."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Like Dracula, this book did not tell the story I thought I already knew.Frankenstein is another one of those stories to have entered the Western consciousness so deeply that we're all convinced we know it. We see it in cartoons, in comedies, in serious movies, stories, and TV shows. We see the green-skinned monster with his arms out, shuffling along and moaning, the little girl with a flower, and the brave (if wrongheaded) townspeople bristling with torches and pitchforks. What we don't see is Shelly's monster, and whether I mean Frankenstein's creation, Frankenstein himself, or all of humanity is something you have to decide by reading the book.I was sympathetic to the narrator from time to time. Other times I caught myself saying internally \\"if you would have just reacted with kindness from the beginning...\\" In other words, I really debated who the monster was - he whose creation violated the laws of nature, or he who hated his creation.From what I understand, the former is the traditional reading of the book. Since Frankenstein played God, he was punished by his creation. He violated natural moral laws and he (and those around him) suffered the consequences. The references (both implicit and explicit) to physiognomy seem to point to this - the monster was simply a monster at heart, despite any hope we might hold out for him.I'm not sure I'm convinced that it wasn't just a literary tool in her hands. If so, she wielded it to great effect - I can easily imagine that my internal dialogue, my occasional sympathy for the monster's situation, was anticipated long ago. In my reading, there is no intrinsic evil in the monster's existence, even if Frankenstein himself sinned in bringing him into being.Instead, Frankenstein's primary sin was in casting out his creation based on physical appearance and on his place as a creature of a creature. Frankenstein's sin was a lack of love for the one he owed a duty of love to. Is this a purely modern reading, or is this what Shelley intended? I don't know, but I like to think she intended me to see it this way.Either way, the Frankenstein I thought I knew never forced me to ask the question. I'm glad I read this book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is Mary Shelley's frankenstein. What else can you say. It's a story that has launched several movies as well as giving the world a theme for many more tales and stories. I donated this to my local library."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It was the discovery of Frankenstein that prompted meFrankenstein's Daemonto write a sequel to this revered classic. What revelations blossomed when I read the book. Who knew the monster could communicate so eloquently. Like many, my acquaintance with Victor Frankenstein's creation came from Hollywood. Mary Shelley's novel is far removed from those onscreen versions. Many books have been written on Frankenstein: its themes, its place in literature in the broad historical perspective. Literary commentary on Frankenstein seems to be born daily. I had somehow escaped the required reading of Frankenstein in my high school and college days and my sympathy for the monster was rather muted based on film. However, Shelley's novel gripped me from the beginning. Despite what may be taught in literature classes across the world, a few points about the novel struck me. Readers must remember that Shelley wrote the book based on a kind of parlor game. Was it a mark of her genius that she was able to abstract her concepts from essentially a \\"waking dream?\\" The themes gathered in this book, for the time, are truly remarkable. Also, who is the villian here, if one is needed at all? If there is one, the answer is not clear cut. You must read the novel yourself to make the determination. While Karloff elicites a bumbling sympathy for his monster, Shelley crafts a complex creature who feels pain acutely - so acutely that he displays a wide range of human characteristics. He is, after all, a thinking, feeling creation. Love, sympathy, betrayal, murder,and gothic elements that veer into melodrama populate Shelley's novel. However, it is a great work and one, perhaps, that does not need a sequel - unless the desire to learn the monster's fate is too strong."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Early into Frankenstein, I might have given it 3 stars because of its old-fashioned language and letter-writing format. I was not interested in Walton's whining to his sister Margaret about loneliness and friendship. And I found this part of Shelley's writing stiff and uninteresting.That all changed once Walton rescued Victor Frankenstein from the icy sea near the North Pole. Frankenstein's story is great on a couple levels. First, the thriller element still has its appeal. You are fascinated that Victor has created life and you wonder at the consequences. You are sympathetic to the monster's plight, being alone in the world, considered grotesque by all those who see him. You want Felix, Agatha and their father to accept him. You want him to have a companion. And you are shocked at his murderous way of dealing with his loneliness.The overlying themes of love, friendship, loneliness and loss enrich this story and the question of whether Frankenstein has the right to create life makes you think about the larger responsibilities of man to his fellow man. Frankenstein pays dearly when he destroys the monster's female counterpart. The monster's shocking reaction and Frankenstein's horror, his mental collapses and the race against time make this story a true thriller.The story within a story within a story, etc. is an interesting structure, and not too hard to follow. This style and the letter-writing format are the only things that make Frankenstein seem less modern, but they are minor points.Note: I read the free Kindle version and I have seen a lot of debate over which version is the one to read. Shelley published then later edited and republished a second version. I believe the free one is the first edition. No complaints or criticisms. It was free and I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The classic original story by the original author. Read the book that inspired so many other writers and film makers. It still holds the attention even after all these years."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I began reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein ill-informed of the story of this classic novel. My conception of it as a pioneer of science fiction was the chief attraction of the book to me. I didn't even think of it as a horror story before my reading. Perhaps this is partly due to the popular imagery of \`Frankenstein' the monster as square-faced with deep sunken eyes, a figure which doesn't look particularly terrifying to me. On this account, I was rather taken back by surprise to find that in reality, the book is an immensely dark, depressing and tragic tale of broken dreams, misunderstanding, unfulfilled desire of love, revenge and murder. In the end, everyone in the story is a loser.The chain of tragic events started with Victor Frankenstein's daring and ambitious experiment to create life in the form of a human-like creature. Unfortunately, the good intention in the pursuit of science was not accompanied by careful anticipation of the consequences, and the young scientist was absolutely unprepared psychologically for the outcome of his endeavor. This led him to abandon his creation on the night of its awakening. The creature, with features hideous and detestable beyond description, possessed superhuman agility and endurance. It turned out to be extremely intelligent, gaining knowledge and learning the human language. It was capable of eloquent speech with the power to persuade others to sympathy. The creature was also overly emotional. Initially having a benevolent heart, all its actions were motivated by a desire of love, companionship and acceptance. However, its rejection by humans due to misunderstanding and its physical appearance led it to plunge into what would be the darkest of human nature --- selfishness, malice, and wish to deprive others of happiness simply as a revenge for the lack of happiness of one's own.The tale of Frankenstein is truly a classic horror story. It tells of the horrendous effect of the lack of love. It portrays the evils of a depraved mind. The reader is left either chilling in despair, or pondering how a tiny bit of love and compassion towards the unlovable might have changed the course of the story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"On writing this review, I had to remind myself this novel is 200 hundred years old and likely the first of its kind, and therefore as original as a novel can ever be. Today's horror writers would not get away with the long narratives, wordy dialogue and second (and third) accounts told through various people.But none of this really mattered. The rich and dense writing style did not get in the way of the story, which drew me in from the first. Poor Frankenstein is doomed the moment he creates the monster and immediately regrets doing so. I had to smile to myself when Frankenstein returns to see the monster gone. 'Thank heavens,' he thinks, 'my troubles are over!' As if! The monster denied a companion or of humanity returns to pick off Frankenstein's loved ones. I felt sorry for the monster that bore no resemblance to the Hollywoodized clich&eacute; we imagine. A creepy and dark tale; horror fans who omit this book from their reading list are missing out."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The novel starts a bit on the slow side,but as chaptersprogress and you become aquainted with Frankenstein'screation it will be difficult to put the book down.For a great work of horror fiction, the book has somepleasantly surprising moments. In particular whenFrankenstein's creature speaks to his maker and compareshimself to Adam who has been abandoned by God. Themoment is very touching, and made me feel pity andsorrow for the &quot;monster&quot; who never asked to be broughtinto the world"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I ordered extra copies of this book to give as gifts, but they all arrived with some damage, some with a lot of damage. I kept two with the least amount of damage. It feels more like a problem with the publisher rather than Amazon."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Sorry to you religious types, but this novel describes the human condition more powerfully than any \\"spiritual\\" tome. To say that it is about responsibility, scientific as well as parental, would be true but also misleading as to the true depth of the work. Like some greek tragedy, there are no truly evil characters in this story. Both Victor Frankenstein and his creation are the victims of their own personalities. Destiny or psychology? Ponder the creature's emotionally wrought story well, for it describes perfectly the psychology of a terrorist who is a human being with family, not some inhuman monster, who strikes out at those he perceives as uncaring to his real or imagined wrongs suffered at the hands of others. Many forget that this was a horror story. Though the creature started out innocent, in the last third of the novel it has matured into a destructive force. And what a force! It haunts Frankenstein like some demonic monkey on his back, stalking him and killing his loved ones while Frankenstein is unable to expose him to the world without admitting his complicity in the creature's existence, even if he were to be believed. At one point, he ends up in an insane asylum. The novel starts with Frankenstein's obsession to create life, and ends with his obsession to destroy what he has created. A timeless portrait of the human condition in all its wretchedness."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Okay, I can see the romanticism that is covered with this book but I cannot fidn the entertainment that is supposed to lie in every single book upon this earth. I am 15, and sitting here reading (and sleeping to) this book was just an absolute waste of time. The book was filled with constant tautology (constant repition of the same thing, just in different words) and filled with chapters that were utterly pointless. There is no horror to this story at all...It is about a living creature, shunned by society who eventually goes on the rampage. Gee, like that hasn't happened before. The story was generic, even for it's time. I think Mary was desperate, considering that the book wasn't even liked in the first place by the original romanticists authors of that time."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"i am getting into books on cd, as i hike a lot. listening to a book on cd while hiking is so relaxing ---- unfortunately, the narrator of this wonderful story sounds more like some guy reading instructions on how to assemble a machine, or install a heater, or the like. although his enunciation is perfect, he's horrid at putting anything of himself into the story. unless he truly is as boring, mechanical, and flat as his reading sounds.i don't understand how people can tolerate his droning."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was subjected to mostly Shakespeare in high school thanks to the personal tastes of teachers who didn't follow a more traditional reading list curriculum, so, sadly here I am reading Frankenstein for the first time at the age of 36.All of my previous knowledge of Shelley's book comes from the 1931 classic film starring Boris Karloff as the monster, a movie which I must admit I've never seen. But thanks to the monster's constant use in pop culture and other reference in society, like everything else we are subjected to on a regular basis, the image became an icon which became embedded in our brains as knowledge - knowledge I was completely wrong about!This is the perfect example of Hollywood taking a book, keeping its concept in a sense, and changing everything else. For example, Victor is not really a mad scientist living in some German castle high on a cliff using all kinds of bizarre machinery to give life to a body he stitched together from body parts that his assistant Igor picked up in some prison cemetery. Nope! Not it at all really. We don't even have the classic torch wielding mob scene in the end.Instead, Victor is a smart student who becomes interested in medical science while at university and discovers how to give life to that which is dead. He does steal body parts from crypts and such, but that's it. No castle. No glamorous laboratory. No Igor. Shelley doesn't even really go into the details about the creation of the monster itself. The monster just wakes up one day and Victor is immediately disgusted by what he's done.Six years pass before Victor even encounters the monster again, when Victor's young brother is killed and a beloved guardian is accused. Here, we meet a very intellectual monster who tells Victor the story of how he has been observing a poor family living in a cabin in the woods and has been learning by their everyday actions. The monster rattles on for a good fifty or so pages about everything he has seen and experienced. No one-worded \\"Massster!\\" mumbles for him! But it is from the monster's point of view that we really begin to see the intention of the classic story.This is a book about human suffering and acceptance. It is about our need in society to fit in and to have friends and companions like us and who do not judge us. Frankenstein has been called the first \\"science fiction\\" book, and while it lacks certain dark elements that might attract today's readers, it's still a good solid Victorian novel with underlying themes of the human condition.I'm glad I spent time with Shelley at this age; I certainly appreciate it more than I probably would have twenty years ago."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A great read - I really enjoyed it. The Kindle version is good quality conversion of the hardcopy. Would recommend to any book lover."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I BOUGHT THIS TO REFRESH MY MEMORY ON THE SKILLS AND ARTFULNESS OF THOSE WHO MASTERED THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BEFORE IT BECAME SO SHRUNKEN IN STYLE AND VOCABULARY.IT WAS A JOY TO READ...........TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT WRITING WITHOUT A SINGLE CURSE WORD.... AND I'M NO PRUDE!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"There isn't much I could say about Frankenstein that other reviewers haven't covered better and more thoroughly than I could, but here's one small fact: this book was first published in 1818, and it has NEVER GONE OUT OF PRINT.So for almost 200 years, people have been eating up this story: we read it when the Miss Bennets and Mister Darcys of the world were lighting up high society, and when Oliver Twist was asking for seconds, and when Holmes and Watson were hot on the case. We read it when Marlow was tracking down Kurtz in the dark jungle, and when Gatsby was courting Daisy, and when the Snopeses were taking over Yoknapatawpha County. This book has survived the Industrial Revolution, Queen Victoria, two world wars, the Great Depression, the atomic bomb, hippies, civil rights, Watergate, and 9/11, and WE ARE STILL READING IT.So why is that, especially when (as another reviewer observed) this isn't even an especially \\"scary\\" story?Here is one idea. When you think about it, every discovery since Galileo has undermined our previously-held concept of man at the center of the universe: we have been made to understand that our planet is not the center of the solar system, much less the galaxy, and that we have risen from apes instead of descending from heaven, and that our thoughts and personalities are largely authored not by our souls or natures but only by a series of complex chemical reactions. Every one of those has been an enormously hard thing for us as a species to come to grips with, and Frankenstein seems to foreshadow quite a bit of it: if a thing made from dead flesh and given life by chemical manipulation could be not only physically but morally and intellectually superior to us, then what place of pride will be left for us as a species?THAT is a scary thought, and no mistake. Still, I like to think that we will be able to do a better job than Dr. F. As you read, you might notice that he sets the bar pretty low."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I'd never read Frankenstein before, and I enjoyed it. The language is a bit obtuse, which sometimes was charming and sometimes annoying. The pace seemed a bit uneven to my modern sensibilities, with some sections waxing lyrical about things philosophical and other sections led by action. On balance, though, Shelley put in quite a lot more philosophy than action.I read the free Public Domain Kindle edition, and the layout left a lot to be desired. The sad thing is, there are literally dozens of editions of this book on Amazon, and most of them are IDENTICAL to the Public Domain one. Don't waste your money! Check the samples before you buy, or just overlook the flaws of the free edition and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"When assigned to read this book or an English class, I couldn't decide if I was excited or not. I knew that I must read it since it is a timeless classic and seems so popular. But at the same time, I've read many books from the same time period that were unbearable to read. This book, however, was an exception. I finished it in no time because the plot was enthralling and the language easy to understand. It is a rather short novel that provides lots of suspense, so I suggest it to everyone. But I'll warn you, it greatly differs from the movie. But as always, the book is always better."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's superb storytelling style sucks you in to Victor Frankenstein's world. The first appearance of the monster sent chills up my spine. As I was reading the book I felt compassion for the monster and resentment at Victor for being so selfish and heartless."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstien was pretty cool and it was really i ntresting"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"With lyrical language, the story of a university student who animates a creature composed of parts of various corpses unfolds, exposing the shallowness of the human mind and its immature horror of anything different or strange. The hideous creature that young Victor brings to life, is spurned by his creator and forced to find its own way in the world, which it finds is impossible due to general human hostility. Ultimately, it is the story of an irresponsible parent who makes a life he is unwilling and unable to care for, and the terrible results of such a mistake."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN is a novel full of suspense and mystery. This is a novel of its time and takes you back into history of a tale long forgotten. Mary Shelly does a good job by leaving you some questions to ponder about after you read this wonderfully written novel. Beautifully written and well composed, this book makes you yearn to read and read and read and read some more."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"i was forced to read this book in ninth grade and i thouroughly enjoyed it (to my surprise) i recommend it to not only school teachers, but parents as well-get your kids started early."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book depicts a sciencetist, Dr. Frankenstein, Tampering with life and death. I liked the way Shelly set the mode by telling all the emotions of both the monster and Dr. Frankenstein. I think any one who enjoys science fiction and horror should read this book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book but I was not too excited to read it. I thought boring &quot;classic&quot;....Fortunately I was extrememly surprised. Having never seen the movie but knowing of the image of the monster I was impressed by the actual story itself. I consider this book a gem and am happy that i was able to find it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is one of the best classic work I have ever read before. I enjoyed it so much, I read it again a few weeks later. I like how they use to write in the old days. The way she describes everything is so different to the way we do today, it makes it seem like a whole different type of writing. The revenge and plot is well set and the creativeness is beyond comprehension. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"While this classic book is considered to be one of the great masterpieces, I do not understand it. The plot has an ingenius concept, I admit that, but the wording is, well, too wordy. I'd rather read a summarization of the whole thing. The underlying ideas are enough to keep you reading for quite some time, but there was a point when I knew I had 70 pages to go and I considered quitting. Those last 70 could have been spent reading a wonderful classic monster tale...Dracula!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \\"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and Plutarch's \\"Lives.\\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?The Thirteenth Floor"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"In Mary Shelley's novel, there are various statements about the use of science. The field of eugenics is brought into question. The issue of cloning is brought into perspective way before its time. Shelley's novel is prophetic in so many ways for revealing the debates and scientific issues of contemporary times. From the recent FDA consideration of livestock cloning to genetically engineered crops, these controversial issues have been compared to Frankenstein science. Other past scientific innovations such as the use of pesticides like DDT have led to failure and proved dangerous for human civilization. These too were once compared to Frankenstein science, yet humankind persisted on using these chemicals, all for reasons of convenience and capital ambition on the part of corporations involved. We may see Shelley's Frankenstein as the first great scientific warning to humans in an industrial world. It may also be seen as the beginning of environmental awareness. This awareness concerns humans within their own environments such as parent/child relationships and childhood influences, as well as human impact on nature."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Unfortunately, the idea of what Frankenstein is about has been heartily ruined by it being adopted by the schlock film industry in the 20th century. This, the real thing, is much more amazing than any movie. When the book was published, it was also somewhat of a milestone in the history of women's writing as Shelley used a male pseudonym but when the novel became extremely popular, the truth came out and many realised that, hey, women CAN write just as well as men! The writing is at times difficult but not overly so.What I remember most from reading it is a deep sense of philosophical despair that the book conveys. Unlike most film versions, the book is based on the idea of the suffering creation and works like Milton's Paradise Lost. The creature is created and then abandonned to fate, unable to be a part of society due to its physical ugliness. Eventually, it becomes a fiend after a heap of misfortunes and psychological torture. In what I think is some of the best horror writing ever, Shelley brilliantly describes the psychological mindgames between Frankenstein and the monster. However, mixed in with the evil caused and suffered is a sense of solidarity - the monster is inflicted with a profound pain and is a philosopher as much as a murderer.The book also deals with movements like Romanticism and the Scientific Revolution and their relationship. Thus, Frankenstein's scientific obsessions are portrayed as unhealthy in terms of not being accompanied by a sense of emotional context.There is an absolute heap of other symbolism in the book but even from the basic text, there are so many ideas and emotions being presented to the reader that this deserves to be hailed as one of the great world classics."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I have read the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Hobbit, the Silmarillian, Star Wars books, Treasure Island, and much much more. But this is the best book I have ever read. I would recomend this book to almost anyone.P.S.Dont expect the flat headed monster from the movie (its nothing like that), but dont try to get bang that image from your head either it fun to see the contrast.P.P.S. I dont want to insult anyone but if you have limited vocabulary dont read this book, you simply wont apreciate it enough.P.P.P.S. Please excuse my horrible spelling."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I had to read this in my English class and I always wanted to read it. Mary had quite the imagination! The novel did not disappoint me whatsoever. I found it to be a great read and overall one of those stories that you just can't instantly judge as which character is the antagonist or the protagonist. The novel makes you think deeply about both Victor and the monster he created. It's the splitting image of a gothic novel and indeed just as scary and amazingly thought up as can get. To imagine one man creating his own human is an idea that is mad as well as amazing to think even of.The story starts off where a ship up North finds a man and takes him up on their ship, and the leader listens to the story the man tells in agony and woe. It's of Victor as when he was younger, and happy and fascinated in an idea he conjured, of creating his own human. But only discord happens afterwards, and Victor realizes he must destroy his creation before the whole human race is in danger. But alas, the monster has a negotiation, and Victor must decide if he will uptake it for the sake of his family and the rest of the world's safety.This is a story that will leave you thinking deeply and possibly shedding a tear. It's up to the the reader nonetheless, to wonder if they dare read such a chilling tale."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Rereading this work one wonders is it silly or not, and if it is not silly, why couldn't Mary Shelley have repeated her achievement. She lived a long life, enjoying fame as Shelley's widow.The work is seemingly as marvellous as ever. The wild story is perfectly balanced by the writing done in the classical style of the times. Frankenstein is, of course, a variant of the Prometheus myth. Both Byron and Shelley were working on the myth in their poetic careers when this novel was composed, rather as a lark.Mary Shelley describes Scotland and Switzerland, places of particular and significant happiness to her. Victor Frankenstein discovers he has the power of bestowing animation. He beholds the monster he created on a day in November.Victor learns from his father of the death of his younger brother William. Returning to his father's house, he discovers that a girl, Justine Moritz, is suspected of having committed the murderous deed. Victor puts forth the claim that Justine is innocent. Poor Justine is convicted and seeking absolution at the point of her execution, she makes a false confession. Victor feels that he is really the murderer. His visage shows despair, subject to detection by his cousin Elizabeth.Victor finds the demon at Mount Blanc. The monster reminds him that he is his creation. The monster recounts to Victor his adventures in voyeurism. He surreptitiously assisted the cottagers upon whom he spied. He gathered wood for them. From them he became aware of language and began to note their poverty. The monster educated himself by means of the works of Goethe, Plutarch and Milton. By showing himself, the monster caused the family to depart.He wants Victor to produce a female. Victor fears the disappointed fiend, but finds he cannot overcome his repugnance to make a mate for the creature. He is also faced with the duty and desire to wed his cousin, but he is conscious of the threat of death to his bride should he wed. Victor undergoes the death of his friend Clerval and imprisonment in Ireland. His fiendish adversary pursues him to the end. The finale is operatic. The doubling effect throughout the novel is masterly."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is at once firmly in the tradition of the Gothic genre that was so popular in the eighteenth century and one of the first of the science fiction genre that was to become so important in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It remains one of the defining works of both genres. The mad scientist, tampering with Nature with disastrous results, has become a stock character of SciFi/horror. As for the Monster itself, only Dracula rivals him as a horror icon. So the novel is important for its place in literary history, but does it still stand up on its own merits as an individual work?The first thing to say is that it is not the story you know from the Hollywood versions. The scientist is called Frankenstein and he created a man; the similarity ends there. All the details are different. The novel is a strange, obsessive tale, complex in structure and rich in psychological symbolism. The real, underlying themes are incest, sibling rivalry and the self-destructive power of guilt. I will refrain from further comment on the story itself, because you are better coming to it fresh and letting it unfold. In that respect, the Bantam Classic edition has an excellent introduction by Diane Johnson which however, is full of spoilers. Read it after the novel itself. Johnson's interpretation is along psychoanalytic lines which I normally find unconvincing but in this case I think are right on the mark.The author's style is always competent, often elegent, but never sublime. She is not the poet of the family. We are offered lengthy word-portraits of Alpine landscapes that are clearly intended to transport the readers but in fact leave them prosaicly in place.Not in the first rank of literature therefore, but so strikingly imaginative and replete with such memorable imagery that it is still worth reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I ask if Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is really all its cracked up to be. For generations, this book has been rated as one of the greatest horror stories of all time. I can understand at the time this was written it horrified many people, but did it really stand the test of time?My main problem with the book was the lack of information. So many things were left out, especially the details on how The Creature was actually created. The general writing style that Mary Shelley used when writing this book is very weak, and isnt supported enough by actual fact to make it beleivable. It seems that on many occasions, she avoids getting into details about things she knows nothing about, and just assumes the reader will accept this. I needed more than just excuses to keep me wanting to read on.This isnt my only complaint, we reach other voids as well. When The Creature is drifting around for months on end, he suspicously, and coincidentally, finds cloaths, food, and fire out of nowhere. These coincidences not only distract, but confuse the reader at times. It sometimes provokes the idea that maybe Mary Shelley herself doesnt know what to do, which ultimatelly supports my argument on her weak writing style.I was gravely dissapointed in this book after I finished it, and was left wanting much, much more out of it. It could have been much better. It could have been a satire on human life, or given a much deeper question on what is it to be human, or to be God, or what it means to be given life, or a soul. These were the questions I was asking throughout my read, and these are the questions that were never answered sufficiently enough.I read this book to get a taste of the classics, and what a good horror story might be like...if you want to read a horror classic, read The Exorcist, or Bram Stoker's Dracula...I always liked Lagosi more than Karloff anyways."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"God almighty. This book was a struggle. At points, i was halfway into it, but unfortunately, Shelley always said, &quot;No, stay an armlength away from me.&quot; I think the main thing i hated about it was how Victor was always saying, &quot;Oh, and my heart was always troubled. The monster led me to my self-destruction and doom.&quot; Shelley wrote this so the readers might sympathise with his plight, yet she should've paid attention to the saying, &quot;Show, Don't Tell.&quot; And the constant &quot;Words cannot describe the sorrow i felt,&quot; really did bug me as well. If you're published, that is, slap-bang in the middle of an industry based around words, you SHOULD be able to describe stuff, else you shouldn't be in the business. Maybe i just couldn't indentify with such an old book. Though i could with A Tale of Two Cities. Who knows? Don't read this book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A book that I always wanted to read, I should have left it on the shelf gathering dust. A very lengthy Preface, the name Frankenstein was not used until late in the 3rd chapter. First 3 chapters were extremely difficult to follow. The author's style was a bit bizarre. I think I'll stick to the movie for this one. I'm hoping it gets better the further in I go. I'm amazed they were able to write a screenplay based on this book. WOW."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"As I read the novel I thought always of how much better it could have been. Mary Shelley wrote that she originally conceived \\"a few pages -- of a short tale\\" but that Percy urged her to develop the story at greater length (p. 283). Mary should have stuck to her instincts. The book is way too long; it would have been much better as a short story.Moreover, the entire tale of the monster is ludicrous. We never learn anything about how the monster is created, but he certainly is a fast learner! The monster runs away from Victor Frankenstein and hides for several months, living off the land. From where he hides he observes a family's comings and goings. While hidden, he somehow gains the equivalent of a university education, reading Paradise Lost, Plutarch's Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter (p. 151). Then he flies into a murderous rage and demands that Victor create him a mate. When the monster realizes that Victor is stalling in the girlfriend-production department, he turns his rage toward Victor, follows him across many lands, and carves long, threatening messages into trees and rocks (pp. 253-254).The silly monster story might have been easier to take if the novel had left open the possibility that the monster did not exist. For most of the book, such a possibility is open. The entire novel is a series of stories within stories. Robert Walton, the Arctic explorer, writes letters to his sister. The reader's vantage point is that of Robert's sister. Victor tells Robert his story, which Robert passes on to his sister. Victor hears the monster's story and passes it on to Robert, who passes it on to his sister; likewise, with letters Victor receives from his father and sister; and so on. For almost the entire book, all that Robert knows about the monster is what he has heard from Victor. The better ending to the novel would have been for the monster never to appear except in Victor's version of events. In that way Robert, his sister, and consequently the reader would have been left with a choice about whether to believe Victor's kooky monster story or instead to believe that Victor either made it all up or is delusional. Unfortunately, that choice is foreclosed when the monster makes an appearance on board Robert's ship at the end of the book (pp. 270-275)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I'm probably biased, because I hate the romantic period for its namby-pamby emotional fireworks, and I think Frankenstein epitomizes that. Everything is so dramatic to the point of being histrionic, and annoyingly so. Honestly, the author's life and the inspirations for the novel were a lot more interesting than the novel itself, which was neither scary nor emotionally involving. If anything, I felt little besides sheer ire toward the protagonists. This book awakened my schadenfreude. Unless you have to read it for school or something, stick to the legend of Frankenstein as the monster, not his creator."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This was the dullest book I have ever read in my entire existence. The theme behind this book is excellent, but the writing is quite dry and wordy. Who ever named this so-called Story a Classic is not someone I would like to meet. Only the theme kept this book from being a ONE"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I read a condensed kiddies version of this when I was 8. I liked it better because it got to the point right away and lacked the increasingly dull indulgence in using zillions of paragraphs to describe things that don't really have anything to do with the story. It comes as a rather large surprise that this book is held in such high literary regard. Perhaps back in 18-something it may have been scary but by modern literary standards I'm afraid to say that Frankenstein is gibberish.Perhaps this stems from the fact that Mary Shelley just wrote this for a laugh. She, Lord Byron and another pal were on Holiday in Switzerland and had a competition on who could write the scariest story. Shelly instantly came up with this, which is probably why it seems so uninspired, unfocused and meandering. Granted, the subtext is interesting enough, even to this day, but that's not what the book is about.Shelley does go on a bit. Far, far too much time is wasted on set-up and over-description (her love of the Swiss countryside is evident in the dozens of pointless paragraphs describing the landscape) when it should really just be getting to the point. And then when the point finally arrives...it's underwritten. It feels like the book is nothing but filler. I mean when the monster/beast/wretch/daemon/creature is being created Shelly hardly writes anything. Where did Frankenstein get the parts? How did he put it all together? How did he actually bring it to life? She doesn't even have a full or half-full description of what the monster looked like. This could have been interesting in a macabre way but it's ignored.And what's the deal with the monster going from not being able to speak or understand language to talking like some sort of Oxford professor within a few months? It's so far-fetched and hard to swallow. Tho there is sympathy to be had for the monster and doubt whenever Frankenstein badmouths him.Another problem is the actual storytelling. The narration shifts 5 times in the course of this book and it becomes most annoying. I suppose this benefits the views of 3 different people but when they conflict in no way or contribute to the story what's the point? Frankenstein should have had tighter editing? For what it is it's a decent tragedy but NOT horror of any kind."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This particular edition uses the wrong text -- the bowdlerized 1831 text,rather than the original 1818 text. Most Frankenstein editions do in fact use the 1831 text, which was the only one available for 143 years. Then in 1974 James Rieger, in his _Frankenstein or, The Modern Prometheus: The 1818 Text_ (Chicago), compellingly made the case that the 1818 text is superior, in terms of both ideas and language. Almost all scholars of English Romanticism were convinced by Rieger, and now prefer the 1818 text.Frankenstein really is a great work, containing profound symbolism, disturbing ideas, unforgettable images, and some of the most beautiful prose in the English language. However, to appreciate these fully, it's necessary to have the best text. Fortunately, several editions of the 1818 Frankenstein are now available, edited by J. Paul Hunter (Norton), James Rieger (Chicago), Susan J. Wolfson (Longman), and D.L. Macdonald & Kathleen Scherf (Broadview).The masterpiece, Frankenstein, was really written by Percy Bysshe Shelley, one of the greatest poets in the English language. For this case, check out my own book, The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein.I would give Frankenstein five stars, but this edition merits only one."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I did not receive the exact book I ordered.

I realized that I had never put my opinion out there for non-subscribers. So, here's a little of what I said for the blog.I love horror fiction, especially classic horror fiction. I love female authors. I love people who are unconventional and who color outside the lines, as Shelley did simply by writing this novel. I should love this book.I don't.Let me clarify a point right up front: I was not expecting this book to be anything like any of the many film representations of the story. I remember that much from college. I knew up front that this book would not be anything like the movies (although had it been like \\"Young Frankenstein\\" I'd have married this book).What I was expecting was a thrilling horror novel with most of the suspense being internal in Victor Frankenstein. What I got was a snooze-fest. The novel is presented in epistle form, and I typically love epistles (there's a phrase you don't hear every day). \\"The Color Purple\\" is one such example. Frankenstein is not. The \\"internal suspense\\" in this novel is really more Dr. Frankenstein being a whiny little girl. He spends all of his time lamenting his mistakes but not doing anything about them until you are about 80% through the novel.I'm not saying that I hated the entire book. I just hated the first 40%. That first 40% consists of the exposition, which is ridiculously long, and Dr. Frankenstein relating his story to the letter writer. This is really dry because, as I stated before, Frankenstein is a whiny little girl. At the 40% point, the novel picks up. It actually becomes entertaining. \\"Did Dr. Frankenstein stop whining?\\" you ask. Nope. This is when the Creature speaks (that's right, in the book, the Creature speaks). From the moment that the Creature speaks (quite eloquently I might add) until he stops telling his tale, the book is absolutely riveting. I call him the Creature because in the novel he is never named and whether or not he is actually a monster is for the reader to decide. That's actually one of the themes of the book. I won't reveal whether or not I think that he's a monster. I'll let you decide that for yourself, should you choose to read it.Just be prepared to be bored for somewhere around 1120 locations.

WASTE OF TIME!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Published in 1818, Mary Shelley's best-selling novel Frankenstein has become famed and celebrated annually as thousands of children dress in various monster garb for Halloween, depicting themselves as Dr. Frankenstein's creation. Although Shelley's story is sometimes slow and explicitly focused on minor details, the work presents many issues that are still being analyzed today in literature and society. This is a testament of the timelessness of this great book.Like other authors of the time, Shelley comments on the innocence of childhood when Frankenstein says, \\"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.\\" Frankenstein's childhood was something that was precious and dear. This thought has remained popular in current literature. For example, in the television show Ed, the main character has this to say about the early days:\\"Explain to me why we're always so condescending towards our younger selves. We should be looking back in awe of who we were...all that passion, all that fire, all those dreams. And then it all fades and people say, \`Oh well, that's just part of growing up.' I think that's tragic.\\"The fascination of the idealism of children is still quite popular, not only in modern sitcoms but in blockbuster movies like Big or classic fairy tales like Peter Pan as well. Although Shelley does not fully explore this matter, she addresses an issue that still gains press today.Another theme of Frankenstein is equivalent of the modern day sociological issue of nature versus nurture. The creature begins his life full of love and cannot even conceive of why someone would murder another person. But as he faces constant abandonment and bitterness, the creature turns to acts that he once could not imagine. Placing the blame on his nurture, or lack thereof, the creature exclaims, \\"I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me?\\" Shelley's answer to these questions is not all too clear, although the fate and doom of Frankenstein sends a message that the scientist was partially at fault. But the answers that the creature would get in modern times are lucid and concise.A final issue that is still prevalent in society is mankind's attempt to govern the physical world through science. The results of Frankenstein's experiment indicate that Shelley strongly believes that man should not try to play God. Stephen Hawking is currently trying to unify physics, or combine the theory of relativity with the theory of quantum mechanics. Others try to clone life using DNA. Hawking recently said, \\"\\"If we find the answer to [cloning or the unification of physics,] it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we would know the mind of God.\\" Like Frankenstein, scientists are still trying to discover the mystery of life, and Shelley's commentary on this absorption is appropriate even today.This book is slow at times but in the end worth the read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Finally, a classic novel that keeps your attention from beginning to end. I think what makes this novel so great is that it is so different then what you originally perceive the story to be about. It's nothing like any of the movies that Hollywood has created over the years. As you read, you find yourself completely in tune with everything that Victor Frankenstein feels. Sometimes it seems as if the story starts to just drag on, but just at the right moment, something new happens that grabs your attention and rekindles your interest! While writing this novel, Mary Shelly left out what seems to be some very important details. This, at first, may seem frustrating! But as you read on, you realize that it only gets the you to use your imagination to create parts the parts of the story that are missing. This actually seems to make the story a little more dramatic and scary then it would have been if Shelly had filled in all the blanks for you. There are some very interesting things going on in this book if you read between the lines. While reading, you must ask your self various questions about why Victor decides to create the monster and is there a connection to this and the death of his mother? I won't spoil any more for those of you who have not read this book yet. All in all, I was very impressed with this book and really enjoyed reading it. It is by no means, hard to follow or understand. I believe that anyone who reads this book, will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I bought this recording so that I could introduce my seniors to the Romantics and I really am pleased. The actors who portray the main characters all do an excellent job bringing to life a book that could very well be hampered by the limitations of audio.Also, it was nice to show my students that their concept of Frankenstein is decidedly not the real story. The recording does a wonderful job of reflecting the major philosophical statements that Mary Shelley wanted to express to the reader.If you are going to share this with a class, it would be a good idea to connect the ideas of education, as well as the Promethian connection. Not only does the story make a connection between Frankenstein and the daemon's education, it provides a connection between Shelley's education and that of the daemon's. I feel that one of the strong points of the book is the feminine interpretation of education (not necessarily a feminist viewpoint of education). It is important to expose high school students to women writers who express strong ideas and transcend diaries and letters to their daughters.That said, I have two minor complaints:1: The audio level is not evenly balanced. I found myself turning up the volume to allow my students to hear the important dialogue and turning it down because the voices were instantly too loud. Alone this would not be a problem, but in groups it certainly was.2. While the music fit the mood of the story, there wasn't enough of it for my taste. I would have liked a bit more to punctuate some important moments.If you want to listen to this alone, while sitting quietly, this is a wonderful experience. However, if you want to have a group to listen, be prepared for volume problems. Essentially this is a really good abridgment and reading, but the sound is a bit troublesome."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Set in remote European landscapes, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein transports her readers into a gothic tale of sympathetic characters driven by success, revenge, acceptance, and grief. A great book to have on a snow day with hot tea and a cozy blanket."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I thought that the book was good from the beginning. It starts out with people crossing the Arctic Ocean on a ship and they find Victor Frankenstein half alive on an iceberg. The rest of the book is his account of the creation of his monster and how he came to be in the middle of the ocean. He tells the people about how the fiend he created killed most of the people in his family and his best friend. He tells them how he tries to stop the monster from killing any more people by he trying to destroy his creation. I would probably read it again, even though it was a little boring at times."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Subtitled &quot;the modern promethius&quot; you find in this book lots of criticism of the promethian impulse to go too far and achieve too much.

As a sophmore in highschool I was required to read it in for my English 2 class. I glanced through it at first and thought it to be quite verbose and overly detailed. My assumptions were wrong. When I actually got into the book I began to really enjoy it. I realized that the many details help you visualize what is going on more. Mary Shelly creates a very imaginitive and creative plot about a man who tampers with the laws of nature. She combines science and fantasy to create one of the greatest novels of all time. So if you have the patience to read this somtimes slow but fabulous book, I definately recommend you do so."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Among the many themes of Frankenstein, one of them is that of friendship, ambition, and the conflict between the two. The message is that the deeper need of the two is friendship, but that we are susceptible to the temptations of ambition, which can destroy friendship.Ostensibly, Victor Frankenstein had an unselfish mission to \\"benefit all mankind\\" with his scientific project. His \\"selfless\\" ambition failed him and proved to aim at self-glory because he wanted to create a race that would bless him as its father. In Captain Walton's second letter to his sister, we learn that although he has a well-trained crew, he has no soul companion; this need he regards as a \\"most severe evil.\\" Walton's exploration of the secluded and frozen Arctic serves as a metaphor for how his ambition has removed him from society. His ambition even threatened his own and his crew members' lives when ice surrounded and trapped his boat. Likewise, this is where Victor's ambition leads him when he's hunting down the monster in futility. The message is that if one sets out ambitiously to benefit mankind, once that person has acheived their goal, their prominence sets them apart from the same society they set out to benefit.Victor had a much more intense ambition than Walton, with corespondingly more disasterous results. As Frankenstein prepared for his project, he isolated himself from his friends and family to laboriously study the sciences and he would later postpone his marriage for this project. The embodiment of his ambition, the repulsive monster, would eventually slay several of Victor's loved family members, including his fiance on their wedding night. Even the monster feels as his deepest need a human relationship, which he has none and which is the very thing that turned him from good to evil. While observing an impoverished family, \\"the bitter gall of envy\\" arose in the monster. He considers them rich because they have the companionship of each other even though they are in financial poverty. When Frankenstein rejects the monster's pleas to create for him a mate of the same race, the monster sets out on an unstoppable path to destruction and an ambitious one indeed. The novel links ambition with destruction, particularly destruction of companionship and conveys friendship as a great , if not greatest, need for man.I don't think the story conveys that all ambition is destructive. At the end of the story, Victor has great regret for the results of his ambition, but he still has pride for his effort. Although he cautions us that we would be better off to believe our \\"native town to be the world,\\" he adds, \\"yet another may succeed.\\" You could interpret this as Victor not \\"learning his lesson;\\" that mankind will continue to give in to harmful passions. Another, much different analysis could be that this story portrays that limited ambition, integrated with society and not aimed at self-glory, can be virtuous. After all, for the teenage author of a classic, enduring novel to tell us that all ambition will destroy us would be a contradiction."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is one of the most misunderstood and underappreciated works of fiction in the English language. EVERYONE should read it- it's very short,very readable, and a really entertaining story. You THINK you know the story from the movies, but it's actually quite different. Frankenstein's monster is not the lumbering lummox the films make him out to be- rather, he is articulate, sensitive, and as soft-hearted as he is embittered. The central philosophical question of the book is whether or not the \\"monster\\" (or, as Shelley referes to him, \\"the fiend\\") is really human. The question of the creature's humanity is muddled by the fact that he is entirely rational and seems to have a well-defined sense of morality, although his morality might not be shared by all the readers. Some will argue that the creature is indeed human, other's will argue that he is merely a sociopath created out of the remains of formerly human souls and is therefore more or less an organic robot. A lamentably short read, this story will stick with you and will forever change your opinion of the hollywood version of this monster. This edition is dirt cheap, so you can't afford NOT to read it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Everyone is familial with Karloff's image of the lumbering, living dead character of the Frankenstein movies but this icon of Americana beirs little resemblance to the true monster of Mary Shelly's imagination. Frankenstein is more than a tell of gothic horror. If that is what the reader is after any number of works by Steven King or Dean Koontz will suffice. The story of Frankenstein however, is one of love, hate, seeking acceptance, madness and rage gone unchecked. Not only is Frankenstein a great read but it also has the distinction (at least to my knowledge) of being the only novel to be told from three separate points of view, Dr Frankenstein's, the Monster's (who goes nameless through the entire story), and a third unattached view of a ship Captain who finds himself to be the soul witness to the final conflict between the two. Few stories from this time period transport themselves to the present with the same amount of relevance as Frankenstein. Anyone who doesn't find time to read this classic is cheating themselves out of a wonderfull story, that will mean much to them."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This audtio CD arrived quickly and had now signs of use.

I wish I had read this first, because it gave me more of a feel for what was happening in the sequel, but still, it was easy to read them out of order.The original book strikes me as more of a cautionary tale for wandering men of the time period! It's hardly the \\"horror\\" story it turned into due to Hollywood magic. It was horrific, but not a horror story as it evolved into. It was a book about losing sight of what is important, about losing yourself to your passions, of redemption, of pain and longing, but really, the \\"horror\\" aspect of it is secondary in my mind.I tried desperately to figure out which character was the \\"bad guy,\\" but it turns out that there really wasn't one. Frankenstein and his creation were both equally guilty and equally victims of each other. I felt for both of them, and it was hard for me to think of the creation as a monster. I was profoundly moved by his plight, but at the same time, I wondered that he could speak so eloquently and be moved by beauty, yet could commit such crimes and feel justified. He was definitely torn, as was Victor Frankenstein.The style of writing and use of language is superb and I can't recommend it more highly. If you hesitated because you thought of this as strictly \\"horror,\\" well, don't let Hollywood's butchering of this magnificent story deter you.

Students are excited. Services great. Book awesome."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"After reading this, I realized I am Frankenstein's monster. Just kidding. The language can be hard to comprehend at times, sometimes because it is truly incoherent or stilted. It wasn't scary. Even so, there are far passages that read so well they are like smelling a fragrant flower, the descriptions so clear and detailed yet eloquently stated. However, it's hard to rate this book above three stars because near the end I really had a hard time following it. It seemed the monster had died. Frankenstein came upon a sledge and his nemesis was dead, or so it said. Following that, the plot became nebulous and the passages were so exasperating I skipped many paragraphs until the point where Dr. Frankenstein had died, not the monster. Then I had...the rest of the story. But on the plus side, the plot was not predictable. With so many pluses, and so many minuses, I rate this story three stars.Perhaps one day we will be able to use DNA material to recreate a Neanderthal, creating a true to life Frankenstenian monster.My edition was close to the original, if not the original text, the cover differing from that depicted here."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Far from the caricatured, cartoonish Frankenstein that appears every Halloween, Mary Shelley's monster is a creature of refined human feelings, longing for love and acceptance, who turns to murder only after being repeatedly rejected by every human he encounters because of his hideous appearance. It is his creator who is truly despicable because he regards his own creature as a demon and an enemy, never once admitting or accepting his own guilt for rejecting the creature who needed love and acceptance from him most of all.Shelley's classic leaves plenty of room for speculation -- just what message was she trying to send, what allegory was she trying to make, etc.? However, one can set all these aside as I did, and simply enjoy this as a well-written book. It is old-fashioned in style and language, but that makes it even more obvious what a truly phenomenal and ground-breaking book this must have been at the time it was published.George Guidall's narration is excellent and adds much to this classic novel."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The opening words of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley tell us that we're in for a great ride. And a great ride it is indeed. Filled with lust, confusion, anger, vengeance, pain, death, and most importantly, life, Frankenstein is a work of art that has enthralled readers for almost two centuries, since its publishing date in the year 1818.At the beginning of our story, we're introduced to Robert Walton through his letters to his sister, Margaret Saville. We learn that he is about to embark on a journey that will take him to the top of the world, the northern pole. He excitedly describes the stages he progresses through as he prepares for his trek, but with one complaint. Robert Walton yearns for a friend to share his travels, excitement, and passion for knowledge with.Not too many pages later, we encounter a strange man who joins Walton on his ship near the north pole. This stranger proves to be a friend to Walton, but not quite the friend he was originally yearning for. When the stranger learns of Walton's desire to explore and gain large amounts of knowledge possessed by few others, he tells us his story in an attempt to dissuade Walton from continuing his voyage. The stranger tells us of his life as Victor Frankenstein, creator of the most horrendous monster ever to disgrace the whole of earth with his presence.I thoroughly enjoyed this tale written by Mary Shelley. I loved the book and was captivated from the moment I flipped the pages to \\"Letter 1\\".

Of course I have seen the movie. This book is nothing like the movie. After I understood that it was written during the Romanticism period than it was actually a pleasure to read. At nineteen, how old Mary Shelley was when she wrote Frankenstein, she wrote an amazing and deeply profound story of a being that is looking for what everyone of us look for: the comfort of companionship and love of another. Human beings are meant to be in relationships of one kind or another. Mary Shelley also does an admirable job showing the anguish of Victor. You see the love,support, and concern of his family. It was thought-provoking and poignant. I found myself hoping the being would find what he so desperately craved. i felt his frustration at such an injustice, as he saw it. If you have seen the movie I strongly recommend Frankenstein. I promise, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Their product description was spot on. During the holidays they shipped it in an expeditious manner so as to be under the tree on Christmas morning. Well done."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is the story of Victor Frankenstein, a scientist in pursuit of greatness. His goal is to create a human out of sewn together parts of corpses. When the creature comes to life Victor instantly regrets his progress. His creation is a hideous monster that Frankenstein fears. The remainder of the book documents Victor's exploits in trying to capture the monster and conquer his fear and depression. Throughout the book the reader gets to hear the story from several different perspectives: a captain of a ship on a voyage to the North Pole who runs across Victor on the ice, Victor himself, and even the monster's side of the story. The end of the book is quite bleak and very depressing, but the idea discussed is one to think about: When does science go beyond morals and ethics into cruel punishment?There was everything I love to be in a book in this book: mystery, a little bit of romance, and a great adventure. I love the way Mary Shelley keeps her audience reading by not revealing anything until the right time. The reader begins to question what is about to happen in the story and reviews all the possible outcomes of the situation.The only drawback with this book is that the vocabulary of the characters is very sophisticated. The book is beautifully written, but some parts are difficult to understand because of the language used.This book is a great piece of literature with action, adventure and suspense. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good adventure.Elizabeth EdmondsonLandrum High SchoolLandrum, SC"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The book, Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, really surprised me. I thought it would be a boring book, with language I didn't understand, and a plot I couldn't get into. But let me tell you I was WRONG. Yeah, it did start a little slow but once you got amerced into the plot of the creature and Frankenstein's hatred for one another, you couldn't really say you had enough of it.In this book it starts off with letters from a boat captain to his sister, then we get to see Frankenstein's story, inside that is the creature's, and inside that is the story of the family in whom the creature watches. In other words, a big giant story sandwich. The tone of it could get a little boring and bleak but what was actually going on could never be. From all the deaths in the book it could be labeled a tragedy, but the tragic part was how the creature actually loved Frankenstein and blackmailed Frankenstein, so he, the creature, wouldn't be lonely. But when Frankenstein dies, so do all of his dreams of a loving life.But I agree this is still a sci-fi book, but with the plot twists of a tragedy.Faith HowellLandrum High School"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"for the people who hated this book and gave it poor reviews. Really missed out on what may be the greatest novel of all time. For me it's hard to put down. And the themes are deep and everlasting ones that humans will forever struggle with. Life and death, God vs science, good and evil, spiritual themes, and social ones also, all wrapped up in a GREAT story. Oh well, you can't expect everyone to get it and resonate with it.One thing about this Rieger version: it says it \\"reproduces for the first time in more than a century the text of the first edition published in 1818\\". Not true. Donohue produced at least three editions (I have them) around 1895 that are all the 1818 text.Just an FYI.Believe the hype! This book is hard to surpass. I virtually never give 5 stars to ANYTHING. This deserves it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It is pretty surprising that something come up with almost on a whim toprovide a diversion has come to be such an important text for twogenres, both horror and science fiction.Victor Frankenstein's obsession with the creation of life ultimately ends in tragedy and death for those around him."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \\"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and Plutarch's \\"Lives.\\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I enjoyed Frankestein, but I don't recommend the book for kids, unless they are really good readers. There are many words that are harder for kids to understand because it was written in old english. Frankestein was written very well even if it was a harder book.

I don't want to discorage young readers from reading this book, but you'll understand it much better if you wait a couple of years to read it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Reading Frankenstein and thinking it would be like the movies in Hollywood is totally wrong. When reading Frankenstein in the beginning it is somewhat slow but turns gruesome. People get killed even in their innocents. The monster is truly evil, not nice. Middle of the book becomes interesting but you feel sorrow and some sympathy for the monster. In the end the monster himself reveals the complete truth of what he is. This may sound like a book report but feelings cannot capture the feeling that erupts inside during the novel.If you look at the novel from a critique point of view it is a horror but still spellbinding. The story is not just simple and scary but helps you understand the nature of emotions and the beast inside our hearts. Love and wanting of acceptance is an emotion that is not understood easily but this book uncovers the secrecy on how one is wanting to be accepted in society.For the people who like books of horror but no meaning this book is okay. People who want a true classic but be mystified by a monster that is untaimable this is an excellent book. If you are looking for a sweet feminine or just a normal novel this might not fit you. This novel in my opinion is a true classic and you can tie it to todays world easily even though this was written over 100 years ago."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"In an age where scientific knowledge is rapidly expanding, Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is especially important. Science warrants both caution and careful use of conscience from those who unlock its secrets; for what is labeled \\"progress\\" can unexpectedly backfire and cause harm.Early in the novel, Victor Frankenstein reveals his deep desire to acquire knowledge of science. The young man proudly proclaims that he will achieve \\"far more\\" than anyone else ever has and that he would \\"pioneer\\" new ways to \\"unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\\" He diligently carries out his operation without carefully considering the consequences of his actions. For Victor, completing the task takes priority over worrying about the possible consequences.One can easily draw a direct connection to our own world. Genetic researchers are often faced with ethical dilemmas in which others accuse them of \\"playing God.\\" Perhaps the day isn't too far off where one will be able to order not only clothes but also kids from catalogs. Nike kids would be better athletes and Calvin Klein could sell children that would blossom into beautiful models.Today it is just as important for scientists to proceed with both caution and conscience. If, like Victor, they work only to achieve a goal at any cost, it is very possible that the holocaust of the new millennium won't be as visible to the public because the weak, the handicapped, the diseased, and any so-called \\"undesirables\\" will be silently discarded before they ever have any kind of a chance.Should be required reading for high school and above."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is the true and orginal Frankenstein story. My high school teacher recommended this book to me and I am grateful she did. This book is packed with suspense as well as horror. You will be drawn into this book and will feel like you are actually living in Frankenstein's world. Mary Shelley is a great writer and everyone should read this classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein---The word conjures up an image of a gigantic monster out to demolish mankind and everything attributed to it,an ogre created by man bent on dissolving his maker in utter misery. \\"Frankenstein\\" has travelled over the ages to become synonymous with destrution,blood,murder,havoc,fear and everything and anything that's even remotely associated with evil. \\"Frankenstein\\" has become a cliche.And that's exactly where the greatness of the authoress Mary Shelley rests. The plot in the novel is simple enough---a young ardent man steeply soaked in \\"natural philosophy\\" creates a monster with his genius,regrets his doing,asunders it and then suffers the agony of his own architect---but the classic proportions of the tale are vividly accounted in the entwining philosophies,morals,allusions and allegories that it invokes to. It's indeed a wonder that Shelley could've exploited an innovative, simple idea to garb it into a massively broad saga at the tender age of 19,but then again, that's what you call greatness. Take Mozart for inatance. He was composing symphonies and sonatas when he was barely six!Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" begins when a friendless, doughty and resiliently ambitious seafarer Robert Walton saves a strange man from the brink of death amidst a sea of ice whose first words are:\\"Before I come on board your vessel, will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?\\" This is Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein and the whole novel revolves around him and the monster he had created. Walton writes to his sister Margaret in England about the fall of Frankenstein from greatness and as the tale unfolds from the man of science's own shivering lips, we've taken on a ride on a wave that flatters to deceives.Victor Frankenstein is a young Swiss who leaves his hometown Geneva to pursue natural philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt. His knowledge of Cornelius Agrappa, Alberta Magnus and Paracelus pushes him towards a realm beyond the confined boundaries of chemistry and two years of dedication and devotion and Professor M.Walton's \\"words of fate,enounced to destroy\\" him and he reaps a result of magnanimous proportions. He creates \\"the daemon\\", his \\"own vampire, my(his) own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to men\\", a monster whose gigantic stature,ugly features,hoarse voice and crude appearance repugnates its maker and Frankenstein denounces him. And denounces his fortune,career, family,peace of mind and charm of life.For the monster,unbaptized and solitary,comes back again and again to haunt the Swiss. It first kills his youngest brother William,then transfigures into the cause of the doom of the innocent Justine Moritz who's falsely charged with the child's murder;the ogre puts Frankenstein's childhood friend Henry Clerval to death,mortifies his father to his death-bed,destroys the life of his love Elizabeth on their wedding night,allures his creator to death's dwelling and ultimately drags himself to te inevitable end.The plot then is as plain as white paper,as ever so slightly whispered earlier, but that the scope of discussion of characters and events is as extensive as the horizon is illustriously brought to the picture as we explore the landscape of \\"Frankenstein\\". The reader cannot help but sympathise both with the creator and his creation---one repenting his \\"unhllowed arts\\" for being \\"not in deed,but in effect\\" the curse and murderer of one's family,and by extent,mankind;the other willing to harmonise oneself into the fabrication of society when one's physical features are not withstanding. The notion of Frankenstein an ignorant and languid person pets is that of a hideous fiend mustered from animation pictures and cartoons but the essence of it transcends much farther from this simple and debvastating prejudice.The theme of the novel,that of man inviting his own destruction and being chased by his own myriad forces of vices,is disturbing enough and the sophistication even more muddling. Frankenstein is a distorted harmless young man who realises his blunder when it's too late. A man shadowed by a curse he himself has raised and who loses one beloved after another is always going to transpire confusement and indecision and so does he who actually makes the novel happen. He seeks revenge but knows not how,he is compassionate towards his \\"fiend enemy\\" but refuses to show it. The reader embarks on his queerness not to fulfill his promise and manufacture female partner for his creation. Frankenstein reasons with himself that two fiends would be one too many for the world to endure and their posterity could aspire to evilry. But was he right to believe what Brutus did of Caesar in William Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\"? That \\"He would be crown'd:/How that might change his nature, there's the question.....Fashion it thus:that what he is,augmenter,/Would run to these and these extremities? That he should kill his own child and \\"sport thus with life\\"?And indeed was Frankenstein's monster as terrible and catastrophic as he deciphered him to be? In the struggle of this fiend to congregate his being with men and their ways,we find an underlying sense of pathos and self-consciouness expressed bluntly and confusedly. At one moment, the colossal beast stoops down to piti and submission:\\"Was I then a monster,a blot upon the earth,from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?\\" On another occasion,he tranmutes into a figure of abhorrence and disastrous:\\"You are my creator, but I am your master;obey\\". This juggling of self-assertion and self-submission makes the giant a confused,complex individual as well as a victim of circumstances since his motives are misconstrued. The cruel end of his strangely pleasant relationship with the cottagers and the rustic soughting \\"to destroy the saviour of his child\\" provide testimonies. The reader discerns his parallel with Shylock in Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\",whose tale too is a tragedy of circumstancs, the awkwardness and hardships of a Bohemian surviving on the fringes of human attachment.The similarities between the Creator and the Creation are in abundance and are stark. Both are equally anguished---the Creator rueing His germ of an idea to build anything so splendourly ugly and the Creation questioning his independence and the Creator's need to make him. This is the allegory,or if you will,the theme of of Shelley's darkly eerie narrative. The invokation to the first-person narrative,the plethora of similes and metaphors,the lofty diction and the intricacy of language augment to the authoress's aim to portray the dark shades of life on a more gentle and lighter backdrop. In Frankenstein's pursuit of his monster,the authoress alludes to man's constant hunt of vice in his own self,in the fiend's direct conveyance of his mortal,spiritual and moral wounds,Shelley reveals the hopelessness of the socially deprived;in the end, she hungs upon the wall the conclusion that all such chases ollide with. Herman Melville's classic \\"Moby Dick\\" ran on a similar line and it,like \\"Frankenstein\\",is a tour de force. First publisher in 1818 and set against the era of the eighteenth century, Mary Shelley's intuitive idea dressed in wondrous clothes sparkling with divine metaphysics and resonding portayal of life,truth and futility sustains a powerful impact on us even long after w've closed the book and started chasing our own Frankenstein's monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"even though i do not read a lot of books, this one started out extremely difficult for me. as i continued to read it, it became very interesting and exciting. the &quot;old english&quot; style of talking is what threw me the hardest loop. I guess all in all, frankenstein was good reading and maybe in a couple of years i'd read it again."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"An excellent classic about Victor Frankenstein and his creature. Mary Shelley's only book was a great success and is full of suspense and insanity. Although it may be a great story, it is not for readers who want an action-packed, fast-paced book. Chapters and events tend to drag. Overall an excellent instant classic that shall never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book is about a doctor who creates a monster from dead people. The monster walked around at night. The towns people were frightened because the monster was ugly and different from them. When the towns people chased him with a bat, the monster became frightened and started to fight back."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"All right, I agree, Frankenstein is a very tedious book to read. It's repetitive, rambling and very often, boring. The term \\"miserable wretch\\" can be found practically every two pages, Shelley likes to have her characters write marathon-length letters to each other and the good Dr. Frankenstein has a tendency to go staring at mountains for chapters at a time. If you can ignore all these imperfections, Frankenstein truly is a rare gem indeed. It has withstood the test of time by infecting many-a-generation with the vision of a solitary, man-made creature and his tortured creator. More movies and books have been created around Shelley's idea's than I have fingers. A tour down a local CVS during Halloween will yield you with at least five different \\"Frankenstein\\" costumes to pick from. Frankenstein is a part of our culture. Media and commercialism aside, Frankenstein also has a lot to say about our science as well. I honestly can't think of any other fiction book that expressed the same concern for the state of bio-technology and ethics than this novel. Worried about test-tube babies? Human testing? Cloning? This book has it all. And to add more icing to the cake, this book was one of the first to worry about it. Sure, the text might be unrefined. But the idea itself is worth the 233 pages, and enough to make me give this book a 3.5 on the rating scale.. Read this book when you have the spare time, you'll be pleasantly surprised!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I've seen other people who have rated this book well, but cannot understand where they see the ingenious in this book. Personally when I started reading this I hoped for a scary book that infered on human behavior. What I got was a drawn of boring story set in 4 parts.The beginning is somewhat interesting and delves on Frankenstein the scientist learning about life and developing the monster. This part has a somewhat boring start, but once he starts making it it goes faster. Then once hes done with this the monster is made..... and it slows down to a miserable pace.From here it will have short spurts of something exciting, like for seven pages, then it goes into a fifty page boring streak, prattling on about details you don't care about. If it wants to emphasize that Frankenstein is lonely, it takes 25 pages of examples when five would be sufficient. From about the time Frankensteins monster is born you want it to die and let the story be over with because it is so boring. Not to mention predictable. I could predict the deaths of some of the people fifty pages away! Let me just say leave this book on the shelf and don't start to read it. You'll hate the book, and yet you'll probably make yourself finish it just because you started it. At least thats the way it was with me."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley brings up a well argued topic. Who has the authority to bestow life upon a creature? That is about the only thing that holds water in the book. The book starts out boring................ and stays boring. She wants to write a chilling horror story or a romantic novel, but she only skims the surface. The only exciting thing about the book that gets you hooked is the vividly designed cover."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"OK, I was really excited when I was given this book as a present. I was redy for entertaining, but cultured writing, new philosophic ideas, and beautiful prose. The only thing I found was philosophy, and not much if that. This book was probably much more appreciated at the time, for it was truly a &quot;novel&quot; idea. With all th enew science fiction and horror novels of the time, the theme seems somewhat generic, and the philosophic ideas presented about man are nice, but the story seems to be put together hastily and without much consideration for details. For example, one second, Frankenstein (the creator of the monster) is studying chemistry at a university, the next thing we know, he has the ability to &quot;bestow life on an inatimate object!&quot; Where did that come from? Can we be any more random? Such a complex story should have been longer than 206 pages; perhaps a trilogy would have been more effective. Only read this if you are lookibg for a good thinking book, and have A LOT of patience."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein's a classic, and I'm sure that most of you reading this will have either read it or at least heard it discussed. Shelley's novel is very interesting both from a historical perspective and in how it approaches the horror genre. Frankenstein is a book, however, not an interesting piece of memorabilia, and my high expectations while reading it were not so much matched as smashed to pieces.When compared to other classic horror authors, Shelley's outlook is interesting in that it seems to be one profoundly antithetical to horror. Shelley's world is a fascinating place passionately described. Landscapes, waterways, and glaciers are all rendered vivid at the stroke of her pen, and there is a vastness to her settings - to the waters which, at one point, bear her protagonist haplessly away from his destination or from the freezing arctic where both the tale's frame and conclusion takes place. All that might be superficially relatable to the feeling of the world as a dangerous place that one gets with many horror authors, but while Shelley's world is a dangerous place, it's never a frightening one. That's not to say that Shelley does not attempt to invoke fear, mind you, but her fear comes entirely from what's known to man, from what man creates. The natural world here is, at times, both invigorating setting and potentially lethal setback, but it is never the enemy itself, and there is never the claustrophobic feeling that Shelley's world is populated by the unknown. Her horror comes purely from man, a horror that is frightening precisely because it comes from man.Shelley is, in many ways, the exact opposite of Lovecraft (who tackled similar themes in Herbert West - Reanaimator). Lovecraft took a resolutely rational approach to portraying the irrational, an atheist evoking towering monstrosities to show just how empty our world really is. Shelley, on the other hand, takes an irrational route to portraying the rational. Shelley's writing isn't precisely spiritual, but she does constantly invoke the supernatural with regards to chance, motivation, and the outcome of events (\\"It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter destruction.\\" (p. 23)), all the while making her monster strictly scientific and rational in nature, albeit impossible by any natural laws. The romanticism of the text - the feeling that the world is something vast and wondrous all around us to be felt and experienced - shifts for the chapters that the monster narrates. The monster is scientific in his outlook, piecing together our world from observation and trial and error. There is a lot of stumbling around in these sections, and the outcome of the monster's tale is rather obvious, but these sections are still by far the most powerful of the book.Everyone knows the basic story of Frankenstein, I think: Victor Frankenstein makes a monster from dead flesh, and the monster's not the nicest of fellows, though one must admit that it's rage is somewhat justifiable. The key flaw in Frankenstein is the near total lack of tension, caused both by wordiness and a horrendously loose plot. Shelley's prose is very much driven by the character's emotional state. Her writing latches onto an event and circles around and around on it, pontificating at such length on the most minute matters that it soon manages to loop around entirely and contradict itself. On page 141, we learn that: \\"As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.\\" Then, on the very next page: \\"Indeed, as the period [of our marriage] approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty.\\" (p. 142) Both being terrified and undisturbed, now that's a feat of cognitive dissonance, Victor.As for the actual plotting, one would be able to reach roughly a hundred of this book's hundred and sixty-seven pages and assume it had nothing whatsoever to do with any monster. In the author's reprinted foreword, we learn that Shelley intended Frankenstein to be a short story but was persuaded to make it a novel. The signs of filler are everywhere; the book is an exercise in the most lax plotting, and bloat practically bursts forth from its seemingly slight page count.The novel's frame story is a man exploring the arctic who stumbles upon Victor in pursuit of his monster. Those opening pages are told through letters from the man to his sister. But here's the catch: Frankenstein is not spotted until page eight, and his story does not begin for several more pages. The opening scenes of the story are spent setting up the frame character who is almost wholly irrelevant to the novel. It's a slight matter, admittedly, but it's a sign of the excess to come.Frankenstein is ashamed of his creation and does his best to try and put it out of sight and out of mind. That's totally fine. It's believable and shows every scene of leading to personal struggle and all that. But it's taken to absurd lengths. Frankenstein flees his apartment when he creates the monster, and then proceeds to do nothing about it. It only really becomes important again when he's about to lead a friend into his abode: \\"I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\\" (p. 38) Bringing dead tissue to murderous and horrible life is upsetting, sure, but if our friends saw it'd just be too much! Read a bit too fast and you might be left with the impression that Frankenstein isn't worried so much about breaking all natural and moral laws but rather the playboys he might've left in plain sight.Perhaps I should give Victor a bit more leeway, though. After all, he'd just been subjected to a rather bad shock. Shortly after, he comes down with a debilitating fever, and maybe we should excuse him for his actions. In fact, the book seems to be looking up. He's heading back, and it seems that something terrible has happened n his absence. If this was the only instance of bizarre nonchalance, it'd almost not be worth mentioning. But it is, of course, not the only instance. Far from it. Frankenstein is a master of fretting. He has perfected the art of completely ignoring the monstrosity he's created for pages on end while he does absolutely nothing, all the while thinking about how he must hurry to resolve the situation before it rends him and all he loves limb from limb.The worst example of this comes when Victor takes a multi-month sightseeing tour of the United Kingdom. This section is infuriating. Perpetually horrified, Frankenstein takes the time out of his busy schedule to visit tourist attraction after tourist attraction. These are, every one of them, described. Not in terms of the plot, or even in terms of how the character feels about them. Nope. We just get to have brief history lessons: \\"We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs, and endeavoring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden...\\" (p. 117) It goes on like that. For pages.Sadly, when Frankenstein does come around to the point, it's not much better. Now, there are effective sections. The problem is that they're few and far apart. The majority of the books climactic scenes drown whatever genuine emotion there was to be found in torrents of melodrama, obscuring tragedy with phrases like: \\"The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured\\" (p. 129). The core of the novel is never described to the reader. Any chance of us developing our own terror of the monster is smothered by Victor's awe inspiring gushing.The issue is not truly the scenes of action themselves but rather Frankenstein's general personality. He responds to every event with rapture or terror; he is incapable of concluding the simplest sentence without an emotional exclamation point, a habit that's rendered even more grating when coupled with his indecisiveness. When first confronted by the monster's demands, he says: \\"'I do refuse it [...] and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me.'\\" (p. 104) Then, after a single page, he admits: \\"I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\\" (p. 105) The end result of such effusive dialogue is a thundering hesitancy, a narrative filled with grand declarations that, ultimately, amounts to nothing at all.If Frankenstein had been written last year, I would have declared it turgid and sworn never to read the author again. As it's a classic, however, my disappointment's mixed with incredulity. Frankenstein is not bereft of virtues. The premise is excellent, but it's horribly executed. The monster's perspective was interesting, but it's highly digressive (even if less so than the main narrative). And so on. Frankenstein may be worth reading for its historical value, but, as a novel, I found its every page miserable.[Note: all page numbers from the Dover Thrift Edition]"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The idea of a mad scientist creating a human monster was a great idea--especially in the year 1816. However the book is boring...implausible...over-written...under-edited...and boring. So why is is so famous? Let's face it, today nobody would have heard of, much less read, this book if the 1931 movie hadn't made it famous; yet the book and the movie have very little in common. So why does it get such great reviews? Again, let's face it, the title is so famous that most people don't want to say that they don't get it. But there's very little to get, other than what you read into it--the emperor has no clothes!

I was waiting for the bolt of lightning and then this horrible creature to appear just like in the movies. I felt it was time consuming to read and at times hard to comprehend. For example many people in my class did not understand how the &quot;monster&quot; could so easily learned to read and speak. I felt at first the pace was rather slow but as the reader reached the climax of the story it became rather interesting. I, myself, was very intrigued by this point in the book and found I could not put the reading down. If I could have changed anything about this book I would have wanted Victor to tell others about his creation. After reading this story I really questioned if the \\"monster\\" was really so horrible. I feel the \\"monster\\" started off with good intentions but when he realized that his own creator wanted nothing to do with him he felt lost and alone. Was the &quot;monster&quot; really asking Victor for too much? All he wanted was a friend, someone to talk to and be with but no. Its just like Shelley asked at the beginning who's fault is it the \\"monster\\" or his creator? He, the \\"monster\\", was different and everyone fears different and has a hard time excepting different so he was perceived as an outcast. This often happens in society. Over all I feel this was a great book. It kept my attention for the most part and kept me wanting more."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's charactorization was... lacking. None of the charactors had their own &quot;voice&quot;. This actually made it confusing to follow at times, as the protaganist, his love, and his creation all have sections where they are telling the narative... and it is often difficult to tell who is talking!While I'm glad I read the original, I probably will not re-read it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is one of those books that makes the reader wonder how the author could have ever made this up. As a sophmore in highschool I was required to read it in for my English 2 class. I glanced through it at first and thought it to be quite verbose and overly detailed. My assumptions were wrong. When I actually got into the book I began to really enjoy it. I realized that the many details help you visualize what is going on more. Mary Shelly creates a very imaginitive and creative plot about a man who tampers with the laws of nature. She combines science and fantasy to create one of the greatest novels of all time. So if you have the patience to read this somtimes slow but fabulous book, I definately recommend you do so."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"First, don't buy this if you expect to read a scary horror story. It's also not exactly science fiction since the details of the monster's creation are left out..However, this book is still clearly a classic. It's amazing to think it was written 200 years ago by a 19-year-old woman. The themes are as fresh today as they must have been novel when the book was written.The primary theme, in my opinion, is whether the monster is to be considered a human. This topic is seen in the debate over cloning. Secondly, Shelley puts forth the notion that the monster is inherently kind &amp; caring but is driven to evil by society's obsession with outward appearance.I agree with other reviewers who say that information is left out. I was puzzled as to how the monster learned to speak so well in such a short amount of time. The issues of food &amp; clothing are also in question. However, looking at the larger themes involved, these details are minimal and do not detract from the story.."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Well, this book wasn't really what I expected.

Also, the prose is relatively easy to read, so no one should be afraid of reading this relatively short work. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, is a vortex of action. It follows the ambitious Victor Frankenstein who has set out to do the impossible: resurrect the dead. Victor is so swept up in his ambitions that he fails to acknowledge any of the consequences of following his dream -- that is until it is to late. Despite its great plot, Frankenstein is great for another reason as well: its timelessness. Many of the ethical questions regarding the limits of technology that Shelley pursues in Frankenstein are relevant today with the advent of cloning and genetic engineering."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book was not all THAT great. I found it rather boring most of the story because Dr. Frankenstein and the wretch talk on for, what seems like ages, when they could 'sum it up' in about one paragraph. The theme is great, but it was a long book for what Mary Shelley is portraying. I recommend seeing the movie, as the lighting up scene in the movie is MUCH better then the one in the book. The book stated something of this sort: And then he was alive. Nope, no lightning, no of those 'shreeky funny squealing noises' evil doctors make. In fact, Dr. Frankenstein wasn't that evil at all. I don't recommened reading this book on your own free leisure time unless you enjoy reading classic books. I think this book is classic because they made a good movie out of it. If you have read this book: you cannot learn the whole english language in TWO YEARS! Another thing that bugged me was the fact that some of the stuff in it was so surreal. If you want to read surreal, might I recommend THE ODYSSEY. Yet, I gave it 3 stars because it is a classic and obviously there has to be SOMETHING good about it, but I have yet to find that!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"...after all, it was written a long time ago. But may I remind the reader that Mary Shelley has made an incredible leap into the future of science to bring her audience what may have been (at the time) a procedure for bringing dead tissue to life. It may seem fantastic, but Shelley's creative talents have intrigued readers for decades. The most ingenius aspect of the novel is not in its style, but the ideology. Shelley has injected her tale of horror with a dose of social commentary that holds true throughout the ages, teaching a valuable lesson about judgment of character. Especially poignant today, Shelley has also given an eerily foreshadowed warning to us about the possible dangers in genetic engineering."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"You must read this book at least once.

Forget what you think you know about the story of Victor Frankenstein and his monster and allow yourself to experience the work that &#34;inspired&#34; the countless movies. While not as engaging Dracula, the story does have an element found in Stoker's novel and most 19th century horror literature; a certain mix of roles where humans are the monsters and monsters are victims. An ambiguity of wrong and right, good and evil, the inevitable climax between those forces and a moral and lesson that is hard won and forever lifechanging for the characters and the readers. For monsters and victims and hubris are not exclusive concepts. They exist in every character and truth is fickle in these tales."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This was an amazing book.

Unlike the movie, you can really have emphathy for the creature. I read it in my teens and I enjoyed it again this time."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"For those like me who had heard a lot about Frankenstein (book or the film) are in for a nice surprise.The monster isn't half bad as he is popularly conceived to be but may be a product of society and circumstances. I picked this book up to look for answers on the questions of identity and wasn't disappointed.Very interesting and definitely worth a read at least to understand the monster's perspective. And if you think its 19th century origin might be a turn off for our present generation of readers, well you will be surprised.For Mary Shelley knew how to keep up the excitement and of course the gothic appeal will have the 21st century reader turning pages with delight! :)Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Once upon a time, I had to read Frankenstein in high school, and I certainly wasn't a fan. The language was difficult, the story lengthy, and I just didn't see the point. Truth be told, I don't think I even read the whole thing, but I honestly can't remember anymore. The only part of the story I did remember, which is why I wonder if I read it in its entirety, was the monster trying to talk to the family he liked, and them reacting very badly to him.Recently, I read A.E. Rought's Broken, which is a spinoff of Frankenstein, and I decided that I really needed to sit down and read Frankenstein in order to make a decent comparison of the two novels. So I did. And you know what? I really liked it. Yes, the language in the beginning is difficult, and that makes it feel more lengthy than it really is, but it's a great story, and I found that if I could get past the more boring epistolary beginning of the novel, to the part where Frankenstein begins his tale, it was actually quite interesting. As I read, I found myself really getting into the story, and the questions of humanity versus science piqued my interest in a way it never has before. I kept changing allegiances, yelling at Victor, then yelling at the monster. In truth, Victor shouldn't have played with life, but the monster should have started killing, either. The monster is livid for being abandoned, but in reality, Victor ran out of the room in fear, and the monster left of his own volition prior to Victor's return. So, the idea of abandonment, in my opinion, is a bit weak. I'd run if I was scared, too. But Victor came back. Yet, then again, if someone went yelling and screaming out of a room that I was in, would I wait around for them to come back? Nope, I'd get out too. So, I completely understand why the monster left. This back and forth debate I found myself having was actually a lot of fun, but it didn't stop there. Once the murders begin, I found myself hating the monster, and then hating Victor and humanity when the monster explained his tale. I originally thought Victor should have made a companion for the monster, but then again, Victor's fears of a female monster choosing her own path and running rampant was a good point. And this leaves me with the question of who is truly at fault? Victor, for creating the monster, or the monster for using fear and anger prior to attempts at civil conversation?Shelley has some amazing points that she brings up within this classic novel, and I completely understand why it would have invoked fear in the hearts of her readers in the 1800s, as well cause great debates. I also think it's pretty cool that now, fifteen years later, I can go back to a classic I \\"hated\\" and find it all together riveting. Is it because my mind has matured over the last decade, or is it because no one is forcing me to read it? I guess we'll never know."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I had never read this book before and it's always been on my list of \\"To Read\\" since I was in middle school. Then, I got to college and it was a required reading for one of my classes and I was so excited to start reading it. Now, I knew by then that the movie and book had almost nothing in common and that the Monster looked nothing like Karloff's character. But I still expected there to be some creepiness in the book. So I open to the first page......Ummm...okay...so, there's some guy writing letters. Should get to the good stuff anytime soon.The book was a slow read from the get-go. By the time Frankenstein had created the Monster I was forcing myself to read this book because I HAD to read it. I've only ever started and not finished a book once in my life, and if this wasn't a required reading, this book would've been my second. Victor's narration of this story is so uninspired and down right boring most of the time.The ONLY reason that I gave this book a 2-star rating was because of the Monster's narration in the story. By that time, the book was 2/3 of the way done, so I figured the rest of the book would be a little more fast-paced. I was wrong. After the few chapters of the Monster's story, the book went right back to the pace it began with.The ending wasn't the worst ending out there, but it still didn't give this book any redeeming factors.I was surprised by this book, but in a bad way. For a book that got so much acclaim over the years I just didn't see it here. Maybe it's because of when the book was written and how books like this were written back then. I'm not sure. But this book was a very large let-down, and that's sad because this book I had been looking forward to read for years and I was largely disappointed in the end. Don't read this unless you have to.

Frankenstein's monster is a sympathetic figure rather than a scary one. He's a sad one, too."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is one of those books I'm glad I waited to read. It is so different from the Frankensteins everyone associates with, yet it is a totally engrossing read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It was a real pleasure to reread the founding novel of both Sci-Fi and horror, important types of fiction that provide readers with challenging questions and vicarious, imaginative adventures.When she was 18 years old, Mary Shelley wrote her surpisingly complex novel after she had a rather disturbing nightmare; at the same time, she was part of an amicable writing contest between herself, her husband, Percy B. Shelley, and their guests, Lord Byron and John Polidori. Frankenstein is one of the most influential novel of all times, having been translated widely and changed into plays, films, shows and pseudo sequels. Its characters - the monster created through galvanism out of dead bodies parts and its creator, the \\"mad\\" scientist Frankenstein - have reappeared endlessly in other novels, films, cartoons, animated features, Halloween costumes, action figures, video games and everyday language.Many of its essential thematic ideas have become key issues in fiction and media, such as: the scientist's moral resposibility regarding his/her creation, the dangers involved in replacing God in his life-creating function, the important need to be accepted by a social group, the acceptance or rejection of \\"different\\" beings perceived as \\"others\\". Frankenstein will always be read with enjoyment for its being such superior entertainment and reverence for its being such an accomplished classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Why I have never read this book before I do not know. The fact that it was written by Shelley when she was only eighteen or so makes it an even more remarkable story. Very easy to read and access the language. The misery of Frankenstein and his monster is described so eloquently, sympathy is evoked by the reader. As I say above, I wish I had read this book a.long time ago."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Don't know how I missed reading this book all these years. Good story but I didn't think the monster's description was as scary as I thought it would be. Maybe I'm synthesized to present day vampires, zombies, and monsters, in today's media."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The Frankenstein I knew of from when I was a child was about a mad scientist who created a monster who wreaked havoc on the townspeople. With their pitchforks they hunted down the monster and his creator and seek to destroy them. I never read this version of the book let alone knew if there was any other version to this novel, sadly to say. When I was recommended to read this book I thought I would know exactly how it will be but I was surprised to see it the way it was. Frankenstein thinking before I read the novel how boring it will be was actually very interesting and kept me intune. I didn't want to put it down and I wanted it never to end. Victor Frankenstein was my favorite character in the beginning of the novel. He is very intelligent and has a love for science that I can not imagine. When he created the monster I thought he wouldn't be afraid of his own creation but actually be proud of what he created. Maybe even show it to the world, but he disowned his creation and for that he went to my least favorite. As the story went on I started to see how the creation by Frankenstein was never born a monster but made into a monster by the events that he had gone through. I feel for the monster, being brought into this world when he didn't want to, having to endure the troubles of the new world by himself. He was misunderstood, like a newborn child without parents having to deal with life by himself. Still he persevered keeping his self alive. As I read I see who is the real monster, I recommend this book for those who know Frankenstein as a mad scientist who created a monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The leather bound book, the color, the design is awesome.

Thank you"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Wishing the movies had been like the book. Much more interesting than I thought it would be. Liked a lot!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Written in 1817 (published 1-1-1818), the English language is on a pedestal in this classic piece of literature. It took me a quarter of the book to finally get into Shelley's command and use of the native tongue, but from that point the reading sped up considerably. Yes, you will want to read this with a dictionary close at hand (thank you KINDLE for your fortuitous inclusion of an interactive, in-text dictionary feature).Frankenstein, and his Monster, are both used throughout the piece in ways that speak to the issues of creation, Creator, free will, and sovereignty.Inherent to the issue of \\"Monster's\\" path of death and destruction is the fact that Victor Frankenstein failed to, or was unwilling to, name his creation. Void of an identity, It was forced to spend its existence searching for an identity, as well as an acceptance from society.This is not your HORROR channel b/w movie adaptation. This s pure literature, filled with passion, with characters struggling with issues of existence that are paramount to ones survival in world in which they have been placed; love and hate, life and death, acceptance and rejection.While not a 'life changing' read in my opinion, it is a book with the power to cause one to evaluate one's life, and seek for a better, brighter tomorrow.Read the lines. Read between the lines. Let the lines speak to, and through you.I rate this book a solid 4 stars out of 5 on the following scale.+ poor read++ so-so read+++ good read++++ excellent read+++++ life changing read"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The first few chapters are boring but once you really get into it, its an amazing book!

I will be the first to admit that I LOVE Frankenstein's Monster in all of his incarnations.

Read this classic - it is a true horror that will touch both the mind and the soul."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It started off a little slow but that is simply how the author chose to introduce the characters. It was well written and engaging. Part of the story is told by Frankenstein and part by the monster.

I have heard of the story but never understood all the details until reading this book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Shelley's Frankenstein is still a timely caution on \\"humanity\\". The author reaches out to our conscience to get us to see the \\"monster\\" in us all and combat it with actively acknowledging its existence but not allowing it to emerge."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The plot of the book is great, but from beginning to end the novel is extremely slow paced in my mind, other than the exception of some parts."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It is the best book that I read this year. Thank's Amazon and it is good for increase my English learning."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book was required reading for a course I was taking. It was a little hard to read for first few chapters but surprisingly got exciting. Since it is written in Old English it takes a little more time to comprehend but was worth the effort."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... or at least the Hollywood version, with green skin, boxy head and bolts in his neck.But the original creature is quite different in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" which starts off rather slow but builds into a tragic, darkly hypnotic tale about tampering in God's domain, and the terrible consequences that come from it. Also: if you create a new creature out of dead body parts, don't disown him or he'll kill your family.During a trip across the Arctic, a ship picks up a starved, half-frozen man named Victor Frankenstein. As he recovers, Frankenstein tells them his life story -- especially about how he became fascinated with science, and developed a process to reanimate dead tissue. Eventually he constructs a new creature out of dead body parts, and brings him to life.But while the creature is intelligent and articulate, he's also hideously ugly. Horrified that he's not beautiful, Frankenstein flees... and has a nervous breakdown. Wimp.But months later, the murder of his little brother brings Victor back to his home, where he figures out that the creature was involved. And to his horror, the creature now wants a mate. But the loathing between them -- caused by Frankenstein's disgust and the creature's increasing bitterness -- leads to even more tragedy...\\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those rare novels that is almost beyond classification -- it's gothic horror, it's sci-fi, it's a tragedy about scientific ambition that goes where it shouldn't go. Mary Shelley was only eighteen years old when she began writing this book, but she interwove religion, science and a fiercely intelligent knowledge of human nature into it.Her writing is a bit stuffy at times (\\"All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own\\"), but that's because it was written in the early 1800s. Despite this, Shelley's writing skills shine in the more horrific moments of the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work. Victor is actually a pretty horrible person -- while he's a tragic figure whose unnatural ambitions end up destroying his wife, brother and father, he's also incredibly cruel and callous to the creature because... he's ugly.The creature, on the other hand, instantly gets our sympathy. He's intelligent and childlike at first, but his ugliness causes everyone to immediately hate and fear him. When him becomes embittered and eventually murderous, you still feel sorry for him.Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those few, rare horror books -- it adds a little more of that scientific gothic atmosphere to a classic tale of horror, slime and sorrow."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I bought this to help some of my high school students get through this rather difficult novel, which is a required reading. The recording was true to the edition of Frankenstein we use and was done done fairly well."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Great book that can't be beat. It's such a classic book that I could read over and over! For me this book never gets old."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Took a few chapters to get into the book however certainly worth it. Good character development and enjoyed the build to the end."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This truly is a classic tale of social insight, a story of one seeking acceptance and desiring companionship but being rejected and branded a monster. The thing that I liked most about this book is the fact that it's divided into two accounts, designed to view both sides of the story. The first part of the book \`Frankenstein' tells the story of the life of Victor Frankenstein, the creation of Monster Frankenstein and the death of his younger brother William. A servant \`Justine' has been put on trial for this murder, but Victor knows the identity of the true killer. Monster Frankenstein and Victor finally meet up and despite his desire to kill his creation, Victor is forced to listen to the monster's story, after being threatened.\`The Modern Prometheus' tells the story of the Monster Frankenstein, confused and unsure from the very first day of life, found himself hiding in the woods watching people and learning how to find food, create a fire and how to differentiate between the feelings of happiness and sadness. Watching a family in poverty taught Monster Frankenstein many things and he started chopping wood and shoveling snow for the family while they slept. His loneliness finally drove him to show himself to this family who ended up running away in fear. With a mixture of loneliness and anger, he seeks out his creator, finding his way to William where he decides to kidnap him for companionship and ends up accidentally strangling him.This is where the two stories meet and monster Frankenstein pleads with Victor saying he's \`a good creature turned bad by unforgiving humans who scoffed at friendship'. The monster pleads with Victor to make him a companion which he would take and never be heard from again. Victor reluctantly agrees but found it harder and harder to do, even though his family was in danger. Victor began to realize the female companion could wreck much havoc by giving birth to more monsters and refusing to be with the monster as a mate altogether.Monster Frankenstein swears revenge and goes about killing everyone close to Victor in attempt to show Victor what it feels like to be alone. As Frankenstein dies, the monster appears in his room and begs his dead body for forgiveness.In the end the story has no true villain or hero. Monster Frankenstein and Victor Frankenstein were both portrayed as hero and villain. The story also leaves you wondering on how you treat others, do our actions end up turning people into a \`monsters'? Overall this was a brilliant story, although the language was at times hard to understand, it is still worth the read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Sometimes I read a book after seeing the movie. And, often the book's plot is heightened or better flavored - maybe because I hear the voices of the better actors who brilliantly perform roles of masterpieces.This is one of those books where I saw many versions of the book prior to reading. And, even spoofs of the book - whether it be Mel Brooks or Abbott and Costello - touched upon main themes which made me believe the previously seen movies followed the core concept of the literature.I was surprised.This book is a clever yarn by a brother who ventures to see and gets stuck in the polar ices and witnesses two men - one chasing the other - in the blinding white. The big one gets free, and the small one climbs on board of the brother's boat - and then delivers his tale for the next 40-60 pages. That tale is then woven with monster's tale of what happened to him when he escaped his creator's lab.Frankenstein speaks? Yes. Any good? Many languages. How educated a level? With great use of the vocabulary, no less.And, Frankenstein is not a nemesis to the villagers, who chase him with fire and so forth. No, he is the nemesis to the creator - who returns with his tale after the closure of the monster's account of growing in the mind: learning behavior, learning language and more.Ultimately, the monster demands that his creator make a mate or else. The \\"or else\\" makes the monster more a Dr. Jekyll than an innocent lout who walks about with large shoes, and responds in primitive fashion to other's actions. Oh no - this monster is devious, plotting, and controlling - intentionally killing innocent people affiliated with the creator to implore upon his creator of his seriousness in demanding that Dr. Frankenstein make him a mate.Wow. What a book. What a tale. And, oh so different than any of the movies - but I still have to admit thatYoung Frankensteinis another masterpiece - just another genre."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Nice edition of Frankenstein for your collection. It is a good quality leatherette that feels nice, but it is not leather. The leatherette is very thin and will wear off the corners and binding. The paper is medium weight. The font is large size. The binding is not very strong. The cloth ribbon is the extra narrow. It might actually be considered a wide thread rather than a ribbon. It is much narrower than the one pictured. The book is comparable in quality to the Barnes and Noble leather series...but with much bigger font."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It's a good purchase but the quality of the book worries me. The glue along the binding is already breaking off and separating from the book. The book mark ribbon is too delicate and cheap. The gold on the page edges makes pages stick and is poorly done and the \\"leather\\" covering is cheap."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The book arrived within a week of purchase, in wonderful condition. the gold pages were barely faded which added to the positive. There was some minor shelf ware, but that was said in the description and was acceptable, just around the corners, and the spine was slightly detached from the pages, so i had my school librarian reattach it with book glue, no cost and not a big deal. Overall a good read and a great place to purchase a book from.Also,I ordered this with Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, and Dracula of the same publishers. All are great reads."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I had to read this in high school and enjoyed it too much. I liked the messages about love,college, and family...even the message about not judging by appearences and not trying to go overboard with the science experiments.Because there are so many movies not at all like the book,I wish BBC or some genious would make a movie based on this classic...then many more people would get the shivers and the message in another beautiful genre...film."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A very interesting take on a old classic. Different to what I expected, but a very interesting read. Would recommend it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The Impact this book had on 19th century literature is undeniable. Shelly's 18 year old mind couldn't have crafted a better book. Any Fan of Frankenstein or Science-Fiction should read the Mother of all Sci-fi books."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A classic tale of self created misery, an aspiring scientist brought to ruin by his own creation. Nearly everyone has an idea of what Frankenstein is about, but have never taken the time to read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Great literary work. The book is far from the movie accounts, but is a good read. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Although I have read Frankenstein once before in high school, I was not mature or alert enough to realize what a gem I was reading. This novel, if you haven't yet learned, is nothing like the various incarnations of Frankenstein movies you may have run across over the years. None of these pop-culture references can prepare you for the monster within the novel. You will not find bolts in the monsters neck, nor will you find some illiterate creature. What you will find is an abundant amount of sadness and emotion.The story, which takes form in a frame narrative, Frankenstein is not actually told by Victor Frankenstein, or by his created monster, but rather a third party who is as interesting as the title character.When Victor's tale begins, we are introduced to a young man whose thirst for knowledge leads him to give life to biological inanimate objects. After a successful experiment where these objects are transformed into an eight-foot-tall creature, Victor allows his monster to escape his laboratory. It is important to note that, this is where most people I talk to feel a certain level of disgust for Victor. What follows can only be summed up as a cat and mouse game between the monster and Victor.One overlooked and important part of the novel is the amount of emotion that is involved in the story. Without ruining anything, I feel that this is easily the most interesting aspect within the story. As I mentioned before, this is not the illiterate monster that you may have been told about. When the monster first confronts Victor about life and human interactions, it is truly a remarkable moment in literature.There are many moral lessons to be learned from this novel, including the importance of compassion and empathy. Similarly, it can easily be identified as feminist literature, which teaches lessons in it self.I give this novel five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is well written and very thought provoking. The language is descriptive and poetic. I recommended it to everyone, especially if you enjoy classic literature."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I thought the book was very well read and hearing it spoken allowed me a fuller understanding of the written text. I would recomend this book to any who have the desire to have a complete appreications of this great work."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book was an extremely wonderful book! I am happy to have gotten the privilege to read it, though it may have been a little confusing towards the end."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Once I used to the stilted language (apparently typical for the time - &#34;Dracula&#34; was written almost identically) this became a gripping tale. If the author had reduced the narrative about the characters' feelings about the natural features around them near the end of the book, by which time I'd more than enough, I would rate it five stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The Frankenstein monster is truly one of the most tragic characters in classic literature. He is obviously quite brilliant, having learned to speak (rather eloquently, I might add), and to read simply by secretly watching others. He's sensitive, kind, and appreciative of nature's beauty-all of the most admirable characteristics of a wonderful soul. And yet, he is vilified by all who come in contact with him because of his physical repulsiveness.His longing for love, especially from Victor, was so painful that it became difficult for me to read. I kept hoping he'd find someone to show him the littlest bit of kindness. His turn to violence is entirely understandable, and Victor's irresponsibility toward his creation is despicable. Victor, who is outwardly handsome but cowardly and cruel, is the story's true monster.In addition to writing a captivating story, Shelley raises many social issues that are still relevant today, nearly 200 years later, and the book provides a superb argument against *ever* cloning a human being.(Note: I have the edition with the marvelous woodcut illustrations by Barry Moser and the Joyce Carol Oates afterword - superb!)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I think if this book were published today it would not have been the success it was. Not only because of the overly ornate prose (no doubt placed in the book by Mary's husband, Percy)but because it has some problems. First, the \\"creation\\" of the monster is done almost out of hand without true explanation (justified by saying it's a secret) or even any real description of how it was done. In little more than a couple of paragraphs, the monster is made. Second, the monster turns out to be able to speak like a Shakespearian actor after roaming alone and hiding for his whole existence. Where did he learn to speak like an Eton grad? No real explantion. (This absurdity is so obvious that the movie industry, upon which the Frankenstein reputation truly rests, made the monster a grunting being, the right thing to do). Third, a large part of the book is spent describing the towns, the cities, etc. that Frankenstein visits while taking a year-long trip before his wedding to Elizabeth. It was like reading a travel magazine.The tale is less a tale about science gone wrong, then a tale about revenge and lonliless. The created monster could just have easily been a child (illegimate child?) of Frankenstein and, if hating his father (instead of creator) done the same things. In fact, the creation aspect, the most famous aspect of the tale, seems to have been just tossed in for dramatic effect, almost as an after thought."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"An incredible book that I only wish I had read earlier in my life. Once I started the book I had difficulty putting it back down except to do the things that I was obliged to do. I loved the book completely, but I am still after finishing it unsure what my thoughts and feelings are towards Victor Frakenstein or his monster. I want to feel compassion for the monster in his only desire for love and to not be alone but at the same time I fear that if I had met him in the city that I would scream in fear and desire to kill him myself. As far as Victor, he is someone who at times I felt sorry for and other times I wanted to hate him more so than the monster for his crazy ambitions to do such a thing and then to abhor and desire the death of his creation. A great book that I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This novel is probably one of the top twenty of all time for the grace of the writing, the vividness of the monster and the plot development. I think I read a reviewer write that you should watch the movie instead of reading this book, or as a supplement to a movie. That is a horrendous statement because Frankenstein has just about everything that a book has to offer. This would basically be like telling people to never read anything but poorly written instruction manuals.First of all I love the way that Dr. Frankenstein is developed. He is known to the author first as a dedicated learner, and we all know that man, but then he is known as a person that knows a woman, since his story also tells us about her. So his character is already defined psychologically (and what other way could there be in a book because physical description of people only go so far in a book) in terms of a woman and his creation Frankenstein. It makes me want to scribble some love notes on Mary Shelley's grave.Frankenstein himself is another extremely well defined character, and the whole story breathes life into him. It is pure beauty, since he is not defined in terms of some properties alone, but what dominates is what the others have seen, and that's what he becomes. The shading of characters, and the unwinding stack of letters, and the sequence of events make this book pure candy for the soul.If this book were a three-star book why would Frankenstein be a household name so many years later? Also just for the sake of it, this book is not so reproducible as the Dracula story which abounds in bookstores today like no other myth. Frankenstein is more of a psychological character made by the entirety of the novel and whole, described mostly just as \\"hideous\\", whereas Dracula is defined by others in terms of all sorts of cool properties. Modern vampire books make him out as like some sort of mr. potatohead. Frankenstein is the more tragic villain I would say, and more simply defined villain. Dracula is kind of a hysterical villain, with his lusts and pluggable physical properties that accomodate his lusts for darkness with his lists of charms and aversions. In fact many others want to be Dracula, and there is envy of Dracula, but Frankenstein is categorically repulsed as an abomination, and as a creation not of god, but he was born in the book, whereas Dracula has unexplained and freakish dispositions. It's interesting now though that Frankenstein should grow in cultural relevance in relation to Dracula who was born out of slavic legends I think, with all of science's creations, but the Dracula franchise sells more for some reason. Perhaps it's a more optimistic view of the future, an evolved human with cool sunglasses, sexually rapacious appetites and gadgets, rather than an abomination of scientific creation."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"For those who only think of movie images when they recall Frankenstein, this book will serve as a pleasant and refreshing experience. The gothic undertones lend authenticity to this beautiful story. When I first began to read this book, I was expecting horror and terrifying elements that may have inspired authors like Stephen King. However, I was amazed at just how beautifully deep and inspiring the book actually was.There is no need for me to rehash the plot because others who have reviewed have done this, but they failed to mention just how many levels there are to this book. The whole story is based on relationships; those between creator and creature, man and nature, science and morality, familial relationships, etc. It is full of concepts such as existentialism, religion, philosophy, family, society (and the shallow, narrow-mindedness of society), and so on. For such a short work, it really covers a large range of human experience.This is probably my favorite book. It left me feeling hopeful and inspired and I recommend it to just about anyone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"On my recent travels, I finished reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.Written in the Gothic style, it's also written as one would tell a ghost story: minimalist in its descriptions of setting, focusing on character and action more than anything else. It's written in the first person, with varying narrators allowing for varied points of view. Despite the threadbare descriptions of setting, Shelley does a good job of conveying with those few words key aspects of the setting, giving her story great atmosphere.Gothic stories always are high on emotion, and not high on reasoning thought, and this is no exception. I am still left wondering how folks can consider this a work of science fiction. It is more fantasy than science fiction: man takes on the role of God, man's creation, like God's, goes awry, and the pair are locked in a monumental struggle. Fantasy's themes often go to the nature of characters trying to choose between right and wrong, while science fiction's themes go towards the consequences of technology and science, without the necessity of morality, and Frankenstein tends towards fantasy under that line of thinking...hence, the alternate title, \\"The Modern Prometheus\\".All in all, an entertaining, and quick read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"In Mary Shelley's novel, there are various statements about the use of science. The field of eugenics is brought into question. The issue of cloning is brought into perspective way before its time. Shelley's novel is prophetic in so many ways for revealing the debates and scientific issues of contemporary times. From the recent FDA consideration of livestock cloning to genetically engineered crops, these controversial issues have been compared to Frankenstein science. Other past scientific innovations such as the use of pesticides like DDT have led to failure and proved dangerous for human civilization. These too were once compared to Frankenstein science, yet humankind persisted on using these chemicals, all for reasons of convenience and capital ambition on the part of corporations involved. We may see Shelley's Frankenstein as the first great scientific warning to humans in an industrial world. It may also be seen as the beginning of environmental awareness. This awareness concerns humans within their own environments such as parent/child relationships and childhood influences, as well as human impact on nature."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I love this book! Frankenstein is created, and born into a world that cannot accept him. It is intelligently written, dark, and quick to read. Feeling compassion towards Frankenstein is a strange feeling...."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley writes in the vernacular of the time in which she lived--verbose and overblown. This romantic language in no way detracts from the fact that Frankenstein is a masterpiece.The monster Frankenstein has created is constantly referred to as a \\"daemon (sic\\" and a fiend. Yet this monster excites our sympathies because of his abject need for affection and acceptance. At the end he calls himself an \\"abortion.\\"The novel Frankenstein can be interpreted as a morality tale warning against hubris and overweening pride in one's own powers of intellect and invention. Frankenstein is obsessed with creating life. He finds out that once he has accomplished this deed, that life which he created is forever his master. The creature Frankenstein has created makes Frankenstein his slave.Without regarding this novel as a morality tale and taking into account the gothic nature of this writing, one can also sympathize with the feelings of rejection, loss, love and affection demonstrated throughout the book by all of the characters.Ultimately, I found Mary Shelley's Frankenstein worthwhile because the novel helped me realize just what it is to be human."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A very popular word, Frankenstein has become an important part of Western pop culture. I found the book to be very different from my preconceived ideas about Frankenstein. The general thinking about Frankenstein is one of horror but this is not the focus of Shelley's novel. This novel is about much more than just horror, and in fact, the horror aspect of the book was weak. Some themes of the book include the relation of creature to creator, the darkness of human creativity, the selfishness of mankind, and the futility of human existence. Overall, the book is very dark. This edition of the book has a great introduction that explains the background of Mary Shelley's life which gives good insight into the book itself. It seems as if the book reflects some of the author's own feelings and experiences. Being such an important part of literature and culture, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"\\"Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me... I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\\" This was said by none other than M. Frankenstein's monstrous creation. To me this quote sums up one of the most important themes in the book. This theme being that all life is very difficult to deal with, but we still strive to live even if times are very hard. It also throws up the question: Are we born pure and good? Because the monster says that when created he was all about being a good man, but now that he is miserable he is a bad person. Mary Shelley wrote this book on a dare from Lord Byron in 1816. This was supposed to be a ghost story, even thought to me it doesn't really seem like a ghost story, but more of a story about playing god, and about life's hardships. Two of her daughters died during infancy, only one son survived. Her husband drowned while sailing in 1822. Mary Shelley died at the age of 53 in 1851. As you can see her life was full of hardships, and loneliness. This makes a lot of sense because if you read Frankenstein you get a sense of horrid loneliness throughout the entire novel. Emotionally this book plays a toll on pity for M. Frankenstein as well as the monster. No one is happy for more than a page or two in this book, and during this rut of happiness they are constantly nagged by something in the back of their mind. It is a very good story and has a lot of very good points about life in it, but the book leaves you feeling...cold and alone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary shelley's frankenstein, the famous novel by her, probably her best work despite her turbelous and personal history (she had a child out of wedlock and her relationships didnt last). the book was made into a slew of hollywood remakes from the earl 1930's version with boris karloff to the more modern one with kenneth brannagh (which is closer to the novel that previous movies).This is one amazing novel, it literally impacted many writers both male and female to come. even more amazing is that shelley was only 18yrs old when she wrote this novel. she truly was gifted and &quot;frankenstein&quot; despite it being one of her few great works still cemented for shelley as a great writer.I've been asked why i love this book and it's quite simple, shelley's takes an obscure plot, a man , victor frankenstein, a scientist using a dead cadaver to create life and bettering mankind creates a monster that terrorizes mankind. shelley thus takes this simple plot , and turns into a complex story with many different twists. beyond that, she uses this story to address some serious issues, all of which i will cover in this review: women's right, prejudice against those who are different from the rest of us, the battle of good vs. evil and of course do we have the right to sacrifice lives like Frankenstein does in the name of science?Shelley was ahead of the times she addressed many key issues that we have discussed even to to this day, so in effect I love her works because she was a visionary and to some extent almost a psychic predicting certain trends that would impact society as a whole for many years to come.:If you watched the old Universal 1930's version with Karloff you think you know what the book is about. Dr. Frankenstein creates a monster because he is mad and wants to rule the world. The monster is hideous and ugly and wants to kill everything. He does meets a blind man who seems to recognize the monster and little girl whom the monster kills after the girl scream. Everyone dies at the end. That's it.No that's not it, in fact it's hard to put in one paragraph why &quot;Frankenstein&quot; has become the timeless classic. In a couple of sentences, the novel brings many social messages into view and makes the audience through the character ponder these questions. By the end of the novel, some questions get answered, however some don't. Shelley leaves many parts of the novel open for interpretation (like Shakespeare did with his plays) so people could come with their own viewsThe novel showcases the fight of &quot;good vs. evil&quot;. But who is exactly evil, the intelligent but evil and unmoral Dr. Frankenstein or the hideous monster who has been scorned by society for his looks (like the Elephant Man).The novel showcases the question of &quot;creation&quot;, more specifically &quot;the creation and ending of life&quot;. Does Dr. Frankenstein have the right to do what he does with body parts in creating this being? Is Frankenstein's intention to create a serious of super beings to rule the world?Why doesn't Frankenstein come forward for being the one responsible for the monster, when several murders including his family members get murdered by the hands of the monster?As you can see Shelley's poses us with some serious questions some of which impact us as a society, questioning our morals? I loved this because questioning our morals nowadays seems to be at the bottom of our priorities (See Iraqi prison scandal).Some of the intriguing questions directed at us as potential scientists if we have the right to some extent go against God and create our own race of beings in our image? Who really is the monster here. Us or the monster?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Victor Frankenstein's creation had murdered members of his family and strangled to death his fiance on their wedding night fulfilling his threat to \\"be with you on your wedding night\\" and warned Victor, \\"You are my creator but I am your master.\\" As Victor centered his life around creating the monster, he would later center it around hunting down and killing his creation. This manhunt would expend Victor's life and prove his efforts futile to catch an untouchable and nameless monster. This novel is full of enduring themes of ambition, friendship, and the conflict between the two, psychology, oppression and rebellion, the dangers of scientific and intellectual advancement, and societal injustice. The writing itself isn't great but it's the story and the themes that make this a great classic.Shelley wrote this book influenced by the period of time in which she lived, the Romantic Period. This was the response to the previous time, the Age of Enlightenment. In the Enlightened Age, reasoning was deemed of utmost importance and people thought that there were natural laws and that reason plus these natural laws would equal progress. By progress, they meant not only advancement, but unlimited advancement, that society would continue to move closer and closer to perfection. In Frankenstein, we see the result of so much logic and reason- the creation of a monster. In the story there seems to be no natural laws governing the world. The Romantic Period accounted for emotion like reasoning and logic cannot. The monster as the center of the novel shows us as his direst need a companion, as does Frankenstein himself.When I think of what natural laws would govern the world, Justice comes to mind as the most important. Throughout this whole story, justice is so dearly lacking. Injustice leads to more injustice. The monster is born into unforgiving circumstances that were not his fault. His creator rejects him immediately. Throughout his life, the monster found himself rejected by everyone for the repulsive looks his creator gave him. The monster even suffered rejection of the impoverished family he ardently and sacrificially helped. When he saved a girl from drowning, her father shot him. The monster yearned desperately for a mate of his kind, which Victor denied him for fear the two would breed an entire race of fiends or that she, too would reject him and there would be two fiends. Decide this debate between the monster and Victor for yourself. Even if Victor was right to deny him a mate, it was still an injustice for the monster. After all, the monster could not help the disadvantages he was born into and he strove mightily to be virtuous. He exercised his will and responsibility strongly, but to no avail. The poor thing begs for just one friend and he is denied this. The innocent Justine (a play on the word \\"Justice\\") is executed for the monster's crime; the monster eventually slays several innocent people he doesn't even know. Injustice is what moves the plot of Frankenstein.Shelley's novel disputes the importance and promise of natural laws, reasoning, and the idea of progress. It introduces emotion and intuition. Frankenstein studied laboriously but failed because he left the monster emotionally neglected and rejected. When Victor first learns of the murder of an innocent member of his family, he intuitively knows it was the doing of the monster- he offers no reasoning or deduction as to how he knows. The monster hounds Victor and seems to supernatually know where he is at all times.One of the many interpretations of Frankenstein is that it was a product of the Romantic Period, which was a response to the Age of Enlightenment. My own evaluation of reasoning vs emotion is that our logic must be in control of us always but that emotions are a part of us too and must be satisfied."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I adored Mary Shelley's portrayal of the characters. Victor Frankenstein is a talent with great compassion for humans yet he is also mankind's worst enemy for creating a monster who can destroy them. Frankenstein is a man who made up his mind to make a human, but in the first case, could not assume responsibility. The same is true for when he tried to make the monster a mate, but he realized this and could not go ahead with it. He is both the villain and the hero, an aspect that is rarely seen.However, The monster is shrouded by mystery and pain. Being the embodiment of sorrow and human sufferings, he is still an amazing symbol of human nature. Mary Shelley captured every emotion felt by her characters so accurately that I could even feel the monster's fury.I especially like the way that the plot unravelled and jumped from place to place. It did not get confusing either. It was quite easy to follow. The characters were well drawn and in everything that they did, their motives were clearly known to the reader. None of the characters did anything that seemed out of mind. There were parts of the book that were a little drawn out and sluggish, but it always picked right back up again. Mary Shelley presents an issue that is very applicable right now. Is it morally right to play God and attempt to create life? Obviously, Shelley's opinion is that it can only lead to disaster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Short Summary: Victor Frankenstein is young, intelligent, and quite full of himself. He discovers through his studies the methods of creating life, and does so. The creature he creates is of enormous size and strength and is hideous to behold. Terrified of what he has made, he flees, leaving the creature to fend for itself.I just finished re-reading this book, it has been over 10 years since I read it the last time. My memory of the book was a tremendous feeling of sadness and compassion for the creature that Frankenstein created. In this re-reading I was shocked at the change in my feelings toward the characters. Though everything seemed the same it evoked an entirely different set of emotions in me. After doing a bit of poking about the internet I discovered that there are two versions of the story that Shelley wrote, one the first one, which is the one I just read, is much harsher, the creature is much less amiable, and Victor is much less forgivable. The second version she wrote, which I understand was written about 10-15 years later, evokes more sympathy for Victor and his creation.Both are almost identical, starting with the gentleman on the ship in the Northern Ice who meets Victor. Victor relates his tale to the young seamen, this tale often becomes a tale within a tale within a tale as we shift points of view, always related to the young sailor through the stories of Victor. As I read this book I found myself thinking that this may be one of the few books that manages to encompass all 5 versions of Conflict, Man vs Man, Man vs Self, Man vs Nature, and Man vs God. Shelley's prose can at times be difficult, not to read, but to focus on because of the style and time frame it was written in. It is very easy to find yourself skimming, which you do not want to do.The story is one of love and loss, creation and our relationship with our creator, the faults of man attempting to become God, and the cruelty that lies with our society to that which we perceive as ugly, frightening or hideous. When Victory abandons the monster he leaves him to learn of the cruelty of our society and to react to it as inappropriately as he does. This tale is NOT what you watched on TV, it is not found in the movie you watched. This is a story that can only be found in this book.Did I love it? Not really, in the version I just read, Victor is a whiner, who considers himself a genius though he stands aside while his family and friends are killed. The monster, though more understandable, is also a contemptible character as he murders one after the other with little to no remorse. Yes it is well written and filled with interesting comparisons, warnings, and meaning... but as for a fun filled entertaining read, the characters were a bit to whiny and non-committal for me to really have anyone to root for. Still, they were full characters, completely rounded and interesting even though they were pathetic. The story is so filled with meaning that you could discuss it for days. And the concept of the feminine in this book is very interesting to read... I recommend this book, but I won't say that it ranks above Dracula in my mind."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Every year, millions children all around the United States dress up for Halloween, and many dress up as the malevolent Frankenstein's monster. But is Frankenstein's monster really evil? In today's society, it seems clear cut that someone who rips the heart out of an innocent person must be evil. However, this simply reflects our inability to look at such an event from a non-anthropocentric point of view. From the perspective of the monster, he only wanted revenge against a world that turned its back on him. Shelly does an excellent job of bringing you into all the pain and misery that the creature suffered ever since Victor Frankenstein created him. And as for his creator, Victor Frankenstein, was he good or evil? This ambitious young scientist wanted to play the role of God, however in his intellectual quest for understanding the nature of life, he managed to destroy everything he loved. This nicely illustrated the ethical dilemma that arises when the forces of nature are tampered with.Frankenstein is a great read. For those who may be put off by the publication date of 1818, stick with it because the book is well worthwhile. It's much different than the popular conception of the story, which is not surprising, considering the way it has wended its way through popular culture for almost two centuries. Shelley pulls off quite a feat with this book, and rightly deserves the fame it has brought to her. Her attention to detail is magnificent, and her imagery was fantastic. The action scenes were extremely suspenseful, and they forced you to read on in order to see what happened next. Anyone in the mood for romance, suspense, agony, and action would truly love this book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I picked up Frankenstein as sort of a &quot;project&quot; read... I felt like it was such a &quot;classic&quot; that I ought to understand it more than the pop-culture monster image.I was surprised to find a book that holds its own extremely well some 100 years later. The message of scientific experiment for curiosity's sake is a profound one, especially in this age of nuclear experimentation, biological warfare and the like. It is also compelling as a story in and of itself.Although I was well-aware that the Boris Karloff image was a far cry from Mary Shelly's novel, I was still surprised to find such full character development and strong motivation. Despite the fact that this was her first effort, and based upon a whimsical challenge to write a &quot;ghost story&quot;, it is compelling and well written. If you haven't read this book, don't be put off by it's age. It is exceptional."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Why adapt a work of art that is genius into a boring superficial version? It's not as if the original Frankenstein is so hard to understand, as are some \\"classics\\" such as Paradise Lost. It's an easy read and full of poetic imagery. I do not recommend this version. I see no point to it. Even a child could read the original."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I thought it was boring, I made myself finish it because it is a book my teens are soon to read and I wanted to be able to give help where needed. It did pickup some after about half way, but still very dry I thought."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The book Frankenstein was a pretty good read. There were many twists and turns in the plot I didn't expect. Although it is considered a horror book, there are some slow parts that you just have to get through before the attention-grabbing moments. The wording could be confusing at times which would spoil the horror effect on me. Many times I would get so frustrated with Victor for his negligence of the monster and his threats. However, overall the book was good and interesting and at times a little bit creepy."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Sci Fi movie buffs may not recognize the original novel by MaryShelley, any more than movie goers would recognize the real Tarzan in ERB's debut book. For this 1818 novel introduces us to a surprisingly articulate monster--who is never named by his idealistic young creator. Its antique literary style offers a tale presented by three different first-person narrators. Letters (tales within a tale) are the inevitable legacy of suicide or premature death before the story is really over.In contrast, the basic theme appears remarkably modern, especially in the light of 21st century scientific debate over the inherent dangers of too much knowledge (as in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde)or genetic tampering (The Island of Dr. Moreau). Man is simply not morally csapable to assume the role of creator. Lofty-minded but overwrought Victor Frankenstein conceives the blasphemous idea of creating a living being of gigantic stature. Despite his noble goal of benefitting mankind, the experiment goes grotesquely awry. The youthful natural scientist endures a few years of tortured, morbid existence, which swell to a crescendo of horror as a result of his cerebral &quot;Hybris.&quot;Frankenstein's obsession gradually dominates his life--spilling blood onto those around him, as the people dearest to him are viciously and deliberately murdered. Is there no way to stop the rampage of terror which he has inadvertantly unleashed upon a helpless, unsuspecting world? Linked inexorably by the bonds of unholy creation, both Victor and his monster live only for Revenge. But can either truly be said to be alive, if the other should perish? Are they not mutually dependent on each other to sustain the fires of the hunt? Despite uneven pacing, this thriller/chilller has captured the imagination of kids of all ages for almost two centuries. Bear in mind that Hollywood has transformed the original monster, spawning the idea that Frankenstein Is the monster!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Forget the Frankenstein from the movies and come read the real story of a man, Dr. Victor Frankenstein, who is a brilliant scientist with an obsession: play to be God, creating a living human being all by himself. God punishes him: when the creature wakes up to life, he turns out to be a horrible monster. Frankenstein is terrified and rejects his creation.And here's where the Gothic tale becomes a true literary work of art. What follows is the tragedy of a creature created by the arrogance and ambition of one man, an ugly yet fully human being. The monster is not good nor bad: he's just plain human. What he needs is affection, love and understanding. But his ugliness and clumsiness provoke that no one is willing to approach him: he scares the hell out of everybody. First, he is sad; then, he is enraged. Here's where the real monster is created: by the hatred and frivolity of other humans.A true Gothic masterpiece, this novel is unforgettable for its message, its depth, and especially for its environment and mood. It is all dark, all cold, all terrifying and all moving. The true monsters are the others, not Frankenstein's creature. But his wanderings around the world are wonderful horror literature. Don't miss this great book written in one night by Mary Wollstonecraft, the young wife of poet Percy Shelley. It is the fortunate result of a bet made by several attendants to a vacation by a lake in Switzerland, Lord Byron included."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a classic in the horror genre and to me it far outshines Broker's Dracula and his other novels which can sometimes appear like turn of the century pulp fiction horror. Shelley was a masterful writer who conveyed a powerful theme at the core of Frankenstein. It was the 19th century, the earlier half of the century. Shelley, the infamous poet Lord Byron and another writer were on vacation and living in a castle. They made up a bet. They were to write a work of horror and the writer whose book was the most frightening and intense and most successful was to receive honors by the group. Mary Shelley had a phantasmagorical nightmare which became the plot to Frankenstein. What a way to write a book. Since its publication, it has become an instant classic and attained popularity for years. Hollywood has made various movie versions. Kids still dress up as Frankie for Halloween. Mary Shelley wrote more than a horror piece that was meant to win a bet. Indeed it is intensely scary but its message is strong. In the 19th century it was a cautionary tale. Darwin's theory of evolution was out and man was accomodating themselves into a new, secular world full of inventions and scientific progress. Medicine became more advanced. Industry boomed with railroads, steamships, factories, and later in the 19th century- film, phonographs/record layers, telephones and electric lightbulbs. Shelley was urging people not to lose their faith in God as a creator and that to play God could spell disaster.Doctor Frankenstein represents the modern man, the atheist, the scientist, the new creator. It rings true today since we are so advanced in our science that we are able to produce new life both bacterial in form and human cloning. Dr. Frankenstein is a naive idealist. Initially, he believes that by creating this man from the cadavers of human beings, he will create the ideal man, free of evil and a figure of hope for mankind. Perhaps Dr. Frankenstein's mistake still applies to scientists today ? Will cloning humans turn out to be a huge disaster ? Will they be more monstrous than human. But it's interesting to note just how human the monster can be beneath his monstrous exterior. He feels human emotions like other people - love, hate, anger. This way, Shelley blurs the line between humanity and monstrosity. We are ourselves monsters because we continue to engage in war, build bigger weapons and believe we are indestructible in our technilogical progress to the extent we sometimes lose our soul. Frankenstein is just that a monster because essentially he is a human missing a soul. Each phrase, each description is poetic, vivid and powerful in is imagery and symbolism. This is the only true literary horror novel that one can make essays and master thesis on. No other work can do this. Perhaps only Anne Rice novels but for the most part, horror novels seem to lack the literary themes that this book contains. If you still haven't read it, and have seen the movies, don't expect it to be the same. This is on a class of its own. But most assuredly the book is better."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mention the name \\"Frankenstein\\" and the first image to pop into people's minds is one of a big, dumb, green guy with bolts coming out of the sides of his neck. Anyone reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein for the first time may be surprised to learn that in the novel the creature is neither inarticulate nor ignorant. He is the product of a zealous doctor's quest to take life and death into his own hands. The creature is shunned by all mankind, including the one person who should feel some compassion or responsibility for him, his creator, Dr. Frankenstein. All the creature ever wants is to be accepted by society and to find companionship. With an intellect superior to that of the average human being, he learns to speak and read. It isn't until after he understands that he is doomed to a life of rejection that he seeks revenge, turning violent and murderous. The underlying question of the novel is, who is the real monster here, the formidable creature or the creator who abandoned him?Through the creature's own words, we hear of his confused awakening and search for understanding. From the start he recognizes that his appearance is so horrifying as to repulse anyone who sees him. Fittingly, once he has taught himself how to speak and read, his first attempt at communication is with a blind man. When he realizes the futility of his search for a friend, he focuses his efforts on another objective - revenge upon the one who brought him into this cruel world. The creature sets out to make Frankenstein's life the same sort of hell as his own.The scientist Frankenstein goes to great lengths to complete his experiment, realizing too late that there are consequences for interfering with the laws of nature. He brings to life a most unnatural beast, and flees in horror from the being he has created. Feeling no responsibility to comfort the creature in any way, he instead wishes to completely abandon it and forget that it even exits, leaving it to struggle single-handedly in a world where it does not belong. Is it any wonder that his creation becomes slightly incensed at his abandonment and seeks to create for Frankenstein a life equal to his own in misery and isolation?Who deserves the label of \\"monster\\"? First-time readers of Shelley's novel may have a hard time accepting that the creature is not a purely evil or demonic being; contrary to popular belief, he does not just wake up and start strangling people. The creature in the novel has qualities we more easily identify with, such as the desire to be loved and accepted. On the other hand, Dr. Frankenstein's actions are questionable at times. Is the creature justified in his revenge? Or does Frankenstein get the bad end of the deal, his originally well-intentioned experiment gone sour? Either way, reading Mary W. Shelley's novel presents to us the viewpoint of a very different \\"monster\\" than we expect."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is an immortal tale about hybris, love and hate, justice, racism and the responsibilities of scientists.Its fundamental question is: 'Had I the right to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? ... future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.'The 'unhallowed arts' of Frankenstein produce a 'filthy mass that moved and talked', but it is nevertheless a human being with normal human aspirations: 'Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good, misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.'But, Frankenstein is a 'painted bird': 'Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me? I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.'His reaction is : 'If I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear.'Mary Shelley's vision of mankind is far from rosy: 'I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty.' 'A man was considered, except in very rare circumstances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few.' 'Was man yet so vicious and base? I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow.'Her world is one of resentment, racism and jealousy: 'religion and wealth had been the cause of his condemnation.'But, 'how strange is that clinging love we have of life, even on the excess of misery.'Frankenstein is the scion of the evil principle, the invention of a man-scientist and a 'painted bird', who is therefore not accepted by the rest of the human race. His reaction is revenge.This is a great text by an 18 year old.As Oscar Wilde said in 'The Critic as Artist': 'For when a work is finished it has as it were, an independent life of its own, and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips to say'.Some texts become even more important and luminous with time, like this masterpiece.A must read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The plot and perhaps the character itself of Frankenstein has been manipulated and perhaps even corrupted by the passage of time. Few of those that dress as \\"Frankenstein\\" for Halloween know the true story behind the creature. This is unfortunate as Mary Shelley's classic is among the best books ever written. More than a monster story, it raises questions of morality and ethics.When Dr. Frankenstein sets to create the creature, it is to set his stamp on science. But in many respects, he took on the role of a deity by creating a new life. But that new life is neglected and shunned by his creator, causing him to reject his deity. As this morality play progresses, the frightening reign of terror begins. Dr. Frankenstein is faced with a moral dilemma that could halt the creature. He must weigh the risks of this dilemma against the benefits. Though quite predictable in terms of the plotting, Frankenstein set a standard in its time. The creature is cunning in the traps and scenarios it lays for his creator making the villain more frightening.Shelly's writing also causes the reader to feel sympathy for the creature. It is a struggle to maintain this feeling, but Shelley is able to meet this challenge. In this respect the daemon is less demonized."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was quite surprised at how much depth was really in this book. I had ideas of Frankenstein's monster from the movies and society, but those pathetic interpretations do not capture the true, sorrowful nature of the \\"daemon.\\" I was genuinely moved by this tale: It is a story of light and dark; it is a story of gain and loss; it is a story of love and hate. When the creator becomes the hated, the created becomes the vengeful.I never expected this book to have such unique depth. Whatever you think you know about Frankenstein is just a poor transcription of this wonderful work by Mary Shelley."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"People often group science fiction books or horror books into their own category, even though the great sci-fi / horror books explore the same themes that \\"non sci-fi and non-horror\\" books do. In navigating the human condition and making a commentary on it, books are either categorized as tragedies or comedies. This classic of literature is alternatively classified as a sci-fi book or horror book, when it is most definitively a tragedy.Set in 19th century Europe, the book tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young and upcoming scientist with great skills in the life sciences and a gifted engineer. Whilst his colleagues spend time enjoying the social life of Europe; Victor devours books and speculates on life itself. Soon he begins secret experimentations on life, and concludes that it is nothing more than organic material energized by electricity. He follows this be creating life, in the form of a human made from spare parts that he obtains from graverobbers and such. At the moment he brings his creation to life, both freak out and are separated.Frankenstein's creation, the monster, wanders the cities and countryside of Europe, trying to piece together his origin, his whereabouts, his identity, etc... All the while, his horrific looks, being made of human spare parts, makes him so ugly as to be unacceptable to society and he whiles his days in hiding. The experiences breaks his heart on an hourly basis. He realizes he can never be accepted into human society, so he contacts his maker and asks for a female mate. The maker accepts at first, but at the last moment, negates on his promise. And so starts the hatred between maker and master, for the monster is truly the master since he is not bound by human laws nor human relationships. The monster proceeds to kill all those loved by Victor Frankenstein. In turn, Victor begins a lifelong chase of the monster to kill it. The book ends on the decks of a ship in the northern seas with the monster getting his last laugh.Tragic in its ending, the book makes commentaries on multiple subjects. First, man should not play god. This is the obvious theme of this book. We cannot control our creations and should be more careful in what we create. This theme has since been echoed on the topics of nuclear weapons, automobiles, fire, and now nanotechnology. Second, this book firmly places itself on the nurture side of the nature - nurture debate. The monster is born innocent, and his sufferings at the hands of humans makes him into a true monster. Third, love makes the world go around. The monster ultimately does not want a home; awards, rank or title, social distinction, etc... He wants a wife. Could this theme be related to the author being a wife herself, and maybe the book somehow comments on her marriage? Not sure here.All in all this is a great book. It is a great story book, it is a great commentary on human society, and it is a wonderful examination on the needs of all humans. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is one of the most beautifully written novels I've ever read. Besides its smooth style of writing, it has also enlightened me thourgh two major themes. The first is its revelation of indivudal's fragility compared to nature's unparalled power. The main character Frankenstein's desprate endeavor in creating a monster of perfection is equivalent to an attempt to completely control one's fate and get ride of nature's influence, which results in nature's retaliation as the monster slaughter all the people connected Frankensten. The second is the excitement and fear from solitude and loneliness. The former feeling exists before Frankenstein successful created the monster and the latter feeling arises after the experient is accomplished and done. These two extreme feelings shown in the book, coincide with our daily experience, showing how loneliness can help a person achieve the extraordinary and how it can make a person suffer from the unthinkable, the despairing, the worst."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book is truly worthy of the term \\"classic\\". Mary Shelley began writing this novel at the young age of 18, yet managed to create a landmark work of fiction. The story is interwoven with ever-present social and ethical questions. What does it mean to be human? What are the consequences of using scientific technology to play the role of Creator? How far is too far when tampering with the order of the universe?Upon my first reading of this book I was pleasantly surprised to find that the creature is very intelligent and human-like, though grotesque in appearance. It is a shame that the Frankenstein creature is universally represented in the minds of the public as an oafish and very dimwitted monster with bolts in its neck and a green pallor. The true Frankenstein is far more intriguing. I love the parts of the book that are a first person narrative by the \\"creature\\".I highly recommend this book as it is an enjoyable piece of classic literature. If you are a fan of horror, read this for an understanding of the early roots of the genre that you so love, and that those roots actually formed intellectual arguments and contained actual substance. This book is a must read for the well rounded reader. In fact, had I graduated from high school and never read this book, I would begin to question the quality of my own education."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Forget the horror themes. This book is timeless for all cultures because it forces us to ask the big questions: What is our responsibility as a creator? What is God's responsibility as a creator? What is God's realm? What is Man's realm? If God is us, and we are God - are we evolving or are we going where we shouldn't go? Are there ways that society should/shouldn't use or ignore their knowledge? What do we do when our technology surpasses our humanity? How should humanity proceed with technology? Are we ready to know what we know?The intrigue is endless, and can be revisited with new groups for discussions over and over."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Robert Walton, an explorer trying to discover a Polar Passage, sights a strange, giant creature among the icy environs. Shortly thereafter, he encounters a man on a sleigh, of ill health, who calls himself Victor Frankenstein. He is chasing after that creature, his own monstrous creation, who he created in an obsessive desire for knowledge and power, only to find himself haunted and distressed at every turn by his creature--whose only desire is for companionship, respect, and love from his creator, who hates him, and society, which abhors him. Frankenstein retells his story to Walton, interspersed with the creature's own eloquent thoughts about how he became a murdering wretch. The two of them are bound by destiny to end their lives in misery and shame.I don't know which Hollywood screenwriter turned a multilayered, profound piece of literature such as Shelley's Frankenstein into cheap horror schlock, but anyone who is only familiar with the Halloween caricature is in for a surprise. Frankenstein is immensely readable (compare this to Percy Shelley's \\"Prometheus Unbound,\\" which covers some common ground, and see the difference), but there are some genuine wrestlings about why men seek after knowledge, and the ways in which that pursuit can have unintended consequences. There are cogent allusions to the Bible, the myth of Prometheus, and Paradise Lost, reflecting the way in which Frankenstein's Faustian quest becomes a degraded recaptulation of God's creation of man and the rebellion of Satan. Plus, there are moving and eloquent entreaties from the creature himself, whose descent from goodness to coldblooded vengeance is detailed in a startingly believable, psychologically plausible manner. Nor does Shelley's work merely echo stereotypical Romantic themes such as the innocence of man before society and the oppression of social mores--while those elements are present, Shelley's narrative brings up numerous ambiguities in those ideas (some of which were heavily promoted by her famous husband). So there's little surprise that this text is assigned in most English departments and classes on Romantic literature--this is, its popular reputation aside, a genuine work of Literature, capital L with all its hoity-toity implications. There's too much richness here that Hollywood has put aside in its filmed versions, and it would be a great shame if most people aren't aware of just where those visions came from."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book is a great read. The main character is not the monster, but the scientist Victor Frankenstein who creates him. The story is told from his point of view, and reads wonderfully. It's a bit like a journal, beginning with a line something like 'I was born in..', and truly can be called a 'story'. It is not what I expected, not as scary as I thought it would be, and the monster is very different to the typical image most people have of him. Although, however, the author leaves a lot about his features to the imagination. The story takes place in Switzerland, England, the Arctic, and other places around Europe. Mary Shelley paints a beautiful canvas through her descriptions of mountains, rivers, the sky and sea, the sun and the moon, castles, towns and villages, relating human emotions to them. In different parts of the story, both Victor and the monster spend days and weeks in isolation to dwell on their troubles. Nature plays a role and has an effect on their thoughts and emotions. The monster often sees the sun, the shade of the trees, and songs of the birds as his only companions.The monster torments Victor by murdering those close to him. The author leaves you to decide on these events, and sometimes you sympathise with the monster, sometimes you cannot accept any excuse for his misdeeds. The victims are as innocent as can be and poor Victor has to bear so much grief, but the monster is alone and repulsed by the whole of mankind. Both creator and creation suffer. I won't dwell on the themes of these points as I'm sure other reviewers can do better, I'll just say the book is wonderful. Read it if you like good stories with a nice unhurried pace, and if you don't mind getting a little depressed. And, even if you do mind, read it anyway, it's such a short book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"There is obviously something unique about a text that has survived within the canon for so many years, is continually taught to students in secondary schools and universities, and is read for entertainment by numerous people every year. Moreover, there are even fewer texts that have generated such a legacy of being retold, replicated, and borrowed from throughout their histories. One of these grand texts is Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Though one may never have read the novel or be able to recognize the author's name, it would be difficult to find a person who is not familiar with the title. Frankenstein has evolved since its creation into one of the greatest fright stories ever and the monster has become one of epic proportion. But, the story, in actuality, is quite different from its many replications floating around Hollywood or even those of oral tradition. Likewise, the effect this novel has on the reader may be quite unlike what one initially presumes. This was my case in reading the infamous tale for the first time this year.To begin, the language of Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, is, like many novels of its time, challenging. This should not, however, be considered a hindering aspect of the novel. Actually, the language of the narrative aids in the reading for Shelley uses the text as a tool to present an argument. The formality of the language is necessary in order to articulate such a position while demanding attention from the reader to evaluate that posture. Along with this, there are several instances that illustrate the desired position of the author. Without the elevated language, these small details would certainly be lost or overlooked. Through such clarity, one is forced to accept the seriousness of the ideas presented within the text, which are often disregarded in modern film or oral interpretations.Another particularly impressive aspect of Frankenstein is the development of the story in entirety; it is here that Shelley's genius is obvious. First, the tale is appropriately established within a darkened atmosphere; this created world places the reader in the proper frame of mind to begin such a tale while allowing the author to skip over mundane details that would obstruct from the reader's enjoyment. Throughout the novel, one can depend on Shelley to move the reader through the plot by her creation of the atmosphere. Second, as the story focuses around the nature of the human, Shelley develops her protagonist accordingly and with eloquence. The author does an outstanding job of balancing grandness with reality. Dr. Victor Frankenstein is a man who is greater than life while epitomizing all human beings. That is, he is a genuinely good man who makes a grand mistake. Throughout the story, one is able to relate to the doctor as a fictional character and as a representative figure of all humankind.Finally, the action of the story is probably the best known aspect of the tale and is much deserving of that recognition. The plot shares many of the characteristics discussed regarding the development of the protagonist. While the action is something grand, it is created in a way that seems applicable to all human experiences. On the other hand, it is for this reason that the actual plot seems less important than the underlying presuppositions which Shelley is presenting through her narrative. That is, there are certain universal truths that ought not be violated. There is an ultimate good within the world that is both universal and eternal and the violation of this will always lead to the destruction of the person. Obviously, there is a deep religiosity flowing throughout Shelley's narrative.In short, all the elements of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein illustrate reasons that explain the success of the tale. Shelley seems to have hit a vein in the imagination of all humankind. Not only is Frankenstein a fantastic and entertaining story, it is a grand piece of literature dealing with questions of eternal proportion. While the modern interpretations will focus on the science of creating a monster, do not be surprised when questions of even greater importance are brought to light in the reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Overall, this book was great. It's the type of thriller that would scare you, had we not been desensitized as a society by gore and guts on TV and in movies. Its not the Frankenstein you see in the media like Eddie Munster with the things sticking out of his neck and the lightning storm and the mad scientist creating the monster. It is a genuine, old-fashioned horror story. The best part is, Shelley does not give you a detailed description of the creation of her imagination. She lets each person's imagination create its own \\"monster.\\" You can make it as scary or as innocent as you want. That's the beauty of what Shelley does in this novel. You can read into the scenes and story as a whole as much as you want to. You can also argue that the book is not a horror story at all. There are many different points of view concerning the intent of the novel. How it is interpreted is left entirely up to each individual reader. The only downfall I found in the novel was the pace that it held throughout the story. I had to adjust my thinking towards the time at which it was written. It does not have the speed that a modern novel has and you have to adjust somewhat to get through the slower parts. As a whole, I highly recommend this classic for anyone who enjoys letting his or her imagination create the story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"As most of my reading is, I was forced to read Frankenstein for school, and was tested on its content with a test. I began the book skepticaly, to be honest. Most school books are written, impossible to understand, without any intention of creating entertainment for our culture. What i found instead, was a book that kept me interested at all times, contained an array of different emmotions, and was just a good book. I read it in two days, and i f you knew the type of student i was you would find that to be the best compliment."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"....and read this, one of the all-time greats, both in its style and its story.Young Victor Frankenstein regards himself as an alchemist, a searcher after the secrets of life. Like many idealists, he is willing to go to great lengths to realize his dream.Unfortunately, and again like many idealists, he forgets that, being human, he too has a dark side, and unless one comes to terms with it, it's liable to show up right in one's face one day...Some of the most moving passages herein come from the &quot;monster,&quot; who is poignantly eloquent about how he feels about being lonely and homeless and abandoned by his creator. Even so, Victor will not hear him, and therein begins the tragedy--for what we will not hear will raise its voice until we're forced to.&quot;You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale; one that may direct you if you succeed in your understanding, and console you in case of failure.&quot; -- V. Frankenstein"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I wonder whether Shelley intended the pallid ineffectual women of Frankenstein to be irony? Showing how men expect women to be mirrors of their narcaccistic selves. Point made, but I personally am not amused. However, this book is wonderful in providing an in-depth analysis of Shelley's own emotions. She had an illigetimate marriage and illigetimate children while living in an unforgiving society. When going out in public she felt ostrasized, like a monster perhaps. Aha! The idea for Frankenstein was born out of her own isolation. Victor repulses me with his weak excuses and selfishness when it came down to saving Justine. Throughout the entire novel there is an obsession with the class system and beauty. The characters that aren't wealthy and of a privileged birth are less worthy as human beings. Elizabeth was adopted because of her beauty alone; the other peasant children were ignored. I suppose this book reflected the concerns of the nineteenth century almost perfectly"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; has the odd honour of having an unnamed monster which gets confused with the protagonist (afterall everyone calls the monster FRANKENSTEIN when he is unnamed), but the merging of identities and names is at the heart of this classic. Questions about creation, the limits of human knowledge and actions are explored, as well as what is human and what is not. Shelley's protagonist Frankenstein slowly reveals the harsh and cruel side of himself as the novel progresses, while the monster he creates takes on more human traits expressed in his guilt at the murder of the child, and his desire for a companion to ease his lonely days. At the end of the novel, it appears that the roles have reversed. Frankenstein's personality takes on a more &quot;monstrous&quot; aspect while the monster gradually attains the readers' sympathy. The monster and the human therefore switch positions and we have to question and relook what we define as &quot;human&quot; or otherwise. The story on intertwined fates and dependence reaches a tragic end as the release for both monster and creator is possible only through death."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein by Mary Shelley is a fabulous novel of suspense, horror, and love.

When I got about half way through the book I had gotten a little more into it, but I was still bored. The action scenes that it did have were good though, that is why I gave it three stars. Pretty much all of the parts when there wasn't anything going on but talking I was bored because they weren't talking excitingly. Another thing that I didn't like is that &quot;Frankenstein&quot; made out ot be a horror, but the demon only kills four people in the entire book. Also, when the demon did kill somebody they didn't describe it. It was just something like &quot;I heard screams and went into the room; there she laid dead,&quot; or something to that effect."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"There's This-Will-Make-You-Stupider Bad, like a James Patterson novel, and then there's something like Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, elegantly written with themes worthy of your contemplation, yet still bad when you consider its preposterous events.* As one reviewer pointed out, the creature is created in less than a paragraph. And you're not even sure how it happened. I had to rewind because I thought I'd missed something, but no: one moment Victor is like, \\"I was reading books\\" and the next he's like, \\"I looked at my creation's black lips and I hated it!\\"* Victor freaks out and just leaves an 8-foot superbeing (that he hates) hanging out at his apartment. (He does this throughout the whole book, just leaving it at-large somewhere. He's justifiably deathly paranoid that the fiend might harm his family - it already killed his brother - but he goes to Scotland anyway to build a she-creature.) (And not just a long working-weekend either, but rather a months-long pleasure cruise around the British Isles. I don't get it.)* The creature went from hideous dumb clod to hideous Collin Firth in a matter of months via eavesdropping on some peasants. Fine. His erudite, eloquent narration is all sensitivity, even as he's describing (to Victor) how he strangled Victor's kid brother. Fine. Fine. Whatever. I guess I'm okay with it. Moving on....* Victor and the creature stalk each other with uncanny success everywhere on the European continent. And not just at each other's houses, but in the woods, on boats, in cabins, on mountains, on dog-sleds, across multiple terrains and during different weather systems. In a coup of because-I'm-the-author-and-I-said-so, Mary Shelly leads us to believe that the creature prepares for Victor a scavenger hunt across the North Pole, leaving taunting messages and even meals of dead hare to nourish Victor for their final showdown.I'll stop there. There's tons more crazy-unreal coincidences interwoven with breezy descriptions of incredible scenarios. I thought this was going to be literature on the order of Turn of the Screw or Poe, but no. It's a fun listen, don't get me wrong. The language and diction are probably good for you, and you should also be massively entertained by the absurdity of what is purported to be happening."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"what an interesting book!

Unfortunately, the writing style is so overwrought, meandering, long-winded, and antiquated, the incredible story is buried underneath mediocre writing.Story receives five stars, actual writing rates one star, which averages to just three stars.I find the idea behind Frankenstein a very compelling tale - the creation of a flawed creature who turns on his creator (allusions to Lucifer, formerly an \\"angel of light\\" who betrays God). The moral of the story appears to be that the only reason Frankenstein's monster acted like a monster in the first place was that his creator abandoned him, showing no love, mercy, or compassion for his own creation. Because Frankenstein's monster was not accepted by humans, he decided to reject them completely, killing and harming innocents.If you can get past the meandering prose, I do recommend the story, but it is unfortunately a very badly written novel."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"\\"F***ing Frankenstein\\" is the way to go, by far! Don't take my word for it, take Jonathan L. Davis's word.In 1831, Mary Shelley created a monster when she published Frankenstein. Much like her protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, she did not know what havoc she would unleash with her creation, what social mores upended, what ideas rethought, what literary trends rebuked. A memorable lesson: when we finish creating our work, we become powerless; our creations have their own journeys of which we are no longer a part. Victor Frankenstein imbued life into something inanimate. He released a monster. And so too did Mary Shelley - with Frankenstein, a monster of literary endurance, living on for almost two centuries. But for how much longer?Enter writer Matt Allen. What Matt Allen has done here is revolutionary. He inserted the word \\"f***\\" and its gerund \\"f***ing\\" into the text. This is not sedition; this is galvanism. \\"Galvanism\\" is the term Victor Frankenstein used to describe his scientific method when reanimating life. Matt Allen - with the surgical precision of a cardiologist - galvanizes our interest in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, breathing new life into its barely beating heart with the scalpel of the crude.To dismiss Allen's placement of profanity into the novel as \\"blasphemy\\" or \\"sacrilege\\" is to miss the point. In 1831, critics denounced Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as a \\"horrible and disgusting absurdity\\" (Quarterly Review). Frankenstein has a long history of subversion and what Matt Allen demonstrates here is a coy understanding of Frankenstein's true scholarly tradition. Much like Mary Shelley's subtextual warnings of the evil of the industrial revolution, Matt Allen, in his profane Frankenstein, exposes the same dangers of the information age. While old Manchester coal mines sooted up the streets with black and phlegm, digital media perverts the literary landscape with cut/paste and search/replace.Matt Allen may not be the last to put his learned fingerprints on a literary classic, but he may be our most canny academe. To read \\"F***ing Frankenstein\\" is to read the real Frankenstein - a modern Prometheus, as Mary Shelley so artfully describes. For what is Frankenstein if not immortal, shifting, complex? Would Mary Shelley approve of Matt Allen's version of her text? Does it matter? She created a monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Let us compare two perspectives from which to 'see' this work by Mary Shelley---through the eyes of Victor Frankenstein's or through the eyes of that doctor's creation. Let's begin with the latter; and in the words (yes, 'he' speaks in the book) of that creature/daemon/monster/being: \\"I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existance every one will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.\\"But, alas, it was not to be for Dr. Frankenstein's bodily creation, as 'he' admits to \\"...daily vows [which] rose for revenge---a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.\\"\\"Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.\\"\\"Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.\\" \\"...I desired love and friendship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this?\\" \\"But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.\\" \\"Am I to be thought the only criminal , when all humankind sinned against me?\\" And, akin to that berzerk kid in Virginia who went on a killing spree (in April of 2007) Shelley puts in the mouth of Frankenstein's creation the same words that that kid utilized after the fact: \\"You made this happen.\\"(Dr. Frankenstein's creation speaks well, does he not? Get a load of this sentence from the Doctor's creation, as the creation, in his own words, describes his seeing a young girl carrying a pail thusly: \\"As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose counternance expressed a deeper despondence.\\")Then we have the sympathetic Dr. Victor Frankenstein:\\"I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.\\" Actually, to be frank (pardon the pun), we not only have Victor and his creation's viewpoints, but Victor's viewpoint of the 1818 edition of this book and the 1831 revised (by Mary Shelley herself) edition. Likewise the Doctor's creation changes in some respects between editions. So we have 4 varying perspectives through which to view this novel, you could argue. While there were many stylistic changes made (I consulted the 1818 text---Frankenstein (Oxford World's Classics)---to see for myself what the differences were, just for curiosity), more substantive changes were also made, as well (substantial enough to give us another two takes on our pair of major characters). So, what were the changes? Well, for the 1831 version, Dr. Frankenstein's character was made more sympathetic, \\"who is partly absolved from blame for his early errors\\" (Appendix Oxford 1818 version). In addition, Dr. \\"Frankenstein's character is now built up as admirable\\" (Oxford again). And Dr. Frankenstein is given lines about 'the guardian angel of my life,' as well as referring to his soul. And, finally, Victor's love interest is made a non-relation in the 1831 version while the women in question in the 1818 version is his consistently identified and referred to as his (first) cousin. So, one could argue that Dr. Frankenstein was tempting fate in the 1818 version---the love interest with a first cousin and his being a scientist without an overly religious consciousness trying to replicate life; ie., attempting to play God---while in the 1831 version we get a far more sympathetic characterization of the Doctor: \\"I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thristed for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.\\" Who can really say why Mary Shelley made these changes, but It seems hard not to credit some of the tragedies which befell her in the interim. The 1818 novel was written by a daughter whose parents \\"had been heavily influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution,\\" and her father, to boot, was a radical of the anarchist Left; \\"an ex-Dissenting minister turned atheist...\\" While the 1831 version, one could conjecture, was influenced by these tragedies: the suicide of her husband's first wife (after Mary had stolen away with the then already married man), the death of 2 (of her 3) children, and the drowning of her husband. (The latter---the Oxford edition introduction notes---put her in a more precarious financial situation (not completely relieved until her father's passing in 1844.)So, where does that leave us? Which version should one read? Well, that's your call. Both versions convey, in Mary Shelley's own words, how \\"Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.\\" But at the same time, both versions pretty much make Dr. Frankenstein's artificial creation sympathetic too. The two versions just reorder the stress between these two notions; the 1818 version (SeeFrankenstein (Norton Critical Editions)) leaning more heavily on the former (but nowhere nearly so as does the James Whale classic Frankenstein film---Boris Karloff'sFrankenstein - The Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / Bride of / Son of / Ghost of / House of); wherein the creature is not portrayed as sympathetic and Victor is portrayed as a 'Mad' scientist), and the 1831 version being more of a fudge.

Rewind to Mary Shelley's original. \\"Frankenstein\\" is about recklessness, man's inhumanity to man, and the potential idolatry of science.The creature's desire for friendship mirrors Dr. Victor Frankenstein's desire to confide his secret to someone \\"normal.\\"Our author, the wife of English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, wrote \\"Frankenstein\\" when she was only 19 years old. Her story construction shows a remarkable sensibility that we'd find, if at all, in people much older. Some examples:Her choice of name for Victor's university instructor -- Professor Waldman. He encourages Victor's medical research to better diagnose and treat disease. Waldman represents the \\"wall\\" of ethical norms that no person, no matter how talented or well meaning, should go beyond. To do otherwise, a person may well lose himself and all he holds dear. Victor charges past the wall with disastrous results.Ambiguities of time and setting increases the story's power. Victor Frankenstein's faith tradition is left undetailed. Frankenstein sounds Jewish yet Victor and his family seem part of Geneva's gentile establishment. Perhaps VF is Roman Catholic and retains that religion's unhealthy fascination with the dead (with its disturbing statues of nailed-up Jesus and the habit of praying to deceased \\"saints\\"). Odd yet welcome that these people are in the vanguard of today's pro-life movement.It shouldn't escape notice that Geneva, while an international city at Europe's crossroads, was also home to John Calvin's experiment in Reform Protestant theocracy. So is Victor a Jew, a Catholic, or a Presbyterian? We aren't told and that's crucial. Shelley is showing us that spiritual blindness is an equal-opportunity malady.Negative reactions to the creature give us a glimpse of the violence lurking just below the surface of \\"civilized\\" society. Shelley's story is a signpost for how the manufactured men of advanced biology and other minorities-cum-servants come to be treated in a violent society. For prologue, see Alex Haley's \\"Roots.\\" For meditations on the future, view the movie \\"Blade Runner.\\" For contemporary applications, consider the debates over cloning and stem-cell research against a backdrop of a country where boxing, professional wrestling, the International Fighting League, and fisticuffs in hockey are taken to be normal instead of the abominations they truly are.The only weakness in \\"Frankenstein\\" is the creature's ability to speak. It's not clear how he received this power. The Vilna Gaon once told his most accomplished student, Rabbi Chaim Volozhiner, that it's not especially difficult to create a man if a person truly understands a book known as the Sefer Yetzirah. The creation is known as a golem. A golem can do everything a normal man can do including reason, the Gaon told Rav Chaim, the exception being the ability to talk. The speaking spirit that G-d gave Adam and subsequent members of the human race can only be bestowed by G-d.\\"Frankenstein\\" would have been even more terrifying and moving had Shelley withheld the power of speech (and some better movie treatments have handled it this way). Victor finding the creature's thoughts in a journal after his reign of terror would have been more poignant. Guess we can't blame our British Protestant author for not knowing Jewish tales involving golems.It's possible for Jews to become Frankensteins -- consider what Dr. Bernard Nathanson did to the unborn, including his own offspring, in the name of \\"women's rights\\" and \\"reproductive freedom\\" (read BN's \\"Aborting America\\") before his soul reawakened. Yet if Victor Frankenstein is Jewish he lacks the key ingredients in being an Israelite -- compassion and acceptance of responsibility.Failure to accept responsibility is what got the early fathers of mankind cursed (see the Book of Genesis for how G-d reacts when Adam tries to put off his sin on Eve and when Cain questions whether he needs to concerned about the whereabouts of murdered brother Abel). Noah moved the ball somewhat but only took responsibility for his own family. Our father Abraham, history's first prophet, was the pioneer in taking compassion and responsibility outside one's own tent, making converts and doing kindness to strangers. This set the pattern for Abraham's descendants and the spirit would manifest itself powerfully in his great-grandchildren Joseph and Judah, the sons of Israel.Notice in Genesis how the story of Judah taking responsibility for his children with Tamar (even embarrassing himself publicly in doing so) comes amid Joseph beginning a journey that will include stewardship of Egypt and a grand act of forgiveness. The Torah is showing us that the new ethic is blooming on two tracks destined to become one.The culmination comes when Joseph publicly tests Judah over the matters of their father (Jacob/Israel) and brother Benjamin. Judah demonstrates that his repentance and acceptance of responsibility are complete and immovable. Joseph's reservations melt and the brothers are tearfully reunited. Epilogue: Judah became the largest of the Israelite tribes and eventually become the identity for the entire holy nation -- all Israelites today are known as Yehudim, \\"Jews,\\" (Yehudah being the Hebrew equivalent of Judah). It became halacha (Jewish law) that all Jews are responsible for one another. And Joseph was given an extra portion of inheritance by Jacob mainly for his (Joseph's) ability to avoid the desire for revenge, something that consumed the main characters in \\"Frankenstein.\\" Israel must eventually forgive its/our brothers, the nations of the world, for the final redemption to occur.It's a pity Dr. Frankenstein didn't know the personal prayer of Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi (Judah \\"The Prince\\"), someone who knew a good bit about taking responsibility. Rabbi Yehudah, thanks to the good grace and cooperation of Edomite/Roman cousin Emperor Antoninus, was able to compile the Mishnah, ensuring Judaism's oral law would not be forgotten.Rabbeinu HaKadosh's daily prayer is found in the Babylonian Talmud (Berachos 16B) --\\"May it be Your Will, Hashem, my G-d, and the G-d of my forefathers, that You rescue me today and every day from brazen men and from brazenness, from an evil man, an evil companion, an evil neighbor, an evil mishap, the destructive spiritual impediment...\\"A few words from our author's husband in the heart of Victor Frankenstein may have saved the doctor and his creation from fates worse than death --\\"The winds of Heaven mix foreverWith a sweet emotionNothing in the world is singleAll things by a law divineIn one spirit meet and mingle.Why not I with thine?\\"(P.B. Shelley, \\"Love's Philosophy\\")"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was forced into reading this for my senior AP humanities class over the summer. I began about three weeks before school started, and it took me a week to get though, despite being a relatively short book. I literally almost fell asleep every ten pages. Mary Shelley almost as much in need of a good editor as friggin' Frank Norris with his stupid novel McTeague. She spend eons talking about how lovely the mountains are, then spends around five seconds explaining the birth of The Monster. This tendancy to skip over the exciting parts as though they were unimportant may have been intentional (that's what my humanites teacher tells me) but it still bored me. Also, I don't really care what the mountains looked like. Victor Frankenstein whines his way through the entire novel, which is really irritating because everything that happens to him is his own fault. When it comes to the development of The Monster, Mary Shelley seems to think that somehow, magically, The Monster knows way too much. Too many convient things happen. For example, he just happens to hang out behind a hut housing several very nice peasants, and they never notice? Yeah, right. Also, he just happens to find three very important and significant texts that have striking parallels to his own situation? Again, yeah right. It reached the point of ludicrocity. I sincerley did not enjoy this book, and though I know that it may partially be Percy Shelley's fault (evidently, he was her editor), and I know that Mary Shelley had many miscarriages and children's deaths and this book is about that and blah blah blah, I will never enjoy it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book had a really good idea for a story. Too bad she couldn't describe feelings to save her life. Its amazing that in less than a year, a monster, made from dead criminals can learn to speak better than i have been able to in my entire life. By the way? Where did he get the pieces of dead people? Yeah, he just walked in the local morgue and picked up the pieces he needed. Sure. Well if you have any thing that you need to get done DO IT BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK. I didn't think anyone could make a 160 page book seem so long! And talk about repetative. Well I think I made my point."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"3 Words best describe this book: wordy, contrived, and melodramatic. I LOVE reading classics, but this one consistently disappoints. A lot of classics are wordy, and a lot of Gothic tales are contrived and melodramatic, but at least the pay-off is worth the effort. Sadly, I cannot say the same for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

In laymen's terms, it did stupid things with the abilities of Mary Shelley. If anyone is looking for a book to read, he or she would be better off reading \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F.

I mean sure the concept of the book is cool but only two out of so may parts were the only interesting part. Wait, I take that back, three. The part in the letter where Walden first saw the monster, the part when Frankenstein was making the monster, and the part when the monster was killing people. The rest was just unwanted details. That book literally put me to sleep and it's about a monster! Frankenstein's suppose to be an exciting Halloween story gives little kids nightmares! Instead it's a bed time story for a caffeine addict.I thought it would be cool to finally know how the monster really came to life, but I didn't even get that much out of the book. It doesn't say how it was created, or even what happened to him after he left.If you've ever read the book you know that long 50 page story of when the monster was stocking those people in the cottage. Instead of that how about this. After scaring a man out of his home, the monster finds a hole in the wall, looks through it and sees people. He watches them 24 7 while he learns more words, gets more food, and evidently, learns how to read. After so long he decides to meet and actually talk to them, but does it the wrong way so they beat him up and throw him out. Then he runs away ashamed of himself.

THIS IS NOT A HORROR NOVEL. it really is not, as stated by a true horror master: H.P.Lovecraft. it is a philosophical supernatural drama. if you want a horror novel, you are looking in the wrong direction. i agree there is something grizzly here, but that does not make horror."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"\\"Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers.\\" - It describes how the monster was left all alone and didn't understand anything, but would find out a great deal about people.Victor Frankenstein is a person who likes to be with people but at the same time likes to be alone. He created Frankenstein. He is a really friendly guy but at the same time he has a passion to get back at the monster he created for killing all of his friends and family. He has a thing about doing what he thinks is best too.The Monster is someone who doesn't understand the meaning of life. He goes around trying to find out his purpose, and he is treated badly by every human he meets. So he goes bad and starts getting back at Frankenstein for making him and not making him a wife.The story takes place in Europe, around the 17th century. It mainly takes place in Geneva.It is a mystery kind of story.He used a lot or describing words, he described everything really good. He used a wide viraty of words. He is a good author, and he kept the ending good. I liked it.The problem is that the monster starts killing people and Frankenstein has to stop him. The monster is going out of control just to get revenge at his creator.I think that people who like adventurous books would, but they have to be able to read a lot, and be able to read through some boring parts because there were a few.I liked the book and would rate it a 7 out of ten. But the author used a few words a lot. But the story plot was good, and was pretty easy to follow as long as you were reading it and not just looking at it. It grabbed my attention, but at the same time some parts were just boring. And if you were to read it you would have to be able to know what some of the words mean, there were a few weird words too.

A man on the ship writes letters to his sister telling about their voyage and how they met a strange man by the name of Dr. Frankenstein. In the letters he retells Dr. Frankenstein's story of the creation of a monster that he abandons right after giving life to. Because it was so hideous nobody could meet it without running away and his creator abandoned it. With the lack of friends the monster is driven crazy and demands Dr. Frankenstein to make him a woman companion. When his request is turned down he promises a life of misery to Dr. Frankenstein and it keeps its promise. With all friends gone Dr. Frankenstein chases the fiend in hope of vengeance all the way to Antarctica were he gets on this ship. While on the ship Dr. Frankenstein dies and the fiend comes in to see his fallen creator. The fiend then repents and leaves the captain of the ship with the promise of burning himself alive. Frankenstein by Shelly is a sad, warning for the future, descriptive book worth every minute it takes to read it.This book builds very sad images while your reading along. The short story the monster tells about secretly helping a family but when it goes to confront them is beat with a frying pan and drove away it gives you a feeling sorrow for the monster. But when you read about Dr. Frankenstein's newly wed wife screaming as the monster strangles her to death you feel hatred for the monster and sad for Dr. Frankenstein. And even more heart compelling is when the monster is standing over its creator grieving and repenting for all the horrible things he has done to Dr. Frankenstein.During the book people are warned the possibilities of what would happen by giving life to a creature by man. It says by doing this you make a monster unable to be loved by the nicest of people. It also implies that by making a creature your just making a burden for yourself. Another factor proposed in the book that would disapprove of the making of a human is the chance of a violent natured monster set out to harm its creator and not a nice monster only there to help.The book is very descriptive in all aspects. The formation of the fiend is very in depth and the feelings the monster goes through are numerous. The landscape and harsh conditions the monster has to endure and the way he survives is covered, and the mental state of Dr. Frankenstein is always known.If I could I would reread the book to have the same emotions I had the first time round. It was a very sad book that carried an important message for people about the creation of a human in a descriptive manner. It was a fun experience for me and I am sure it will be for you also.(...)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I am one among the very few who has never watched a Frankenstein movie, but yet is very familiar with the name Frankenstein. Yet, it's highly ironic that popular culture (in film, television,etc.)has ironically came to confuse the name \\"Frankstein\\" with the Monster rather than the creator. This is one of the greatest attributes that has made Mary Shelly a genius of gothic and horror literature: uncertainty. She somewhat forces us to interpret the plot and the characters. For instance, who is really the monster, its creator or the monster itself? And most hauntingly, even more so to this day, where does science draw the line when it comes to the point that technology is playing the role of God? Even throughout the plot we aren't truly sure or convinced that any of the characters have grown wiser, or just sadder, if they learned anything at all. Is the monster a genius? Is he a murder, the \\"fallen angel,\\" a representation of a neglected Adam? Or simply just a child of innocence that was neglected and somewhat forced into a life of melancholy, despair, and adversity? Even after Mary Shelly had revised Frankstein, she has never changed the story. Her haunting novel still awakens us to think about the knowledge and imagination of man, and its limits, and how dangerous it can become if we start trying to become a substitute of God, or the \\"modern Prometheus.\\" I feel lucky that i have read this book before actually watching the Frankstein films, which i look foreward to seeing. But i know that the film doesn't follow Mary Shelly's novel exactly, however, it's a classic moment in pop culture. That has good points and negative points: first of all, regardless if people have read it or not, it opens us to a tale that still brings chills and suspense, and exemplifies the genius of the incredible author that made all of it possible. The sad thing is that people who have NOT read the book at all, and assume that they KNOW the story just from watching the classic Frankstein films, are truly missing out on a story that should be read, not just watched. I believe that people should learn this tale from literature first before pop culture. But from the looks of it, i guess it's easier to simply watch the film and be contented at that, which is fine. But hopefully, more people will be interested in knowing the true Frankstein who wasn't just some mumbling, grotesque creature, but one who was intelligent, articulate, an adept orator, and hauntingly just as human (and monstrous) as man itself."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is, by far, one of the best novels I have ever read. Set in the 1700s, the novel follows a captain on an important expedition. Frankenstein was written for a diverse audience. Anyone of any age or race could read this book and understand it without any problems. It not only keeps the reader interested in what is going on, but it also keeps the reader trying to guess what is going to happen next. The novel has a mysterious appeal. The plot is filled with many twists and turns which make it uneasy to spoil the story. The characters in Frankenstein are very unique. Each of them possess specific characteristics which make them key figures to the development of the plot. I believe there are many themes to this novel. I believe that tragedy, sorrow, and grief are the main themes though. All of the characters experience tragedy sorrow and grief brought on by a series of misfortunate events which occur throughout the story. This book is considered a classic because it has, over the years taken on its on identity, becoming one of the most popular myths of all time. There have been many different versions of the book and many movies, but nothing comes closer to the original version written by Mary Shelly. I would recommend this book to anybody of any age who is able to read it. It is not a complicated story to read and it is filled with many aspects that any reader could relate to. Science, love, mystery, and suspense all play a role in making the story interesting and worthy of reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I love this book and how fitting it should be written by the child of Mary Wollstonecraft and Percy Shelley.I just think on what my Literary Types prof at the University of Michigan had to say...\\"It's the story of a crazed undergraduate.\\"\\"All right, Viktor, you put the twelve-inch [organ] on the monster and what do you think he's going to do with it?\\"Made a 7 a.m. class worthwhile."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I believe at the time that this was written, that readers were expected to come away from reading this book with a sense that people should not try to emulate God by creating their own life from scratch. And in such, readers were supposed to empathasize with the monster and shun the doctor. I had the opposite reaction. Initially I had pity for the monster but it slowly disolved as the story wore on. I felt pity for the doctor. I think this is one of the classic stories of good versus evil. And the fact that the interpretation of who is good and who is evil is up to each individual reader. And it's because of this that this is one of my favorite books of all time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is a very well presented view of how society did, and still does, view the unusual and different. Mary Shelley did an excellent job portraying the monster, and an even better job showing his human emotions and compassion. At first, you are led to believe that the creature is an abomination in the name of human kind, but quickly realize that he did not ask to be created, and that he is nothing more than what his creator's hands molded. This is also a look into the subject of human beings \\"playing god\\", and offers many viewpoints that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, it can be incorporated with modern subjects, where everything is not \\"black and white\\", but where there is a \\"gray\\" uncertain area (cloning, etc.).

Make sure you read the introduction and preface; and also the Letters before you get to chapter one because if you don't you will get a bit confused in the story. The story was well written, but one thing is that it never mentions how he created the monster so it was a bit confusing. It is much different than what I thought Frankenstein was, or how they show him in TV shows or commercials. Other than that the story was good and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"THis isn't the old Frankenstein story you think it is. THis is simply an amazing story written by a very young woman. I was blown away as to the emotional strings this book pulls. An absolute must-read!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If you like horror, then this book is one you should strongly consider reading. Forget about your \\"ideas\\" of Frankenstein from the movies, and instead focus on the life of a man who plays god. Dr. Victor Frankenstein who creates a living human being all by himself. But, who would of thought that when the creature would awake, Victor's creation would turn out to be a horrible monster that even Victor himself rejects.The story opens in the frozen Arctic wastes during a sea-going expedition to find a passage through the ice to the East. Aboard the ship after a strange meeting, Frankenstein tells his story. As a young man he wanted to find ways to create bigger and better things in the sciences, and indeed figured out a way to create life. Having done so, he became alienated from the world, which left significant consequences for both Frankenstein and his creation. The two interact closely throughout the book, sometimes almost like twin brothers (in one sense as if the monster was a form of Victor) and like Creator and creation in another.While the monster's appearance frightens many he is still merely just human, and desires like all other humans for anyone's understanding, and loving to fulfill his need to be accepted. The theme of friendship and ambitions can be seen, and the conflict of each of these difference shows through each of Victor and his creations appearances with each other.This novel is memorable due to its depth, mood, descriptions of Victor's creation, and mostly of the dark, cold truth telling of the real monsters within others, and not just necessarily in Dr. Frankenstein's creature.This book may present some significant challenges to its reader's. The novel seems to take a long time to develop each of it's specific points, so patience is required to go through layer after layer in hopes of being able to see the underlying picture of the story told.Why, give the book three stars instead of five? The awkwardness of the story was an annoying setback, but well worth the read. While many may not fail to be drawn back by this, it was something that made it harder to push through. While the style of the book moves and develops extremely slowly, just when you feel nothing could happen, it does! That is what makes the book go on, and the reader becomes satisfied.After you have had a chance to absorb and appreciate the consequences of this book you find you are then asking yourself how you yourself relate with others. Then you start to examine future potential consequences you might make. This book can help you in a way to think about your actions before you take them, and make your decisions more worthwhile."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"\\"Frankenstein&quot; is Mary Shelley's first novel written in 1818 It is turned to everyone: young people, who are still in the search for their own identity, adults who will be called to reconsider some well-forgotten moments of their life, and all pleasure seeking readers. This novel is influenced by Mary Shelley's personal misfortune. The aspiration for writing the story appeared in a peculiar way, and so strange is the content. It is not an everyday chance to find and read such a novel. It follows the characteristic features of the novels of the nineteenth century--it is as if not directly retold by the author. Mary Shelley is hidden somewhere behind the story of the characters. And this makes the novel not only sound real, but also even-handed, and thus credibility is established. \\"Frankenstein\\" is in the form of letters, and the story sounds as though it is directed and created for the reader. The Epistolary technique brings the reader into the action. A letter is something extremely personal and dear, and by making the reader part of it, the whole experience is more than just reading a book. The fact that the book is still widely read and studied is because Mary Shelley addresses issues that are timeless. This is one of the basic merits of the novel. The monster is the embodiment of men's defiance and disrespect of Nature. So we are confronted with questions about the importance of human life, the responsibilities one should bear for what she does, the availability of happiness in one's life, and the prejudices of society towards the one who is different. But what is most valuable in the book is not posing questions, but rather lighting the way to find the answers. After reading this book, one is called to rethink her values and her place in the modern society. Mary Shelley's book imposes a philosophical issue of whom we really are -creatures learned to conform to society, living by its norms, with its consciousness. We subconsciously hide our feelings from the rest of the society. Thus we may lose them and become rational creatures, losing touch with our identity and individuality. Reading such books brings not only pleasure, but also acumen into our own psyche. So by opening the first pages of Mary Shelley' s masterpiece--Frankenstein, you are on the verge of savoring the authenticity and originality of this literary creation."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A thrilling tale of monsters and insanity,(on the madd scientist's part of course).

In spite of this, I felt incredibly distanced from him due the language used to describe his emotions.Nonetheless, the book's themes are fascinating and insightful. It is basically a story of how a man's arrogance and thirst for knowledge leads him to meddle with nature, and what tragedy this causes both for him and the being he creates.

I beg you not read the story as a horror story, but as a truth about human-kind."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Victor Frankenstein always loved science. He loved even more trying to figure out how life was brought into people and how it was taken out. Finally after two years of college he finds out how. In finding out how he made the worst mistake in the history of mankind.Once he figured out how to put life into something he was dying to try it. He stole body parts from cemeteries and created a creature. The creature was a monstrous wretched creature. Right when it came alive it ran away. When people saw it they gasped. Now the creature hated Victor for ever creating him. Frankenstein's creature goes to kill everybody in Victor's family and his friends. Victor's life will never be the same.This is a great book for ages nine and up. It is a classical fiction book but will never bore minds. I definitely recommend for action fans. An action packed and compelling story! A must read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"As a high school student in an honors lit class we had to read this book as a required reading. I was expecting it to be cheesy (sort of like those movies and for it to have a very simple plot line), well I was wrong. Mary Shelly was only around 19 when she wrote this story and it was for a contest. I wonder if she even realized how amazing Frankenstine actually is!The story takes you on a nearly suspenseful journey that will have you questioning your true feeling on what is called the &quot;monster&quot;. Sometimes Frankenstine's monster seems to be good with true feelings and well, other times the &quot;monster&quot; becomes the source of disaster for everything he holds dear. During the story the inventor also makes a woman &quot;monster&quot; for his somewhat demented invention but all is not well and the woman's pieces are scattered throughout the ocean. This is when the wrath of the &quot;monster&quot; is felt and the &quot;monster&quot; runs then off to cause disaster. From then on Frankenstine trys to stop his invention before it's too late (and this is when the beginning of the story picks up---you will understand what I'm saying if you read the book :)The story is excellent and there is not a boring part in it! Shelly builds up the suspence slowly and torments the readers with a veriety of conflicting emotions. It is the basis of todays horror, mystery, and thrillers. It is a must read for ANYONE who enjoys a GREAT book----read it and I promise you will NOT forget it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I read this for 11th grade english and was not thrilled with having to read it because I wanted more Shakespeare. However I did read this book and was struck at how many themes in it were applicable to the moral battles being fought today. Stem-cell research, cloning, designer babies, etc... All of this was being touched on by an author who couldn't ever dream how true her prose might ring. My experience with this book may be distorted because when you read a book with a guide (such as a teacher) your opinions become mingled with your teachers. The character of Victor is fascinating but he is one that you will hurt deeply for. He does so many things that will repulse you and he takes so little responsibilities for his creation and the consquences that will spring from it. Read it and soak up the story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A Flash of lightning strikes, thunder crashes rumbling the whole house and suddenly... Wait a minute! This is not the book I read. The image that our society has of Frankenstein is extremely twisted from Mary Shelley's original. I am not exactly sure if the ugly, horror image was the one that Shelley was attempting to achieve. However, she ended up creating a novel that dealt more with an individual struggle rather than a horror story. Victor Frankenstein, who is not the creature, but the creator, provides readers with many interesting perspectives about his thinking and motives. Mary Shelley has written an excellent novel for readers who want to analyze her work using various critical methods.I believe she has also written an excellent novel for readers who can stand an extremely slow pace. The story began and I felt like I was never going to reach the heart of the novel. However, once the reader moves through the introduction, Shelley does not stop giving you creative images and adventure. Overall, I believe the novel was a descent story for the basic, surface reader. In addition, I think that the psychoanalytic critics could have a field day with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"what up?, well i have read this book all i can say is this and that, the book is good though but there is a lot of lack of information"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is not just a horror story, it is one of the most moving commentaries on humanity that I have ever read.

Classic in every respect and deserves a standing ovation when you are done reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I watched the movie with Helena Boham Carter first, and I thought it was a wonderful movie, so I decided to read the book. The book was a terrible book. I couldn't relate to any of the characters, except the creation. Everyone, except the creation, was so perfect! Elizabeth was Barbie incarnate! She was smart, talented, kind, loving, honest, loyal, beautiful (looked just like Barbie). Victor was the same, except he made something that wasn't beautiful. So an ugly thing crashes Victor's perfect world. Boo-hoo-hoo. The only thing that made sense in the story was the creation. The way he explained how he was so lonely, how if Victor made something, why would he want to make it suffer so. I felt so bad for the creation. Victor made absolutely no sense in why he wouldn't make a companion for the creation. He said something about evil, and how there would be more killing, but the creation explained to him, more than once, why he did what he did (the little boy, the friend, etc.) And he even warned Victor that there would be more destruction unless he had a companion. The ending was good, how the captain understood the monster. I felt contempt for the characters in the book. The creation was the only character who had any depth. Victor and Elizabeth and everyone else was so involved with their perfect, beautiful world that it was dumb. They were so flat, one dimensional characters. I know that Shelley wanted us to understand the monster, which I did (thus the 2 stars), but the rest of the characters were mindless. Real life isn't like Victor's world. Real life is like the Creation's world. Searching for something, searching for a part of you, searching for the meaning of why we were put on this earth because life is vicious and cruel. I would recommend reading this book only for the sake of the character of the Creation. It was such a small book, but I got so annoyed by the dumbo characters."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A lot of people get confused with the&quot;creature&quot; and the Hollywood &quot;monster&quot;.That's bad because in the book he's not some green stupid oaf.

But he has given his creation the brain of a very smart doctor,and it dosn't want to die . . ."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein has so much more to offer us than horror and scince-fiction.Mary Shelley wrote a story which encompasses human feelings of guilt, despair,love,desire,and so much more.Read what Victor says about his mother's death and what the monster says about knowledge to see what I mean.A man decides to make a human,but in the first case he cannot assume responsibility.The same is true for when he tries to make the monster a mate,but he realizes this and cannot go through with it.The name of Frankenstein is the name of the scientist, but it is more than misuse that causes it to be considered the name of the monster.In his own way,Frankenstein's monster is as humane,sensitive and prone to lamenting mistakes as Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Although many people make the mistake of thinking that the creature in the novel is named Frankenstein, the truth is that Frankenstein is actually the name of the doctor who created the monster. The story is narrated by Victor himself, who makes it quite clear that his quest for knowledge will be his undoing. I thouroughly enjoyed this novel. I found everything about it to be interesting. I especially like the way that the plot unravled and jumped from place to place. It did not get confusing either. It was quite easy to follow. The characters were well drawn and in everything that they did, their motives were clearly known to the reader. None of the characters did anyhting that seemed out of context. There were parts of the book that were a little drawn out and slow, but it always picked right back up again. Mary Shelley presents an issue that is very applicable right now. Is it morally right to play God and attempt to create life? Obviously, Shelley's opinion is that it can only lead to disaster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Shelly's use of words and imagery, in this classic book, allows the reader to feel and see the intense relationship between creator and monster. It's a mood of anger, sorrow, and outrage. The details of the chase for revenge are strong enough that the reader is scared for humanity, but feels sorrow for the hideous monster. This book is my personal favorite. Shelly makes this a romantic battle of wits till the end."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"i have always heard about this book and when i found it for free i read it and loved it"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley was born in London in 1797, two years before the death of George Washington. She wrote \\"Frankenstein\\" when she was 19 or 20, depending on which literary historian you choose to believe. If you approach this novel as the work of a teenager in the England of two centuries ago, it is impressive. If you treat it as a piece of literature, it is absolutely awful. As many other readers have pointed out, the basic story idea is great but it is very badly written. Shelley's language is flowery to the point of absurdity. She might be allowed to get away with wildly overwritten dialogue, considering the period in which the book was written, but just try to imagine the nine-foot tall hideous monster, who has deliberately murdered a small child, speaking these lines: \\"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, nor herself understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.\\" The plot, too, has some seriously nonsensical elements, the most basic of which may be Victor Frankenstein simply walking away from his newly created monster. The creation of the monster, incidentally, is not described. All of the lightening-catchers and pseudoscientific gadgetry was the invention of later dramatists. Mary Shelley's achievement was to create the Frankenstein myth, which has been dramatized and parodied repeatedly. Despite the glaring faults of her novel, \\"Frankenstein\\" is historically important, and the story itself does have some genuinely interesting episodes. The edition published by Everyman's Library is inexpensive, nicely printed and bound, and has an excellent introduction by Wendy Lesser. Shelley's early life, as described by Lesser, was so bizarre and socially irresponsible that it would make a good subject for a historical novel. \\"Mother of Frankenstein\\"?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was never one for monster stories or haunted houses and such,being only nine,but I felt it was unfair to dock a star for that.Frankinstien is a wonderful work of art.Lots of modern day stuff houners Frankenstien.Some time in their program, Frankenstien is featured on almost every modern T.V. show.Now that it's free you have no excuse not to read it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"just about everyone has heard the story of Frankenstein, so i'm going to skip that part of the review and go right on to \\"what is this story about\\".well, as far as i can tell it appears to be about a woman, who leaves the security-and watchful eyes- of friends and family, gets pregnant, has a child, then spends the rest of the book covering up while the child finds out just what it is like to be a bastard in the early 1800's. with no friends, family, connections, or money the child has no hope of a future and decides to take revenge on its creator.why do i think Frankenstein is a woman? having read quite a few gothic novels, i can say that victor is not a masculine character, he is a feminine one. he does not do guy things like shooting, hunting, hanging out with the guys riding horses. he spends his time at home with the ladies doing girl things.his decent into moral wrong is simple, he reads trashy novels that gives him ideas, when he is away from friends and family he has the opportunity to experiment with these dark ideas, with no one to check him he sinks deeper and deeper in to depravity until finally he creates a fully fledged monster and the sight of which suddenly causes him to realize all the terrible things that he has done, and no one must know about.now take this and turn it into a female's way. SHE reads trashy novels, SHE is away from friends and family and has the opportunity to experiment with these ideas, with no one to check her SHE sinks deeper and deeper into depravity until she gives birth at which time she realizes all the terrible things that she has done, and no one must know about.the most telling feminine thing victor does is just after he creates the monster. he faints and is sick for 3 months. a woman being sick for 3 month used to be indicative of bed fever. a person cant get bed fever without having a baby first."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is a great work, though one that has consistently been underratedand misrepresented. Frankenstein is, in the words of Donald H. Reiman, \\"themost seminal literary work of the Romantic period\\". It is a work of profoundand radical ideas, written in poetically powerful prose. Frankenstein is notreally a gothic novel, although its author sometimes employs gothicconventions and language, and even spoofs them. Rather, Frankenstein is anenduring myth, a novel of ideas, and above all, a moral allegory about theevil effects of intolerance and prejudice, ostracism and alienation, both tothe victims of intolerance and to society at large.Since there are some good reviews here, I'll concentrate on thisparticular edition -- the Chicago edition edited by James Rieger.This is one of the two best editions of Frankenstein available (the otherbeing the Norton Critical edition). Most importantly, this isthe original 1818 edition, rather than the inferior, bowdlerized 1831edition -- which is the most common, and the only one that was available forwell over a century. James Rieger was the first editor to make the case for thesuperiority of the 1818 edition, and he did so convincingly enough that almost allscholars of English Romanticism now prefer the 1818 edition. Rieger took a lotof flak from feminist academics for asserting that Percy Bysshe Shelley was,at the very least, a minor collaborator. In my considered opinion, Shelley was the primary author, and Mary Shelley was merely his secretary.The appendices in this edition include the full text of John William Polidori'sstory, \\"The Vampyre: A Tale\\" and Byron's brief fragment of a vampire story.Rieger's comments on the 1831 Introduction (written ostensibly by Mary, but withmuch help from her father, William Godwin) are perceptive.Please check out my own book, The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein, whichmakes the case that Frankenstein was really written by Percy Bysshe Shelley,one of the greatest poets in the English language."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I grew up seeing Frankensteins on windows and as costumes during the Halloween season, but never did I know, until now, that Frankenstein in the novel is the man who created this abomination from body parts and some electricity, and this plot makes for an intriguing novel...certainly different than the popular images/movies of Frankenstein, and perhaps even better.Victor Frankenstein grows up thirsty for knowledge and with a penchant for the dark arts. He is studying at a university when he creates the monster that everyone knows today as Frankenstein, although in reality he is never named. The creature stands at eight-feet-tall and is grotesque in form. Horrified, Victor runs away, and soon the creature leaves the building to wander the earth. The creature is never far from Victor's tormented mind.Later, as the naive creature is repeatedly scorned and shunned by humans, he murders Victor's beloved friends and family, beginning with his brother William. Victor is guilt-ridden because the accused is innocent, and he knows that his own creation was the one who strangled the boy. Victor's health deteoriates so he retreats to the mountains, only to come face to face with the creature. There, he learns of the monster's isolation from humanity and its yearn for companionship, but Victor never really does anything about it, which leads only to more tragedy.The storyline is amazing; Shelley wrote this when she was only a teenager. Yes, the language is a bit too flowery at parts; for example, the monster has extensive, absurd vocabulary and conversations that I find a bit laughable, but flowery language was not unusual in the 19th century. I could definitely picture in my mind Victor's emaciated self (the mad scientist look), the monster's anger --he should be like Adam of the Bible but he is not--, and all Victor's beloved die off, one by one. Great classic read, if you can get past the verbose writings :)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I am an 18 year old college student, and I was required to read Frankenstein and analyze it.

But, being required to read it, I went along with it.Into the first couple chapters, I became more and more interested. When the Creature was finally ressurected was when I had my epiphany.This book is packed full of messages regarding Knowledge, Passion, Regret, Sorrow, Selfishness, and Prejudice.Those who dislike this book must not have the mental capability to \\"read between the lines\\" and find the hidden messages that Shelley places.Overall, one can learn much about the value of life, and what it means to truly be happy."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The book is very different from any Frankenstein movie I have ever seen.

Commentators and critics throw out all sorts of theories about Mary Shelley's original message, many of them centering on the creation riling against its Creator.At last I've read the book for myself (my first novel read on an e-reader). The story starts with a ship in the cold Arctic regions coming across a man, almost dead, upon an ice floe. This man is Victor Frankenstein, who gives account of his life for us, telling of his youthful interest in science, of his search for the key to life, and his discovery thereof. In his pride, he unleashes a monster that wreaks havoc more upon its creator than anyone else. The story ranges from Italy and Switzerland to Germany, England, and beyond. A number of murders occur, and Frankenstein in his unwillingness to seek help or bring the truth into the light, suffers the consequences, in much the same way we see in \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"\\"Frankenstein\\" is so much more than I expected, more literary and thought-provoking. It touches on the evil within each of us, and the way that is unleashed through our pride, our secrecy, and our anger. In many ways it's a metaphor for man and science, for man and arrogance, for man and sin. This story continues to reverberate because it touches on so many themes, defying easy interpretation all the while. On the other hand, \\"Frankenstein\\" is much less than I expected. The horror and violence are mostly committed out of view of the reader. The story, like \\"Dracula,\\" is told through journals and letters and remembrance so that it feels personal while also feeling detached from the original actions.A precursor to many of our science fiction novels of today, \\"Frankenstein\\" was the foundation for H.G. Wells and Robert Louis Stevenson to further build upon these themes, and later, writers such as Heinlein and Crichton. It's all the more remarkable for being written by an English woman in the early 1800s, a stark contrast to books such as \\"Jane Eyre.\\" It loses some of its horror and excitement in today's market, but remains a classic for its language and themes."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The book was in the condition it was promised, but it took a lot longer to recieve it then expected.

I rated this book based more for being a horror classic and for basically inventing the creature feature horror genre and less on actual entertainment and merit."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A Review of Mary Shelley's FrankensteinWhen has science gone too far? What is man? What is the responsibility of a creator to a creation? These questions are resonant themes as well as questions that are presented throughout the book. Shelley gives an answer to all three questions through the eyes of her main characters Victor Frankenstein and his \\"monster.\\"Immediately with Frankenstein's freakish human creation, the reader is quickly alerted to the wrongness of it. The shock and horror felt by Frankenstein at his creature sets up the moral struggle that was so evidently in the mind of Shelley. In her preface she mentions that the actuality of a creature being given life is not an impossibility according to Darwin and some physiological German writers. With this in mind, Frankenstein is a book intended to create fear and engender greater moral responsibility to the science community and those who regulate it. Frankenstein is shocked by the creature he created, and because of his selfishness, cowardice, and lack of compassion, Frankenstein's creature becomes a monster. In regards to what constitutes a man -- it is a more philosophical question - this question is addressed clearly in the conversation between Frankenstein and his monster. The monster had raised himself; he learned language and social skills by observing others, as well as the necessities of survival. The monster had emotions and feelings, and though he was horribly deformed and a frightful looking creature, he was most assuredly human -- not because his physical members were collections of dead human corpses, but because he demonstrated that he could learn, communicate through language, and reason. Shelley portrays this terrible dilemma for the monster that longs for human interaction, but because his looks are extremely frightening he is forced into isolation. And then the next emphasis -- what is the creator's (Frankenstein's) responsibility to his creature, the monster? It seems that is left ultimately up to the reader to resolve, but many passages lead one to determine that Frankenstein had a great responsibility for the creature and those around him. The problem was that he catered to one individual in a foolish manner, and lost both because of his fear of the monster.When should one refrain from experimenting? Well, interestingly Shelley seems to indicate that life is not something for the scientist to meddle in. The horrors of the monster bring evils upon everyone that is even remotely connected to the monster. The deaths of Justine, Elizabeth, and Clerval are terrible and gut wrenching, yet so is the pain of the monster and Frankenstein. It seems that Shelley is asserting that life is sacred, and developing it can be dangerous. Frankenstein, though with noble intentions, created and then abandoned his creation from fear, and it was from this act of abandonment that the monster blamed for his behavior. The order of the world is set off balance because of Frankenstein's creature in Shelley's book, and this is because science was not appropriated correctly, but was instead used selfishly which ultimately resulted in lethal consequences.In the portion of the book where the creature recounts his two years before meeting up with Frankenstein, there was a narrative of how he survived. The inhabitants of the cottage home that he observed became his unknowing teachers. The monster learned how to talk, and learned social interactions in that he learned what a mother was, etc. This even prompted a naturally human response -- kindness. The creature took care of the people in the house, cutting down wood for them and doing other outdoor chores. The creature surely resembled a man, yet his appearance in sighted so much terror that it is hard to grapple with the idea that he truly was a man because of his peculiar origins and the evil that he soon would embark on. However, Shelley gives light to the reader on why the monster spreads terror throughout Frankenstein's circle of family and friends, thus rendering him human, and the reason cited is neglect. Shelley devotes several chapters to the questioning of the creator by the created, and develops a rich dialogue between the two men.In the first chapter of the second volume, the monster lectures Frankenstein that Frankenstein's neglect of him was wrong, and that the bond between them can only be broken with one of their deaths. Now comes in to play the question of the responsibility of a creator over his or her creation? It seems Shelley would have the individual creator weigh the pros and the cons. However, this is not done because Frankenstein was rash, and it then fell to him to destroy the work his hands had made. The last part of the book is about Frankenstein unrelentingly pursuing the monster after he finally makes the good decision not to make a female monster. Thus the lesson taught by Shelley's gothic horror reaches its final conclusion to eradicate a horrible mistake.In the Pocket Books publication of Frankenstein, it puts forward several themes that the publishers believe are the main motifs of the book. The first they state is science versus nature. They explain that \\"there are some things man is not meant to know (Pocket Books).\\" It goes on to state that there is a struggle between what is natural and what is interference by man. Another theme is feminism and motherhood, because the publishers believe that this book provides an insight to a female mind, and gives a feminine interpretation of a gothic novel. It is argued here that gothic tales are typically a male oriented type of writing, yet the most famous of gothic tales is by a woman.The second to last theme cited is \\"monstrosity.\\" \\"The issue of what is a monster lies at the heart of the novel.\\" This main theme, according to the publishers, is what haunts the book through and through. At moments the story sets up an emotional conflict that has you feeling sympathy for the monster, and yet at once also feeling fearful and disgusted by the monster's actions. And the last theme is that of secrecy, because, of course, secrecy has a lot to do with the demise of the characters in the book. It is secrecy that eats up Frankenstein, and holds him hostage to help his fellow man.The Pocket Book publishers had it right. This book surely is about science versus nature -- it is the same theme presented in this paper that asks when has science gone too far? The question presented here is just a more blunt and simple form of the complex discussion of science versus nature. Truly, this overarching theme is in play from the creation of the monster, to the havoc and blood shed wreaked by the monster, to Frankenstein's contemplation to appease the creature by creating another, to finally his pursuit of the demon. It is a tale of people trying to achieve knowledge they should not. The publishers argue that it is both Frankenstein and Robert Walton that are acting unnatural by trying to create life, but end up in fact destroying life.The idea of feminism and motherhood really has little to do with this tale. There seems to be nothing classically feminine about this tale, nor does it have anything to do with motherhood directly. This tale is a great one because Mary Shelley was a brilliant and gifted writer -- just as many other women are as well as many men. This book is a token of her greatness as an author, but this novel's greatness has nothing to do with feminine themes or motherhood. It may be an interesting side note though, that at the time it was written very few women or mothers wrote books. So it is also interesting that she was only 18 years old when she created this story, but surely none of these were factors that led to the book's success, rather it was the talent and dedication of Mary Shelley, the person.The monstrosity and secrecy themes are extremely relevant. The monstrosity theme is linked to the other two questions presented in this paper -- what is man and what is the responsibility of the creator to the creation? The monstrosity is what raises a question about responsibility to the creation, because it is undetermined whether the creation is a monster or human - if he is a monster then kill it or if human then help it. Parts of this dilemma are briefly touched on in this paper, but are these links correct? The monstrosity is what keeps the reader reading. The reader is left with two decisions - is the creature a man or is it a monster? The secrecy theme is also relevant. Frankenstein refuses to tell authorities in the beginning about the monster, because he believes they will think him insane. He keeps all this to himself until he has lost everyone important to him. Only then does he finally start telling people. Of course it is too late then, and his initial instincts were right, in that the people he tells, other than Robert Walton, do think he is crazy. However, Robert Walton sees the creature himself at the end, so if he had any doubt it was displaced by sight. The secrecy was so powerful that it ate at Frankenstein, and in a way, the tale was told because it was his last way to release the agony of keeping the secret.Shelley's Frankenstein explores so many areas. The themes are abundant and the ideas suggested, and bluntly stated, are sprinkled throughout. Readers have been, and will continue to be challenged by this work. Challenges that become more and more relevant each day with the world of changing technology. When has science gone too far? When should society enact ethics laws to block some science? The questions go on and on ... the most important of all should be the resounding theme of the sanctity of life. What constitutes life and when is it society's responsibility to take it, nurture it, or create it? These questions are pondered and even given answers in Frankenstein. The book also gives warning to those who are ambitious and those who have great talent to be careful, because oftentimes those attributes can lead to disaster as was so tragically seen by Frankenstein.With our modern age full of amazing scientific discovery and meddling with the laws of nature (e.g. genetic engineering) this book will continue to fascinate. It is ultimately unimportant, and probably was for Shelley too, whether or not man could really ever create life in the way Frankenstein did, but it is the maddening pursuit, the gross abandonment of morality and blinding terror of disorder that punctuates this story. In an age that is wrestling with questions of science and morality such as embryonic research, abortion, life support, gender change surgery... this book serves as a strong caution...monsters may yet be created, and they may not be a work wrought just by medical doctors and scientists, but rather they could become the monsters themselves.No matter which side one may come down on the issues of today, there is one thing that no one can dispute -- Mary Shelley, a woman who lived in the 19th century wrote a marvelous book that seems to become more relevant as time progresses. A woman living in the times of Dr. Darwin, who contemplated his ideas and was challenged by her two friends and husband, wrote a novel that has invoked fear into many millions of readers. Shelley penned the words of Frankenstein in an era that was beginning to boom with the modern interpretation of science, will always be remembered for her masterful work of art. It most assuredly will continue to endure the test of time and will be a blessing to provide a conscience for modern science or a haunting reminder of what man was able to do, but shouldn't have.Work CitedShelley, Mary.

Highly recommend especially for the price. Great for a class set. I ordered for students at school. It is the 1818 version, which I like better in a lot of ways, but may not be the same as your school's library if that is a concern. I like the three volumes and fewer hints \\"you will laugh at my allusion\\" (1832) in the 1818 verses some of the over editing in the 1832. I will switch to the $2 copy from Thrift because it is the 1832 and most students borrow or buy that one, so the class will have the same language.Frankenstein (Dover Thrift Editions)Though it has no dedication page (INSTUMENTAL in understanding her work!) or notes- they have me in class."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Chapter 14 should have been cauterized. There you are, engrossed in the monster's struggle for love, acceptance, and identity, and then Shelly stitches on an extra appendage--kinda like Victor Frankenstein sewing a hand or foot onto the monster's back--a convoluted back story of how Felix, one of the cottagers, saves and elopes with Safie, a Turkish-Arabian love interest. Chapter 14 does absolutely nothing for the story, save provide a means for the creature's learning to speak and read. (In one movie version, Branagh's, the cottagers are simply teaching their own children to read and write, which further strikes at the core of the monster's suffering. I disliked the movie, though.) Chapter 14, I can't stand it! It could have and should have been reworked, but it wasn't.

Mary Shelley's dark horror story is about a promising young man who decided that he had to discover how to create life. When he finally unlocked the secret to doing this, he constructed a body to spark with life. The moment he made his creation come alive, though, he was consumed with horror and remorse, and ran in shame. His creation ran, and lived in the woods for months, where he began to learn things. The monster discovered a family living on a poor farm and hid in an unused portion of their home for yet another few months, learning how to talk from them by watching. Finally, he worked up his courage to confront them, but it turned to disaster and he was sent running. From here his hatred for man grew, and he murdered an innocent boy whom he found out was related to his creator. Dr. Frankenstein found the monster, confronted him, and agreed to make him a companion so that the monster would have some one to confide in. The doctor destroyed the body right before he finished though, and his monster killed all his friends and family. Frankenstein chases the monster until he cannot anymore, and the monster kills itself out of remorse.This chilling story is a vivid reflection of Mary Shelley's Marxist-like beliefs. It is a twisted and gruesome story, but an entertaining one at that. It is a great work of fiction, and a classic. A good gothic horror read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I read this book for an English class I had to take, and it was very helpful!!!The book not only included the text, but interpretation notes as well which were very helpful!!!So glad I bought this book!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Damon Medic says If you believe \\"Frankenstein\\" is a \\"Monster\\" story, you need to read this novel.

You will probably cry while reading. Don't trust me; find out for yourself. Read Frankenstein, and you'll see what I mean!-Damon Medic"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Maybe the most surprising thing about reading Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* is in discovering just how different--and how much more complex--the original is than the story as it has passed into popular culture. Here is one of the great myths of modern man and the Age of Science and Reason; it's a myth that in some respects is even more relevant today with the prospect of widespread genetic engineering. The dream of unlocking the secret of life--and the parallel fear that it might turn into a nightmare remains with us long after Shelley gave it form in this short novel.On the downside, Shelley's prose bears all the faults of the age in which it was composed. *Frankenstein* is almost unbearably overwritten, its characters melodramatically overwrought, and the whole production bathed in the over-the-top hysteria that often typifies Romantic literature. It's comical to hear long eloquent orations delivered by characters in the middle of scenes in which they're literally fighting for their lives--and, indeed, even more ridiculous to hear the monster himself speaking like a Shakespearean actor. To be sure, Shelley's monster is a great deal different than the green-skinned blockhead of the movies, no bolts in his neck, jagged forehead scar, or monosyllabic groans here. This is a pensive, autodidactic monster. Still, the way Shelley envisions him, he's actually far more horrific than Boris Karloff or Herman Munster. Here we have a stitched together assemblage of corpse-parts that the flesh doesn't always entirely cover, leaving the workings of tendons and the like grotesquely exposed to view. He's a wild, ragged, hideous-looking zombie, but not a shambling, sleepwalking, unfeeling drone; instead, he's super-strong, super-agile, super-fast--and he's as eloquent as Cicero.Certainly, Shelley felt it necessary to give the monster a brain and the silver-tongue to express its complex cogitations because *Frankenstein* is, in the end, more a philosophical novel than a tale of horror. What does it mean to be human? Do we overstep our bounds by encroaching on the miracles of life and try to play \\"god\\"? Is there a god? Do we not feel pity for the \\"monster,\\" which, by its appearance alone, seems to be the embodiment of all we loathe and fear...and yet, in fact, only wants for compassion and companionship to make it \\"human\\"? These are the kinds of questions that Shelley asks in *Frankenstein* and to do so she allows her monster to defend himself in the court of ideas like F. Lee Bailey.For that matter, it's somewhat hard to wrap one's mind around the fact that Shelley's Victor Frankenstein begins his work at reanimating corpses while still at college and--instead of the more appropriate middle-aged scientist familiar from innumerable remakes--Dr. Frankenstein in this novel is no older than his mid-20s throughout. Apparently, Shelley herself wasn't yet twenty when originally composing the tale, so that perhaps explains Frankenstein's age here, but it doesn't seem quite right to have him be so young.Still, if you can get past the various absurdities, the purple prose, the frequent repetition, and the more tedious travelogue descriptions of the countrysides of Switzerland, Scotland, the frozen north, etc. there are some genuinely frightening scenes and, more importantly, still-compelling ideas that make Shelley's *Frankenstein* not only the original, but the best elucidation of the myth of the mad man of science and the responsibility of the creator towards ((and for)) that which he creates. If for only the sheer importance and enduring influence of this work in literature and popular culture, Shelley's *Frankenstein* is worth reading, and giving four stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is a horror classic that no matter how many times you read the story...it's still good!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was surprised by the literary beauty of this book and by its intriguing horror. It was not at all what I had expected based on my exposure to Frankenstein movies and tales. This story is quite different in many ways that make it more appealing to the reader.The tale involves a monster that is truly hideous in form but reveals a conflicted mind and heart. Shelley effectively causes the reader to have mixed feelings about this creature that wields destruction while confessing its own misery and affection for humanity.She also conveys the dangers of a person pursuing his or her ambition at the cost of other values such as relationships and peace.The novel is told in an innovative fashion. Shelley uses three different narrators to tell the story. This creates some variety in the point of view and in the voice of the narrator.This book is very compelling, but at times I had to put it down due to the tragedy of it. The whole time you know where its events are leading and a part of you wants to go there and another part wants to avoid it--like watching Titanic, you know it is going to sink but you still hold out some hope it won't and you try to avoid its definitive demise.I think this is a horror story that has yet to be surpassed in literature. I really felt for the characters, including the monster. I was completely entertained by the skillful writing."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley starts off very uninteresting. In the beginning, a man writes letters to his sister in England but the story soon begins to pick up. Don&#65533;t be discouraged when you read the first page or two. Give it a chance you will learn to love this story.This novel is definitely not the same as the black and white movies you may have seen. Mary Shelley shows a whole new side to the monster in her novel. There are many conflicts and themes in this story. There is love, hate, and the most obvious rage. This is a classic story of a gothic monster gone mad and even though it was written well over 100 years ago it can still scare the pants off of people today.This book touches on the main problem in society, acceptance. There are so many people out there who will change their look, their attitude and their entire lifestyle just to be accepted. This relates to me because I am now in high school and I have observed people who will do anything to be accepted. In my opinion it is ok to want to be accepted but when a person is willing to harm themselves, just to have more friends, that is not ok with me. Mary Shelley shows us the reality of life in this wonderfully touching story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"As with many of the other reviews for this novel, I too was surprised to find that the original character bore little resemblance to the movie representation. This monster was not actually called Frankenstein, it was not slow and lumbering, it was not stupid or incapable of speech. While the literary critics have been historically slow to warm to this novel, it is a work of substantive quality and structure. It also conveys a powerful message about good versus evil, vanity, and personal responsibility. This novel is really, in a lot of ways, more than a horror story, its about how people view themselves and those around them. There is much debate (in literary circles) around whether or not Mary Shelley actually wrote the novel of her own accord or whether she had a good deal of help. I would suggest the paucity of anything else even remotely in the class of Frankenstein would lead one to certain suspicions."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I studied this book, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, in my 12th Grade English Literature class. There are some slow parts, but overall an adventure to read. Victor Frankenstein's family at the beginning, his &quot;nervous fevers&quot;, how he created the monster and became obsessed with his work, his marriage to his cousin, Elizabeth, etc...it's all there, but the reader such as myself has more sympathy for the monster than Frankenstein himself because of the monster's longing for love. It's a good book for students and anyone who enjoys tragedies (it doesn't really seem to be like a horror story though)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I have read \\"Frankenstein\\" several times. Although it has been included in the genre of horror tales it is not so much a horror story,but more a tragedy.It's a story of scientist who creates an artificial being in attempt to understand the secrets of life.However when he gazes upon the hideous countenance of his creation he rejects it automatically thereby avoiding total responsibility for his actions.This of course brings about some negative repercussions for Dr.Frankenstein as his creation seeks revenge for his rejection.Unlike the way that this creature has been portrayed in most of the movies,the creature in this book has some intellect for it had taught itself to read and speak.Which is impressive as this man-made being never went to school or had a tutor to help.Also this character displays a human sense of empathy when it is able to identify with some of the people in the books that it was able to read.Obviously the author Mary Shelley had portrayed this creature in such a way as to gain sympathy for it from the reader.Even after this creature kills the wife of Dr.Frankenstein one still feels more sympathy for his creation rather than Frankenstein himself.The creator it seems is not so god-like in this novel for after he creates the hideous looking creature he abandons it and any responsibility for it.One wonders seriously if this man ever thought about the consequences of his actions or whether he just did it to prove himself god-like? If so maybe his ego was more in control than his intellect. That's probably why when he saw ugly the creature was he turned away from it rather than face the fact that he had botched up his creation's appearance.If he was truely dedicated to his work than he would have or should have attempted some plastic surgery to remedy the hideous appearance of his man-made being.Because of it's hideous appearance the creature recieves a less than positive response from the few humans it encountered,which is why this creature became so bitter and misanthropic.This more than anything makes this tale a tragedy than a horror story.Rather than terrify the reader,this story appeals more to one's sense of sympathy instead,especially for the unfortunate creature who through no fault of it's own is brought into this harsh world to experience the fear and animosity of it's creator and the people that it had encountered.Although written in the early part of the ninteenth century this particular story is still of current importance to our times as well,especially when we are on the brink of genetic tampering and artificial intelligence.There are some among us who believe it possible to create machines that can think and maybe even feel like us.Which does raise some disturbing questions of whether we should really want robots or machines to think and feel like we do.After seeing the movie \\"Bladerunner\\" I seriously doubt that a race of man-made beings like the replicants should be a welcome idea or that it could be of any benefit to us when we come in conflict with such creatures.If anything this novel by Mary Shelley serves as a timeless reminder of what might be the result of creating something in our image."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley had no idea when she wrote this that centuries later it would be enjoyed, or that the idea presented in the book would actually be an issue. She presents the issue of \\"playing\\" God or creating life. This is the very issue that we are dealing with now as far as cloning goes. What are the consequences of creating a creature? According to Shelley we may be overwhelmed with what we have done, and be unable to control the outcome. Frankenstein is a book that everyone should read and think about long and hard. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction... A great read, don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If a reader was to compare the macabre gothic darkness in the novels of Frankenstein, Dracula and The Phantom of the Opera, one would believe that the element of horror and depravity in each book would be on an equal standing. But the reader would be incorrect, for in respects to horror, somberness, trauma, deprivation of love, empathy and respect, Frankenstein towers above the others. It has a hybrid of excessive melancholy despair and disturbing horror. It is a work of literature where the gothic element is pushed to the zenith. Where Dracula is a novel of lust and physical intimacy, at its core, it is still a novel of love-however warped and disturbing it may be. Where the Phantom in Gaston Leroux's novel is a more well-rounded representative of human needs, Frankenstein really isn't. If anything he is a full throttled representation of anger and rage. And that is only one side of human dynamics. His is a living organism, created and plunked into the epicenter of humanity, a walking, thinking experiment that goes terribly awry. Frankenstein is not a creature of God-and perhaps therein is where the problem lies-but a concoction of man's arrogance and man's wickedness for unrepentant self-glorification. One could easily say that he is the genuine embodiment of the true son of Satan, albeit a human one. And that is truely appalling. He is the son of evil who is able to see and feel the horror of his own birth. How ironic! His abomination is both internal and external. Frankenstein obviously addresses numerous contemporary issues: the medical ethics of cloning, the wanton lack of family responsibility and the dangers that arise as a result of it, and lastly-the sometimes subtle, sometimes not-emotional evolution of humans into self-proclaimed gurus or demigods. Is there really a stark difference between Dr. Frankenstein and say, the megalomaniac Reverend Jim Jones of the People's Temple or Marshall Applewhite of Heaven's Gate? Dr. Frankenstein untimately comes to his senses when it is too late, but his desire for historical immortality via creative and scientific recklessness is no different then the hunger of contemporary, psychotic cultist gurus or tyrannical dictators-evil doers who are willing to go at any extreme in order to be remembered. Religion often plays a part in gothic works. The idea of a higher authority isn't always blatantly addressed, but its essence is surely felt. Dracula was at one point a human being who casts God to the side, makes his own decision and evolves into a horror of his own making. The phantom was a deformed being who, because of his skeletal appearance, was cast into the scummy bowls of Paris. But there was something that both of these characters had-and without sounding like a preacher-simply, they had God, a force whom they could turn to for strength and persistence. And what did Frankenstein have? A god, a father, a force who turned his back on him. Frankenstein is an especially sad novel, because the monster is truly alone in every sense of the word. He is a genetic calamity whereby only suicide could be his salvation. Mary Shelly incorporated many possibilities in this novel for the creature to find happiness, numerous inroads for human acceptance; a case-in point would be the various scenes with the creature's 'beloved' cottagers, but just when you think you have the progress of the story 'licked,' you are deceived and led down another road entirely: from hopelessness, to hope, to hopelessness, back to hope. Elegantly written and truly thought-provoking, Frankenstein is a novel that can't be limited in the things it has to say. A true classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A story does not become as well-known and a part of the culture as this book has become without tapping in to some serious veins of the social subconscious. It is a fascinating idea, with a balance that allows for many hours of debate as to the relative merits of the monster and his creator, as well as the relative merits of the options facing Dr. Frankenstein, and whether the option he ultimately chose was the most ethical one or not. Still, much of the writing style itself is rather weak; there are places where it really shows that Shelley was only nineteen when she wrote it. Particularly given that the story is essentially told in the first person from the perspective of Dr. Frankenstein, in his voice, the fact that Shelley's dialogue is stilted and awkward is a real drawback. I realize that by the standards of 19th century fiction, the dialogue is not as poorly written as it would seem in a modern book, (dialogue was in general not a strong point in 19th century fiction) but even by those standards, the dialogue here is weak. Still, the concept is too good to rate less than four stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"According to Hollywood, Frankenstein is a mean, gory character who kills randomly out of pleasure. Although this may be exciting, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is by no means anything like this. Instead, Mary Shelly's novel depicts a more human and compassionate side of the Being. I loved this book so much. It introduced so many new ideas that make you think, such as the idea on how far you can actually take science and technology without interfering with life and death. I liked how she described the being as a human instead of a monster, but also left out some description so you can picture him in your own way. My favorite scene in the book is the turning point, when the Being is rejected by his neighbors. This shows why he started to kill and have no feelings for human nature. Mary Shelly's style of writing is interesting. Although it's a bit slow at times, the novel was for the most part, exciting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Romantic writing and also has a great imagination."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"First time I read the book.

The ambition of man can cloud judgement. The best intentions are often their doom."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If you have never read the original Frankenstein, pick this up and read it! It is not the story that Hollywood has perpetuated, and like all written versions of movies, it is way better!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If your a horror fan you know the story, this is one of the originals. it's timeless and always a great read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Most movies are true to the basic storyline: A young scientiest, Victor, commits scientific hubris by creating a monster that would eventually murder all his loved ones. If you like horror, this wouldn't be so bad a premise, although the true message of the book seems to be more \\"take responsibility for your actions\\" rather than \\"ambition is evil\\", which Victor practically says in the end.The biggest problems I had about the book are the characters. It was almost ridiculous how one of them could have stopped what was happening or at the very least their own deaths - Henry might have come earlier, Justine needn't have given the necklace straight away to the authorities (if she'd lived there her whole life, shouldn't she have known how unfair they would be?), Elizabeth or Frankenstein's father would have noticed the string of unfortunate events and would have concluded that something very, very wrong was going on and ordered extra protection. Besides that, Victor tended to view them through rose-coloured glasses (understandably, I suppose), making them almost perfect in his eyes.How he introduced external pieces of information was a little hard to swallow, too. For example, Elizabeth's letter about Justine. The amount of story fixed to characters who don't really matter - such as Felix's family - is very trying. Maybe the author went on about them in length because she wanted to show how the monster could somehow talk like a Shakespearan actor; but no matter the way you look at it, it is a little ridiculous he managed to talk that way with just about a year's study, unless you accept the movie-verse information that it was more of the monster remembering than learning.Other than that, it was kind of interesting, though it would've been better if the characters were given more personality so the audience could care about them, too. It's worth reading, definitely; a tale of very serious consequences of an act not all too thought out."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If you love early 19th cetnury literature you will love this novel. Yes it deals with the creation of life but at its heart it is a story about love, lonliness and the struggles created by man's unchecked ego.For those reading this based on their love of the 1930's movie, know that they are not the same story. Hollywood took great liberties with the story in order to create their great movie. For modern readers this classic in no way resembles a Horror story; if you are reading it to be scared you will be dissapointed but on the other hand if you are reading this to expand your mind and experience true genius then you will be greatly rewarded.Concerning this e-book edition: it is just the novel and as far as i could tell it read true and it was also problem free."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"There are several good reasons for reading FRANKENSTEIN, by Mary Shelley.First, it's an excellent example of literature of the English Romantic period. It has the Gothic element as exemplified by its eerie monster; the detailed appreciation of nature with its descriptions of lakes, mountains, forests, and ice floes; and the idealization of the common man in its central characterization of the humble DeLaceys, who are at first so much admired by the monster.Second, it is the first example of science fiction in English literature, as science is used to create human life in the laboratory. Some may argue that the third voyage of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is also science fiction with its flying island, thus making FRANKENSTEIN the first complete novel in this genre.Third, the plot of the novel is an intricate frame story that contains not one, not two, but three narratives. The outside frame consists of the epistolary technique--a series of letters exchanged between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret. Walton is exploring the North Pole region on his ship when he sights first a giant who is fleeing across the ice and then shortly afterward Victor Frankenstein in a physically diminished state. Walton rescues Frankenstein, who was pursuing the nameless, eight-foot tall creature. Frankenstein then proceeds to tell his life story in an extended flashback.A brilliant student, Frankenstein's reach exceeds his grasp when he makes the decision to play God. Using recycled body parts of humans and animals and his knowledge of chemistry, he creates a monster with yellow eyes and yellow, almost transparent skin, so hideous looking that Frankenstein abandons his creation as soon as the thing opens its watery eyes. The monster disappears, and Frankenstein himself is ill for a period of time. Eventually he learns of the death of his young brother, supposedly killed by his caretaker, who is subsequently tried and executed. Frankenstein suspects otherwise and eventually confronts his ghastly creation, who confesses.This confession, which is the third narrative, will wring the heart of the reader, and this account is the finest part of Shelley's novel. The monster has frightening encounters with humans and so eventually hides near the cottage of the DeLacey family. He watches them, falls in love with their humble lifestyle, and does farm chores for them at night in secret. By listening to them, he learns to speak and by borrowing their books, again at night, he learns to read. Thus he becomes the educated creature confessing to Victor Frankenstein. Finally, the monster gets up the courage to reveal himself, first to the blind DeLacey grandfather, but when he is discovered by the adult children, all hell literally breaks loose.I cannot emphasize enough how poignant and heart-breaking this section of the novel is. After his rejection by the DeLaceys, the monster burns down their cottage and eventually murders his creator's brother. Now he asks Victor Frankenstein to have mercy on him--by creating a mate for him! It will be a new Eve for the new Adam, and Frankenstein reluctantly agrees. However, when the time comes to do the deed, he cannot bring himself to bring another monster into the world.What follows is a continuation of Victor's story and then Walton's--it is a tale of madness, mayhem, and murder that eventually ends in self-destruction on the ice floes of the North Pole."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I am not a big fan of horror books and movies, so I was a little reluctant to starting on this book.

Frankenstein's Monster was hated by his creator and could not find a friend because he looked so hideous. This is a powerful, tragic statement.(...)Shelly's writing is very well composed and full of extraordinary intuitions about what it means to be created, and hated."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Think about how technology and humanity often clash with one another. For 18 years, an unidentified mail bomber kills several and wounds many, his career culminating in an anti-technological jerimiad blackmailed into mass media publication by both The New York Times and the Washington Post. Doctors in Scotland succeed in cloning a sheep, and knowingly set off both heartfelt protest and academic wrangling. The decoding of the human genome sparks scientific firestorms--as scientists debate the possibilities for both help and harm to come when new techniques of curing disease and prolonging life spring into being. The proliferation of nuclear weapons heralds a chaotic possible future that political scientists still cannot completely fathom, even as the looming shadow continues to pursue us all.Mary Wolstonecraft Shelley, author of &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; seemingly foresaw what lurks within all these examples. As the wife of Percy Blythe Shelley--famous even today as perhaps the greatest poet of the Romantic Era--Mary Shelley shared with her husband the concerns of many of the most humanized intellectuals on the planet. Technology in 1821 was a relatively new social force. Industrializing rapidly, the England with which Shelley was familiar had already bent beneath the weight of changes wrought by the beginning of the age of machines only decades before. Old ways obliterated themselves. New, and unfamiliar metaphors to the human condition quickly replaced them.Considered by some as the first science fiction novel ever written, &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; as a novel, could be and might best be considered something of oracular proportions. Sweeping in its scope, wise in its prophetic and albeit poetic assessments of what technology really means to the survival of the human spirit, the novel rises up from the predominant notions of both medicine and the ultimate purpose of technology--in that the prolongation of life and the defeat of death are the ultimate endpoints of both. Moreover, the prospects of creating life from death--and we all know the familiar scenes from the movie in which the crazed Dr. Frankenstein robs graves in the pouring rain--provide an ironic counterpoint to the major thrust of the novel's theme.Even more ironic is that no one will ever know how Shelley might have felt to have learned that her grave warning to the human race would be hacked and cut to pieces to serve as a form of entertainment that was undreamed of in her age. What would she have thought of Boris Karloff's chilling portrayal as a blunt-headed beast of her protagonist's creation? Could she have ever dreamed that the very message beneath her life's work would be mangled and disembowled of any and all meaning? While many today celebrate the fact that Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is the archetype of the modern horror story--the birth of a monster that takes more contemporary form in movies such as &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;--few consider the powerful metaphors within the novel itself.Unlike the movie, Mary Shelley's version begin with a harrowing encounter in the Artic--the ice cold and unhospitable axis of the world, the place by which the world turns and turns ruthlessly with no consideration for the fragility of human life--and continues with almost karmic dimensions as Dr. Viktor Frankenstein, fully and suddenly understanding the scientific terror and technological golem he has obsessively unleashed, devotes the grim remainder of his life to the destruction of what he has created. It's an old tale, too, a little like Dante entering a wood and visiting Hell, the tale of Dr. Frankenstein is synonymous with the advent of middle age: We spend our youths dreaming of our creation, and yet we spend our later years often searching for ways to destroy that for which we once dreamed.&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is one of richest novels ever written. A favorite of generations, it regales in a style that is itself a vivid example of how technology and its unforseen imperitive--that we constantly hurry and curry the lowest common denominator--have turned both the novel and the English language into a strange changeling that is a pallid, shadowy reflection of an age of philosophic and spiritual grandeur that unavoidably midwived the modern age. Regardless of its richness, however, Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; won't alienate a reader who gives herself to the oceanic flow of her voice. Told simply and with a passion unsurprisingly absent from contemporary prose, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a novel whose time has yet to come."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I've never really seen the movie version of this literary classic, let alone thought about reading the book. I picked up what I thought was the story of Frankenstein by osmosis. It is now obvious that what I learned didn't come from the book, as the story is totally different from the movie versions. Mary Shelley has written an interesting tale that attacks not only technology, but the misguided belief that man can control such technology.The story has three narrators, so readers get different viewpoints on the story. The first narrator comes across Victor Frankenstein in the arctic as he is tracking down his beastly creation. This narrator is Walton, the captain of a ship and a man on his own dangerous mission. We then get to hear Victor Frankenstein's story. This section details Victor and his education, where he is enraptured by alchemy and natural science. During the course of his studies he figures out how to animate objects, and creates a man that is to become his nightmare and his undoing. The last section is narrated by the creature that Victor has created, and the Creature's attempts to become part of society and learn to educate himself is one of the more interesting parts of the book. The creature is spurned, of course, and decides to take his wrath out on humanity in general, and Victor in particular. It isn't hard to see the theme of the story, which is that man shouldn't attempt to play God. If man is imperfect, the creatures he could create would be even more imperfect. I think the book has a nice message to events today, in that those who advance technology almost never suffer themselves. It is the rest of us that have to adjust our lives to accomodate the Bill Gates' of the world. Bill Gates and a few thousand other people really benefit. In Frankenstein, others do indeed suffer, but so does Victor. No one benefits from this beastly creation. Even the beast suffers in the extreme.This book is indeed well written, although as with most 19th century literature, the prose takes some getting used to. It sure beats the garbage being passed off as literature today. The Penguin version, which is the one I read, is pretty good. It includes appendices that contain extra text, as well as some short horror stories written by Shelley's friends Lord Byron and Polidari. The introduction is pretty good as well, and points out some connections that the book has to other works that were circulating at the same time. Do yourself a favor and read a book like this. you'll increase your I.Q. and feel better about yourself in the process!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"What can you say about Frankenstein? Mary Shelley was truly an inspiring author, she is probably one of the greatest authors of our time. The way she described the monster, Frankenstein, and many other characters in the book. If you have not read this book yet, you should be deeply ashamed, it taught me so many things about life and how precious it is. Frankenstein is about a young man who creates a monster, the monster is very lonely and as a result begins to kill Dr. Frankensteins family and friends. Loneliness can be a small thing to some people, or can be a big thing. This is why we need to take part in the world today and comfort the lonely, sad, or self-distrout. If we don't, there is no telling what may happen. I strongly encourage every person to read this book, it will keep your interest going and I guarantee you won't be able to put the book down."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was forced to read Frankenstein in gr. 11 english class. I thought it would be one of those books that have no point or moral, just as most of the books we read in english. But I was wrong the novel was one of the best I ever read. It deals with the theme of Innocence to Experience from the start to the end. And what the effects are of using power and not thinking of the consequences, making it an anywhere anytime type of novel. Marry Shelly uses the frame device through 99% of the book (it's when the whole book is being told by one of the characters, often used to make the story more believable) The book will keep you wanting to read more and more. I recommend it to everyone, the language used by Marry Shelly is pretty easy and straight forward. ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"To those of you who don't want to read Frankenstein because it seems scary - it's not. In fact, it is book with a profound theme. It's a book with romance, some suspense, many twists, and a some sad scenes on top of it all. After reading this book, the reader either sympathizes with Victor or the monster. I thought Victor wasn't an extremely complex character who just has to deal with the wrong choices he's made. This book wasn't extremely dry, only superfluous in some parts. I admit, I just read it for my 8th grade English class, but it was one of the better classics I've read for school."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A great story about Frankenstein!I found it very interesting and easy to understand. It kept my interest and I felt compassion for Frankenstein. He did not asked to be created by Victor, but Victor wanted to come up with a new creation to man-kind. Then after Victor created this monster, he finally realized that it was a very bad mistake. &quot;That is what got me hooked&quot; Frankenstein was not known or understood by the villagers and the mean things they did to him was only because of the way he looked. This books makes you think about several things; one being don't creat something without putting a lot of thought into it, becuase it could seriously back fire on you and the pain you can bring to others as well as your self. And last don't judge someone by the way they look, because even Frankenstein had a heart that felt pain, anger, humility and sadness. Thank you.

What surprised me the most was that there was no assistant, no Igor. Also that Frankenstein hated what he had created. The book had many pages of remorse and it is very gloomy and sad. So much death and sadness created by giving life to something that should not be alive. I think Mary Shelley is trying to warn us that God is the only One who can create life. When we try, bad things happen.

We take several chapters before we even meet Victor Frankenstein, and there is a lot of backstory told that isn't really needed. However, between the unnecessary exposition, there are many exciting and profound, and even emotional moments. Shelly went much further into character development than what I was expecting from what little I knew about the story - I knew the monster is misunderstood, but was not expecting the depth that is offered.The roots of modern sci-fi are found in books like this, and this should be considered a sci-fi classic. I also noticed hints of language and style that reminded me a lot of H.P. Lovecraft, particularly the descriptions of madness and angst, and themes of delving too far. Could it be that Lovecraft was heavily inspired by this novel? Possibly.A great book that should be part of anyone's repertoire if you wish to be functionally knowledgeable about literature and science-fiction."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I liked this book, there was an interesting storyline, lots of action etc. But nothing extremely WOW about it.

Everything revolves only and always around him. Despite being allegedly brilliant, he has the critical thinking skills of a newt.This book is, in a way, a good example of the evils of racism, but I doubt that Shelly or most of her readers understood it that way. Basically, Frankenstein's monster was deemed wicked and depraved merely because he was deformed and ugly, not because of any inherent character flaws. In fact, during the book, we learn that he was amazingly intelligent and sensitive. He went off the rails, so to speak, only after constantly enduring deprivation and scorn inflicted upon him merely because of how he looked. Yeah, if you throw enough brickbats at a person, eventually they might retaliate. Big surprise. So, in Shelly's distorted world view, one's throwing the brickbats at creatures whose only sin is ugliness, isn't depraved, but if the receiver of the undeserved brickbats retaliates in any way, then that retaliation confirms depravity? Clearly, Shelly had a very undeveloped mind.Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this book. It really and truly is atrocious. In addition to a story that makes no rational sense, the book is backed with tedious page after tedious page of the typically horrid 19th century gratuitous glorification of nature and of excessive maudlin brooding on one's emotional state. If you want to read a classic \\"monster\\" book, do yourself a favor and read Bram Stoker's Dracula, which is indeed a good book.

When asked about it, long after I stopped carrying about the novel with too many complexities for even a bright 14 year old to understand, I would simply say \\"I know that Mary Shelley is [radical feminist] Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter, but you would never know it from Frankenstein.\\"I reread the novel for my Goth Lit class freshman year of college when I was better able to understand the intricacies of the text. For the first time, I did see saw Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter. Numerous reviewers before me have expounded upon the \\"Man trying to usurp God with Reckless Science\\" themes of the novel, concentrating on the Reckless Science (so like what we see paralleled today) while ignoring the phallo-centric characteristics of the science that Victor Frankenstein practices.The man's science relentlessly pursues and forcibly unveils a decidedly feminine and reluctant Nature, and manages to bypass the feminine entirely with the creation of monster that came simply from the work of a man. Frankenstein houses a genuine fear of female sexuality (just looks at the dream he has following his monster's creation, in which his beloved, while in his embrace, becomes the corpse of his dead mother).I know my argument might seem shoddy here, but Hindle (the editor) puts together a wonderful introduction that, among other things, connects Frankenstein's science to his maleness.The are many editions of Frankenstein.

I am reading it for a Literature Course in School."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"came next day in perfect condition my sister needed it for school and she was very pleased thank you"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Maybe the most surprising thing about reading Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* is in discovering just how different--and how much more complex--the original is than the story as it has passed into popular culture. Here is one of the great myths of modern man and the Age of Science and Reason; it's a myth that in some respects is even more relevant today with the prospect of widespread genetic engineering. The dream of unlocking the secret of life--and the parallel fear that it might turn into a nightmare remains with us long after Shelley gave it form in this short novel.On the downside, Shelley's prose bears all the faults of the age in which it was composed. *Frankenstein* is almost unbearably overwritten, its characters melodramatically overwrought, and the whole production bathed in the over-the-top hysteria that often typifies Romantic literature. It's comical to hear long eloquent orations delivered by characters in the middle of scenes in which they're literally fighting for their lives--and, indeed, even more ridiculous to hear the monster himself speaking like a Shakespearean actor. To be sure, Shelley's monster is a great deal different than the green-skinned blockhead of the movies, no bolts in his neck, jagged forehead scar, or monosyllabic groans here. This is a pensive, autodidactic monster. Still, the way Shelley envisions him, he's actually far more horrific than Boris Karloff or Herman Munster. Here we have a stitched together assemblage of corpse-parts that the flesh doesn't always entirely cover, leaving the workings of tendons and the like grotesquely exposed to view. He's a wild, ragged, hideous-looking zombie, but not a shambling, sleepwalking, unfeeling drone; instead, he's super-strong, super-agile, super-fast--and he's as eloquent as Cicero.Certainly, Shelley felt it necessary to give the monster a brain and the silver-tongue to express its complex cogitations because *Frankenstein* is, in the end, more a philosophical novel than a tale of horror. What does it mean to be human? Do we overstep our bounds by encroaching on the miracles of life and try to play \\"god\\"? Is there a god? Do we not feel pity for the \\"monster,\\" which, by its appearance alone, seems to be the embodiment of all we loathe and fear...and yet, in fact, only wants for compassion and companionship to make it \\"human\\"? These are the kinds of questions that Shelley asks in *Frankenstein* and to do so she allows her monster to defend himself in the court of ideas like F. Lee Bailey.For that matter, it's somewhat hard to wrap one's mind around the fact that Shelley's Victor Frankenstein begins his work at reanimating corpses while still at college and--instead of the more appropriate middle-aged scientist familiar from innumerable remakes--Dr. Frankenstein in this novel is no older than his mid-20s throughout. Apparently, Shelley herself wasn't yet twenty when originally composing the tale, so that perhaps explains Frankenstein's age here, but it doesn't seem quite right to have him be so young.Still, if you can get past the various absurdities, the purple prose, the frequent repetition, and the more tedious travelogue descriptions of the countrysides of Switzerland, Scotland, the frozen north, etc. there are some genuinely frightening scenes and, more importantly, still-compelling ideas that make Shelley's *Frankenstein* not only the original, but the best elucidation of the myth of the mad man of science and the responsibility of the creator towards ((and for)) that which he creates. If for only the sheer importance and enduring influence of this work in literature and popular culture, Shelley's *Frankenstein* is worth reading, and giving four stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein conjures us lurid images of Boris Karloff in the best Hollywood version of the tale, However, the classic novel by Mary Shelley(1797-1851) is better than any movie version! She composed it while on holiday near Lake Geneva. She, her Romantic poet husband Percy Bysshe and their friend Lord George Byron challenged one another to compose a horror story. Mary's dream of 1818 became the novel we now know as Frankenstein.it tells the story of scientific genius Victor Frankenstein and the unnamed man he creates using galvanism and electricity in a horrible corpse. The creature becomes a murderer escaping from Victor. The creature murders Victor's wife, best friend, brother. Victor begins a quest to destroy his own creation but die in mortal combat with the horror in the icy wastes of the barren North Pole.Victor had earlier refused his creatioin's desire for the scientist to conjure up a Mrs. Frankenstein. Victor worried that the two monsters would create a race of horrible creatures who would wage war on humanity.The beginning and ending of the novel are written in an epistolary correspondence carried on by sea captain Walton and his sister back home in England. They narrate the strange and sad tale. Though almost 200 years old the prose is quite readable. The Penguin edition footnotes add insight to the novel.Mary's subtitle was \\"The Modern Prometheus.\\" Prometheus was the Greek god who stole fire from the gods giving it to mankind. As a punishment the gods imprisoned him to a rock. Prometheus (Frankenstein) may represent modern industrial society, rebellion or chaotic forces unleashed my humanity. One thinks of the Frankenstein-like atomic bomb era precipitating the Cold.Mary Shelley was well read and drew upon her expertise in gothic horror, ghost story and adventure tales to complete her little gem of a classic. Her book is well written, thought provoking and deeply disturbing. It is a parable of the modern age of angst, fear and chaos we all inhabit each day on our conflicted globe."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Shelley's Frankenstein is a really touching story, well-told. You must let go of your memories of the movie to appreciate it. It reveals the suffering of an outsider in the 2nd part where the Creature is observing a loving family and longing to be part of some family, contrasting it with being abandoned by his only parent, Dr. Frankenstein. Also introduces the idea of humans overstepping the lines of nature by creating life and the doubts end guilt associated with genetic engineering.This paperback, is difficult to read because of the closeness of the margins and the binding.

You may think, \\"Oh, it's just a story, it won't scare me.\\" Yeah, you think that now, but wait until you read it. This story is so freaky, it even scared me....and it takes a lot to freak me out. Everything about it-the creation of the demon, the creature's killing spree, everything-was just plain creepy. It was a good book, yes-but it was also just plain odd. So when you're reaching for a book before taking a little nap, I wouldn't recommend reaching for Frankenstein-unless, of course, you like being challenged and having a lot on your mind before bed."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The monster is the most interesting, well-developed character in the whole book. The monster doesn't even join the plot for several chapters but still, he is the center to all the themes of the book and the plot. The novel is pretty much only about the monster, and to a lesser degree, Frankenstein.The creature and Frankenstein each do terrible things, but I find the creature to be more forgivable and more worthy of compassion. Frankenstein brought his problems upon himself, whereas the monster's problems were thrust upon him. He tried so hard. In the face of rejection and utter loneliness, the monster kept trying and trying to make friends. For being the way his creator made him, his creator abandons him; for chopping much- needed firewood for an impoverished family he is screamed at and abandoned; for saving a girl from drowning he is shot. Just when he feels he can't take any more humiliation and feels he will punish society, he gives it another try. Eventually, he snaps. He makes a transistion from an angelic creature to a monster.The monster is \\"eight feet tall and proportionally large.\\" He can survive in harshly cold climates and subsist on coarse food. Even though Victor is well aware of the physical toughness and superiority of the monster, he decides to hunt this creature down. In the epic showdown between the monster and Victor, the monster wins hands down. In this sense, Victor's first name is ironic. In the ending, the monster finally achieves what he sets out to do. His original goal of peace was shattered but he managed to achieve the alternative goal of asserting himself with revenge and tormenting Victor to his death. He didn't kill Victor; he let him kill himself hunting him. It's not exactly a victory for the monster, but he maintained and decided to exercise what personal power he could. He succeeded in not \\"taking it\\" and standing up for himself. Throughout the novel, although he changes drastically in demeanor, he remains dynamic. From his creation he set out to explore his world and learn to read. Then he worked on the plan to become a part of the family in the woods. After his goals of peace and love had definitely, hopelessly failed, he redirects his drive in a new direction. He's always working on something; he always has a plan. His determination and perseverence have been corrupted, not defeated. It is this unstoppable drive that characterizes the monster as dynamic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein contains themes relating to Sigmund Freud's theory of psychoanalysis. Freud placed a high value on interpreting dreams for psychological insight. Right after Victor brought his creation to life and realized he made an abomination, the scientist raced to his bedroom and finally fell into a troubled sleep, but awakened \\"disturbed by the wildest dreams.\\" He dreamt that he saw his fiance Elizabeth and as he kissed her he beheld the corpse of his mother in his arms. He delayed his marriage to Elizabeth to create the monster, and passively allowed the monster to kill her on their wedding night. Victor's troubles began in college when his mother died and he rebelled against his father by reading books that he forbade Victor to read. Psychoanalysis might determine of Victor that he inwardly struggles with the \\"Oedipus Conflict\\" in which, as Freud established, children develop their first sexual desire for their parent of the opposite sex and therefore have hostility towards the other parent.Freud also contended that anxiety arises from \\"libido\\", or repressed sexual and aggessive desires. Indeed, Victor's anxiety of the monster on his wedding night is parallel with his anticipation of marriage to Elizabeth. As stated earlier, Victor even postponed his marriage to create the monster which would later kill his bride on their untried marriage bed. Freud said that each person has an aspect of themself, which he called the \\"Id\\", that contains antisocial desires which we repress and as libidinal forces, constantly seek expression in distorted, concealed ways. Freudians might say that the monster symbolizes the Id of Frankenstein, that hidden aspect of himself which violently desires to destroy all that he loves. The monster's ugliness fits well with representing this ugly aspect of Victor. The monster and Frankenstein are bound together as one. When Victor finally dies, the monster, too dies. The two hated each other passionately and each made it his life to end the life of the other. Freud said that \\"forgetting\\" is often motivated by a subconscious desire to repress some painful memory; but all that we repress seeks expression in all sorts of symptoms. After Victor abandoned the monster, he acted in such oblivion to his creation. But, like painful memories repressed, the monster would reappear very ugly in Victor's life and ardently express his fury. Victor tried to repress and control the monster only to find the monster controls him. Similar themes arise in \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\""},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Among the many themes of Frankenstein, one of them is that of friendship, ambition, and the conflict between the two. The message is that the deeper need of the two is friendship, but that we are susceptible to the temptations of ambition, which can destroy friendship.Ostensibly, Victor Frankenstein had an unselfish mission to \\"benefit all mankind\\" with his scientific project. His \\"selfless\\" ambition failed him and proved to aim at self-glory because he wanted to create a race that would bless him as its father. In Captain Walton's second letter to his sister, we learn that although he has a well-trained crew, he has no soul companion; this need he regards as a \\"most severe evil.\\" Walton's exploration of the secluded and frozen Arctic serves as a metaphor for how his ambition has removed him from society. His ambition even threatened his own and his crew members' lives when ice surrounded and trapped his boat. Likewise, this is where Victor's ambition leads him when he's hunting down the monster in futility. The message is that if one sets out ambitiously to benefit mankind, once that person has acheived their goal, their prominence sets them apart from the same society they set out to benefit.Victor had a much more intense ambition than Walton, with corespondingly more disasterous results. As Frankenstein prepared for his project, he isolated himself from his friends and family to laboriously study the sciences and he would later postpone his marriage for this project. The embodiment of his ambition, the repulsive monster, would eventually slay several of Victor's loved family members, including his fiance on their wedding night. Even the monster feels as his deepest need a human relationship, which he has none and which is the very thing that turned him from good to evil. While observing an impoverished family, \\"the bitter gall of envy\\" arose in the monster. He considers them rich because they have the companionship of each other even though they are in financial poverty. When Frankenstein rejects the monster's pleas to create for him a mate of the same race, the monster sets out on an unstoppable path to destruction and an ambitious one indeed. The novel links ambition with destruction, particularly destruction of companionship and conveys friendship as a great , if not the greatest, need for man.I don't think the story conveys that all ambition is destructive. At the end of the story, Victor has great regret for the results of his ambition, but he still has pride for his effort. Although he cautions us that we would be better off to believe our \\"native town to be the world,\\" he adds, \\"yet another may succeed.\\" You could interpret this as Victor not \\"learning his lesson;\\" that mankind will continue to give in to harmful passions. Another, much different analysis could be that this story portrays that limited ambition, integrated with society and not aimed at self-glory, can be virtuous. After all, for the teenage author of a classic, enduring novel to tell us that all ambition will destroy us would be hypocrisy."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein was a pretty good book. It was about a guy named Frankenstein who created a monster using dead parrs of dead people. The book was semi-interesting as the story went along. In the beginning, I found the book to be very dry and boring. As the book went more along, I found that it got interesting. There were things in the book that I was not expecting to happen. You always here these stories about Frankenstein that did not happen in the book. As I was reading the book, I was a little shock at what was happening in the story. When the monster was coming to life, I was expecting something more than all of sudden he is alive. I thought the part about when the monster, whose name is not even Frankenstein which was another shock, was watching after the family for all those days. He was only trying to look out after the family and the children. The only part of the book that I disagreed with was how all the humans were treating the monster. He was only trying to find a friend. On the other hand if I saw a monster on the streets, I would probably run the other way. The book definitely brought out the issue of racism. Another issue in the book that was definitely gross was the thought of Frankenstein and Elizabeth falling in love with each other. Also, how she brought these feelings out that he had for his mother. Another part was when Elizabeth was murdered. You could see that coming. Why Frankenstein did not stop the monster from committing this crime blows me away. Overall, the book was not bad. I gave the book a three because it was not the greatest book I ever read but it was an interesting book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is obviously a classic. This book was one that I never thought I would find myself reading but the more I got into it, the more I enjoyed. The classic story of the man who creates his own monster out of anger and aggression, is portrayed somewhat differently than what most think. Unlike the movies, the monster is an intelligent man who knows what he wants, and the man who created him is just as smart. The book follows the main character through his life, past, and present and somewhat into the future. With exciting twists and turns and climatic events, Frankenstein will keep any reader interessted. This book will make you think, use your imagination and have sympathy for the main character. I would reccomend this book to everyone, especially those who are big fans of all the Frankenstein movies."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Overall, I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed reading the novel. I was a little skeptic at first since it was written so long ago, and also because I already had an idea in my head of what the book should be like. Although the book started off slow and some parts tended to be very drawn out, it began to pick up towards the middle and it became much easier to read. I liked how the author allowed us to see from the creature's perspective and were able to sympathize with him. This was my favorite part of novel because it makes you want to find out what happens in the end. The novel can definitely be related to society in the way that people that are not considered the &quot;norm&quot; are treated. I felt the novel was a good learning tool to different ways a book can be interpreted."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein was pretty good. Although, many times i found my mind wandering to other things. It was somewhat slow paced, and at times very boring. I felt Mary Shelly left out some things that perhaps should have been discussed in order for the book to be a little more interesting (ie. how the monster actually came to life). Even though the story was short, and unbelieveable i did however like how she made the monster a product of society- everyone hated and feared him, therefore he hated everyone else. He could have been good, and lived a (somewhat) normal life. The story has a deep meaning to it- it just took M. Shelly a long time to bring it out. I would recommend this book if you like science fiction."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein was pretty good.

At all times Shelley is able to hold the reader in suspens and then jump into vivid details about the accounts of the story and the journey of Victor Frankenstein and his creation. I would not consider this to be a horror story as much as it is a drama story with its fair share of action. Shelley also lets the reader gain a personal attachment to each of the characters in the story by enclosing very detailed descriptions of their physical and personal attributes. As the story progresses the reader can begin to sympathise with the characters which creates a rising interest for the duration of the novel. Because this book has many different scopes that can be examined and critiqued, I would highly recomend this book to readers from 7th grade on up through professional levels of literature.

I read Dracula earlier this year and it wasn't at all what I thought. Frankenstein, similarly, had very little to do with the films. While there are vague connections, the blind man, the murders and executions, the book was significantly different. First of all, this is a Victorian novel. The prose style is refined and sophisticated. Frankenstein is French living in the Swiss Alps. He is also a young college student when he creates the monster. He neither creates a bride for the monster nor does he celebrate his achievement of animating dead tissue. No castle in Bavaria nor lightning nor creepy assistant. Just a romantic young scholar obsessed with the secrets of nature.The book has a comic edge. The monster, rejected by his maker, goes off to live in a village where he hides and simply observes peasants living. He learns to speak by listening to them. He also learns human kindness and dignity. When he reveals himself and is rejected by them, he seeks out his maker and tells his tale. Somehow, he speaks better than Frankenstein. The dialogue Shelly gives the monster would be a stretch for a character purported to have doctoral level studies in the liberal arts. He is so sophisticated that he recognized man's search for meaning and the significance of a mate and asks Frankenstein to create him a mate. To the extend that the monster's dialogue is comical, this book is something of a real, vintage Price and Prejudice and Zombies, though unintentional.I wouldn't give the book away, but the story begins and ends in the Arctic - not the mountains of Eastern Europe. And the scenes take us from Geneva to Ireland to Arctic Russia and beyond. Nicely written, though dated in it's Victorian style, and a fast, fun, creepy Halloween read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"its a good product but if you want an edited version find it somewhere else. it even has a book with it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Loved it!

Why was he so obsessed with the creation? What made him turn on his progeny?And, we also are let right into the mind of the creature, who, abandoned, makes his own way in the world, rejected, scorned, feared. How does he survive? How does he learn? Who does he love? And what does he do to try and influence the good doctor to make this right?It's all here.Mary Shelley was only 18 when she wrote her novel. Her vocabulary and prose are amazing for someone so young.The story begins in an unusual way - a man writing to an unknown loved one describes his journey leading up to a sighting of the \\"monster\\".We're then transported into the life of the young Dr. Frankenstein, writing his long journal entry about his fateful decision to create life from \\"nothing\\". He foreshadows terrible things, of which most of them come true.We meet Dr. Frankenstein's family - those he loved and grew up with. His father, brothers, and beloved adopted cousin, Elizabeth, whom he later vows to marry.They all play their parts in this macabre story. All throughout, we think, \\"Stop it, Dr. Frankenstein.

The style of the writing -- Walton telling his sister the story told to him by Frankenstein -- did little to engage my interest. The separation of the narrative from any action slowed the pace of the story to a crawl, which is why it took me so long to finish. This was very much a chore to read, and Frankenstein struck me as one of the most sniveling, pathetic characters ever written, but I enjoyed the descriptive language, the characterization of Frankenstein's creation, and the last chapter, which did much to redeem the book as a whole."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Great timeless classic.

Its timeless appeal can be shown by the fact that it has been borrowed by more people than probably any other book I own."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I thought that the book was very good.

Thus it has stood the test of time and is taught in schools even today. The story is profound with themes of bravery, adventure, unrealistic human aspirations and fundamental questions about good and evil. The most amazing thing to me, however, regarding the book, is that it was written decades ago by a teenager who was stranded in a house during a freezing winter is Switzerland. The book was actually written on a dare, \\"While we've nothing else to do, let's write a ghost story, the best one wins.\\" (I'm paraphrasing of course). But essentially this is what happened and the result was this profound, spiritual horror story about the aspirations of a man trying to be God with an inevitable but interesting Shakespearean ending of tragedy. There are lessons to be learned from this book. Profound lessons, and how a teenager, especially a female teenager could create such a masterpiece establishes that the human capacity for imagination and teaching in the context of a novel is something that simply can not be denied. It's sad that modern literature seems to lack this soaring imagination, originality of form and inevitable conclusions of right and wrong which beam brightly from this outstanding work of fiction. This book should be required reading for all English speaking people and perhaps for all people across the world. I give it the highest recommendation possible."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is not a scary novel. it is a suspenful one. all ages can read this clasic story by mary shelley."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Excellent book (which I knew) but I really liked the layout on the Kindle, especially for the cost.

It was a slow start to a book which I imagined would be amazing based on its popularity. It took me over a month to get through it because of the less suspenseful moments. I started two other books before finishing this one. However when the book picked up it was a great read. Also confusing at time to who was speaking and the dialect made me review much of what I had already read.This edition was free and I love free books.In reading this book you must remember it is taking place over 200 years ago and the dialect is far superior to most writings of today, so some dictionary searches may be necessary.

Just read it.Hannah McLellan"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The story of FRANKENSTEIN is a tale that never seems to go away or get tiresome because it is a true literary classic that addresses fundamental questions about who we are, what we are capable of and how our choices generate enormous consequences. This beautiful 'INTERVISUAL BOOKS' leather-bound edition of the much-published adventure of the mad scientist who creates a new being out of pieces of dead beings is worth picking up and reading, even if you have a copy already or have read the story before. And if you haven't, you are in for a real treat. Not only is the story wonderfully inspired, the background about how it came to be written by Mary Shelley (wife of the much-loved poet; Percy Bysshe Shelley) is equally compelling. And the writing style of that period (1818) is like a time machine that takes you back to the period where the story is set. The book was first published under the title 'THE MODERN PROMETHEUS'."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***Because the subtitle of Mary Shelley's atmospheric, gothic tale is \\"The Modern Prometheus\\", \\"Frankenstein\\" has traditionally been interpreted as a cautionary tale against seeking forbidden knowledge or \\"Tampering in God's Domain\\". Nonsense. In Greek mythology, the Titan Prometheus defied Zeus's edict against giving mankind fire. Yes, he did suffer Olympian torment by being bound to a rock and suffering an eagle's daily ritual of snacking on his liver. However, Prometheus's defiance DID benefit mankind, and Prometheus's liver grew back each night. Furthermore, during his legendary twelve tasks, Hercules killed the eagle and released Prometheus from his ordeal. Tampering in a god's domain ultimately paid off.Tampering in God's domain has usually benefitted mankind in reality as well. If we didn't, we'd still be living naked in caves and be vulnerable to severe weather changes and predation. Yes, but one might say that Victor's creation or reanimation of life inappropriately encroached on a function exclusively in God's job description. Nonsense again. Humans create life all the time by having sex. So no, Victor's true transgression was not seeking the amelioration of the human condition by creating life. Instead, his true sin was not taking responsibility for the life he created.Seeking knowledge about the world in itself is not wrong. Doing so selfishly and without concern for the consequences definitely IS wrong. To paraphrase Ian Malcolm's observation in the movie \\"Jurassic Park\\", sometimes scientists are so engrossed in finding out whether they can make a discovery, they neglect to consider how to, or whether they should, put it to \\"good use\\". Victor does exactly that. There is no sense in \\"Frankenstein\\" as to what benefit Victor will put his resurrection abilities. There is a sense that Victor wants to create life just so he can say he can. He is heedless. Instead of making a being of normal human proportions and appearance, Victor just rushes ahead to make an unsightly giant just because the bodily parts are easier to manipulate. When he succeeds, Victor flees in disgust and terror from the creature. When he returns to the lab to find the creature gone, Victor rejoices.As a result of his abandonment by his errant \\"father\\", the creature has to stumble through a second life alone through trial and error. His infant-like sensations gradually get clearer and he adapts. At least \\"deadbeat dad\\" Victor gave the creature one advantage (however unlikely) besides physical strength; an apparently brilliant, perceptive brain. The creature doesn't grunt inarticulately for long. As he seeks invisible shelter with the DeLacey family, the creature succeeds in becoming not only literate, but also quite eloquent. Nevertheless, no matter where he goes, or whatever good deeds he performs, humanity shuns the creature for its ugliness. This undeserved isolation inexorably drives the creature to acts of envious spite, deceit, and murder.I believe that despite his descent into malignancy, the creature largely maintains the reader's sympathy because as he himself says, \\"I am malicious because I am miserable\\". We are wont to blame Victor as the ultimate source of the havoc the creature wreaks. And yet, despite his anguish, the creature does not regress into a mindless killing id. He is introspective and remorseful for all the deaths he directly or indirectly causes. If only the creature had encountered Victor before his killing rampage, we feel, his philosophical reasoning would have convinced Victor to rehabilitate his creature and facilitate his entry into society. Alas, the creature also could have, but also fails to take responsibility for his actions and thus compounds his misery. The only thing that redeems the creature in our eyes is that he is at least aware of his failure to take responsibility, and will at least make some amends by presumably immolating himself so he doesn't kill any more. Victor, to the end on his deathbed on Captain Walton's sailing vessel in the Arctic, never does and even feels he has behaved honorably through life!Being irresponsible can make anyone a monster, some (Victor) more than others (the creature)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"There is a reason that the classic books are referred to as classics.

Recently, I realized that I am a bit ashamed that I have yet to read this book for myself since along with Dracula it is considered such a classic horror story. I was so surprised as I started reading this book to find that all of the things I had thought about the story were actually wrong. This book is not so much about horror as it is about the basic human emotion for love and acceptance that we continually search for, and while the movies touch on this theme a bit the book is mostly about this thought. In a sense it is not so much horrifying as it is sad and disturbing, but the brilliance of the story is that it really makes you step back and look at yourself and what it means to be human.A Swiss medical student, Victor Frankenstein, discovers the secret of life and decides to build a man from various corpuses. He becomes horrified by what he creates and runs away from what he considers a monster. The creature suffers from a fair amount of confusion and neglect and begins to see himself as a terrifying monster. He is incredible smart and is able to teach himself language and means of communication through watching a poor family. He discovers the truth about his identity and begins to seek revenge on his creator. Through a series of tragic events Victor Frankenstein chases his creation around the world meaning to rid humanity from it.It is easy to see why this book has stood the test of time.

How did I reach the age of 43 without realising \\"Frankenstein\\" is so much more than a one-dimensional horror story about a blockheaded monster with bolts in his neck? The \\"fiend\\" reads poetry, longs for companionship, admires kindness and gentleness. Is he evil, or just lonely and misunderstood? Either way, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN is as relevant today as it was during its initial publication in 1818. The story, butchered by Hollywood renditions, chronicles a young doctor Frankenstein who discovers how to reanimate life. He attempts to create the perfect being: tall, athletic, and free from disease. Instead, when the being comes to life, the result is hideous and grotesque. The doctor flees his lab and his creation only to find his life haunted by his rejected creation. Modern retellings of this story hold that the monster (who is often inappropriately called \\"Frankenstein\\",) is a lumbering idiot who is afraid of fire. These versions focus on the horror of the monster. The 1818 version of Frankenstein's creation is a smart, nimble creature who has become a wretch after finding rejection at every corner of the world.Shelley's original narrative focuses on the horror of being rejected or cast out of the world. The book often references and evokes Milton's PARADISE LOST, and for good reason. There are similar themes at work here -- similar ideas about creation, rejection, and the yearning to find meaning in our lives.The Kindle edition is a pretty good public domain copy. The formatting is great. There's two introductions: one from Wendy Steiner, and another from the author herself. There are a few instances in which letters and characters did not translate correctly to the electronic edition (some ol's that format as d's, etc). Other than a few instances of this, this version is very readable and contains few errors.I'd recommend this book to anyone who has even a cursory interest in FRANKENSTEIN -- the tale told here is infinitely more interesting and fascinating than the monsters of Hollywood. Because FRANKENSTEIN is available through the public domain, Amazon is offering this eBook for free. It's easier to access this great book now than it ever has been before. What are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Amazed after finally reading this story how little the movies take from it. The Amazon reviews are spot on, I got used to the characters rambling across the lands and figured that Shelley was just trying to beef up her word count with a few entries from her travel blog. And it's true there are no details going from Frankenstein the student to Frankenstein the mad scientist to - oh look, he created a monster. You have to pull it out from between the lines of about half a page. It was why I finally read the book, I wanted to see how she brought the monster to life, but, there's nothing. Frankenstein just goes collecting bits and pieces and presto-chango, a freak is born. But, the good news is, this monster's got a lot more going on than the movie versions. He seems much more hideous looking, which I think is cool. He has Spiderman abilities to move thousands of miles and track Victor on all his many ramblings. This monster is a thoughtful, conflicted man with a plan. He just needs a good woman to set him straight."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Well...it's the complete story with a background story on the author but I honest think it's not worth the money.

I used to get up early just to go get the paper and see which movie was showing that Saturday. It was usually either a Godzilla movie or a Bela Lugosi-era monster movie. So my first experience with Frankenstein was the 1931 film version and Herman Munster. Needless to say, the original version was quite a bit different. Frankenstein was the creator, not the monster (although he more often goes by Victor). No stunted, criminal brain is involved. In fact, he is highly intelligent. I will leave it to the reader to decide for herself whether he is innately malevolent or a blank slate shaped by his early experiences, but I depart from many in thinking the former.Shelley's prose is often very powerful. There are shades of Dostoevsky in Crime and Punishment. Shelley makes extensive use of symbolism--breaking ice, the escape from science into nature, Frankenstein's relation with his monster analogized to God's relationship with man. It doesn't have much of the suspense modern horror so heavily relies upon. It's the kind of book that should make you think long and hard, and much of what you should think long and hard about is not entirely pleasant.Shelley does sometimes writes in convoluted sentences: \\"She was tranquil, yet her tranquility [sic] was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.\\" But that's par for the course with Victorian writing.I read the Kindle version of Frankenstein offered free through Amazon.

Robert Walton himself learned how destructive the desire for knowledge can be after seeing what it had done to Victor first hand.This literary work of art, however, also portrays some aspects of human nature, the want to be accepted into society. The monster wasn't really bad, nor was he good. He was simply a human being with a unique appearance that needed affection, love, and acceptance. His unique appearance, however, scared away everyone that he meets, which will eventually enrage him because he feels he is not loved.This book is truly a great book that touches on the subjects of acceptance. To not judge people based on how they look. Everyone needs someone who can love and understand them. Without these things, it will cause someone to rage quit life."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus, first published in 1818, is well-deserved classic of science fiction and horror. Mary Shelley's work, much like the similarly influential Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson (see my review of that here on Amazon for more on that tale), has almost been forgotten in its original form, as so many adaptations - most quite different from the original - have been produced in the nearly two centuries since it first appeared.The story begins with an introductory framing narrative by Robert Walton, an arctic explorer who catches a glimpse of a giant person traveling through the ice shortly before rescuing a stranded traveler who turns out to be Victor Frankenstein.Frankentein, a young Swiss student of chemistry and natural philosophy, relates his tale to Walton, who then records it in letters to his sister in England. Frankenstein describes how he created artificial life, only to be repulsed by the hideousness of the new being. Frankenstein abandons the creature, which then disappears.However, some time later, the creature begins taking revenge for his abandonment and misery upon Frankenstein's loved ones. Eventually tracking his creation down, the being tells Frankenstein his own tale of how he has attempted to befriend humans, only to be hated and driven away each time. The creature extracts a promise from Frankenstein to create a mate for him, after which the pair will disappear.Frankenstein begins to work on another creature, but eventually decides that he cannot create another monster and destroys his work. This prompts the creature to continue his campaign of revenge upon Frankenstein, eventually leading to the chase into the arctic. At this point, Walton resumes the narration and describes the final climax of the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation.The central theme of the story is the creation of life and the responsibility of the creator to his creation, as framed by the now-classic science fiction device of the artificial creation of life. Frankenstein, though the main character, could hardly be described as a hero in this narrative with his abandonment of the creature and self-centered actions, and the creature manages to illicit both sympathy from his lonely misery and horror with the lengths to which he will go to enact his revenge. Shelley does a fine job of taking the reader between these contradictions.I listened to the audio version read by Ralph Cosham, a favorite narrator of mine, and can certainly recommend Cosham's reading of the tale. Cosham's readings of the classics are always well done.Shelley's language will sound archaic to modern readers. However, if you can manage to get past that or you actually enjoy that style, Frankenstein is well worth reading. It has earned its place in popular culture and as a foundational tale in both the science fiction and horror genres. Do yourself a favor, and read the original Frankenstein. You'll find a lot more than the grunting, shambling monster of the movies. Shelley's creation is as alive, powerful, and intelligent as Frankenstein's."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book was both a masterpiece in the style it was written in, yet both a total mind-f**k in the plot set up. Overall, I give this book 3 stars for it was not entirely interesting to me, included a lot of \\"filler\\" scenes, yet kept the plot twisted enough to keep me reading. Not a bad book if you want to hear the real side of Frankenstein and his twisted thoughts in the Dr. Jeckle - Mr. Hyde relationship, but also the realization that man is almost entirely greedy and selfish."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"After seeing at least five versions of this tale in film - one of my great childhood monster loves - I was happy to finally read the novel. As so often occurs with classics, I was as surprised as I was fascinated.For starters, the characters are far more subtle than any of the film versions: Victor F appears as a brooding and obsessed genius, but also as a great lover of life and nature. The monster, who is an articulate and literate creature who read Goethe, is even more interesting, from his hopeful beginning to his bitter reaction at rejection and his thirst for vengence. His eloquence was vivid and his pain horribly realistic.But the work is also fascinating as a window into the mind of the Romantics, who at once strove to reject the rationalism of the Enlightenment yet reflected it. The creature starts off empty and what it becomes is due entirely to his experience. Knowledge is not always good, etc.Finally, the themes are timeless and full of conflict: creativity giving birth to unimaginable destruction, tampering with nature as its necessities overwhelm even genius, and the like. THe book is a kaleidescope of philosophical reflection. The pain of the creator and the monster alike are inescapably linked like father and son.I did find the style of the book a bit difficult. It is full of florid rhetoric and lengthy circumlocutions, as the doctor and then the monster tell their stories in almost identical prose.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I am an eighth grader that chose this novel to read for my English, it is one of the few books that I actually enjoyed, this book is a classic example of a horror tale, (it may not satisfy the horror book lover who reads Stephen King), it was one of the first books in the modern \\"robot\\" genre, a fictional autobiography of a man so obsessed with creating life, that without thinking of the consequences, he toils day and night wandering around graveyards, collecting material for his horrible deed and working in his lab, anxiously awaiting the completion of his horrible project and finally when it is completed.... O.K., I don't want to give away the whole story. I do want to say that this book lacks a great amount of detail as to how he was doing his horrible deed, but probably if it did, in Shelley's time, it wouldn't have been published. I also want to add that at times the book drags on as Frankenstein is telling about his remorse for the creation of his \\"wretched abomination\\", but not alot of times. I also want to add, for the ones of you reading this who saw the movie, that the book is totally in every way different than the movie, which drastically modified Frankenstein character, added some new ones (Igor) and changed the setting."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If you want to read Frankenstein as a classic horror story, you are missing Everything! Outwardly, especially due to the bastardization of the enigmatic and prophetic novel by cinema and mass media, people look at Frankenstein as a novel about a monster. End of story. But Shelley meant so very much more. Frankenstein is a desperate, angry, pleading outcry against industrialization and the destruction of humanity by moderization and advancement. The creature was Shelley's way of saying &quot;where are we going?&quot; &quot;what have we done to man when science takes precedence over forthought?&quot; This is also a new persceptive of man as the creation of God and banishment of Adam. Instead, in Shelley's world, man has grabbed at the reigns and assummed the role as creator and, as God, is horrified at his creation. Frankenstein acts without thought, then hastily casts off his creation as an abomination. And, the creature, like man's pursuit of divinty, ravenously pursues his creator. Shelley asks if this is the relationship of man and God. Have we been rejected? Cast aside as a hideous mistake? Are we relentlessly pursuing a creator that sees us as an abomination? If you want to peer into Shelley's philosophical soul, read Frankenstein. Write in the margins. Puzzle over the questions. Ask yourself where you stand after you see the vision of Shelley. Of course, if you want a monster on a rampage, rent the movie. The black and white versions the best."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"A great book, it's amazing how a dream can create such an incredible story. When I say forget the movies, it's because in the movies, even the original one with Boris Karloff, there is many things that are not in the book. For example, in the book, there is no lightning revival of the body, there is no hunchback assistant, it doesn't take place in some mystical castle on the edge of a cliff, but in a small student apartment. And, in my opinion, that is what makes it a great book. Allow me to explain.First, since the story is told by Dr Frankenstein to his new friend, Robert Walton, and since he feels ashame of himself, Dr Frankenstein is not willing to reveal his secret to anyone, nor say how it happened, because he fears someone might repeat his experience. That gives Dr Frankenstein a humanity which he doesn't have in the movies. In the different films, he looks more like a crazy fanatic scientist than anything else.Second, the fact that there is no hunchback is good because otherwise that shows how alone he was, how desperate his quest was that he didn't want anyone else involved in it. Hhe purposely isolated himself so not to bring to many attention on his research.Third, you see that Dr Frankenstein is not a crazy scientist living in a desolated castle, but rather a young scientist still in university.Finally, one thing I liked as well is that the monster is not, as in the movies, a grunting 8 foot man with bolts sticking out of his neck who scares people off without any reason. The monster is an articulate men who reads, talks, writes english perfectly. You know why he hates humanity that much, because he's been treated so badly by everyone.All in all, a fantastic book, a great story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Assuming that the people who are going to be interested in this book are going to be people who have seen the movie and want to compare it to the book, yes, the book is equally horrifying, and with no visual aid whatsoever (in the version that I read). This, to me, is a testament to Shelley's writing skill. Victor Frankenstein is portrayed not as a mad scientist but as an ambitious, emotional, lovesick, scholarly human being. The monster, too, is human. The best books are the ones that we can relate to, and we relate better to truly human characters. I actually felt more sorrow for the monster than I did for old Vic; I, too, have much love in my heart, but have said and done cruel things to people who have angered me, who have shunned me or wronged me. Human beings are capable of great good and great evil (since Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil) and if we are not loved, we become evil. I also empathized with Vic a little, though, for I know how it feels to accomplish/acquire something and find out later that I never really wanted it. I could empathize with both sides of the conflict, and it taught my pendulum-like ego that there are some things in life that we cannot control, and that no matter how successful we are, we need people. We have to care.All of this, combined with more-than-adequate imagery, combine to make this one of the most powerful books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This is a wonderful piece of literature, both moving and morally powerful. Frakenstein and his creation each moved me to sympathy and contempt, and I was left torn between caring for and loathing them at the same time. Without question this tale is worthy of its status as a classic, and is infinitely superior to the flat and superficial &quot;Dracula&quot;, a work it is often classified with, though I feel it is a far more meaningful work. If you haven't read &quot;Frankenstein&quot; you owe it to yourself to do so--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's classic book has often been regarded as the first science fiction novel. Brian Aldiss has referred to it as the first novel of the Scientific Revolution. It should be required reading of any college or college-bound student. The version I read was the original 1818 edition. In 1831, Mary Shelley made a number of changes (but, nothing of great import; for example, in the 1831 version Elizabeth is no longer Victor's cousin). I did read the author's new introduction to the 1831 edition however. This introduction is well done. In this novel, written in the epistolary form, a young (age 21) student at the University of Ingolstadt, Victor Frankenstein, discovers the method of imparting life to inanimate tissue. He uses his skills to construct a creature and to give it life. The creature's and Victor's lives are intertwined and the reader can detect much of Mary Shelley's early life as well. Her mother (i.e., her creator) died a few days after her birth. The female act of creation and its results is an aspect of this novel. Others have pointed out that this is a true female novel. Although, the monster &quot;inspires loathing&quot; in all who see him, I came to the conclusion that the real villian in this story was Victor Frankenstein. He allows his own creation to control him."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Shelly's Frankenstein is pretty well understood to be a flawed work, an amazing first attempt by a young author while also being a classic of literature. It is hard to say how I avoided reading it for so long but was surprised to find my friends negative attitudes on this book. Classics though must be read, so I devoured this over the course of a weekend and found the book quite enjoyable, however, at times I found some of its problems nearly overwhelming.The first problem Frankenstein has is that it is (as far as content goes) really a short story. I can't imagine it needing more than 60-100 pages, but Shelly inflates it to over 200, and for no discernable reason. The expanded length leads only to additional passages where Frankenstein himself is lying unconscious for months, or needless travelogue scenes which only serve to detract from the story. It might also be said that after 100 pages of melancholic whimperings from Frankenstein the reader has probably lost all sympathy toward the character. There are also certain plot elements that seem to repeat themselves a bit too often, but I the appeal of these elements will be based upon the reader.Ultimately, Frankenstien seems a great story that you occasionally feel compelled to skim through. There is a certain sloppiness (I am still not clear what happened to Edward--the only surviving Frankenstein, but I do know something about some of the townspeople mentioned in a letter which have NOTHING to do with the story), but when you put all that aside, the very heart of Frankenstein is an enjoyable read. The monster is a sympathetic one and I found myself glued to the pages as he first illustrated how he came to understand the world around him.Unlike Moby Dick which should never be abridged since so much of its irrelevance seems the primary point of the story (I often consider Ahab and the whale merely a sub-plot in Ishmael's life), Frankenstein could do with some good editing. Despite Frankenstein being a relatively short book to begin with, even 200+ pages feels a bit trying when all you are reading about is landscape and Frankenstein fainting."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein' is a wonderfully horrifying look at one man's obsession and the evil that comes from it. Victor von Frankenstein, a young and ambitious scientist, discovers the secret of bestowing life on lifeless matter. After creating a hideously deformed being Frankenstein quits the experiment and leaves his 'monster' to his own devices. Months later Frankenstein pays the price as the 'monster' seeks it's revenge. Far from the Boris Karloff idea of Frankenstein's monster, Shelly's creature is one that invokes sympathy and pity as he is cast out from the human world and forced to endure existence without companionship. The basic theme of the work is also an important moral- that obsession, if unchecked, can only result in despair. Truly a great work and one that fans of horror have embraced for over one hundred years."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I picked this up because it was free and I have not read it in years so I thought it would be a good choice to learn to navigate with on my K2.

With the TTS on I sailed through this book and loved it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I found this book very interesting, considering the cultural clout attained by \\"Frankenstein\\" the monster. It was surprisingly not scary. There was very little descriptive gore. Some parts of it were actually bland and a little boring. The climax was obvious to the reader. I'm not sure if Mrs. Shelley meant for the reader to see what was going to happen to Dr. Frankenstein, or if she thought we'd be taken in as he was. I wasn't.The moral of the story has implications for the current push by some scientists to control the creation and termination of human life. I am glad that I had the chance to read this book. If it wasn't for the library book club doing a season on \\"Spooky Tales,\\" I would have never picked it up on my own."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"In our modern day of of Judges legislatling their humanist agenda from the bench using society as lab for their social experiments and scientists playing God, this novel is more relevent today than it was the day Mary Shelley wrote it.A man creating life, what was once the domain reserved to women, what an idea. And certainly this novel shows consequences.Young Doctor Frankenstein in his vanity to create life andlearn new knowledge creates his being but fails to love it. Fails to provide for it. Fails to care for it.The conseqences are tragic. A tale of suffering and death caused upon innocent people as a consequence of one man's vanity."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book is truly worthy of the term \\"classic\\". Mary Shelley began writing this novel at the young age of 18, yet managed to create a landmark work of fiction. The story is interwoven with ever-present social and ethical questions. What does it mean to be human? What are the consequences of using scientific technology to play the role of Creator? How far is too far when tampering with the order of the universe?Upon my first reading of this book I was pleasantly surprised to find that the creature is very intelligent and human-like, though grotesque in appearance. It is a shame that the Frankenstein creature is universally represented in the minds of the public as an oafish and very dimwitted monster with bolts in its neck and a green pallor. The true Frankenstein is far more intriguing. I love the parts of the book that are a first person narrative by the \\"creature\\".I highly recommend this book as it is an enjoyable piece of classic literature. If you are a fan of horror, read this for an understanding of the early roots of the genre that you so love, and that those roots actually formed intellectual arguments and contained actual substance. This book is a must read for the well rounded reader. In fact, had I graduated from high school and never read this book, I would begin to question the quality of my own education."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"yes, yes, yes! This is what litterature is all about! Love, hate, life, death, good, evil. Not that the book in any way is trying to tell you what is what, quite the contrary, but it forces you to relate to the different characters one way or the other. And the language...shivers down my spine in excitement and joy! This book is the original story about the creation destroying the creator, and with that in mind the clice&eacute;s are non-existant.I urge, oh I urge, anybody with an interest in big litterature to read this masterpiece. It's only about 200 pages, so it's a fairly quick read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is a classic that every child had heard of, but who is the Frankenstein we imagine when we hear that name? A scary, green, ugly monster that holds his hands up like in the maraca? Or is it a lonely and curious scientist that releases an alien creature into a society that kills and destroys? Mary Shelley named the ladder Frankenstein and she did so correctly.Who are the Frankenstein's in our society today, who are the enemies, who are the destroyers? The scary creatures of man or the quiet, good looking men who smile and fade away? This book is amazing because of the issues it presents by answering this question. This classic doesn't only use the language of the old British that sweep your tongue and give you the feeling of intellectual bliss, but it also poses a question that continues to be asked throughout the centuries. Who are the REAL Frankensteins?Mary Shelley knew her answer and gave evil a beautiful name that most have used and see each day. Evil is disguised in the finest clothing and the richest words, evil is not in the ugly, the uneducated, the unknown, it is in the men and women who question how to create. Curiosity of God's work, God's hands, God's power. At the end of this book you know where evil resides and who Frankenstein really is. This book will give you a different image every time you heear the word Frankenstein and question, who is the real Frankenstein?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book is a wonderful piece of literature.

In the instance of Frankenstein's creation, the reader comes to realize that he is in fact very intelligent, and a genuinely kind-hearted being who is unfortunately forced to be cruel in order to survive.

Its a great story, it really is. Forget what you think you know about the story of Frankenstien, read the book !!!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein exceeded my expectations that were based on movies I have seen by the same title. This book is a literary masterpiece that sets a bar for terror that is yet to be surpassed.I was very impressed by the writing skill of Shelley. She does a terrific job telling this story, using three narrators that offer different points of view and voices.The monster is a character that elicited sympathy, respect, anger and hatred. He is intelligent and articulate in a way I did not expect. His ability to convey emotions and thoughts creates mixed emotions about him. Yet, because his hatred and anger prevail, these emotions prevailed in me too in my regards of him.Shelley shows the danger of allowing one's ambitions to overtake balance and reason. We see the character of Dr. Frankenstein forsake all to see this dream of creating life realized. We see the consequences of his actions that are a warning to us to tread more cautiously regarding our ambitions.All of the characters are developed comprehensively.I enjoyed reading this but had to set it aside at times because of the tragedy it entails. You know where the story is headed but still hold out some hope that it will turn out more positively--like watching Titanic, you know it is going to sink but still hope maybe it won't.I think this is a timeless classic you should read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"When I started this book I did not expect to be able to read it without falling asleep in the middle, but when I did begin, I realized I couldn't put it down. My teacher assigned this book for my english class and I assumed it to be exactly like all the other ones: boring, containing lots of big words, and having a bunch of quizzes over it. I do indeed have a test to look forward to, but the book was definitely not boring and although it had many &quot;big words&quot; they were not undecipherable. The plot is well developed and filled with interesting descriptions and events, however, she leaves many loose ends, but I don't want to spoil the story. Unlike the classic movie, Shelley describes Frankenstein's creature (no... Frankenstein is the SCIENTIST not the monster) as an intellectual, (how else could she use her fancy words...? ^_^) and as the story progresses, I winced at Frankenstein's stupidity. Towards the end, one finds it hard to decide which individual to pity, because both have suffered so much. This novel is one that I truly enjoyed and I hope that you will like it as well."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book was so close to being the best horror novel ever written. It just lacked a couple of things. The most important being a good description of what the monster looked like, granted it was fun to make up the image yourself. One of the reasons why I personally think it is a bit on the short side and does lack some description is that it was written for a friendly writing contest by Mary Shelly, her husband and some friends. However anyone who considers themselves well read even if they are not a fan of horror should read this book. It is very good and at only just over 200 pgs (most editions) it is not a time consuming book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Popular culture would have us believe that Frankenstein is a hulking green cartoonish character, while in reality, Frankenstein is actually the name of the man who created the monster. Having read Mary Shelley's classic for a British Literature class, I feel that it is a shame that the majority of the population has a misrepresentation of Frankenstein.Prometheus is a figure in Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, and was punished by Zeus for it. Victor Frankenstein is quite young when he goes abroad to study and becomes obsessed with the occult side of science, ambitiously desiring to overcome death. Victor also desires to have a race worship him as creator, and in his ambition he feverishly toils, robbing graves and laboratories to build his monstrous creation, which he fashions to be beautiful. Upon completing his work, the fever that has led Victor on immediatly flees, and he sees his work as a monster, and runs terrified from it. This creature is infinitely more terrifying and horrible than the one described by popular culture--\\"...I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!--Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horried contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and straight black lips.\\"Frankenstein abandons his monster, and returns home, tortured by what he has created. After several misfortunes befall Frankenstein, he again meets the creature, who, we learn, has become eloquent and learned, but, scorned by every human, has become bitter and vengeful toward Frankenstein. He appeals to Frankenstein to make him a companion, or he will destroy Frankenstein and those he loves.The rest of the novel follows Victor as he struggles with this decision, and as more misfortunes befall him.Different types of readers will find sympathy with different characters. I myself found little sympathy for Frankenstein; his selfish ambition and ensuing cowardice and rationalization render him utterly pathetic in my mind. There is some ambiguity as to whether the creature is simply a misunderstood being, or whether he really is a malicious devil as our somewhat unreliable narrator tells us. What a reader chooses to believe will determine the themes that reader derives from the novel.Frankenstein could be seen as a charge against vain amibtion, or it could be seen as an account of man's inability to act as God. I myself felt that Mary Shelley was perhaps questioning God's relationship to man, a plausible explanation considering that Mary Shelley's husband was Percy Shelley, who got kicked out of Oxford for distributing an atheist pamphlet. What, exactly, is a creator's responsibility to his work? To whom do the boundaries of ethics apply? Who is the real monster, Frankenstein's creature or people who unfeelingly reject him? These are only a slice of the themes that intersect Shelley's novel, which is much more than a campy horror story. Frankenstein is a solid read that should not be overlooked by the modern reader, for it contains messages relevant to to us."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book goes beyond a \\"classic\\". Many of the classics I have read have felt out dated, trite, or just plain boring but Frankenstein is not one of those classics. I've read a number of amazing classics too, but I was blown away by this novel. With all the renditions of Frankenstein in movie form none do this book justice.Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of the original Gothic horror classics, along with Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula.\\"If you only know \\"Frankenstein\\" from the movie versions, this book will come as a surprise. There is less detail on the creation, no criminal brain vs. normal brain, no Igor, no fabulous lightning storm, no bolts in the neck and no slow-moving gait.In fact, Shelley's narrative begins with letters from an Arctic explorer, R. Walton, written to his sister. Walton's passion for exploration is explained and his quest for companionship detailed. Then, while his ship is trapped in the northern ice, he spots a creature crossing the ice. Following the creature is a weakened man in a broken sledge. Upon rescuing the man, Walton meets Victor Frankenstein, and so begins his tale.We learn of Frankenstein's family background, upbringing in Geneva, early education and fascination with the nature of the world. Upon entering university, he expands his knowledge of physical science and chemistry. It is there that he begins construction of a being that he plans to bring to life. Through Frankenstein's narrative, we begin to see his descent into an obsessive madness, more manic than maniacal, a bi-polar disorder of the nth degree.The assembly and bringing to life are kept vague, probably because Shelley herself lacked the scientific knowledge, but cleverly veiled by Frankenstein's own admission, lest another try to duplicate his work.Dr. Frankenstein succeeds, and when the creature awakens, Frankenstein is so repulsed that he abandons the creature and flees his laboratory. He has a breakdown, and only the arrival of his best friend, Henry Clerval, brings him back to health.What follows is Victor Frankenstein's demise through the machinations of the being he created.I love Mary Shelley's language, so evocative of the time, full of color, passion and darkness. The voices are very distinct, and we get to hear the creature's story of what happened when he was thrust into the world, cast away by the hand that created him. The creature is far from the dull movie versions, in fact he is quite intelligent, mastering language by observing a family as he hides in a hovel next to their home, discovering the joys of music, and reading the work of John Milton.But, he is alone and an outcast, and implores Dr. F to create a mate for him. The Dr. denies him this request, taking a moral high road lest he should unleash a family of demons upon the world.There is so much to enjoy here, from the lush detail of the travels of both the Dr. and the creature. The range of emotions displayed by both make each sympathetic and pathetic at various stages. There is also the strong message about violating the natural order and trying to play God. One must be ready to face the consequences. This is a powerful story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"If you like horror, you owe it to yourself to read this book from the beginnings of the genre. You will enjoy seeing the themes in Frankenstein repeated in other horror novels that you will read in the future. The book and the movie have essentially nothing in common, so assume that you do not know the story yet if you have only seen the movie.If you do not like horror, you probably won't like the book very much at all.The story opens in the frozen Arctic wastes during an sea-going expedition to find a passage through the ice to the East. Aboard the ship after a strange meeting, Frankenstein tells his story. As a young man he wanted to make a splash in the sciences, and invented a way to create life. Having done so, he became estranged from his new being with significant consequences for Frankenstein and his creation. The two interact closely throughout the book, like twin brothers in one sense and like Creator and creation in another sense.This book presents significant challenges to the reader. Like many books that relate to scientific or quasi-scientific topics from long ago, Frankenstein seems highly outmoded to the modern reader. In the era of psychological knowledge, the development of moods and character in the book will also seem primitive to many. A further drawback is that this novel takes a long time to develop each of its points (even after the eventual action is totally foreshadowed in unmistakeable terms), so patience is required as layer after layer of atmosphere and thought are applied to create a complex, composite picture. Finally, the structure of the novel is unusual, with layers of narration applied to layers of narration, creating a feeling of looking at never-ending mirror images.So, you may ask, why should someone read Frankenstein? My personal feeling is that there are two timelessly rewarding aspects to the book that well reward the reader (despite the drawbacks described above). Either is sufficient to please you. First, the book raises wonderful ethical issues about the responsibilities of science and the scientist towards the results of scientific endeavors. These issues are as up-to-date now as they were when the book was written. Those who developed atomic weapons and biotechnology tools appear to have given little more thought to what comes next than Frankenstein did toward his creation. Second, the moods that are built up in the reader by the book are extremely vivid and powerful. The artistry of this book can serve as a guide for novelists for centuries to come, in showing how much the reader can be deeply engaged by the circumstances of the characters.Why, then, did I grade the book at three stars instead of five? Few will fail to be annoyed by the scientific awkwardness of the story, and that is a definite drawback. Also, only the most dedicated students of style will avoid feeling like the book moves and develops its story too slowly. Less is more in novels. In this case, more is less.I cannot help but comment that this book is perhaps the finest example of appearances being deceiving that exists in literature. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a close competitor in this regard, but that fine work definite has to fall behind Frankenstein. In this book, beings of physical beauty act in inhumane, ugly ways. Beings of great ugliness act in beautiful ways. The same being may act in both ways, in different circumstances. Looks are deceiving, and our perceptions are flawed even when our attention is fixed. If the characters could have overcome this form of stalled thinking, the horror would have been averted. So the lesson is that the misperceptions we aim at others rebound (like a reflection in a mirror) right back onto us.If you have not yet read Paradise Lost, Frankenstein is a good excuse to read that poem. The development of the story in Frankenstein assumes a knowledge of that story about Satan leading a rebellion against God and being dispossessed into Hell.After you have had a chance to absorb and appreciate the nice issues this book raises, ask yourself where you in your life are acting without sufficiently considering the implications of your actions. Then, commence to examine those potential consequences. You should be able to create more good results in this way, and take more comfort in what you are doing. Both will be excellent rewards for your introspection."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein is part of our literary heritage. Halloween would not be complete without images of a large green monster wearing bolts in his neck. However, the origins of this monster conceal a horror far greater than the character popular culture has embraced.For me, it is not the actions of the monstrous laboratory experiment that frighten me, but the act of the monster's creation itself. Mary Shelley created a novel that places the act of creation into the hands of one man, an idea which eliminates the necessity of the female sex. Technology has usurped the need for male-female partnership. What a horrific idea!Dr. Victor Frankenstein was terrified of female power. His feelings of torment concerning his fiancee, including a particularly unsettling dream passage concerning her, led him to strip the female sex of child-bearing responsibility. If a single man can create another man then natural laws no longer apply, the male and female of a species no longer live in symbiosis.This is the fantastic premise behind this classic horror novel. Some of the writing is crude; one instance in particular is when the monster teaches himself to read after conveniently finding a satchel of books by the side of the road. This is an example of the inexperience Shelley had as a writer; however such breaks in the story are minimal and should not overly detract from the reader's enjoyment. This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"After years of watching movies about Frankenstein I finally read the original book (published in 1818) by Mary Shelley.Wow, is it ever different from the movies.For starters Victor Von Frankenstein worked alone. He didn't have a lisping hunchback by the name of Igor helping him out. He worked in solitary while he was a student at the University of Ingolstadt.Secondly, there was no thunderstorm and no electrodes the night that he gave his creature life. There was no bolt of lighting. And although Victor Von Frankenstein keeps very mum about the methods that he used to animate dead flesh, he does make some cryptic allusions to an elixir of life.Thirdly there was no crowd scene where hordes of peasants storm the castle, brandishing pitchforks and torches.In addition Mary Shelley's creature itself is different in appearance from the creature in the movies. Mary Shelley's creature is eight feet tall, has long dark hair and moves much faster and much more nimble than any human. This is a HUGE contrast from the slow moving and awkward creature that they show in the movies.Perhaps the fifth thing that I noticed was that the creature (who calls himself Adam) learns how to speak and read and write (in French) and becomes very articulate. After he learns how to read he finds a number of books written in French (Paradise Lost by John Milton, a volume of Plutarch's Lives and the Sorrows of Young Werter by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) and he reads them again and again.After all this perhaps what struck me about the book is how the relationship between Victor Von Frankenstein and his creation are similar to the relationship between an absentee father and his abandoned child. Victor is repulsed by the physical appearance of the creature he created and runs from the room as soon as it rises up off the table. The creature wanders out of Victor's home and Victor neither knows nor cares if it survived.Not having any parents to guide \\"Adam\\" in his development he is left to fend for himself. Because of his hideous appearance, humans throw stones at him and chase him whenever he appears in public, he is thus forced to hide in the woods and live alone.\\"Adam\\" learns how to speak French by watching a family that live in a hovel near the edge of the woods and listening to their conversations. He grows to love this family and hopes someday to gain their acceptance. He goes into the forest to gather wood for them that they can use for their fireplace and leaves it at their front door. He works to improve his language skills so that he may better communicate with them when he finally meets them in person.But when he finally (after months of preparation) works up the courage, it all goes wrong. The French Family takes one look at him and decides because he is ugly that he MUST be a threat and they chase him out of their hovel.This of course makes him more and more bitter and makes him even less trusting of humans.Eventually he learns who gave him life and where his \\"Father\\" lives.Of course the reunion between abandoned child and absentee father is not good."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The book, written by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, the young wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, is incredibly different from the movies made over a century later. The writing style is typically old-fashioned but tends to be a bit over-burdened at times which is why I give it 4-stars instead of 5, but the story is heart-breaking.Young Victor Frankenstein is a son of privilege. He has a loving father, two charming brothers, and a beautiful cousin that the family hopes he will one day marry. While studying medicine, Victor becomes obsessed with the concept of creating life and he begins a series of experiments which result in his creation of a \\"monster\\" but the minute the monster comes to life Victor is horrified and repulsed by his creation and promptly rejects it. He casts his creation out in to the world with no preparation for life whatsoever and tries to distance himself as far as possible from what he has brought into being. This, of course, does not work.Victor returns to his studies and to his life but, soon after he finishes his studies, he is called home because his younger brother has been murdered and the foster child his father raised, a lovely but fragile young woman, has been accused and is about to stand trial. Victor hurries home but to no avail. Justine is convicted of murdering the son of the family that raised her and is hanged. Victor, of course, knows she could not have done this and suspects it is the work of his own creation. He sets off into the snow-bound secrets of the Alps and there is met by his creation who tells him his tale.His is an incredibly sad story. The monster, cast out into the world knows nothing -- he cannot speak or communicate, he does not know how to care for himself, he is utterly alone in the world with no skills at all. The only thing he knows is that he is much bigger and more powerful than other men and that his appearance terrifies them. He eventually finds himself in proximity to a family -- a blind old man and his two grandchildren who care for him. By living hidden but close to them and eavesdropping on their life, the monster learns to speak and also learns about the world. He is the most pitiful of beings, leading a lonely, hidden life. He tries to help the family he lives near by gathering firewood he leaves outside their door along with nuts and berries but he is completely alone. When ultimately he tries to contact the family he is met with hatred, fear and terror and runs away again.The monster begs Victor to make him a companion. He cannot bear being alone in the world and promises that, if only Victor will create a partner for him, he will go as far away a possible and that they will never be seen again. Victor agrees and goes to an island in the Orkneys with the intention of creating an \\"Eve\\" for his \\"Adam\\" but is so repulsed by the process, even though he did it once before, that he gathers up his work and deposits it in a lake. The monster, who has followed him, observes this and begins a series of murders out of rage.This is an incredibly sad story. Victor comes across as an obnoxious, spoiled, insensitive brat who is constantly falling into illness because of his own rash and imprudent behavior. And the monster is the saddest of creations -- alone with nothing in the world to support himself except his incredible strength. By the end of the story one cannot help but ask \\"who is the real monster here?\\" The answer is pretty apparent."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Readers will be surprised to read this nineteenth century \\"horror story,\\" because the English woman Mary W. Shelley (1797-1851) did not write this book as it is shown in the many motion pictures that were made of it. She published this gothic tale, which many scholars see as the earliest version of a science fiction novel when she was only 21. Scholars think that she wrote it as an attack against the emerging industrial revolution, but perhaps, as we will see, it is more than that. The story is written in the delightful style of its time, like the mystery tale of the Englishman Wilke Collins, which was serialized in 1859-1860 and published in 1860, The Woman in White, which some scholars say is the first detective story, while others give the honor to Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849).Mary Shelley became the wife of the famous poet Percy Shelley after writing her novel. She subtitled it The Modern Prometheus. According to some but not all Greek myths, Prometheus was a giant who created people and latter brought them fire. It appears that the Prometheus in the tale is the creator Frankenstein, who was not a giant in height, but in intellect. Most people consider Prometheus a hero, but not Shelley. She thought of fire as being bad because it caused people to kill and eat animals and gave people more implements with which to wage war and murder people. Frankenstein tells the story to a man who saved him while he is pursuing the man he created. He warns the man not to pursue scientific goals that will harm humanity.The Shelley story is about an educated man of science who was born in Switzerland and educated in a German university, who is interested in helping people. Everyone who meets him likes him. He comes from an educated amicable family who love him, and he loves them. He searches for an answer to what is life. He wonders if he can create life, and succeeds in doing so. He creates an eight-foot man, who is never named in the novel. He is repulsed by the man he creates and thinks of him as a monster as soon as the man is alive. All people who later see his creation are also repulsed and this causes the man to hide and live alone and it accounts for the profound loneliness that the man feels. His creator becomes depressed at what he has done, rushes away from his lab, and is sick in bed for four months. He is Frankenstein. The unnamed man he created leaves.Frankenstein returns home from Germany and discovers that someone killed his younger brother. He is convinced that the man he created did it, and pursues him to kill him. He meets his creation and is unable to harm him because the man is larger and stronger than he. His creation tells Frankenstein that he killed his brother by mistake. The boy saw him, was disgusted at seeing him, and started shouting. All he did was place his hand over the boy's mouth. He tells how he has been traveling about for more than a year, found that every human despises him, and has become very lonely. He begs Frankenstein to make him a female companion because he, like the biblical Adam, can't live alone. Frankenstein agrees.However, when he finishes making the female he becomes frightened that two monsters, as he thinks of them, could harm mankind. So he destroys the female. The man he created is enraged and vows vengeance against Frankenstein for destroying his life.What happens to Frankenstein and the man he created, I will leave for readers to read and enjoy. Will the creation carry out his threat? If yes, how? Which of the two will outlive the other? What will the survivor do? Is it right to call Frankenstein's creation a monster because of the way he looks? Readers may also want to ask themselves: is Mary Shelly's pessimistic approach to scientific advances justified?Perhaps there is another interpretation of the story. It may be an examination with comments upon the creation of man. The first biblical creation Adam is unnamed, like Frankenstein's creation. Although most people think his name is Adam, the Hebrew word adam actually means \\"human.\\" There is an ancient Jewish legend that when God decided to create this adam, the angels objected that people were not sufficiently good. This parallels the rejection of Frankenstein's creation by society. Like Frankenstein's creation, the adam was also lonely and wants a companion. Today, many people, like Frankenstein's creation feel alienated and lonely, and live a life without meaning. This is something to think about."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I think that &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is worthy reading material at nearly any level. Besides a short portion in the middle of the story, this book stays rather interesting throughout. I especially enjoyed the character Victor. His emotions, thoughts, and reactions to his creation are convincingly real. Also, I liked the fact this book did tend to keep the reader a little chilled and anxious. I feel that this book is appropriate for high school or college courses and is surely a great leisurely read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is actually great novel with intense themes that apply to the 1800s as well as today! A 4/5 rating is a little low, and I wish that I could give it a 4.5/5 because it is so good. But, it has a few weaknesses so I couldn't give it five stars. The novel is a whole lot more emotional and meaningful than the 1931 movie. They are so different in their story's events and in their message that it is surprising that they even share the same name!Although I don't agree with everything Mary Shelley is implying in her writing, such as the idea of a planned destiny, some of the novel's main messages are actually quite true and apparent to the modern world. The novel shows how taking someting, such as science or the desire to become famous, taken to the extreme actually destroys rather than builds. This applies to the confict between science and ethics in the case of genetic engineering and cloning of modern day. Also, the novel shows how others' heartless and presumptuous actions can totally ruin a person and can bring out the evil from within that person. Even though the book isn't very long, with all these powerful themes, it is not exactly an easy read.The story is great, and Mary Shelley related events very well. I have to admit, some parts were predictable, but other parts of the book were suspensful and exciting to read. The story starts with an arctic explorer who finds and saves a man he found almost frozen to death. This man, in order try to teach the explorer a lesson about the the downsides of fame, tells his story about his scientific discovery dealing with life and death and his terrible destruction. This story is not action-packed, terrifying, nor that believable (it really doesn't need to be) but it is emotional, tragic, dark, and moving, and Mary Shelley's writing style creates this mood well.The language that Mary Shelley uses is exquisite, but sometimes challenging because it is old-fashioned. I would recommed that you get an edition, such as the Penguin Classics, that has end-notes so you can have a greater understanding of Mary Shelley's writing. Also, there are certain parts of the book that move at a slow pace. Getting through the slow parts is well worth it, however, because it is such a powerful and fascinating book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was told to read this for a class, and I wasn't too enhusiastic, but I started to read it. At first I didn't like it because it started off too slow. But when Victor went off to college the story really picked up and I found myself not able to put it down."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Before reading this book, you must understand that this story was written in the early 1800's. Writing of this time was not based on sex, or even drinking and drugs. Unlike many stories and movies created in the past thirty years, this plot makes sense without all the sex, drugs, and alcohol that is added to appeal the audience. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly was only eighteen when she wrote this book! Anyone one who can create a book with all the emotions of a scientist and the horrid monster he created, definently deserves a five star review!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"The number of reviews for the printed versions of Frankenstein is overwhelming...read them to learn more about the story. My review is of the audio cassettes put out by Monterey Soundworks Audio Theatre series. I recently discovered these gems and they are AWESOME! You are treated to an extremely well written and beautifully performed dramatization of the novel. The acting and sound effects are utterly enthralling and succeed in sucking you right into the action. I am impressed with how they dealt with some of the possible auditory limitations inherent in this piece. For example, in the novel, Dr. Frankenstein works in his laboratory ALONE. Since their goal is to dramatize and not just read, how do they portray his actions to a listener without relying upon extensive monologue? They seamlessly enlarge the role of a minor character and the dialogue between him and the good doctor becomes the vehicle (and no, it's not Igor!). Also, Ms. Shelley never went into great detail on the science or methods of creating and re-animating the creature. This adaptation does a good job of filling in those details.This is a top notch production and I urge you to seek out this and Monterey's other titles if you can find them!(Frankenstein ISBN #1569945136) Great entertainment for the whole family, at home or in the car.

Well written, easy to follow the story. Loved reading it on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"In the book Frankenstein, the author, Mary Shelley tells a story about a monster that the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, creates. Well at the beginning of the book, it leads off with the narrator, Robert Walton, writing letters to his sister Margaret Saville. They are summarizing what Walton did, when he met Victor Frankenstein and how he nursed him back to health. After Victor is becomes healthy, Victor starts telling Walton his story. Victor starts by telling Walton about his early life, where he was born and where he lived, just a little back round information. After this is when you start to learn about Elizabeth, Victor's lifelong companion. Later in the years he starts to make a new friend named Henry Clerval, their friendship blooms. At the age of seventeen Victor goes to a University in Ingolstadt. Before he leaves his mother catches scarlet fever form Elizabeth, who she is nursing back to health. While at the university he creates a monster, which has no name. The monster terrorizes Victor and he becomes ill. Henry nurses him, when he is healthy again he receives a letter from his father saying that his brother William has been murdered. Justin Mortz is convicted of the murder she didn't commit and is executed. But come to find out the monster killed William. Later you find out that Victor meets the monster and finds out that he can talk and he shows emotions. The monster tells Victor of his past and how he learned how to speak. But when Felix scares him away he promises to himself that he will reject all humans. He comes across William and William mentions the name Alphonse and is strangled by the monster to death. After the monster finishes his story he tells Victor that he wants a female companion, after an agreement Victor agrees to make a female monster. When Victor, his father, and Henry go on a two-year tour, Victor finds himself making the female monster. But when he has second thoughts that they will make a \\"Devil race\\" he destroys the monster. When the monster finds out that Victor destroyed the companion the monster kills Henry. Victor is found innocent of Hery's murder and goes back to Geneva.I found that the book was well written and that Mary Shelley, describes the characters with greatest descriptions. I believe that when the monster was telling his story that she put a lot of effort into letting people know what happened to him. That made me want to read the book more.I would suggest that all ages should read this book because it is great entertainment when you have nothing to do. People who like mysteries will have more fun reading this book then a person who likes drama."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"yeah i liked this book. i read it and it was good"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"frankenstein AD Book.

Upon reading the book, I failed to see how it has stood the test of time so well, with so many people proclaiming it a masterpiece. On the other hand, it saddens me to see that some people are so narrow minded as to decry the book merely because it does not live up to its reputation as horror novel.However, in the end one must observe Frankenstein as a literary work in general and not a horror novel whose plot and story have been so twisted and mutilated since its publication with countless inaccurate films and a lack of people who have actually read the book. When I look at it in this sense, I'm afraid I must still look upon this work with poor esteem. I stumbled upon a review crying out for people to recognize the depth of this book and not write it off as a horror novel, and I agree with that reviewer; the book does have depth, exploring the human condition in a truely unique way. However, there is no point in praising a literary work based simply upon the depth of the themes. No matter how deep a novel it, in the end you still have to read it, and that is the trouble with Frankenstein. The themes presented in the book can not be assertained because the execution of it is horrendous. Whether you want to view it as a book of horror or not, one can't help but notice how incredibly bland and drawn out this book is. It is difficult to stay awake, let alone be captivated, by a book that is so saturated with hyperbole and displaced emotion. Perhaps if Shelley spent more time developing her characters rather than simply focusing on the exaggerated emotional states of Victor and the Creature, story might actually seem plausible; instead, the character are uniformly formily immaculate and possess the same emotional expressions as Victor. The only two character that show any distinction are Victor and his father.Also, the plot itself is detestably unrealitistic. Of course a common complaint is that the creation of the monster is not described at all in detail, and, although the actual process of creation is not important for the developement of the themes of the book, I would have to agree that it wouldn't hurt the show the reader some plausibilty. Also, it is difficult to grasp the concept that as a human being it takes the average person about a year to learn how to read on a seccond grade level, yet the monster is able to teach himself how to read without the aid of a teacher possessing the knowledge of the fundamental concepts of written language and comprehend works by Ovid and Aristotle in a matter of months, not to mention speak more articulately than I can.In essence, Frankenstein is certainly credible for its depth, but anyone can be a philosopher. Unfortuantely, literature is an art, and, therefore it takes a talented author to create a reabable and enjoyable vehicle for such insight.

It was an interesting story line but horribly and not understandably written and is one of the worst books I have read in a while."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Let me get this straight: I came to this book expecting a lot. Here is a book that has informed the science fiction, fantasy, and horror genres for nearly two centuries; here is a book whose premise is deliciously provocative and brimming with moral and ethical dilemmas; here is a book which, I assumed, given its plot outline, dealt with such thorny questions as how far humankind must go when it comes to wielding the power of science, should a line be drawn at some point, or do we unbridle science and let it shape out society as we move forward into the future. Yes, I expected a lot from this book.Dr. Frankenstein is a young student who works hard for years to discover the ultimate secret: how to breathe life in a body devoid of one. How to animate a corpse. This is surely one of the grandest, most ambitious projects a scientist could ever embark upon. He spends his days and nights obsessed with his work and, finally, cracks the code of life. One stormy night, his creature, made of body parts obtained from various dead bodies and stitched together to form a single, giant one, comes to life.Dr. Frankenstein has achieved that no human being in the history of mankind has even come close to: he has the power to bestow life. He can revive the dead. What is our good doctor's reaction when the creature opens his eyes for the first time ?Before I tell you about his reaction, here is what the doctor has to say about his education and background:\\"In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.\\"So, our intrepid scientist is neither squeamish, nor superstitious. Keeping that in mind, here is his reaction when his creature comes to life (in his own words):\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.\\"Ladies and gentleman, after achieving a break-through of stupdendous proportions in medical science, after breathing life into a dead body, our good doctor's first reaction is to describe the event as a \`catastrophe.' Do you notice that instead of talking about his accomplishment, its mechanics, and how it can change the future of mankind forever, he describes at great length the physical features of the creature.For Christ's sake, can somebody explain to me the significance of this ? How is the creature's physical beauty or lack thereof of any import whatsoever ?Wouldn't any scientist be dancing in the streets if he could merely bring back a cockroach to life, let alone a humanoid body ?Here is a scientist who has obsessed over his work for years and we have no explanation why he considers his success, when it finally arrives, a catastrophe. No explanation is ever provided.The doctor further tells us:\\"Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.\\"Sleep ! The doctor went to his bedchamber to sleep ! Am I the only one who sees the ridiculousness of the situation here ? He has animated a dead body and instead of communicating with the creature, studying him, finding out about his brain, his mind, his thoughts, his physical and mental status, our good doctor wants to sleep.Once the doctor retires to his bedroom, the creature runs away. Throughout the book, the doctor refers to this unnamed creature as a fiend, a brute, an animal, the devil, a wretch, and we don't know why. I mean, within months of his creation, the creature is reading Greek historians such as Plutarch and writing critiques of such works as John Milton's \`Paradise Lost' and he is considered an animal. Why ? Why ? Why ? No reason is ever given except that the monster doesn't look like Brad Pitt or George Clooney.Maybe Dr. Frankenstein was in the wrong profession, instead of a scientist, he should have been a cosmetic surgeon ?The creature then goes to Geneva and stumbles across, by pure chance, the younger brother of Dr. Frankenstein. What were the odds of this coincidence ?The population of Geneva circa 1780 was around 20,000 and our creature comes across a child who happens to be his creator's little brother. And on top of that, after he accidentally strangles the child, he roams around, enters a barn, where, again by pure chance, he encounters the child's governess who happens to be sleeping in that very barn. Coincidence upon coincidence. The creature had found a necklace on the child's person, which he places in the governess's pocket in order to mark her as the killer.And here is the best part, in the morning, the governess is caught with the necklace and sentenced to die. I mean, here is someone who raised the child, lived in the same household for years, she had ample opportunity to steal whatever she wanted, but she decided to one day strangle the child in a public park, hide his body, keep the necklace in her pocket, and then let herself be caught with it in the morning.People, are you laughing with me already ? Do you see the stupidity of this travesty of literature ? I am glad that Mary Shelley never decided in her life to write a legal thriller.The whole novel is full of such ridiculous co-incidences and logical inconsistencies.Later in the story, the creature confronts Dr. Frankenstein again and asks him to create a wife for him or else he would kill everyone in the doctor's family. The doctor reluctantly agrees, but later decides against it. Why does he decide against it ?Because the creature would have children with this female and the future generations of these monsters might take over the planet. The creature promised to take his wife and go to the jungles of South America where they would never come across humans again. This is a great chance for our doctor to get rid of the creature, he could have created a female creature, missing one or two organs vital to childbirth, and all would end well. His family wouldn't be threatened by the monster anymore, he wouldn't have to worry about the human race being taken over by the progeny of the creatues. But, no, the mind of our good doctor works in really mysterious ways, as we have seen, so far.Throughout the book, the creature expresses his desire to be among humans, he talks like a philosopher and a scholar, he makes it clear that he is not violent, all he wants is some comanionship, but the doctor refuses to hear any of this, and continues to refer to him as a wretch, a beast, and an animal. The only explanation ever given for this treatment is that the creature is not handsome.This was a laughably terrible book. Mary Shelley writes two, three sentences describing the most important event of the story, the birth of the monster, but she dedicates pages after pages describing the Swiss Alps, the weather, Lake Geneva, and other such nonsense which has no bearing whatsoever on the story.She leaves a thousand questions unanswered about the monster, his body, his brain, his mind, his thoughts, and goes on writing about irrelevant stuff which makes it a drag to get through a single page of the novel.The author was supposedly eighteen or nineteen when she wrote this book, and it shows on every page. She describes all the characters in her book as beautiful, handsome, charitable, generous, understanding, and generally being great human beings.Not counting the monster, there is only one wicked character in the book, who happens to be a Muslim Turk. His daughter was born off a Christian mother and wanted to be a Christian. The Turk was imprisoned by French authorities and rescued by a Christian man who fell in love with his daughther, but the Turk betrays his rescuer so that his daughter wouldn't end up marrying him, a Christian. Mary Shelley writes:\\"The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who...instructed her daughter in the tenets of her (Christian) religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.\\"Shelley is not only a terrible author, she is also an ignorant and prejudiced one. Her novel, hailed as a classic for two centuries, is infantile dross and lacks any imagination or creativity. Mary Shelley was the Stephanie Meyer of her generation, and her novel should be shelved with the chic-lit vampire romances and other such fare read avidly by teenage girls."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book was so boring I threw it out my window. (Almost) It just had too much detail"},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I was very disappointed. I had seen the movie, and usually, if I like the movie, I like the book even better, but this time they really improved on the book. I found the book incredibly boring. I had to force myself to finish it. I've read other books written in the same format -- mostly letters back and forth between people -- and enjoyed them. Bram Stoker's Dracula was written largely like that. But Mary Shelley is just not a very good writer, in my humble opinion. She had a good idea, and other people have done great things with it. But the original book just didn't do much for me."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I ordered a copy of Frankenstein but was billed for seven copies because Amazon accused me of having clicked the order button more than once. I will take this opportunity to accuse Amazon of thoughtfully or thoughtlessly having created the possibility of more than one order per click, a reality that could indeed happen with a purchaser who has a tremor or who quite accidentally clicks the order button more than once. That's a sad trap for customers who don't pay close attention to the orders they receive, thinking that Amazon sent an order in the customer's favor and the customer later not recognizing the reality of what happened and end up paying the full amount of the credit card invoice."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I have to add this to the top of the list of books that I have had to read but HATED! Let's see it was up there with Call of the Wild, The Odyssey, Farenheit 451, The King Must Die, True Grit, When the Legends Die, etc...I think you get my point. It is as if the teachers and district pick the worst possible books. Frankenstein has SOOO much potential to be great, however it falls abysmally short. I am sad to say that I had to read this horrible book front to back without the option of throwing it in the fireplace like I was so longing to do. We even had to read the lame(for lack of better word) letters at the beginning. Our teacher said that most teachers don't make their students read those--I guess he is not one of those teachers."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I'm not going to try and write a review for a classic and notable novel such as this. Much has already been written by people far more capable of appreciating and responding to the work than I am. I will simply add my two cents:This book, wonderful and important as it is, can be a taxing read, especially in the world of short-attention spans and \\"show-don't-tell\\" novels that we consume today. It is largely an exploration of enlightenment ideas, particularly with regard to the changing relationship between man, God, and nature. For that reason this novel will certainly remain necessary in any humanities study which tries to understand the rise of the modern era.I found this particular version (the Barnes and Noble Classics edition) to be very useful in that it provided introductory material and segments from essays. As well, it contains some good questions for pondering and a list of other materials for further reading.I'm glad that I worked my way through the book (and I stress that it did require effort), it is one of those works that \\"everybody talks about but nobody reads\\", but I am also glad to be done with it. I'm sure that the challenges encountered, which are central to the human condition, will come back to mind again and again."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I bought and read this version(version #2) of Frankenstein first, then went on to read the original version Mary Shelley wrote, before she made changes to the story years later. (Oxford World's Classics is the original version, or any version with the inclusion \\"a Modern Prometheus\\" in the title. This Barnes and Noble Classics version is the later changed version.) I was glad I read both, and in that order, because when I read the original version (which was by far my favorite), my appreciation for the brilliant nuggets I found had been edited out in version #2 was heightened. I wish I had checked this version out from the library, and bought the original version.The thoughts and motives of the characters in the version #2 suffer from the incongruity of the later changes to the story, while in the original version they flow with more clarity. Some wonderful food for thought permeates the reflections of the characters in the original version, that is left out in the later.As for the story itself, it was a great book club pick! Nothing puts me off more than the \\"horror\\" genre... or the versions of this story depicted in the movies. But I found this to be totally different from what I expected, written with a reflective and thoughtful voice, packed with fascinating themes to think about. Some people say the writing style is difficult, but I didn't find it hard to read. I found it rather enjoyable for its intelligent, almost poetic (some would say stuffy) way of putting things, without being too much work to understand in the context of the story (but that will vary from person to person depending on your taste.) Mary Shelley was clearly an intelligent and well-read person, and that is reflected in this story. I love that it spurred me to learn more about other writings and ideas that were referenced in this work, and the philosophical ideas and discussions that circled in her group, that are still relevant today, and which they tied into similar threads of thought ranging from Greek mythology to Milton's Paradise Lost (which I was unfamiliar with until I read this book.) A few minutes spent on wikipedia learning about Prometheus, Milton's Satan, or reading in an introduction about Mary Shelley's life and circle of friends and family and their part in the romantic movement, really enrich the reading of this book. It is a book you can get something from with just a casual reading, but can really find some good stuff if you feel like diving in deeper."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Not much to say... it's Frankenstein. The chapters are arranged oddly (in a series of books rather than ongoing chapters.Personally didn't like the story... Frankenstein's monster's actions are questionable and everything is overdramatized. Ah well; that's the old style of writing for ya. Not exactly a \\"horror\\" book to me..."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Once you read Shelley's classic you're going to scratch your head and wonder: Is this really the book that gave us the Karloff movie? Not to mention Herman Munster and Frankenberry. For over a century and half people have been cannibalizing this book for ideas, movies, other books, and products of every size, shape and type that our modern concept of Frankenstein holds little to no resemblence to the master work. While occasionally these bastardizations have had enjoyable results, like Young Frankenstein, it's criminal that so few people are unfamiliar with the source. Do yourself a favor and find out where it all came from. It's not nearly as creepy as you may think, but it's infinitely more thought provoking and it certainly doesn't hurt that this version is beautifully published at a very reasonable price."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"It is pretty surprising that something come up with almost on a whim toprovide a diversion has come to be such an important text for twogenres, both horror and science fiction.Victor Frankenstein's obsession with the creation of life ultimately ends in tragedy and death for those around him."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \\"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and Plutarch's \\"Lives.\\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?It is easer to listen to than read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Like many teenagers, I was under the impression that Frankenstein (thinking it was the name of the monster) was a remorseless brute that got joy from torturing people. But after reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, my perception completely changed.I literally knew nothing about the story save that Frankenstein--again thinking that it was the monster--was repulsive in aspect.As I read the story I came to find out that Frankenstein was actually the name of the man who created the abominable creature. Also, I would have never guessed that the creature would have been made malicious by human disdain. The \\"daemon\\" was at heart benevolent and innocuous, but human scorn turned his ways and he sought revenge.Altogether, the story was very well written. It did have a few flaws, such as the overuse of the word \\"endeavour\\" and the impractibility of a man remembering such long a story and actually narrarating the whole of it, not forgetting to omit a single quote. Despite the few flaws, Frankenstein is indeed a horror classic (although, I failed to find any horror in it) and should be read by the fans of the genre."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Dr. Frankenstein goes off to London to receive an education and discovers his love of science. His first experiment is to create a life from parts. He assembles a creature by which even he is repulsed. Frankenstein's nightmare is fully realized when the creature's eyes first blink and he realizes that his experiment worked. He flees the apartment only to find it empty upon his return. But despite Frankenstein's initial thoughts that his problem has taken leave on it's own, he finds himself hunted by the wretched creature. The Monster is seeking a companion, finding himself alone because of society's repulsion to his outward appearance. He proposes a solution to his creator. Create him a companion, or he will take the lives of Frankenstein's friends and family leaving him with the feelings of loneliness and isolation. The Doctor must now decide which horror is worse - to create another of these monsters or to risk the lives of himself and his loved ones.For years I was under the false impression that Frankenstein was the monster himself, not the creator. Further, after seeing brief parts of the movie with Robert De Niro, I had further misconceptions about the true story. But Mary Shelley's actual text is a story about human emotion, making difficult life and death choices, and emotional isolation and loneliness - the desire for true companionship.The difficulty with reading classics like this today is that the language is difficult to get through even for advanced readers. Writing style has evolved so much over the centuries and the old style is not to be faulted, but it does take dedication and patience for those not accustomed to it. Nonetheless, it is a story worth reading and the original deserves notoriety, more so that common and modern misconceptions."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley had a great idea for Frankenstein... creation vs. creator is always an interesting topic, but Frankenstein is as dull as it gets! I had to read this book for school and I could barely get through it- the plot goes nowhere, and important parts of the book, such as the creation of the 'monster' happen very quickly. I had expected to read a true classic, but after reading it, I suggest watching one of the many movie versions despite their differences from the book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"This book is truly worthy of the term \\"classic\\". Mary Shelley began writing this novel at the young age of 18, yet managed to create a landmark work of fiction. The story is interwoven with ever-present social and ethical questions. What does it mean to be human? What are the consequences of using scientific technology to play the role of Creator? How far is too far when tampering with the order of the universe?Upon my first reading of this book I was pleasantly surprised to find that the creature is very intelligent and human-like, though grotesque in appearance. It is a shame that the Frankenstein creature is universally represented in the minds of the public as an oafish and very dimwitted monster with bolts in its neck and a green pallor. The true Frankenstein is far more intriguing. I love the parts of the book that are a first person narrative by the \\"creature\\".I highly recommend this book as it is an enjoyable piece of classic literature. If you are a fan of horror, read this for an understanding of the early roots of the genre that you so love, and that those roots actually formed intellectual arguments and contained actual substance. This book is a must read for the well rounded reader. In fact, had I graduated from high school and never read this book, I would begin to question the quality of my own education."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"I nominated this for our book club.

I liked few books from the era especially horror types, and didn't look forward to 6 weeks worth of analyzing and research. My views were quickly changed. Perhaps it was because I was analyzing it so closely, but I found the book to be fascinating. Everything had a meaning to it, and it was easy to become attached to Dr. Frankenstein's creature.

I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially a senior trying to write his literary criticsm."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"When I closed the book after reading the final page, I looked back at the novel and came to the conclusion that I did not regret reading it. With all the cheap conceptions people have today about Frankenstein, it was great to read this and fully understand what Frankenstein was ORIGINALLY meant to be! I liked the novel, but I found it at times to carry on just a little too much. Chunks of the novel could have been cut without any significant damage to the plot. I found myself fed up somewhere in the middle of the novel because of this, but at the end I was satisfied."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is an interesting, enjoyable, and thought provoking novel, depicting the consequences of one immoral decision on the behalf of Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein is then faced with whether or not to create a second monster to appease the first, which has already killed his brother in his fury. This second decision, which he saw as a choice between his family and the human race, was what angered the originally kind-hearted creature and turned him to a path of evil and revenge. While the story of Frankenstein is commonly thought to involve an evil &quot;monster,&quot; I particularly liked that either the doctor or the creature (or both) could be seen as evil. Frankenstein had sought fame in the ability to bring one back from the dead but he never paused to consider the moral implications of his actions. Abandoning his creation, Victor saw only evil in his creature and, blaming him for the death of his brother, vowed revenge. Victor would not sympathize with the creature's hard life and refused to grant him one request that would end, or so he promised, his evil doings. Similarly, the creature entered the world with a good heart and had intentions only of helping others. He wanted nothing more than acceptance and love, but people were unable to see beyond his hideous appearance. After being shunned by the human race, the creature vowed revenge on the person who had cursed him with life, his creator. Once Frankenstein refused him a companion, and with it, any chance of happiness or love, the creature vowed to make Frankenstein pay for his selfishness. Mary Shelley's story is captivating and intriguing; it portrays the classic horror story plot in an enjoyable manner with emphasis on the issue of who is &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot;, and what the responsibilities of Frankenstein, as the creator should be to his monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Contrary to my original belief that Frankenstein was a generic monster story, I found Shelly's novel to be engrossing.

However, when he finally brought life to his creature, Frankenstein had no idea that his &quot;work of science,&quot; would eventually control his life. Shelly's novel breaks the boundaries set by dull science-fiction stories and enters a world of human nature, with love, vengeance, misery, anguish, and regret. The ending to this well written classic is just as enthralling as the first page, as the term &quot;mad scientist&quot; takes on a whole new meaning."},{"Title":"Frankenstein","review":"Contrary to my original belief that Frankenstein was a generic monster story, I found Shelly's novel to be engrossing.

But nevertheless, their paths soon crossed. Shunned and outcasted by humanity, Frankenstein's creature was left alone in the world with no one to interact with. The monster felt rejected and vowed to discover his creator. During this process, however, the monster came in contact with and killed Victor's younger brother William. Thus begins the unending series of murders that plague the life of Victor Frankenstein.After the creature's request for a female counterpart was granted by Frankenstein, it appeared to have been tamed. However, after agonizing over the morality of his decision, Frankenstein withdrew his promise and left his creation to fend for itself. Once this dark fate hit the creature, it turned towards REVENGE.

I prefer to view the work as an examination of the use of force. Not being particularly well read or skilled in military strategy, I will leave it to other reviewers to judge as to whether it succeeds as an exposition of method but I will say that it was a very interesting read.The Gun is, of course, the force. Dropped along a mountain road by a retreating army it is picked up by Spanish guerillas fighting against the French occupation of Spain and the later history of the Gun becomes the book. What is startlingly modern about this book is that it demonstrates conclusively that war requires the will to match forces. When one side is allowed to retain an advantage the fighting concludes. For some reason not quite explained, the French have been allowed uncontested possession of a fertile plain in the south of Spain. When guerillas manage to obtain this huge piece of artillery, figure out how to obtain ammunition, as well as how to move the thing, they promptly upset the balance of power by assaulting the hitherto untouchable French fortifications. Their efforts throw both sides into disarray. The Gun provides a focus to the Spanish attack as well as the necessary power to press the advantage. Instructively, the very existence and control of power, i.e. the weapon, is itself the source of further power--the allegiance of other irregulars who are emboldened by their newfound ability to succeed. The means whereby the Gun is brought to bear are thought-provoking and lead one to ponder on the usefulness of modern weaponry given the utter lack of societal will to bring any force to bear on the problems at hand. The will to fight with nuclear and chemical weapons (chemical weapons make a surprising and gruesome appearance in this work) is thankfully gone--but have we risked descending into a perpetual detente only to be nibbled continually at the edges by less-circumspect powers?Perhaps some readers find the denouement of the book somewhat unsettling. The ending is quite abrupt. But by the time you reach the end you realize that you have been exposed to various styles of leadership--some more successful than others, various kinds of battle--again with varying degrees of success, siegecraft, the use of artillery, etc. Forester is a gifted author--his narrative decisions are purposeful and directed towards an end that seems to be lost on many readers. In my opinion the author's purpose was to use this interesting episode in a very long conflict to invite debate on leadership styles and the very nature of war itself.I found the book fascinating and it has sparked a desire to read more military history as it is clear that as a country and people we Americans at least are continuing to place ourselves into situations that require an historical context in order to understand the value of the position. Absent a context in history, we risk being diverted from worthly goals by a cost that is misunderstood. Wars are fought for a reason that has not disappeared with the rise of modern technology. We cannot win merely by churning out fantastic weaponry--\\"The Gun\\" teaches that it is not enough to merely possess force, once must understand how best to press the advantage thereby created."},{"Title":"The Gun","review":"The tale of a large cannon that falls into the hands of Spanish Guerilla's during the Napoleonic war. This books provides great insight into the conditions during the Peninsular War. It is not a dry history and not your typical Forester book. It focuses on the cannon's impact on many people instead of one individual like the Hornblower series. I have enjoyed rereading this book several times over the years."},{"Title":"The Gun","review":"This is a much overlooked novel by the author. Most people are familiar with the Hornblower novels, but the author also wrote other novels set in the same time period including \\"Rifleman Dodd\\" and \\"The Gun.\\"I first read this novel many years ago, and the plot has stayed in my mind (the sign of a good novel). A large gun is acquired and moved with great difficulty to assault a fortress. Alas, the best made plans of mice and men... The story is in the attempt, rather than its success or failure."},{"Title":"The Gun","review":"I'm a huge C.S. Forester fan, so you will know where I'm coming from as I write this. If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would, but I shall round up. The only negative aspect of this short novel is the very thing that makes it quite unique; instead of having a compelling charector such as Hornblower, Captain Peabody or Rifleman Dodd, the central charactor is... you guessed it... a gun. I certainly did not find this story as compelling as some of his other works (since it is somewhat difficult for a gun to be compelling), but I did appreciate it as a different approach to the story of war. The story begins and ends with \\"the gun\\" and follows the many charactors whose lives revolve around it. If you like either C.S. Forester or War Stories in general, I highly recommend this tale.One interesting note; I just read this in the first edition published in America (right in the middle of WWII); it was great to have it compared to the Hornblower \\"Trilogy.\\" Even though I've always become sad when ending the Hornblower series, I am so grateful that Forester returned to write many more than the original \\"Trilogy.\\" C.S.

The prospective buyer must be aware that the translation of the title is misleading. This NOT a history of the conquest of Italy by Rome but a history of how after being conquested by Rome Italy became &quot;Romanized&quot;."},{"Title":"The Roman Conquest of Italy (Ancient World)","review":"The Roman Conquest of Italy is a purely academic look at the social, economic, and political factors that led to the Romanization of the Italian peninsula. There is little of conquest here. Jean-Michel David scrupulously avoids anything remotely resembling conquest in his quest to beat the reader about the head and shoulders with the recitation of place names and peoples, legalisms and legislators, governmental structures and the aristocrats who maneuvered within them. Even the second Punic War is employed merely as a backdrop to discuss the displacement of peoples and the subsequent land confiscation of victorious Rome. Lest you think that an act of confiscation might lend some excitement, David makes sure to drown it in ennui with stupefying legalistic effect.If there is a less intriguing side to any facet of Romanization, David finds it with unerring regularity. He seems to leap towards drudgery. Every single time I thought the book was about to pick up, David found a new professorial rat hole to climb down. Hellenism, the agent most responsible for melding the Italics into a whole, is discussed more as an aside than the powerful (and powerfully interesting) cultural force it had become. Additionally, the Social War and the civil wars which punctuated the manifestation of Roman empire are painstakingly avoided as well.I, long ago, experienced the college history profs who, smugly announcing that they don't do wars, dove straight into the most mindnumbingly pedantic archival material known to man. These are the people who, though apparently devoted to representing history, do it its greatest disservice. They literally suck the fun out of it. One of their kind wrote this book."},{"Title":"The Roman Conquest of Italy (Ancient World)","review":"This dry but fascinating book shows how and why ancient Rome transformed painfully from one city-state among many to hegemon and then capital of the Italian peninsula.The special and rare virtue of this book is that it examines the underlying causes and motivations that brought Rome first into conflict with its neighboring peoples, then, ultimately, into a state of mastery over them. More than other ancient-history books I've read, it gives a sense of Rome in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC as a society in process of change--changes which were as often as not forced on it. David shows how the evolution of the Roman Empire was neither smooth nor inevitable.He starts with an overview of the peoples of Italy, all different from each other, many of whom were still organized in rural village structures rather than as cities--from Gauls in the Po Valley to long-standing Greek colonies in the south. The most important shock to the system was the Second Punic War, when Rome was barely able to survive Hannibal's invasion of Italy in 218 BC. It was Hannibal's political shrewdness as much as his military prowess that enabled him to woo many Italian peoples to his side, forcing the Romans to take steps to secure their own alliances.Most of Italy was turned into a war-zone over the coming years, and this set in play forces that would lead to further unification and consolidation under Roman control when Hannibal was finally driven out.The dominance of Rome gradually placed pressure on other cities to gain influence there, and patron-client networks and commercial and military relationships gradually helped Italian aristocrats gain footholds in Roman society. In addition, the explosion of trade in the Eastern Mediterranean became a huge opportunity for Italians generally, and with their new wealth they were able to imbibe ever more Hellenistic culture, which Romans too were adopting as the mark of a sophisticated elite.Eventually the Italians were able to wrest citizenship from a reluctant Rome in an ancient version of \\"no taxation without representation\\". The subject states had become full members of a new geographical state.Other reviewers have expressed disappointment that there is not much \\"conquest\\" in this book. It's true that this book is not an account of battles; those can be found in many places. It is looking at underlying causal factors: social, economic, cultural, political. It looks at the various players, the groups involved, and sees competing interests and the ad hoc lurches toward unification that resulted.The book is admirably brief, but the prose is actually rather dry and wordy. My guess is that the original French is probably quite academic, and the translation retains or even augments some awkwardness of the writing.Nonetheless, I found the book to be unique, interesting, and insightful--an excellent part of a well-rounded library on ancient Rome."},{"Title":"The Roman Conquest of Italy (Ancient World)","review":"This book is only 218 pages long yet holds a lot of information.

There is a Sufi story about moths, and the only moth that really understands the candle is the one who gives himself totally to the light, and the light gives itself to him. This applies to shamanic work. Shamanic techniques work from the larger self, especially in service to others. Shamanism means working with the subconscious, and at times superconscious minds. It cannot be apprehended by the conscious mind, the ego.

Mircea Eliade and all of his work is a product of its time. While 'incorrect' and relying on bad data (due primarily to his armchair anthropology and bad translations), Eliade sought to prove the existence of a universal religious at a time when humanity had all but lost its faith in goodness.This is certainly not one of my favorite pieces by Eliade as it is one of the least poetic (and, after all, Eliade's enterprise was admittedly poetic). If you are looking for a good introduction to Eliade's overarching theory, I encourage readers to consult his \\"The Sacred and the Profane\\" (a shorter version of \\"Patterns in Comparative Religion\\"). Eliade boldly asserted that all humanity is religious. Unfortunately, his route for achieving that conclusion was flawed."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"This massive volume is THE work on Shamanism that everyone interested in these studies should have on his or her shelf.

It's a fascinating and in-depth look at Shamanism, mysticism and ancient spiritual practices. As a reference, it's indispensable."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"Steven B. Herrmann, PhD, MFTAuthor of \\"Walt Whitman: Shamanism, Spiritual Democracy, and the World Soul.\\"This is, without doubt, the classic textbook on shamanism. As Eliade clearly points out, the history of religious ideas distinguishes between three categories or types of initiation to mark the transition from childhood to adolescence. The first type of initiation, he asserts, is \\"obligatory\\": the \\"puberty rite,\\" or \\"initiation into an age group.\\" The second initiation-type leads to incorporation into a \\"secret society.\\" The third, initiation-type has to do with the vocation of the \\"medicine man,\\" medicine woman or \\"shaman,\\" the most intense form of initiation known to man, and this level, he says, is not typically available to the rest of the human community (1958, 3). Moreover, the pre-ecstatic euphoria of the shaman constitutes the universal source of \\"lyric poetry\\" and provides the spiritual inspiration for the mystics of the East and West. The experience of Ecstasy often leads the shaman to song, a secret language, from which the allegorical words of the mystics and prophets of all cultures later crystallized (Shamanism, 511). What distinguishes shamanic initiation from the \\"lesser\\" initiation-types, Eliade asserts, is the emotion of Ecstasy. In this work Eliade is in a category of his own, with what would appear, from what I have read, to be few if any real competitors. I have read this book several times and each time I read it, I learn more and more. He illuminates the pattern of initiation at its most fundamental level. This is no leisurely read. It is scholarly and informs many sources. Many of the best works on shamanism, in the second half of the twentieth century, have drawn on this book as their central inspiration. Not all of the data from Siberia, India, the Far East, Polynesia, Europe, and Central and North America, is developed theoretically and could indeed be taken further, as many of his ideas have. Take for example what Eliade has to say about \\"quartz crystals,\\" or \\"spirit possession,\\" or this nugget from his \\"Epilogue,\\" where he ends by saying that \\"shamans have played an essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community,\\" and adds that they are \\"preeminently the antidemonic champions; they combat not only disease, but also the black magicians\\" (508). All of these passages can be amplified and extended in a psychological, spiritual, or sociological direction to explain what takes place in culture and in the culture of depth-psychology and individual analysis. Anyone interested in shamanism would be wise to begin here. Many of C. G. Jung's late comments on shamanism were taken from this source. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I keep it on my writing desk as a companion."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"This is a scholarly work that seeks to illuminate the role of the shaman. Since it draws from secondary accounts, it does not seek to portray the actual experience. Rather, it is concerned with defining what shamanism is, its historical significance, and its influence around the world. The precision of language used here to describe various aspects of the subject matter tend to make the book weighty and tiresome. But the payoff for the student of the history of religion is big. It is fascinating to consider how shamanism - developed in the primitive setting of hunter-gatherers - has influenced today's religions around the world.The phenomenon of shamanism derives from an archaic world view that has a limited knowledge of the workings of the physical world, but such a knowledge is not of significance here. The shaman's journey is the journey of the soul, breaking beyond the confines of the physical world and entering by means of the cosmic tree or the cosmic mountain (symbols of the center of the world) the celestial regions or, less frequently, the lower regions. To make this transition or flight, the shaman employs techniques of ecstasy, which usually involves drumming and a trancelike state. In the Arctic, where shamanism has been most prominent and the most durable due to the extreme physical conditions, the use of ecstatic techniques have been seen to be the most effective. The purpose is to communicate with spirits in order to cure people of illness, create favorable conditions for hunting, or retrieve lost souls. One of the defining characteristics is the mastery of fire: the ability not to be affected by heat or cold.Now the sceptic or materialist might well think, especially after hearing what seem like tall tales, that the shaman is just some whacked-out neurotic, who uses the threat of the supernatural to advantage. But consider the fact that in order to become a shaman a crisis must first be faced. Some sickness or illness such as epilepsy causes the would-be shaman considerable distress. In dealing with the crisis, the candidate undergoes an initiation process under the auspices of a master shaman, and only succeeds if he or she is able to control his condition. As a result of the ordeal, the shaman is significantly healthier and more physically fit than an average person and also has greater mental acuity. And, the very act of shamanizing is needed in order to maintain that physical and mental health.Of particular interest is how shamanism was assimilated into emerging civilizations both East and West. The author does not broadly speculate, but compares specific characteristics. It does seem clear that shamanism has had a very strong influence on the asceticism of India and even more of an influence on the religious tradition of Tibet and on Taoism in China. In the West, shamanic influences are not as strong. The Indo-Europeans, when they migrated south through Greece and the Aegean and then spread through the Near East, came into contact with an agrarian, socialized people, who were under the spell of a priest rather than a shaman."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"Based on my own intellectual interest, I was drawn to this particular book and was quite intrigued with the information that was presented forward to the reader.

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they all think that they are interesting people and therefore spend no time learning about new things or thinking about new ways to make themselves interesting to others. It's not like everyone has to be interesting: I don't expect a gas station attendant to engage me in sparkling conversation, but it seems that if one is going to create art/culture that this person would go out of their way to learn about new things, try new experiences, etc. Such is clearly NOT the case, here in San Diego, or anywhere else, for that matter. The indie music world often seems about as interesting to me as junior high. I don't have any truck with the social world of junior high, with it's cliques and posturing, but, simply put, it's a boring world. It's the same thing with the indie music world: Like junior high, but with bands.I was super excited to read Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy after seeing the citation in the Shape of Ancient Thought. I was even more excited when I realized that Wendy Doniger, my favorite scholar/professor, was mentored by this guy (Mircea Eliade is a Romanian, and a man, not a chick.) Shamanism was originally published in English (from the French) in 1951, but the book I have is a 2004 re-print with a new foreword by Doniger. Eliade's scholarship is a leetle out of date 50 years on, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this book was the first comprehensive approach to Shamanism that treated it as something other then a \\"degraded\\" \\"uncivilized\\" object of scorn. In fact, Shamanism appears to be the basis of all religious thought everywhere, showing up not only in the civilized religions of the Near East, West and East, but also in the indigenious peoples of Australia, New Guinea, Polynesia and North and South American. Shamanism is the closest things humans have to a \\"universal\\" religion prior to the emergence of the great world religions of Christianity, Islam and Buddhism (sorry Hindus!!!!)So what is Shamanism? Eliade defines Shamanism as religious practice governed by the reaching of non-conscious ecstatic states by the Shaman. During this state, the Shaman travels to the sky or the underworld and rescues the souls of the sick/ill etc. That is Shamanism in a nut shell, but it's the description of the ritual ascents and descents that I found most interesting. I don't want to spoil the joys of the world tree, the soul egg and the bridge for those who might actually read this book, but suffice it to say that Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy, contains enough food for thought to keep the reader thinking for months.

I cannot stress to you enough how thoroughly Eliade manages to cover the subject. A good portion of the book focuses on the Shamanic traditions of Siberia and Central Asia, the heartlands of Shamanism. Amongst the Mongols, Yakut, Chuckchi, Saami (Lapps) and other people of that region Shamanism was first observed, and is stil practiced today in many regions. Eliade goes into great depth about the beliefs and symbolism, about the clothing and ornamentation, about the meaning of ritual tools and amulets and much more. Everything from the axis mundi to ecstasy and trance states to helper spirits to Shamanic ideas of death and illness is covered in superb detail. But Eliade goes far beyond a simple survey of Shamanic beliefs and practices, almost literally taking you into the world of the Shaman. After reading this book, you will understand the Shamanic mindset and world view far more than you ever thought. And, as I said, Eliade goes far beyond the traditional forms of Shamanism in Siberia and Central Asia. In this encyclopedic work, Eliade explores the Shamanic traditions of the Americas (North and South), Australia, Indonesia, Oceania, Tibet, China and beyond. Even the Shamanic traditions of the ancient Indo-Euorpeans, such as the Greek myth of Orpheus, Persian views of the after world and the Germanic God Odin, are given treatment. This book is very lengthy, well written, extensivily bibliographed and filled with detailed accounts and accurate information on virtually all facets of Shamanism. I cannot recommend this book enough. Even after all these years, \\"Shamanism\\" remains perhaps the definitive book on Shamanic beliefs and thought. To truely understand Shamanism and its role in Siberia/Central Asia, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"I agree whole-heartedly with the many earlier reviewers who have praised this extraordinary book. However, it has given rise to some controversies, and prospective purchasers might as well be aware of them. Given the richness of the volume, I consider them minor, but a chorus of praise invites disappointment.First of all, the original French edition was in 1951 (and was one of the author's post-war works apparently not written in his native Romanian). The revised and updated English translation (the fine work of Willard Trask) first appeared in the Bollingen series in 1964. Princeton University Press issued the Bollingen edition in paperback in 1972, and this appears to be the version currently in print. Hence, it is, obviously, more than a little out of date bibliographically. Some people are troubled by this, but there is no way the book could have been expanded to deal with the explosion of research and publications which followed its appearance (although about two hundred titles, mainly post-1948, were added to the 1964 bibliography and notes). Just be aware that it may not mention something important.[Since this review was originally posted, the MYTHOS edition for which it was written has been replaced by a new Princeton printing (January 2004), with a preface by Wendy Doniger, describing the book's importance and limitations with clarity and considerable authority. (She is the Mircea Eliade Distingiushed Service Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago.)]Also because of the book's age, Eliade still used terms and ideas which were common in European scholarship in the first half of the century, but have been largely abandoned since, and in some cases never made much of an impression on the English-speaking scholarly world. He takes for granted the ancient Babylonian origin of several ideas about the cosmos, some of which the \\"Pan-Babylonian\\" school seems to have been reading into ancient texts. This has some importance for his attempts to trace the diffusion and relative ages of certain ideas. He also uses (and doesn't really define) cultural descriptions like \\"Palaeo-Arctic\\" which originated in anthropological theories current in the 1920s. This is where the age of the book really is important to keep in mind.Of more importance are some of his working assumptions about the nature of Shamanism. Correctly observing that the word entered western European languages from Russian, which had borrowed it from Siberian tribes, he tends to regard the reindeer-herders of the Eurasian sub-Arctic as the model of \\"true\\" shamanism, in relation to which other, similar, phenomena, are to be classed. This is reasonable, but, as he sometimes suggests, the Siberian forms have a complex history of their own, and cannot be taken as primitive. It should also be kept in mind than the assumption that reindeer herding was an early precursor of full domestication has been challenged. If it is a secondary imitation of southern pastoral systems, the pristinely archaic nature of the cultures based on it cannot be taken for granted, and their internal history is not independent either.Because many Siberian forms involve elaborate physical (and sometimes verbal) gymnastics, culminating in a trance state, while others consist only in a trance state, often chemically induced, he treats the latter as secondary (and \\"degenerate\\") offshoots. It is easier to see the difficult and complex form being simplified than it is to see a pure trance developing into a demanding theatrical display, but it is not demonstrable. However, Eliade did not intend it as a contribution to later debates over psychedelic drugs, even if it has been read as such. (Eliade doesn't help matters by citing as corroboration for his view the widespread claim that in the \\"good old days\\" shamans didn't just dance their flights to the otherworld, they were seen flying through the air!) A very different view is suggested Gordon Wasson's studies of the Vedic Soma, which he relates to the use of fly agaric mushrooms as an intoxicant by the reindeer-herders Eliade invokes for the opposite purpose. In I.M. Lewis' several studies of ecstatic religions he rather brusquely dismisses Eliade's position; one would have hoped for a fuller response.Finally, Eliade treats out-of-body experiences (\\"Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy\\") as definitive of shamanism, and spirit-possession as a side issue. However, possession experiences do seem to be central in several cultures which are commonly described as shamanist, and the distinction may be more important to Eliade's need to limit the material than to anything else.I would also add that Eliade's copious material on shamanic initiation experiences bears a striking resemblance to some accounts of extra-terrestrial abductions and medical experiments. How did Fox Mulder miss this?"},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"Mircea Eliade's foundational work 'Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy' is a massive 648 page resource work that was first published in '51. Now some fifty-five years later it's still the authoritative reference work on the history, beliefs and practices of shamanic cultures.By the way, just in case you were initially attracted by the subtitle 'Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy' let me warn you, it's not that kind of book. Or if you're looking for some entertaining reading the likes of Carlos Castaneda filled with vivid, exotic first-hand accounts of interaction with the spirits you'll be disappointed. This is a scholarly reference work designed for serious students in sociology, anthropology, psychology and the history of religion.

It deserves its reputation.Shamanism is mostly comparative anthropology, describing shamanistic systems from all over the world and relating them to what Eliade considers to be the paradigmatic type, namely, Siberian shamanism.The shamanic universals are of considerable interest in themselves, not just as evidence of some ancient pan-cultural Ur-religion (although as such they also make interesting thought-fodder). They include initiation experiences (almost always involving the oneiric dismemberment of the shaman by demons), a history of self-healing (frequently the young shaman must and does cure himself of epilepsy or some other such condition), equipment and regalia used, beliefs about the nature and structure of the spirit world, and the claim by twentieth-century practitioners that a few generations back some catastrophe caused a degeneration in the powers shamans are able to command.The portrait Eliade evokes of the practicing shaman is fascinating, but I have to admit that I read this book as much for insight into the interaction between the human brain and mind as for anthropology. Admittedly dry at times, Shamanism more than repays the effort required to take it in."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"As with everything Mircea Eliade wrote, &quot;Shamanism&quot; is a model of a form of scholarship that has all but disappeared in current religious studies. He combines exhaustive thoroughness and faultless analysis, with the sincerest respect for his subject. There is no hint of reductionism, neither of the tiresome and sophomoric urge to subordinate religion to some other discipline (e.g., science or politics). Eliade is as high-minded as he is pains-taking, a very rare combination. Ultimately, I cannot agree with him on his characterization of what shamanic ecstasy is in practice, but no other book influenced me so much in my own work on myth and shamanism, unless it was Eliade's other magisterial landmark work on Yoga."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"Mircea Eliade, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (Princeton, 1951)I didn't keep count of how many times during this survey Eliade says he's just touching on the very surface of the scholarship of a given topic, or that in the limited space provided, he can only manage the barest mention of something. Eliade's \\"few comments\\" (p. 511) and fifty plus pages of bibliography, if he is to be believed, are a quick overview on shamanism as it has been practiced for the past two and a half millenia, covering six of the seven continents and thousands of years.Shamanism is a survey, not a new work; Eliade, here, only attempts to distill what he and others have written in the past, to give the prospective student or researcher an idea of where to begin on a specific topic. As such, the book may not be meant to be read all the way through. Taken as a whole, however, it's an interesting and thought-provoking document about not only shamaism, but many deeper issues; the migration of man over two and a half thousand years, cultural \\"degeneration\\" (Eliade's word), the Judeo-Christian tradition and its heavy borrowing from religions that pre-dated it, etc. While Eliade's writing is often thick, it's certainly understandable by the layman, as always (one of the things which made Eliade a consistently popular and well-read anthropologist). It requires a leisurely pace and a good deal of reflection, but is ultimately worth the time (in my case, five and a half months) it takes to finish."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"He didn't really understand that the shaman works less with ritual than with transpersonal power, nor was he right in saying that the shaman always uses &quot;ecstatic&quot; levels of consciousness. Even so, this book remains THE outstanding classic in the history of shamanic studies. Reading it really gives one the sense of shamanism's crosscultural and worldwide validity....and its crucial differences from the bastardized workshop variety so popular just now in America."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"..not entirely satisfying any more. The positive side is that Eliade has compiled a vast amount of documents (in numerous Indo-European languages (and some others, like Hungarian, for instance)) and crammed them into an erudite &quot;essential reference&quot; magisterial study (even just footnotes make one's mind boggle). Also, he has set the pattern of the shamans-masters-of-ecstasy tautology &amp; cleared the poor &quot;ecstatics&quot; of the insanity charge.What I find the most fascinating are two short passages that a casual reader is most likely to slip by &amp; not perceive at all:a) the Hermetic Ptolemaic cosmos of seven spheres, the foundation of virtually all &quot;high&quot; traditional esoteric doctrines, and probably originating in the Sumero-Mesopotamian milieu before circa 5000 years, is recorded as the Weltanschauung of Siberian shamans. So, not only a &quot;primitive&quot; three-worlds division (heaven, earth, underworld), but the elaborate scheme that had been abandoned only after the 17th/18th cent. scientific revolution &amp; the Enlightenment.b) one passage contains, almost word-by-word, authentic &quot;indigenous&quot; (at least, I suppose it is) variant of the Lord's Prayer/Paternoster. A Q.E.D. of universality of religious experience and human condition.On the other hand, the material is not systematically organized. Eliade has not set forth a clear and succinct blueprint (or abstract) of shamanic psychology, cosmography and/or cosmogony (or, cosmogonies, juxtaposed on various culture &amp; geographical areas). This book literally calls out for maps and tables of correspondences that would enclose a wealth of info in archaic psychologies &amp; mythogeneses into an articulate &amp; illuminating scheme. As it is, I'm left with the impression of chaotic profusion &amp; suspicion that the author got lost in a maze fascinating material, having never fully mastered &amp; elucidated crucial paradigmata of his scholarly quest. In sum- erudite &amp; detailed, but not systematic &amp; explanatory."},{"Title":"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy","review":"Eliade's work, which I first read at university, achieves something quite unique - it's completely scholarly, and yet never loses its deep sense of respect for, or awareness of, its core topic - the search for the divine in earlier cultures, from the Australian aborigines to the Eskimos. Indeed, Eliade's survey reveals the remarkable world-wide commonality of the major Shamanic traditions - death/resurrection within 3 days of initiation, mastery of fire, descent into the underworld to save the dead, and magical flight/teleportation (all shades of the Jesus story?!). In its humanity and understanding, it matches Geza Vermes' \\"Jesus the Jew\\", which explores the multiplicity of revelatory traditions in the biblical Holy Land. Both books enhance the majesty and importance of their central subjects by demonstrating in the most scholarly fashion that nothing profound or sacred springs from a vacuum. \\"Shamanism\\" is a treasure trove of ancient oral esoterica that one can re-open at any time, like a bibliomancer, and find new wonders on any randomly selected page."},{"Title":"A History of Celibacy: From Athena to Elizabeth I, Leonardo da Vinci, Florence Nightingale, Gandhi, and Cher","review":"Despite getting bogged down in various minutae in regards to different religious sects, this book is an entertaining and informative read. The author adroitly links the cultural mores of societies across the earth, and analyzes the reasons for celibacy or eternal virginity among different religions and cultures. She also, interestingly enough, emphasizes the practical nature of celibacy, and the role it plays in today's sex-driven culture.

From china to native americans, ancient greeks to today, Elizabeth Abbott introduces the reader to a world populated by eunuchs, transvestite nuns, tormented ascetics, empowered virgins and AIDS-weary homosexuals. Abbott's wit and wry sense of humor makes this scholarly research a joy to read. I feel more knowledgble of both my own and other cultures view on sex, the close relationship between religion and sex, and how centuries of sexual principles affects many of todays issues concerning homosexulality, teenage pregnancy, pedophile priests, etc...A must read for the curious."},{"Title":"A History of Celibacy: From Athena to Elizabeth I, Leonardo da Vinci, Florence Nightingale, Gandhi, and Cher","review":"It's hard to imagine two words that could do more to kill a book's sales than &quot;history&quot; and &quot;celibacy&quot; (&quot;algebra&quot; and &quot;asphyxia,&quot; perhaps). Nevertheless, A History of Celibacy has proven a huge best-seller in Canada (if that counts), giving South Park fans one more reason to hoot in derision at their northern neighbors.Toronto historian Elizabeth Abbott traces religious celibacy in exhaustive detail from Athena and the vestal virgins of pagan Rome to the Catholic obsession with virginity and the role of self-denial in the Buddhist and Hindu faiths. If the reader can get past Abbott's sociology-textbook prose in these first 200 pages, the book picks up considerably in the second half as she turns her attention to celibacy in the secular world. Abbott pokes fun at the Male Purity Movement of the 19th century and the scientifically unproven link between abstinence and improved athletic performance, but she appears completely sympathetic with female celibacy to transcend traditional gender roles (the section on Elizabeth I is particularly poignant).Under Abbott's double standard, women in secular society give up sex for career or country (Joan of Arc, Florence Nightingale, Rachel Carson), whereas men abstain because they are repressed homosexuals, incurable pedophiles or superstitious jocks (Leonardo da Vinci, Lewis Carroll, Muhammad Ali). Equally discomfiting is Abbott's account of her own conversion to celibacy: &quot;Much as I once reveled in sexual indulgence...I am immensely relieved that someone else's domestic demands no longer dominate my daily agenda.&quot; Yeah, love stinks."},{"Title":"A History of Celibacy: From Athena to Elizabeth I, Leonardo da Vinci, Florence Nightingale, Gandhi, and Cher","review":"It's a bit hard to take her discussion of the Shakers seriously considering she does not consult the scholarly work of Louis J. Kern. His penetrating insights would have illuminated this portion of her book further. Otherwise, this book does give the reader a sense of why one would become celibate in a certain place and at a certain time."},{"Title":"A History of Celibacy: From Athena to Elizabeth I, Leonardo da Vinci, Florence Nightingale, Gandhi, and Cher","review":"_A History of Celibacy_ by Elizabeth Abbott (no irony here, as an Abbott is in charge of a monastery) is a huge overview of what hasn't been going on in human history. In keeping with the collective schizophrenia of our times, the cover has a picture of a curvaceous woman&#65533;s naked back rather than a more appropriate image such as the Virgin Mary or St. Augustine.Celibacy, defined by Abbott for the sake of her study, is abstinence from sexual activity. The technical meaning of celibacy is simply not being married, although the word usually designates \\"not engaging in sex.\\" The foremost proponent of celibacy is of course religion, in particular Catholic and Orthodox Christianity, although celibate traditions existed in pagan Mesopotamia, Greece and Rome as well. The Gospels never mention Jesus as being intimate with a woman and the early Church practiced a discipline of celibacy, following the example of St. Paul. Other saints followed in the tradition including St. Anthony the Great (Father of Monks), St. Benedict, St. Jerome and of course, the sexual revolutionist's archenemy, St. Augustine. The monks of the Christian East were more radically ascetic, \\"anti-Church\\" and individualistic than their communal Western counterparts. Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism had many sects and movements that practiced celibacy for one reason or another as a mystical, ascetic practice. The most otherworldly group, the Jains, believe that celibacy is absolutely to achieve \\"nirvana\\" or \\"moksha.\\" Conversely, Judaism and Islam do not have celibate traditions. Later Christianity is examined, where the Roman Catholic Church made celibacy a requirement for its entire clergy. Cults arose in the United States, such as the Shakers and Father Divine's group, which preached unorthodox versions of Christianity and required celibacy of their communal members.Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci and many other secular figures practiced celibacy in their lives for a variety of reasons. The book describes some unsavory forms of celibacy have been imposed, like that of castrati, prisoners and girls forced to join convents in the Middle Ages. Others are pathological like sufferers of eating disorders. Oddly enough, medical myths of semen conservation that have nothing to do with religious beliefs or social factors have promoted celibacy as well. This was behind some of the Greek stoic philosophers and the anti-masturbation scare and general prudery of the Victorian era. Abbott herself promotes celibacy today as New Age self-esteem measures and to prevent the spread of STDs like AIDS._A History of Celibacy_ represents a familiar feminist anti-Christian bias. If men practice celibacy it is either because of repressed homosexuality, fear of women or psychological hang-ups. Female celibates (unless they are forced into it unwillingly by \\"the Patriarchy\\") do so because it is liberating them from male dominance. Radical feminists promote the \\"gay-rights\\" agenda but suspiciously do not like traditional monasticism, although both amount to \\"biological suicide\\" in worldly terms and leave the sexual use of women behind. The difference is that homosexuality is worldly, but monasticism is not. It seems that feminists would rather have men imitating the stereotypically worst aspects of women. They feel threatened by the otherworldly male ascetics who transcend the world and cannot be manipulated by the desires of the flesh, which is the only fuel behind the feminist program. Abbott's non-mystical celibacy is one of social forbearance, not rocking the boat by spreading STDs, ruining self-esteem, and causing unwanted pregnancies. It is also for New Age gurus and feminists who basically want to tear down Western civilization at the end of the day as well. However, she does have a point when criticizing the current status of the priesthood in the Roman Catholic Church. The early Church did have married priests (and even some Bishops), as does the Orthodox Church today. The Catholic Church's clerical celibacy requirement is in fact a break from earlier Christian tradition."},{"Title":"Drive It Forever: Secrets to Long Automobile Life","review":"This book has some useful information, but it is very basic, generally common sense advice. The advice of this book can be summed up in 1 sentence; Change your oil and fluids often and don't drive a lot of short trips. Some of the advice is simply incorrect and reflects a reliance on folklore instead of hard data. Sikorsky is also apparently a bigger sucker than the FTC, giving ringing endorsements of products such as Slick 50 and &quot;The Force&quot; that have not been proven to be effective (The FTC made Slick 50 stop advertising its unproven claims of engine protection).

The best section is on the four causes of engine deterioration. On the down side, there is too much discussion of carburetors, and the two product plugs seem unprofessional, especially since one of them is for a product made by the publisher of the copy I purchased, ATG.

Or if you're shopping at a mall, and you start your caar to drive from one store to another, you just added 500 miles of wear to the engine. OK, let's see...I've had my car for about 4 years. That means I've started it in the garage at least 265 times. That's 530,000 miles right off the bat. Now add to that all the other starts I've made after parking somewhere, and the amount of engine wear incurred easily comes to over 1,000,000 miles. The odometer reads about 96,500 miles. So over the 4 years I've owned the car, I've put at least 1,096,500 miles of wear on the engine. Makes sense, right? And since I expect to do a minimum of another 153,500 over the next 6 years or so, that's another 76,750,000, plus another 2,000,000 miles from shopping, visiting friends, etc. comes to about 79,000,000 miles of engine wear.

They are the most ferocious test of the human spirit, a contemporary apocalyptic vision. One could hardly imagine any sort of wilderness connected to it, but Ken Lamberton not only finds the wilderness in the prison but makes us believe that it can be anywhere.Lamberton is a tragic figure. An award-winning biology teacher shortly before he ran away with an underage student, he writes from a prison in an Arizona desert. Exquisite sketches accompany his beautifully written, yet never flighty, essays. There is just the right mix of physical description and the spirit behind the wildlife to make it worth reading as nature writing alone. But more than that is the unique frame from which he writes: the concrete walls, the wire fences, the harsh company of inmates and guards. Desperation pervades his words, yet even as he lays bare his soul to reveal this to us, he also shows us the spirit and connectedness that is possible from even the meanest of situations.What is life really about? Prison has taught Lamberton important lessons that he transmits to us. After the extraneous is culled out, the wilderness without and the wilderness within, and the relationships in life, are all that truly matter. And yet the simplicity is deceptive, for there are infinite worlds of detail, and infinite heights and depths of emotion, in the wilderness, and in its violation. Lamberton's crime and his passion for the wilderness intertwine so well, that one can imagine one's own life-triumphs and tragedies all-portrayed, in metaphor, in the wild."},{"Title":"Wilderness and Razor Wire","review":"Early reviews dwelled on the fact that Ken Lamberton has written this book from prison. Obviously his incarceration has provided him with an observation point that is foreign to most of us.But, in my view, the quality of his writing has yet to be given its due.

I wound up reading it twice. The perspective is unique and the insights are thoughtful.As a transplanted Arizonan the descriptions of the desert of southern Arizona brought back wonderful memories for me as did the tremendous illustrations.As we get pushed further from nature this book is a wonderful reminder that even in the harshest most 'un-natural' environments we are never very far from the wild wonderfull natural world - we just sometimes have to look a little harder."},{"Title":"Wilderness and Razor Wire","review":"Ken Lamberton, also referred to Mr. Lamberton to many thirty-somethings in Arizona, was caught for doing something many other instructors have done before and will do again.

This book is perhaps more meaningful to those of us who actually sat under him as students and still respect him in adulthood. Reading this book brought back many memories of basic science lessons where Mr. Lamberton actually took us out of the classroom and into real nature. He has us imagine and look at nature in a different way - a more appreciative way.

Written during the author's twelve years of incaceration in the Arizona State Prison, the essays in this book focus the eye and the ear, sense of scent and touch, on the fragile bits of wildness which entered prison cell and corridor, walkway and window. The heat of the desert, the gaze of the owl, the aroma of spring's bounty of flowers in a barren place, inside a landscape seen as barren, but isn't, are beautiful, and defiant.

The experience took place in the southern desert of Utah. I learned to love and appreciate the desert. Ken has the words and the artistry to describe many of the things that I felt and experienced from participating in that Wilderness.I also have a fascination for the prison system and how it changes a person's life. As Ken pointed out, prison certainly cannot be defined as rehabilitation. I like how he described the issue of doing time and how it weighed so heavily on his soul. He used his education and knowledge of the environment to lighten the burden of being in prison for 12 years. It was his escape and through his words he allowed us to escape with him."},{"Title":"Wilderness and Razor Wire","review":"Lamberton's book, a literary work indeed! I am fishing for a word to describe it and the emotion it conveyed to me, but I cannot find a good word. It is a book filled with beauty and brokenness, arrogance and repentance, reel love and real love. It really is a story of the human condition, trying to walk a ridge line and not falling into the abyss. Some of us fall into the abyss due to our own stupidity and get caught up in all kinds of trouble for violating some cultural rules scripted as law. (Had Ken been in Kenya among the Luo people, the age of 14 is just right for marrying and he could have had as many wives as he could afford.) Others fall into the abyss due to illness which can be equally devastating. Still others would rather take their life on the ridge line before falling.When someone takes a serous fall and survives it may take years for them to recover and all too often those who witness the fall are not there at the time of recovery. Karen, Ken's wife, was always there. An impressive part of this book is the story of a remarkable wife with her three children, committed to an intellegent man. She believed her love would return and again light up her life!"},{"Title":"Wilderness and Razor Wire","review":"I read this book for a class. It was interesting. You could tell that he wasn't a professional writer but tying the nature to the prison was interesting. His crime sort of bothers you in the beginning but, you get over it.

Ken's book allowed me to regain some of the senses and feelings that I experienced while living in a world that has such a lack of appreciation. He certainly has an artistry for words that captured many of the experiences and emotions that were mine during those 28 days. I also have a fascination for the penal system and the affect that it has on a person. Ken validated how it is definitely not a place for rehabilitation but a place where time weighs on a person so heavily.

That's a reasonable trade-off. you may not want it as your sole dictionary though. I also would've liked sentences that do appear to have made the key word more visible, perhaps bolded. As it is, you read the sentence and then forget what word you're looking to see in use.Strengths include, a guide to inflection. It helps a little but, you would need a japanese person to confirm your efforts (which, sadly, i don't have).A bit of advise, get used to speaking quickly. Though you get the inflections, your first tries will sound awkward and wrong. It's because you're speaking too slowly. My epiphany ladies and gentlemen.Also, English manner of speaking is considered. For example, certain words are expanded on, like \\"more.\\" It shows that there are different translations for when you want to say \\"I have more than you\\" and \\"would you like some more tea\\". The core meanings of the word, which all entries have and are paranthesized (&lt;- did i make this word up?) next to the entry \\"more\\", clearly distingish the two - the first meaning \\"greater in number, etc\\" and the second meaning \\"additional.\\" Another good example is for the entry \\"tough.\\"There are these bonus like sections at the ends of the book. I found one just now on Demonstratives, that helps systemize japanese in my mind a bit more. It says there are 4 categories of them, each intended by using a different prefix. Three of which indicate the spacial relations of the listener and speaker and objects (over here, right there!, this, that, etc).The final category is for question words (where?, how?, what the...? etc).Most of the time the translations of words are given by a japanese phrase. Expect this. Its NOT a sturdy, well-built book. Pages fall out if you're kind of rough with your book. Take it with you and leave your primary dictionary at home."},{"Title":"Harper Collins Shubun Pocket English-Japanese Dictionary","review":"When it comes to wanting to express something I say in English in Japanese and making myself understood, I have had more luck with this book than any other.

I now have several others that I like better, but on a whole this is a good pocket sized edition. The biggest complaint that comes to mind is the binding. It wears out very quickly if you're frequently using it for travel or study, which is what I was hoping to use it for."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"As a colleague and friend of Robert Calderisi, I looked forward to this book. He has written a skillful and comprehensive account of the issues, people, politics and economics of post-Independence Africa, from his vantage point of several assignments in various parts of the continent. He weaves his personal experiences with the African people and their leaders with carefully selected historical background needed to understand why things were bound to happen as they did. This book is hard to put down, and the human and political stories and the economics are told with care, and with humor. He was there, you are, too.There is more than enough blame to go around, and Calderisi presents a balanced and, at times, embarrassing account of the excesses on all sides: the elites running these countries, the donors who came to help, and, in the chapter on the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, the foreign investors who sought alliances in the name of profit. His abiding respect and admiration for Africans comes through loud and clear, as does his distaste for their self-absorbed and often kleptocratic leaders. His recommendations for how Africans themselves must turn things around appear bolted to his readable and, very often, entertaining text, but they will stimulate the thoughtful aid practitioner or friend of Africa to think about how that might take place.While Calderisi's book will not satisfy the reader seeking deep history (try Guy Arnold's impressive new \\"Africa: A modern history\\") rigorous economics, a call to arms (Jeff Sachs tried that in his \\"The end of poverty\\") or blame-mongering against NGOs, donors and corrupt elites, it is an excellent introduction to why Africa is the way it is, and why it deserves our help as the development challenge of the early 21st century."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"Calderisi states early on that this book is \\"a personal essay.\\" That turns out to be code for \\"This doesn't have to be particularly coherent, nor do I have to back up my recommendations with systematic evidence.\\" Finally, the writing is not particularly inviting, with lines like, \\"unlike photographs, economies cannot be developed in a dark room\\" (p. 171) or \\"Africa has been in my blood since the age of fifteen\\" (p. 35).However, Amartya Sen once wrote that \\"there is a strong case for judging a book by its best contributions, not its weakest points.\\" [1] Calderisi worked for the World Bank in Africa for many years: he has many interesting stories and a great deal of perspective. He gives the World Bank's perspective on the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, the now notorious Structural Adjustment Programs of the 1980s, and many more personal stories. While there is certainly more to these stories than the Bank's perspective, understanding the Bank's reasoning is insightful.In addition to these stories and perspectives, the author makes ten recommendations, many of them unfortunately unsupported by the body of the book. Most of the recommendations seem sensible (as do many recommendations that haven't worked, as William Easterly has indicated [2]), but Calderisi gives no detail as to how one would implement them nor does he successfully build up to them. I may not be confident that Jeffrey Sachs's plan [3] would be successful, but I give him credit for having thought it through and outlined it in significant technical detail.The book begins much worse than it ends. In the first chapter, \\"Looking for Excuses,\\" the author argues that many traditional arguments for African poverty are false; but the reasoning tends to be specious. Speaking of both the Cold War and colonialism, he argues that it is difficult to make the link between those events and Africa's problems, but then he attributes clear causality to what he calls the \\"benefits\\" of the Cold War and colonialism: it's not clear how we know that they caused benefits but not that they caused problems. In his argument that the manipulation of African peoples by Cold War movers is not responsible, he says, \\"there is little evidence that the superpowers did more damage than African states themselves.\\" Even if they did the same amount of damage, that would be double the damage African countries would have done on their own. Elsewhere in the book, Calderisi relies on a few select quotes to demonstrate that every month in recent African history is \\"replete with tyranny and injustice\\" (p. 63). True or untrue, a statement like that deserves a decent standard of evidence.I'm not sorry that I read this book, but I'd recommend you put William Easterly's White Man's Burden and Jeffrey Sachs's The End of Poverty higher on your list.[1] Amartya Sen, \\"The Man Without a Plan,\\" Foreign Affairs, March/April 2006.[2] William Easterly, The Elusive Quest for Growth, MIT Press, 2002.[3] Jeffrey Sachs, The End of Poverty, Penguin, 2006."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"I have enjoyed the candor of this book. While it can be said that the author looks at things via the rose glasses of \\"elite life\\" in Africa I do agree with much of what he has stated. Care must be taken however to see that many expatriates who throng the shores of Africa do so with fat salaries and exclusive housing to live lifestyles that would never be possible in America or Europe. This behind the wire lifestyle has the tendency to jade the our view and corrupt our ability to look clearly from ground level. I have spend 17 years in Africa, not behind the Ivory towers and five star hotels but in the bush and with the people carrying out aid projects that do make a difference because they are done at a local level and with families rather than governments.I would also note that, while governments in Africa balk against accountability so do our friends in the IMF and World Bank. Money is handed out like toilet paper and little is done to truly assure its proper use. After all its not my money."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"This is a must-read, especially for those who can't make sense of the aid and/or development effort in Africa. Calderisi raises some important points that will be difficult for some people to swallow, but many of us who have lived in rural Africa and have been engaged for considerably longer than a 3 to 4 week stint as a \\"volunteer or eco tourist\\" finish our long term appointments feeling discouraged, disillusioned, and disheartened because of the very issues Calderisi addresses. Granted, corruption and greed are not specific to Africa, but when you go back to your village in rural Africa and see people dying unnecessarily for want of basic needs or reasonable medical care, while billions of dollars are being pumped into the African aid sinkhole, it leaves one with a cognitive dissonance that is difficult to reconcile. And while it is reasonable to expect G8 members to keep their commitments, throwing more money at the problem without demanding real accountability does nothing but exacerbate or perhaps promote waste and corruption. Sure, some of the book's sections lack depth, but Calderisi certainly has the direct knowledge of Africa that Jeffrey Sachs is lacking in his lovely and hopeful, but perhaps naive, \\"The End of Poverty\\". Maybe the truth, and the answer, lie somewhere in between the two. The book was intended more as a cross between an op/ed and memoirs and, when viewed in that fashion, it hits its mark well enough. Many of us who have been there will agree that very little money actually gets out to the people who need it the most and Calderisi's book describes some of the places it actually does go. What the book doesn't even begin to touch on is how much of this money, in addition to the white elephant projects and inflated salaries Calderisi describes, goes to support the hotel & restaurant industry across Africa, as countless workshops and conferences are held in high-end hotels all over the continent to discuss the \\"African\\" or \\"AIDS problem\\", while people in the rural areas continue to get sicker and poorer. The lack of transparency and accountability makes it difficult to write the book that really needs to be written, but Calderisi's book joins a scant few others that raise the cry for rationality in our aid efforts in Africa. I left my copy with my Malawian colleagues who serve as teachers, headmasters, and development workers in the rural area and who rarely have access to books and ideas outside of what the government wants them to know. Perhaps, after reading the book, they will understand why the schools continue to fall into disrepair, the children continue to get sick and die, the women continue to bleed to death in childbirth, and the people continue to get poorer at the expense of the \\"ruling class.\\" Maybe then they will stand up and demand change from within rather than aid from outside."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"The author (mostly) writes about himself, and his plush life as an UN diplomat. His style is poor, his insights are predictable.There are so many books which could bring you understanding of this magnificent continent as Martin Meredith \\"The Fate of Africa\\" (history of every country on the continent since independence) or books by Kapuscinsky, if you want to understand how ordinary people live in Africa, rather than how wrong and dismal politics is made.There are few interesting observations World Bank envoy makes concerning how wrong international help could go. He points out that unconditional help makes things worse. He gives several revealing examples how undertakings supposed to bring good, make more misery instead."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"For Robert Calderisi, experienced development economist and ex-World Bank official, Africans would be a lot better off today if it weren't for their backward culture. \\"The Trouble with Africa\\" presents Calderisi's argument that the continent's scourges of poverty, corruption and mismanagement are of Africans' own making; \\"Africa's handicaps are inbred,\\" he writes bluntly (143). The author believes aspects of what he calls \\"the African character\\" (e.g. fatalism, undue deference to authority and an ethic favoring collective distribution over private accumulation of wealth) must be corrected before African societies can develop. In making this case, he presents himself as a hard-headed realist doling out uncomfortable truths which other Africa specialists are too politically correct to utter--even if they secretly recognize they're true.Many Westerners who've worked in Africa will recognize the cultural characteristics Calderisi describes; as a returned Peace Corps Volunteer I know them well. The problem I have with his approach is that it's based on an outdated concept of culture as a set of essential traits, and it confuses cause with effect. Culture is not some timeless essence passed down unchanged from the ancestors, but a dynamic system constantly being reshaped by politics, economics and history. As an anthropologist I'm uncomfortable with the author's reference to \\"the African character\\"--not because I'm concerned it might offend someone, but because a vast scientific literature accumulated over the last half century has shown the danger of viewing culture as an independent variable. Another ex-World Bank economist (Paul Collier in \\"The Botton Billion\\") convincingly outlines structural and historical explanations for Africa's plight which have nothing to do with culture and aren't even specific to Africa. Calderisi, alas, completely ignores such explanations.\\"The Trouble with Africa\\" tries to account for the near-universal failure of Western development policies in Africa over the last four decades using little more than personal vignettes and anecdotal evidence; its author seems uninterested in rethinking the assumptions that underlay those failed policies. To apply a metaphor from my own profession, Calderisi is like a teacher whose students have all flunked the exam. Such a teacher should at least stop to wonder, \\"What's wrong with my approach? Where did my instruction fall short?\\" Calderisi, in contrast, asks only \\"What's wrong with them? Why don't they get it?\\" As long as he keeps focusing on these questions and grounding his answers in antiquated culturalist fallacies, he is not the hard-headed realist he thinks he is."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"Having recently traveled to Africa for the first time, I left that continent, as did my fellow travelers, wondering what could be done to better the lives of the people we met. It seemed that the troubles were monumental, and that solutions would be nearly impossible. As I read Mr. Calderisi's book, I felt that here were the concrete, rational ideas that are needed to begin the transformation. It made me wish I had the expertise and leadership abilities to get started on it NOW and I only hope that in the very near future that someone with Mr. Calderisi's insight and knowledge will make this a priority and start implementing his ten ways of changing Africa. A truly thought-provoking and inspirational book."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"Every 12 hours the same number killed at the WTC perish from AIDS in Africa, which has 2/3 of the world's cases. In a year 150,000 die giving birth, It is the only region of the world with regular savage wars, and the only continent that has grown steadily poorer over the last 30 year - between '70 and '00 Africa lost half its share of world markets to other developing nations. Over 50% of its population is under eighteen. Finally, making improvement even more difficult, at least 70,000 skilled graduates leave every year.Calderisi believes most of Africa's misfortunes are self-imposed through mismanagement and destructive values. He points out that half the world's aid has gone to Africa lately. (Yet, to protect its farmers, the EU also spends $350 billion/year - 14X aid given to all of Africa and equal to its annual income - thereby damaging its farmers and helping cause economic problems.)Calderisi rejects each of the traditional explanations for Africa's poverty. He begins by pointing out that despite racism and poverty, most slaves' descendants in the West lead better lives than those remaining in Africa. As for colonialism, there is practically no country or civilization which was not someone else's colony at some point; an often overlooked point is that Africa has benefited from colonizers' new technology, education, and ideas. \\"The Trouble with Africa\\" agrees that the Cold War did bring problems to Africa, but also points out that it only involved four nations. As for its debt burden - in '98 Western nations wrote off $50 billion in African debt, nearly as much as the World Bank loaned it in the prior 50 years, and in '05 another $40 billion was canceled.Having few deep-water ports and too many countries (48 south of the Sahara, 22 of which have less than ten million people) are problems that Calderisi believes limit Africa. However, his major point is that no other continent has experienced such prolonged dictatorships - eg. Gabon (39 years), Togo (37), and four others over 20 years. Associated with this is the fact that in most of Africa no one is safe.Half of all Africans live in four countries - Nigeria (127 million), Ethiopia (64), Democratic Republic of Congo (51), and South Africa (43).Major negative values include the fact that if someone succeeds, however, modestly, relatives will often insist on sharing the fruits; further, they are not savers - such behavior is often considered traitorous to their families. Use of leadership for personal advantage is accepted, even expected - for example, class sizes frequently run to 150-200 because of fund diversion. Most uneducated Africans are fatalistic - simply accepting bad outcomes. Another problem is that culprits are seldom punished, though Calderisi offers no data to support this point. Finally, high exchange rates, taxes, and local content requirements further impair Africa's progress.Calderisi' Recommendations: Install mechanisms for tracing and recovering public funds. Require all heads of state and senior officials to open their bank accounts to public scrutiny. Cut direct aid in half, allowing greater oversight - saved monies could be used for general programs, though what this means was not made clear. Focus aid on the 4-5 nations serious about reducing poverty, and impose much fewer restrictions. Require all countries to hold internationally-supervised elections. Promote a free press and independent judiciary. Supervise the running of Africa's schools and AIDS programs to prevent diversions. Finally, combine the World Bank, IMF, and U.N. Development Program to eliminate duplication and working at cross-purposes.\\"The Trouble with Africa\\" makes valuable points - obviously something is seriously wrong for the continent to remain so backward for so long. However, the book would be greatly improved with greater quantification, detail, and documentation. For example, give a credible estimation of how much AIDS and education funding is wasted/diverted, and how this occurs. I also would have liked detail on why there are so many horrible civil wars within Africa."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"For those that can go this way and that, there is trouble in Africa, there is trouble with Africa. Without placing blame squarely on the shoulders of the guilty, there will be no resolution. While the author lived only a couple of places in Africa, the indictment of the continent as a whole is not too far from the mark. Foreign aid does not work, because they are getting too much of what they really don't need which is lots and lots of money and no way to manage it except stealing it and whisking it away to banking institutions abroad. There are far too many well meaning Americans and Europeans that see the problems with a filter and fail to grasp the magnitude of the problems on the continent. For instance, instead of sending people to live in Africa, to learn and understand what is going to work, everyone sends money, money and more money. Someone props up this dictator for 10 years or so and then wonders why he spits in their face when the winds change and we ask him to behave. Africa and the Middle East were the two areas that were carved up by colonial powers in the 1800s and 1900s, the middle east is beginning to recover and come into its own, Africa is in far worse shape. This book does bring ideas back to the discussion regarding why it is in turmoil and how the rest of the world can manage it."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"At a time when the right wing is delusional, and the left is mired down in it's own special version of conservatism; ie \\"Political Correctness\\", it is refreshing to see pragmatic solutions offered by someone close to the subject of Africa. As Mr Calderisi puts it:\\"Politcal Correctness is hard to resist. Especially thousands of miles from the hardships that it covers up.\\" One doesn't have to be in a burning building for long, to realize the fire suppression system is not working.While the book reads as a memoir, Mr Calderisi's 30 years of experiencing the African people directly, makes the case for continuing foreign aid, but not in the business as usual mode. The age of terrorism has shown us the threat posed by failed societies makes the common welfare of nations more important than ever.At a time when as Mr Calderisi puts it,\\"Foriegn aid is dwindling, why accelerate the process?\\" We can see that what money is still available, needs more than ever to be spent wisely. I found the suggestions outlined in the book to be obvious, and very workable. It's a shame that other interests than those of the African people, will be probably be considered first."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"I read in groups in order to avoid being \\"captured\\" or overly-swayed by any single point of view. The other books on Africa that I will be reviewing this week-end include:Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for AfricaThe Challenge for AfricaAfrica Unchained: The Blueprint for Africa's FutureUp front the author stresses that since 1975 Africa has been in a downward spiral, ultimately losing HALF of its foreign market for African goods and services, a $70 billion a year plus loss that no amount of foreign aid can supplant.The corruption of the leaders and the complacency of the West in accepting that corruption is a recurring theme. If the USA does not stop supporting dictators and embracing corruption as part of the \\"status quo\\" then no amount of good will or aid will suffice.The author emphasizes the pettiness and egotism of African leaders, another recurring theme distinct from their corruption. He praises Nelson Mandela, Leopold Senghor of Senegal, and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania as wise men and models.He also emphasizes the need to eliminate monopolies, and I have for myself a note, \\"need to map monopolies--governmental and corporate as well as religious and tribal--down to the district level.\\"Opening quote (p 7):\\"...most not ... aware that Africa has steadily lost markets by its own mismanagement; that most countries--including supposedly \\"capitalist\\" ones like the Ivory Coast--have been anti-business; that African family loyalty and fatalism have been more destructive than tribalism; that African leaders and intellectuals play intentionally on Western guilt; that even Africa's \\"new\\" leaders are indifferent to public opinion and key issues like AIDS; and that, in recent decades, Africans have probably been more cruel to each other than anyone else has been.\\"The author is also optimistic, observing as so many have the richness of Africa in talent, resources, and tradition.In the author's view, aid works best when the government and society are already moderately effective, and a new approach for Africa might start with Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique [this was written before the recent implosion of that country], Ghana, and Mail. He praises Botswana and Mauritius as success stories of lasting importance. I am reminded that four countries have 50% of Africa's population: Nigeria, Congo (CD), Ethiopia, and South Africa.Practical impediments to African develop identified by the author include a lack of deep-water ports (to which I would add multiple land-locked countries); a failure to achieve unity as a whole and even unity at the sub-region level--he spends time on the collapse of Central Africa.Highlights from this book, which \\"tells a story\\" in a very credible way and also improves my appreciation for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, both of which I have considered part of the problem for over a decade:+ Home-grown corruption & despotism is the leading cause of decline.+ The greatest need is for open debate, a free and informative press, a full disclosure to the public of public information about problems, programs, incoming aid funds, and the contributions of outsiders as well as the negative impact of insiders. On page 55 the author is eloquent in condemning \\"the ignorance, uncertainty, dishonesty, and insecurity that rule African lives.\\"+ Core issues include the importance of primary education, family planning, giving women access to credit, fighting corruption, and opening internal markets for farmers and workers, not just business.+ A full chapter discusses culture, corruption, and correctness, and here I learn more about the connection between the family tradition and corruption, the fatalism and acceptance of hardship, the community culture that discourages individual imitative (which is successful is drained by family claims for \\"sharing), and so on. I am especially impressed by the author's urgency in condemning Western acceptance of continued corruption at all levels of any government.+ I learn that racism is alive and well and that hypocrisy runs deep in Africa.+ Only one aid program has truly worked in the author's view, the fight against river blindness.+ If the World Bank annual budget for Africa were given directly to the poor, it would last ten days (this is one of the reasons I believe we must empower the poor with cell phones and access to information so they can create infinite wealth on their own).After case studies of Tanzania, Ivory Coast, and Central Africa (region), the author concludes with ten recommendations that I find gripping in their practical value:01 Introduce mechanisms for tracing and recovering public funds [i.e. from Switzerland, Caymans]02 Require all Heads of State, Ministers, and Senior Officials to open their bank accounts to public scrutiny03 Cut direct aid to individual countries in half04 Focus direct aid on four to five countries that are serious about reducing poverty05 Require all countries to hold internationally-supervised elections06 Promote other aspects of democracy including a free press and an independent judiciary07 Supervise the running Africa's schools and HIV/AIDS program08 Establish citizen review groups to oversee government policy and agreements09 Put more emphasis on infrastructure and regional links10 Merge the World Bank, IMF, and United Nations Development ProgrammeAs something of a bottom line, I conclude from this book that decades of Western tolerance for massive corruption and ineffectiveness at the leadership level in Africa, combined with aid generosity lacking in practical direction has allowed Africa to rot from within.A final quote from the last page (230):\\"Only those familiar with the human beauty, potential, and suffering of the continent will dare hope for breakthroughs in the next ten years. More than others, they know that only Africans can break the cycle of terror, poverty, and mediocrity that keeps them subdued.\\"Other books I recommend with this one:Deliver Us from Evil: Peacekeepers, Warlords and a World of Endless ConflictBreaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About ItThe Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits (Wharton School Publishing Paperbacks)A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and ChangeThe leadership of civilization building: Administrative and civilization theory, symbolic dialogue, and citizen skills for the 21st centuryHow to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas, Updated EditionMy take-away: Africa is an Information Operations (IO) challenge; create a regional Range of Needs table at the household level that the one billion rich can plug into while also harmonizing the giving and the investments of organizations, and Africa can be the first Smart Continent that uses information as a substitute for violence, corruption, time, and space."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"IF you want to get a great idea of the screwed up programs and screwed up governments of the continent, then read this book.

This book systematically and succinctly explains many of the issues that have plagued the continent and has explained away many of the excuses that have served to keep Africa from developing economically and politically.I particularly liked Calderisi's deflating of the slave trade argument. The slave trade is one era removed from modern Africa, with the 150 years or so of the colonial period between now and then. And yet is is used to explain away a lack of development in Africa as if people today are still traumatized by a memory they cannot possibly have, any more than I have an \\"ancestral memory\\" of my people being slaves to the Romans. Slavery has not been, unfortunately, unknown in human history. And yet, peoples have managed to go forward and continue to build and have great dreams.Africa needs help, there can be no doubt of that. Despite significant mineral wealth and agricultural potential the continent continues to fall deeper and deeper into poverty.

In 1960 when France gave independence to more than a dozen nations signalling the final boot to fall off and proving the landmark in the history of African independence, privatly De Gaulle and others beleived the nations needed another 40 years to create institutions to be successfull. Today most of those nations are considered 'failed' states.Of course no one could tolerate 40 more years of tutelage. However when we see the infrastructure begetted to South Africa in 1994 with the end of Aparthied perhaps we can be given a glimpse of what these advisors were talking about. Not all of Africa is a failure, rather Botswana is one success story. It has no sugnificant racial strife, no civil war, democracy, free press and has had no dictators. These simple things ahve made it the richest per capita country in Africa. It has only meagre resources, its Aids rate is high and it is underpopulated, but it is succcessful.This book is controversial but it does dare to challenege the doners and the NGO imperialists, the aid workers who racistly still dominate africa telling Africans they cant do antyhing themselves and forcing africans to accept aid and neo-colonialism under a new guise. Africa needs independence, not from colonialism, but from the mefia like NGOs and aid organizations and the UN(whihc ruitinely sells food for sex in the Congo and allows genocide in the Sudan). Africa needs a chance to finally be free.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working","review":"Much of the information about why aid fails is in fact close to the mark. What is said of the failure of kleptocracies in Africa is true. However, it is somewhat irrespinsible that the perspective on this failure solely blames Africans. As a graduate student studying all of these issues, it is apparent to me that the author doesn't make the connection between the current state of Africa and its past. Africa is failing today because the slave trade turned African kings and mercenaries into forces that ravaged the interior, turning group against group in wars to sell prisoners to the white man. Colonization left African nations with extractive economies, no infrastructure, no experience at ruling, and behind a hundred years in political development. And today most African economies are still completely subject to Western markets and decisions about them. Finally, IMF Bank Structural Adjustment Programs and social austerity programs are largely to blame for enriching kleoptocratic despots, fueling wars, and spending billion on white elephant projects. Also to blame are foreign investment groups and governments who backed dictators and armies useful to their foreign policy. Yet all of this is ignored.Caldersi is a good read for understanding corruption, kleptocracy, waste, and hoarding...however, it is one piece of the puzzle and ultimately fails to educate the reader on the whole picture. I recommend this book, but only in conjunction with a wider reading selection that covers the rest of the picture."},{"Title":"Greek and Latin in Scientific Terminology","review":"I was looking for a book that might list Latin names of common beasties, this is much more than that.

He struggles with every aspect of life - learning disabilities, social issues, behavior issues etc. He, also, does not enjoy reading. Therefore, I am always looking for interesting books for him, in the hopes that perhaps they will entice him to read.By chance, I stumbled on this book, Parents Wanted, at our local library. The jacket piqued my interest and I began to read the book myself. The book brought tears to my eyes. The author sincerely understands these children, as only a parent of a child with ADD could. How insightful! I appreciated every nuance of this story!Of course, I insisted that my son read this book. He, too, enjoyed it, and reluctantly admitted he saw much of himself in the book.I wish there were more novels about children with ADD. (There isn't much fiction written about this topic for children.)"},{"Title":"Parents Wanted","review":"Parents Wanted is an excellent book for middle school students. As a middle school reading teacher I found Parents Wanted to be a great choice for the students. The book provides the inner thoughts of 12 year old Andy Fleck as he is transitioning from sporadic foster care to living with his new adoptive parents, Jeff and Laurie. As Andy has ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and biological parents who do not care for him, he has a large amount of challenges to overcome.Andy makes many mistakes and is very honest with himself allowing the students to easily relate to his thoughts and actions. The students enjoyed keeping a journal of their reading of the book and also loved illustrating favorite events in the book. The book's Boston area setting additionally appeals to those students living in and around Boston.Though the book's focus is about an adolescent boy, the story appeals to both boys and girls. Many of the studetns were relieved that Andy expressed thoughts that they too feel. The students connect so well with Andy that it is hard to believe that Andy is fictional.I highly recommend this book for pleasure reading as well as for part of any middle school reading program."},{"Title":"Parents Wanted","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"Parents Wanted.\\" It has a capturing essence to it that makes you want to read further.\\"Parents Wanted\\" is told in the first person, through the eyes of Andy Fleck, an orphan.

Andy is a boy who has experienced lots of bad things in his life - lack of nurture and often neglected by his parents.Poignantly written, this book will let readers experience the angst-ridden emotions that Andy encounters.You will glide by this book. The language is fluent, and not at all difficult to understand, and the illustrations are quite amusing to look at.Written honestly, \\"Parents Wanted\\" is an extremely touching novel that will grab readers' attentions.

At some parts I would laugh out loud or bite my fingernails, eager to turn the page. It's funny to read what the boy is thinking, and you can relate to a lot of it even if you aren't adopted."},{"Title":"Parents Wanted","review":"The picture of the boy on the cover of this book is strongly reminiscent of a very young George Harrison, circa 1962. That is what caught my attention.When Andy Fleck's natural parents declare him a ward of the state, the boy, then 12 is placed in a Boys' Home. The place sounds more like a hospital/institution than any kind of home. The \\"school\\" the boys attend is, in Andy's words \\"a pretend school\\" where they are not given age appropriate activies nor work commensurate with their ability levels. There is even locked seclusion rooms for out of control moments.Andy's natural parents drank and fought; Andy even says he remembers them throwing things at each other over his crib. He had the crib until age 5 because \\"they didn't have money to buy me a real bed until then.\\" Although he voices loyalty to them, each memory he shares about them paints a very bleak life indeed. Andy responds by lying, stealing and truancy. He also has Attention Deficit Disorder and takes two medications.Once at the Home, Andy goes on trial foster homes, none of which work out. Some of the homes, such as the one with \\"Dumb Donald and Weird Joan\\" were abusive. Each time, Andy manages to get returned to the Home. His angel of a social worker, Alison, works tirelessly on his behalf to find him a suitable placement. Andy also, along with the other boys gets to meet prospective adoptive parents. It is during one of these Sunday gatherings that he meets the Sizeracys.A kind, loving couple, the Sizeracys agree to take Andy for a trial. Andy, despite his man-of-the-world exterior, still is attached to his stuffed toys and loves being read to at night. He appears to thrive at the Sizeracys, although he continues his pattern of lying, stealing and truancy. Each time the Sizeracys go to bat for him and in an especially touching scene, the boy's foster father gives him the benefit of the doubt when Andy is accused of stealing $20.00 from a teacher.Despite the bumpy road and the predictable ending, it is still an entertaining read. One will be cheering for the Sizeracys."},{"Title":"Parents Wanted","review":"Want to see life through the eyes of a struggling foster teen? Parents Wanted is probably the closest you can get short of experiencing it yourself. Written in first person perspective, the reader slides somewhat uncomfortably into 12-year-old foster child Andy Flecks shoes and shares the tribulations of a good-hearted kid who has been unfortunately dealt a less-than-fair hand in life. Given up by his ill-equipped birth parents, Andy has been bounced around from foster home to foster home (sometimes only lasting 20 seconds), his obnoxious and angst ridden behavior make him difficult to deal with- 'No adult has ever apologized to me for the way Ive been treated- why should I have to apologize to them for the way I act?' Finally, he has found a family he likes who are willing to give him a chance and not give up on him, but with his past track record, it is only natural for him to test their limits for proof that they truly want him as their son.Although written for young kids, Parents Wanted can be enjoyed on many levels. Young kids will identify with Andy and his views on adults and possibly learn a bit from his experiences and behavior. Adults will get good insight into the mind of an overactive teen (a refresher incase they forgot what they themselves used to be like) and be able to empathize with every other good parent working to show patience.

Andy, the main character in the book, is so much like our boy that he immediately latched onto the story with great interest. Each night after reading a few chapters we discuss the contents that we just read, and how Andy's situation is similar, or different from, his own.

The voice of Andy is very believable and the world of foster children is presented in a way that's accessible to both young and old. I am happy to report that as a result of the ONE BOOK, ONE COMMUNITY event PARENTS WANTED is now a popular book club choice for the middle schoolers. As an adult you end up rooting both for Andy and his parents whose own story, \\"child wanted\\" ends very happily.

It presents well documented, sometimes shocking, information you will never hear or read about in the media, interspersed with personal, relevent stories. It educates us as to how we are being manipulated by the media and by large transnational corporations and how this manipulation is affecting every area of our lives, from the emotional health of our children to the physical health of our bodies.But the book doesn't leave you hanging, feeling helpless and depressed. It is filled with easy suggestions that we, as individuals, can do to turn back the tide and take back control. This book was a real eye-opener and I highly reommend it!"},{"Title":"Taking Back Our Lives in the Age of Corporate Dominance","review":"Both of the authors are in the non-profit sector and focus on children issues, especially low-income. That is perhaps their starting point in recognizing the huge impact that corporations have on our society especially in areas of the media and entertainment, education, and the fragility and inadequacy of jobs. The book is a two-parter. In the first part, they give an overview that clearly shows that corporations are elephants stomping all over our society and molding it to their tastes; secondly, the authors urge people to somehow bypass this domination and recapture their lives.Corporate domination is a result of resources that far exceed those of individual citizens, which have given corporations the ability to control the political process and system and sway the legal system. They control the various media, dishing out trivialities for news in lieu of thoughtful analysis and presenting nonsensical and violent entertainment, while bombarding the public with advertising that subtly creates artificial needs for dubious products. The corporate propaganda concerning family values has to be squared with the globalization movement secured through so-called trade agreements that are having devastating consequences for workers and families, as well as environmental impacts.The authors are concerned with the passivity that people show towards this corporate onslaught. We watch their nonsense; we buy their image enhancing products; we vote for pro-corporate political candidates; we allow the corporate agenda to penetrate our schools; we shop at Wal-Mart despite its community killing effects, etc.The authors' suggestions for countering corporate domination and taking back lives are really rather limited. They propose taking the initiative to turn off the TV, take on a development task, cut back on consumption, do volunteer work, find meaningful employment, shop locally, etc. They never say to whom their message is directed. It does seem simplistic and utterly unrealistic for most people, who are forced to conform to the status quo. There are tens of millions of so-called cultural creatives who already resist the corporate message but with little overall impact on corporate power.The authors wrote in the late 1990s during an economic boom, where more seemed possible even though inequality was undergoing a huge upsurge. In late 2005, their message seems even more out-of-touch. The corporate agenda has an even greater lock on American society, if that is possible, in the Bush era. Oil companies have the ability to influence foreign policy and manipulate oil markets for outrageous profits at the expense of American families. The cynical manipulation of the religious right to gain voting power for the business right continues unabated. At this point, there are no countervailing forces in American society to corporate domination. Unions have been destroyed. There is no democratic (small \\"d\\") party. There is no means to even get a democratic message out. But there will have to be a democratic upsurge to counter corporate power. Political action must be taken because that is the basis of corporate power. Most legislation of the last twenty-five years needs to be rescinded and reissued with the needs of the public in mind. Developing one's self and volunteering may be admirable, but it is also mostly irrelevant against corporate power.Yes, there are cracks in corporate power. Some can find those cracks - most cannot. They simply do not have the means or resources. These authors obviously do. One had $60,000 to run for Congress. In volume II they need to be advocating a real program for countering corporate power and recapturing our society for people, not monolithic entities with no soul."},{"Title":"Taking Back Our Lives in the Age of Corporate Dominance","review":"In the pages of their new book, Ellen Schwartz and Suzanne Stoddard relate this quote from Paul Hawken's, The Ecology of Commerce: \\"There is no polite way to say that business is destroying the world.\\" While Hawken was talking specifically about the physical Earth, Schwartz and Stoddard are not so limited in their condemnation. Business is destroying the world and everything in it: democracy, living wages, healthcare, the nutritional value of food and even our sanity. We'll put it simply: If you agree with that mindset, you'll love this book. If you have any doubts that corporations constitute an evil empire, you won't. Nevertheless, we [...] recommend that dedicated professionals read this double-barreled critique of the corporate world, just to know how the other side sees you."},{"Title":"Taking Back Our Lives in the Age of Corporate Dominance","review":"I bought this book at a yard sale, just out of curiosity. It's been a good long time since I've had an opportunity to read some Marxist propaganda. Doggone it, the Soviet Union crashed and all the fun stopped. The propaganda wars of the 80s were a hoot for while. Between Vladimir Posner and the ever-dwindling, drowning CPUSA, we got a glimpse of a kinder, gentler Marxism. This book reads like something out of People's Daily World. I gave the book two stars for nostalgia value.I read the book in one sitting and wasn't surprised at the conclusions it drew, that it is all the fault of the nasty capitalists who want only to enslave the beleaguered working class. They bombard us with advertising and like mindless dolts we go out and get ourselves in debt and become slaves to the system. Ultimately, the book is condescending and juvenilizing. Shame on you, authors! Treat your readers as intellectual equals! Typical of hardcore Marxists, you treat your fellow working people as not very bright, needing your divine guidance. It's always strikes me funny how none of these people plan on working in the pencil factory after the revolution.There are two approaches one can take when confronted with the reality that workplaces have become increasingly toxic. (I agree with that assessment.) We can look to the nasty old government to change its ways or we can look to ourselves to create a living on our own, independent of corporations. I choose the second. Freedom is always the best option.I recommend Claire Wolfe's \\"How to Kill the Job Culture Before It Kills You.\\" It addresses these issues in a clever and intelligent manner and proposes reasonable solutions to \\"wage slavery.\\""},{"Title":"On Growth and Form","review":"Don't get me wrong -- \\"On Growth and Form\\" is one of my absolute top favorite books of all time.

This review is a warning to make sure you get the right imprint.Unfortunately some publishers think that they know better than D'Arcy Thompson, and cut out more than half of the original material. After all, nobody these days actually looks at equations, right? Well I do, and the pathetic edition by Canto (368 pages) weighs with less than 33% of the material in the modern unexpurgated reprint by Dover (1116 pages).Amazingly enough, the redacted Canto version costs nearly the same as the Dover complete.

A remarkable man with a wonderful open view of science and the, what's now called, interdisciplinarian approach to the world. Refreshingly full of new ideas especially for his day and even now where conservatism as usual is the norm in scientific circles. I hope many scientists read this book and see not just a curiosity but a representation of a whole approach to the world of nature. I will never forget the first time I read the chapter on coordinate transformations in animal shapes, today's schools simply do not inspire in this way and its time this changed.

The book arrived suspiciously smaller than I expected it, almost half size. I thought maybe my memory deceived me, but apparently no.In the introduction of the editor, Mr. John Tyler Bonner, is so kind as to explain that he mistook a classic book on organism and form, for a scientific one. In order to make the book accessible to general public (who said it was not?) and to \\"correct\\" Mr. D'Arcy's writing, Mr. Bonner removed the \\"dangerous\\" chapters with \\"vague\\" (always according to him) arguments, and the \\"out-of-date\\" material, and finally to turned D'Arcy's book into his own.What I want to clarify is that I am not giving two stars to Mr. D'Arcy's book, for this book I did not read. Instead I am giving 2 stars to Mr. Bonner, to Cambridge University Press, to Canto and to Amazon (for not noting this is an abridged piece of work) for destroying a classic.REMINDER: THE BOOK IS ABRIDGED EDITION, and the editor not so great"},{"Title":"On Growth and Form","review":"It's about so much more than the limits our minds create from standard reviews &amp; categorizations.

The tables are not reproduced in any readable way, and there are none of the pictures that are needed to understand the text. eBooks like this do a tremendous disservice to the Kindle. This could be a wonderful resource to have on the Kindle, but no care was taken in the transcription, and to charge for this is an outrage. There is absolutely no way that I could recommend the Kindle version of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"On Growth and Form","review":"I, too, am a longtime fan of D'Arcy Thompson's endearing (enduring) classic. I've read the discussion. I appreciate very much that Golan Levin, in \\"Canto: An unfortunate redaction of a timeless classic,\\" and others as well, have made it clear to Amazon customers that the Canto (Cambridge University Press) version of this book is radically abridged, as compared to Dover's (apparently) unabridged edition. This kind of comparative information--about a book's being published under different editions, and what those editions contain--is the kind of crucial info which, as things stand, we customers have to contribute.It's unfortunate, if understandable, that the bulk of the laudatory reviews here don't specify which edition these people read. Some of them appear to be from scientists and/or mathematicians: they are, perhaps, readers of the unabridged version. Viktor Blasjo's 5-star review *does* specify: he reports from the Dover unabridged, and a great report it is, too. He convinced me to pick up a copy.Other reviewers seem to have come to D'Arcy Thompson from a more varied background, for their words remind me of my own experience: I first read this book at the age of 19, breathlessly turning the pages, filled to the brim with a sense of growing wonder about what science could do. In Thompson's hands, science opened up the secrets of Nature, right before my eyes. I'd read a fair amount of literature for my age, so from a more sophisticated angle, I relished the many passages of elegant writing--charmingly earnest, sometimes almost passionate. (Thompson's literary excellence comes in spurts, folks, so be patient.) \\"On Growth and Form\\" came, in time, to have a big influence on me: I'd been on the fence about science vs. literature for a major, and Thompson was the first in a series of dominoes that toppled me into a chemistry major, followed by medical school and becoming a doctor.So what edition was this marvel of a book that I read? The abridged version, the 1961 edition, from the very same publisher (Cambridge University Press) and editor (John Tyler Bonner, PhD., Professor of Biology, Princeton University) to whom Levin and others have devoted so many unkind words.I don't know, but I rather suspect, that at least a few of the other highly positive reviews have come from people who've had their experience of \\"On Growth and Form\\" with that very same abridged version. I did hear from someone in university publishing circles, in the '70s, that it was a surprising seller for such an odd little book.Two of the other reviewers' comments, in particular, caught my attention:\\"I have recommended it to home schoolers as thebest single book to inform a teenager about physics,chemistry, biology, & practical thinking.\\"\\"This could be read by a junior or senior in highschool. But, I think it would be more appropriatefor college.\\"Can these people be talking about an 1100-page book? I'll grant any young person the ability to read anything, but the attention span, the sheer time it would take, to read 1100 pages... I just don't think they're talking about the unabridged version. One of the reasons Prof. Bonner gives for abridging the text, is to streamline the presentation of the ideas so as to keep the reader's attention. Is that *so* heretical? This is a master teacher talking here!Oops--I got ahead of myself. Yes, Bonner was in fact *my* teacher. I had a real stroke of luck: John Tyler Bonner was my professor of Introductory Biology, freshman year. I savored his verbal brilliance in the lecture hall, and especially enjoyed getting to know his gentle, lively person, on various social occasions. His research was in slime molds--mind-boggling critters who change their form from a sheetlike syncytium to tall stalks like lollipops, then back again--an organism well-suited to the ideas of Thompson regarding stretching and shrinking of surfaces according to mathematically describable patterns.I was an undergrad in the years 1973-77, by which time Professor Bonner's 1961 edit of D'Arcy Thompson's \\"On Growth and Form\\" was churning through multiple printings as an attractive, popular trade paperback. I knew lots of people who were reading it, or had it on their shelves. It was never assigned for any course (not even Prof. Bonner's Intro Biology), but somehow we all read it--science, poli-sci, history, English majors alike. But you don't have to go back to college with me to read at least some of what we read: Prof. Bonner's original 1961 introduction is in this Cambridge/Canto edition, plus his rousing 1992 follow-up. I haven't seen the book, so I don't know anything about the nature or extent of the re-edits in 1992, but Bonner does say a bit about them.Just in case someone missed that: I do not know about the nature or extent of the 1992 re-edits. So I'm not speaking for the quality of this specific edition--just for the 1961 Cambridge/Canto abridged edition that I came to know and love so well. It seems to bode well, though, that Prof. Bonner is still at the helm.More generally, though, I'm speaking for the notion that there's room for both, or many: a classic book is important enough to deserve more than one treatment. Look at all the editions of classic works of fiction: abridged, unabridged, children's version, illustrated #1, illustrated #2, comic book, annotated, revised w/ newly-discovered author's notes, corrected edition after original hand-written manuscript found in trunk buried on Treasure Island...You can read Prof. Bonner's '61 introduction (which I think is lovely, but then I would) and his '92 follow-up on the new edition (he comments insightfully about the continuing relevance of Thompson's ideas to the past 30 years' advances in biology). You can also read the foreword by Stephen Jay Gould. (I'm surprised Amazon didn't get *his* name into the author field!) Just use the oh-so-helpful LOOK INSIDE! feature. To read the Intro, do a search on \\"Editor's\\", click the first hit, read & page forward as far as you can, then click the next instance of \\"Editor's\\", and so on. (You may have to improvise a bit to read the whole intro in order.) To read Gould's forward, just search on \\"Gould.\\"I strongly encourage those of you who are interested in this issue of page-lengths of different editions, degrees of reduction of the text, etc., to use LOOK INSIDE! and read what Bonner has to say on that point. Some of the reasons he gives for further shortening of the work are truly Thompsonian. =grin= And, thanks to Amazon, you can read those remarks just as you might've in a bookstore--while you're considering which edition to buy, or whether to buy both.Enough. Enjoy. The more the merrier.Oh--the five stars?

Sometimes a simple skewing or stretching will suffice, but in other cases more complicated transformations are needed. Few, however, have read the book, and few realize that the famous drawings come right at the end of a long and detailed argument in which D'Arcy Thompson establishes the importance of purely physical considerations in deciding the forms taken by organisms.D'Arcy Thompson was not opposed to the idea of natural selection, and recognized that it was part of the explanation of evolution. However, he was writing at the beginning of the 20th century at a time when he felt that natural selection was regarded as the complete and only explanation of evolution, and he wanted to show that it wasn't as simple as that. In a modern book, Richard Dawkins's \\"The Ancestor's Tale\\", we can read that \\"Animal shapes are malleable like plasticine. A fish can change in evolutionary time to whatever unfishy shape is required for its way of life.\\" This is the point of view that D'Arcy Thompson considered exaggerated, because he argued that there are many physical constraints that limit this infinite malleability (less, perhaps, for animals that live in the water than for land animals that must take account of gravity, but real nonetheless). He shows that many features of animals must and do obey the same rules as those followed by engineers in designing bridges.D'Arcy Thompson's style is quite unlike any other -- \\"scholarly\\" would be an understatement -- and much of the book can be read for the pleasure of the language. Even at the time of writing (originally 1917) it must have been optimistic to think that scientist readers could cope with abundant quotations from other writers left untranslated from Greek, Latin, German or French. (In the unabridged 2nd edition that I once leafed through but have not read, I think there were some in Spanish and Italian, but I didn't find any of these in the abridged edition.) Most of the French quotations are quite important for the argument, and I suppose the same is probably true for the others, so a modern reader inevitably loses some of the sense. The most extreme example is a whole page devoted to a quotation from Buffon in support of the author's contention that the popular idea that honeybees are brilliant engineers is due to a failure to understand the purely physical constraints involved in constructing a honeycomb.Some of the other reviewers have commented that in preparing this abridged edition John Tyler Bonner emasculated the original. Although I have some sympathy with this criticism I think it is too strong. For many readers the effect of reading the abridged edition will be to stimulate them to read the book in full -- as I certainly shall now do."},{"Title":"On Growth and Form","review":"Bonner's abridgment is a fine introduction to an interesting book and is perhaps getting too bad a rap here; anyone who wants to compare it to the original 1917 edition (or the 1945 American edition) is welcome to hit the Internet archive and download either, since both are out of copyright and freely available."},{"Title":"On Growth and Form","review":"If you are a biologist, or just interested in life or earth sciences, this book will certainly provide many hours of inspiration and awe for you.

D'Arcy Thompson is not interested to the shape of mountains and sand dunes nor to the physics examples of spirals.As for the twist of a strand of DNA, D'Arcy Thompson died in 1948...Dear Gregory McNamee, \\"On growth and form\\" is a beautiful book that maybe in your case \\"repaid skimming\\", but repays much more a close reading. It is full with wonderful (and still actual) ideas mostly from biology that are sometimes hidden in a huge number of examples."},{"Title":"On Growth and Form","review":"This is a delightful book. I shall give some sample highlights. First some things from the particularly enjoyable chapter 2, \\"On Magnitude\\".Raindrops come in the sizes 2^n (p. 59, Dover ed.). Proof: As they leave the cloud the rain drops are all of the same size. If two rain drops meet they make one raindrop of twice the mass, as so start falling faster than the singles. Thus it will never merge with a single to make a size 3 drop, but it may join another double to make a quadruple drop. Of course the quadruples fall faster than the doubles and the singles, so they will only merge with other quadruples, and so on.Many results are derived from \\"dimension theory\\". A simple illustration is the following \\"paradox\\" of constant-temperature animals (pp. 33-34). \\"The heat lost must ... be proportional to the surface of the animal: and the gain must be equal to the loss, since the temperature of the body keeps constant. It would seem, therefore, that the heat lost by radiation and that gained by oxidation vary both alike, as the surface-area, or the square of the linear dimensions, of the animal. But this result is paradoxical; for whereas the heat lost may well vary as the surface-area [i.e., as l^2], that produced by oxidation ought rather to vary as the bulk of the animal [i.e., as l^3]\\". Thus one is \\"driven to the conclusion that the smaller animal does produce more heat (per unit mass) than the larger one, in order to keep pace with surface loss; and that this extra heat-production means more energy spent, more food consumed, more work done.\\"Another illustration of dimension theory: the maximum jumping height of an animal is constant under scaling (p. 37), for \\"the work done in leaping is proportional to the mass and to the height to which it is raised, W proportional to mH. But the muscular power available for this work is proportional to the mass of muscle, ... W proportional to m. It follows that H is ... a constant. In other words, all animals, provided that they are similarly fashioned, with their various levers in like proportion, ought to jump not to the same relative but to the same actual height.\\" It follows that \\"neither flea nor grasshopper is a better but rather a worse jumper than a horse or a man.\\"Yet another illustration of dimension theory: the maximum velocity of a fish is proportional to sqrt(length), \\"For the velocity (V) which the fish attains depends on the work (W) it can do and the resistance (R) it must overcome. Now we have seen that the dimensions of W are l^3 [muscle volume], and of R are l^2 [surface area friction]; and by elementary mechanics W is proportional to RV^2, or V^2 proportional to W/R. Therefore V^2 is proportional to l^3/l^2=l, and V proportional to sqrt(l)\\" (p. 31).For land animals, however, velocity is constant under scaling (p. 38), as we se by considering \\"the momentum created ... by a given force acting for a given time: mv=Ft. We know that m is proportional to l^3 and t=l/v, so that l^3v=Fl/v, or v^2=F/l^2. But whatsoever force be available, the animal may only exert so much of it as is in proportion to the strength of his own limbs, that is to say to the cross-section of bone, sinew and muscle; and all of these cross-sections are proportional to l^2, the square of the linear dimensions. The maximal force, F_max, which the animal dare exert is proportional, then, to l^2; therefore F_max/l^2=contant. And the maximal speed which the animal can safely reach ... is also constant.\\"Geodesics: \\"an instructive case is furnished by the arrangement of the muscular fibres on the surface of a hollow organ, such as the heart or the stomach. ... In fact we have a right to expect that the muscular fibres covering such organs will coincide with geodesic lines ... For if we imagine a contractible fibre ... to be fixed by its two ends upon a curved surface, it is obvious that its first effort of contraction will tend to expend itself in accommodating the band to the form of the surface, in 'stretching it tight,' ... and it is only then that further contraction will have the effect of constricting the tube and so exercising pressure on its contents. Thus the muscular fibres ... arrange themselves automatically in geodesic curves: in precisely the same manner as we also construct complex systems of geodesics whenever we wind a ball of wool or spindle a tow, or when the skilful surgeon bandages a limb\\" (pp. 742-744).Comparative anatomy of bridges. A parabolic arch bridge is designed to distribute stress uniformly. Its shape is determined by a \\"stress diagram\\": if we imagine the bridge as a beam on two pillars and plot the stress as a function of position on the bridge then we get precisely the arch needed to equi-distribute this stress. More generally, \\"Every diagram of moments represents the outline of a framed structure which will carry the given load with a uniform horizontal stress\\" (p. 996), and \\"to precisely those stress-lines has Nature kept in the building of the bone\\" (p. 995). So, for example, \\"whenever the head and neck represent a considerable fraction of the whole weight of the body, we tend to have large bending-moments over the fore-legs, and correspondingly high spines over the vertebrae of the withers ... The case is sufficiently exemplified by the horse, and still more notably by the stag, the ox, or the pig.\\" (p. 1003)."},{"Title":"On Growth and Form","review":"A great book, to be read by all biophysicists-to-be.The modern follow-up to this book is Thom's Structural Stability, which shows that the logical conclusion of Thompson's ideas is both exciting and dubious. We probably can't just 'look' at stuff, we need to make (useful) predictions or the theory won't last. The interested reader should also pick up, if briefly, Mandelbrot's Fractal Geometry of Nature.Two notes of interest. 1) Morphology has indeed proven successful in proving physical theory: in the aggregation of dust particals, measuring the gross fractal dimension allows you to predict the type of noise involved in creating it. 2) The logarithmic spiral, together with the fibonnaci sequence and the golden ratio, show up quite surprisingly in synchronized chaotic loops.PS: to these I can add three more. 3) Shipman and Newell at the University of Arizona have shown that the Fibonnaci sequence in phylotaxis arises from buckling of pressurized skin (e.g. in a cactus or young sunflower) 4) Goldstein, also at UA, has shown that a broad variety of cave patterns (from ripples on the wall to bumps on stalagtites to wonderful crystaline snowflakes) all arise as a result of a single cause, the diffusion-reaction equation. 5) the late Winfree (also at UA!) has quite conclusively shown that heart beating and defribrillation are non-equilibrium sprial patterns similar to the BZ reaction.The whole business of form has been taken up by the Sante Fe institute, see Kauffman's At Home in the Universe.

It belongs on the shelf of every Bacon fan and artist, regardless of medium. Nine interviews range from 1962 to 1986, Bacon's fifties through his seventies, in the form of interactive conversations with art historian David Sylvester (British, 1924-2001), ranging from Bacon's frustrated youth to his unique artistic techniques, the meaning of art to the meaning of life. Sylvester cleverly steers toward topics Bacon finds interesting, allowing him to discuss them at length. (Some of the original audio may be sampled at BBC4's website, though this book's text was heavily edited and re-manipulated from those recordings.)The final chapter is the most biographical. Bacon, 77, recaps his life and career in detail, including his &quot;coming out,&quot; at a time homosexuality was illegal in Britain, the relationship with his intolerant father coming to an end as a result. Overall, the book forms a clear portrait of an intellectually restless artist, demonized by the struggle to express satisfactorily the horrific images which constantly stream into his head. There is no overarching structure to the book, thus many interviews cover the same ground different ways, with illuminating results. Bacon's answers usually reinforce or embellish what was said earlier, but he sometimes answers the same question differently over time, demonstrated for example by his increasing dislike for &quot;drink and drugs.&quot;Some themes persist throughout. Chronically anxious and hypertensive, he can never sit still, never relax. Not religious, Bacon believes &quot;man is an accident, a futile being, he must play out the game without reason,&quot; and life has only whatever meaning we give it, yet his haunted soul clearly identifies with the tragedy of the Crucifixion, which he considers the perfect narrative of the mythic &quot;tragic hero,&quot; and the ultimate symbol of human devotion despite life's vicissitudes. (One famous Bacon work metaphorically depicts a hypodermic syringe stuck into the subject's arm, representing a nail stuck into the hand). He is similarly affected by the open-mouthed cry of human agony, which he expresses in perhaps his most famous and retold obsession, the many horrifying studies of Velazquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X.Too human, he is concerned with posterity, and denies himself the comfort of calling himself a &quot;painter.&quot; He believes an artist must &quot;solve the problem&quot; of art to be a success, which to him means they must render the known through the unknown, or create the &quot;illustrative&quot; and &quot;narrative&quot; through the use of the &quot;irrational.&quot; Discussing Picasso in this light, he says he finds surrealism &quot;more real&quot; than realism, probably meaning he finds surrealism more directly communicates the human condition. He also believes strongly in figuration, slaying abstract art with one devastating word: &quot;Fashion!&quot; He seems burdened by a lack of proper training, having started his career as an interior designer, especially when discussing the trials of his studio work, describing the way he tosses paint at the canvas, the way he tries not to work a canvas too much, potentially ruining it, and the conflicted feelings he holds toward works he has already painted, or those he is still painting.The book usefully reproduces many works in small black-and-white images at times when the conversation turns to them, both Bacon's works and those of others, like Picasso and Rembrandt. The lack of color is entirely unnoticed, as the book focuses on the artist's psychology and opinion, which these plates illustrate perfectly. (Full-color reproduction would probably also have made the book needlessly expensive). Most remarkably, of all the photographs and self-portraits in the book, Bacon never looks directly at the viewer, illustrating most strikingly his natural over-sensitivity and tortured self-denial.Bacon has said &quot;art is completely a game by which man distracts himself,&quot; and &quot;the artist must really deepen the game in order to be worth anything at all.&quot; If anyone feels Bacon &quot;played the game&quot; well, and &quot;distracts&quot; successfully his audience, or that he was &quot;worth anything at all,&quot; then this book belongs in that person's library."},{"Title":"Interviews With Francis Bacon","review":"There are some writers who are able to capture the essence of an artist through the interview format (James Lord's sitting for Giocometti is one) and in this book David Sylvester plumbs the depths of Francis Bacon's psyche like no other writer to date. Not only is his short book brilliantly executed in drawing out the artistic temperament and the especial qualities that chewed every aspect of Bacon's rich brain, it also allows us to sit back and hear the very personal aspects of Bacon's life, aspects that are occult in his cryptic paintings.

This collection of interviews, however, totally belies that notion, wherever I might have acquired it.\\"The Brutality of Fact\\" is a rich treasure trove gleaned from a series of discussions between the master artist and one of his most perceptive and sympathetic critics. Obviously, this book will therefore be invaluable to those who appreciate Bacon's work, but it is equally invaluable to anyone interested in art, art theory, and the creative process in general.As an interlocutor, David Sylvester asks the questions you'd want asked; for his part, Bacon is as forthright and forthcoming in answering them as you could hope him to be.From the images and artists that obsess him to the way he \\"throws\\" paint and rubs out images, from the role of chance in both his work and his life to the way he manipulates the accidents he encourages, Bacon seems to be holding nothing back. He speaks plainly of his goal as an artist and what he feels to be the goal of every serious artist: to rework reality by artificial means to create a new vision of the world truer and more intense than anything ever seen before. And he offers an insightful and incisive critique of what he perceives to be the shortcomings of abstract art, which eschews the world of objects altogether, and illustrative realism, which is simply redundant in an era with ample means of mechanical reproduction. His discussion of these two extreme attitudes towards the phenomenal world and his explanation of the way his own art seeks to mediate between the two are in themselves worth the price and time this book costs you to read.One of the best books by or about an artist that I've ever read, I found myself underlining passage after passage for future reference and inspiration.

I own an earlier edition of the book that I have virtually memorized, so the new additions and expansions David Sylvester has included stand out for me, and amplify the original edition considerably. Whether or not you are a fan of Francis Bacon's painting, the book offers Bacon's insights (as well as Sylvester's) on the very nature of creativity, obsession, and what drives artists of any kind (painter, poet, composer, etc.) to devote their lives to their chosen pursuits. Plus, Bacon's rather sulphurous personality and opinions are captured vividly on the page, through Sylvester's obvious freindship and fascination with the man. An absolutely essential, and rather unique book...over the years, I have been amazed at how many people I have met, from all areas of the arts, who have found this work a source of inspiration and endless fascination."},{"Title":"Interviews With Francis Bacon","review":"To be 100% honest, I'm not sure if I missed something that the other reviewers picked up or not, but I found the interviews with Francis Bacon to be fairly dull for the most part! Perhaps it is because I am neither a painter or an art critic. Regardless, I bought this book because I was interested in the philosophy and psychology of, in my opinion, the greatest and probably most unique artist in history. Although there are occasionally some wonderful insights into the mind of this painter, the majority of the first quarter of the transcript seemed to revolve around the interviewer trying to convince Francis Bacon that he knew the point of what he was painting, despite Bacon himself constantly insisting that he did not. Maybe my frustration about this and my wishes for the interviewer to ask Bacon some deeper questions skewed my perception of the rest of the book, but personally I was quite disappointed with a lot of the interview content.Despite having said this, there is still insight to be gained from these interviews, and the book is also presented beautifully with 146 photos (although black and white) of Bacon's artwork and some of the photographs and pieces that inspired him."},{"Title":"Gourd Seed: Poems","review":"What a wonderful collection.

CCNA was my 29th. Pass them all on the first try.At work I have access to some production Cisco routers so I can get some hands on. But of course I can't make any configuration changes. And I've been intimately involved with half-a-dozen Cisco installations. But to be good at configuring Cisco routers from scratch, you really as much hands on as possible. So thank you Todd for your simulator. Even though the its only good for following the built-in labs (only a subset of the CLI commands are implemented), it's the next best thing to having your own router lab.The book, on the other hand, is a waste. Todd must have been paid by the word. There were far to many screen dumps (he even tells you that two command produce the same output, then shows you the two identical screen dumps to prove it.) and far to few illustrations. And when it comes to screen dumps, there needed to be a lot more bolding or highlighting to bring out the areas of interest.I know from other posts, that people have used this book exclusively to prepare for the exam, and that's fine, if all you're looking for out of a book is passing the exam. For me getting certified is a mute point. I'll pass any certification exam I'm after. So what I'm looking for in a study guide(s) that provide a knowledge base (foundation) that I can build upon to improve my job performance.As I said I never rely on just a single book for exam preparation. Usually each book provides some benefit: a different prospective, or greater detail in one area or another. But in this case, I should have saved some money and purchased only the simulator instead of the combo.PS: Don't be fooled into thinking that the simulator and book go together. They were written as two totally separate products. You can't read the book while trying out the commands on the simulator. Too many of the commands just aren't there, or only some of the parameters are supported. And for the same reason, you can't perform the book's labs on the simulator. The commands have to be entered in exactly as they are presented in the simulator's labs. It's simply the difference between how a real router works and how the simulator works. The simulator is still a great learing tool, but as a stand-a-lone product."},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"Lammle generalizes a great deal in this text. Yes, he covers the fundamentals, but fails to give more detail information concerning LAN design, LAN Switching, and WAN protocol compatibility.A text for beginners, but I would not rely on it alone for the examination...It is the details that will make you or break you on the exam..."},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"When I passed the CCNA exam a year ago I used the CCNA Study Guide by Todd Lammle and passed the exam with a 924. Had I had this book I am positive I would have done even better. Lammle is the first name in Cisco Certification exam material and judging from the content of the book there is no doubt why.Lammle approach to the exam is by far the best I know of and studying the book in the order presented gives you the best chance of passing the exam on the first try. With Internetworking basics like the OSI model and topologies like Ethernet are the very beginning to the CCNA certification.From there Lammle has you working with switching, which I like because switching should come before routing. Then you move to the internet protocols, IOS, IP routing VLANs and router management. Lammle again makes sure that far more information than the exam requires is included.After that you then start working with IPX, Access lists and then WAN protocols like HDLC, PPP, Frame Relay and ISDN. Each section has review questions, the new thing I am very happy to see is both written and hands-on labs.The cd included has over 400 practice questions, over 300 flash cards for both the PC and the palm devices and entire e-book. Lammle again takes the opening and adds not 2 but 4 additional bonus exams.Finally as part of the study process is the use of an actual router and since this can be an expensive investment, Lammle has given you a Router Fundamental Simulator and practice labs. All this in one book and at a price that should make everyone happy. Whether certified or not, whether looking to refresh you skills this book is a must have for every router technician."},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"Last week I attended Todd Lammle's CCNA class, where I received a free copy of his 'CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate, Deluxe Edition (640-801), 4th Ed' (CCNADE4E). Todd's class was excellent, and his book is almost literally Todd in written form. There is hardly a wasted word in this book. If Todd mentions a detail concerning a protocol or a certain default value in a configuration parameter, it's important. If he calls out that same item in a 'Note', it's definitely important. This is not 'teaching to the test' -- it's ensuring students and readers are familiar with material Cisco considers relevant. Cisco started its certification program to ensure administrators could properly configure and deploy its gear. By reading CCNADE4E, you will gain that knowledge.Prior to attending Todd's class and reading his book, I was familiar with networking and related topics. I did not realize that successfully passing the CCNA meant being able to answer questions rapidly, not just accurately. This is especially important when IP subnetting and Variable Length Subnet Masks are involved. Todd teaches a method based on 'block sizes,' or the ranges of IP addresses associated with various subnet masks. This technique is incredibly powerful. I used to need pencil, paper, and at least a minute to answer subnetting questions before I learned Todd's block size method. Now I can answer the same questions in ten seconds or less (honestly). This is not a trick; it's a different way of looking at the problem, combined with memorizing certain key information.Beyond innovative approaches to learning certain topics, Todd's book is also exceptionally clear. I did not find myself wondering what he meant by a sentence, or questioning my understanding of his explanations. This is in stark contrast to a book on TCP/IP I read and reviewed five years ago. CCNADE4E is chock full of good diagrams, tables, and configuration and syntax examples.You could read only the book's text, but you would do yourself a disservice if you seek CCNA certification. CCNADE4E provides readers with questions and labs to test their understanding. These help CCNA candidates understand Cisco's approach to certain issues. Some of these questions really test the reader's comprehension of internetworking.I found the material to be overwhelmingly accurate. I found a few typos that I expect to see on the Sybex errata page shortly.If you're looking for a reference book to guide you through the CCNA testing process, look no further than CCNADE4E. If you work through the examples, you'll also find yourself able to perform simple to moderate configuration of Cisco routers and switches. I blew away the configurations on the gear in my lab, then rebuilt and improved them, using the knowledge I gained from this book and Todd's class. Isn't that what certification should be about?"},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"For the last 3 years I would have sworn by Todd Lammle's CCNA Study Guides; mainly do to his free-hearted writing style that seem to add an element of humor to complex reads. However, this book has far too many errors and lacked technical intensity. In the past, I used Todd's 607 Study Guide to pass the archived 607 exam on the first try. Two and half years later, I purchased the 801 Study Guide with the same enthusiasm. After reading this book twice, taking all 8 bonus exams repeatedly, and exhausting the capabilities of the simulation software, I took the comprehensive 801 exam this weekend and did not pass! My exam had multiple questions that were not covered in Lammle's book. Not to mention the lack of coverage of NAT, that seems to magically show up on my exam. None of which was covered with enough detail within this book. Moreover, the Virtual Lab was not exhaustive and far too basic (No OSPF, EIGRP or NAT simulation capabilities). In my opinion, this is not acceptable. Especially when I was faced with these topics through out my exam. I wish this book did a better job of pinpointing the areas that were and would be crucial on the exam. Although Todd Lammle attempted to do place emphasis on certain points, none of those points showed up on test day. Obviously, Cisco has made the exam harder to achieve by reading materials alone (even there own text). Therefore, accurate and thought-provoking supplemental materials are a must!!The bonus questions simply repeat themselves over-and-over again. The book as a whole lacked coverage on crucial technologies and is filled with confusing statements and answers that turn out to be mistakes- Go figure! All of which, led me to give this book 3 stars (maybe closer to 2 1/2)."},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"Todd Lammle seems to be The Name in CCNA preparation. I bought this book after reading recommendations from other CCNAs at the forums on www.techexams.net.This book contains the complete guide to the curriculum as well as some very useful background material on the CCNA certification itself and the format of the exam.The material is presented in a logical manner and consistent with the requirements for Cisco's exam. The style is readable and entertaining.The material on the CDs is also very useful, particularly the virtual labs, for when you don't have access to real routers and switches.Although I haven't yet completed my study I feel this book will prepare me well for the CCNA exam.One thing potential buyers of this book should be aware of: the PDFs on this book are protected by the FileOpen DRM software. This precludes reading the PDFs on anything other than a Windows box, amongst other legitimate uses. In my humble opinion the presence of DRM software is a consumer rights issue and should be clearly indicated by the publisher, which in this case they do NOT."},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"Last week I successfully passed the exam with 912 out of 1000.My only book was Todd Lammle's CCNA Study Guide. Starting from scratch, this book is really helpful, and you *should* learn it by heart. However, it's only one key to success, and you need a second one : sample tests, sample tests, sample tests ! Unless you're already a network admin with years of hands-on experience on various Cisco platforms, you gotta practice again and again the sample tests.The exam is made of 50-60 questions, some of them NOT in the official scope of the exam , such as NAT or IPX. Sometimes you'll be asked for the BEST answer, not the RIGHT answer.Anyway Lammle's CCNA study guide is what you need for the theory.I would recommend 2 months studying the book , and 1 month practicing sample tests.- 4 stars out of 5 -"},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"Mr. Lammle is still an excellent teacher/writer (the best), but the omission of some crucial material is a setup for test disaster. In particular there is little information on NAT, and zero configuration examples. 4 months ago I recertified on the CCNA and one of the simulation questions was NAT configuration and at least 3 multiple choice were on NAT router commands. I am now tutoring 4 other engineers using this book and we've had to use Cisco Press books to cover NAT and other material that is missing. The Simulator in this book will not do OSPF and EIGRP (both crucial, so we bought Mr. Lammle's routersim from www.routersim.com, this does allow these routing protocols, but VTP doesn't work correctly with the simulator switches. In hindsight I would definitely use Cisco Press now, it doesn't appear that Sybex is keeping up. The Cisco books aren't as well written or real world, but they have everything you need to pass the test."},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"I prepared my CCNA exam with this book and I passed with 974 on 1000.Very easy and pleasant to read.Most of the book is clear and topics are explained indepth enough for you to pass the exam.I really recommend this book as referene to prepare a CCNA because it cover exactly what you need to do it (and not more).However I would recommend to keep concentrate during your reading because there are some mistakes (I would say something around 10 mistakes on the overall). Mistakes appear more and more as long as you reach the final chapters (8-10). (Beware the &quot;Extended IP Access List Example&quot; on page 461. Very confusing mistake regarding the swap of permit and deny commands).Todd Lammle certainly should have had a deadline to write the book because the last chapter is written in a rush. And some topics would have require more details (such as Frame-Relay, ISDN, and DDR map command).A last remark : Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is poorly explained and difficult to understand from this book if you never read something about it.I would recommend to learn about STP from a different source.Personnaly I used the &quot;CISCO certification, Bridges Routers and switches for CCIEs&quot; book from Andrew Bruce Caslow &amp; Valeriy Pavlichenko (Editor : PH PTR). I borrowed it from a colleague of mine, and it appeared to be a very detailed guide about anything regarding switching, though it was not as cool to read as Todd Lammle books.Oh, btw. Don't miss at any cost to read the appendix B about Catalsyt 1900, or you could miss your exam !Don't misunderstand me.The perfect book dosen't exist. You will always find mistakes in book or unclear topics.But this CCNA study guide from Todd Lammle was really enjoyable to read, clear on an overall point of view, and efficient (I did it with 974/1000 successfull.)And the exam test provided and chapter review questions though different from the exam question were undoubtly very usefull to prepare the exam.Good luck ! ;)"},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"I absolutely agree with the other reviewers in that, given this book and basic networking knowledge, you do not need anything else to pass the CCNA. And for those of you who are worrying that this book is outdated because it covers the 640-507 test (not the 640-607, which Cisco released in March 2002), there is nothing to fear; I just passed the 640-607 using nothing more than this book to guide me!"},{"Title":"CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide (Deluxe 2nd Edition)","review":"I used this book ONLY and passed the CCNA test on the first try...that is what counts for me.

I do ,however, think a bit more time should have been given to ISDN and Frame Relay...but that is really my only gripe.The network simulator was invaluable, I don't think I would have passed without it. Not having access to a router, and no experience, the simulator really made the concepts in the book sink in for me.

This deluxe edition though, included the virtual lab which I thought would be important since I do not have actual equipment to practice on.I'm glad that I went this route. I passed the exam today using this book, the virtual labs, practice tests and bonus exams included on the two CDs. I took approximately 2.5 to 3 weeks to study. I enjoyed the way the book is written and layed out. At no time did I find myself falling asleep in material that was not presented well enough to keep me awake.

If you want to memorize information for the CCNA exam (or are recertifying and just need to be refreshed), this is the book for you.

Along with this book, I used the Cisco Networking Academy online curriculum, ICND, Ciscopress Router and Switch eSim, Transcender, and Preplogic. Hands-on experience with routers and switches was the key to my success, but I could have easily passed this test by using only the this book.

Cisco changed the exam from 640-507 to 640-607 and Lammle has kept pace with those changes in this must have reference manual.Placing the exam objectives right in the front of the book, you then move to a assessment test that is both challenging and as a true measurement of the new exam as I have seen so far. Updated to the new exam this 825 page book should be the first place you go to study for the exam.Layout of study guide is extremely important to the flow of material and that's why this book is so very good. Lammle starts off with internetworking overview and then to Layer 2 switching, from there you move to the IOS, routing, RIP, IGRP, VLANs, access lists, IPX, and WAN technologies, making this a very well rounded manual.With 36 written and hands-on labs plus and added 7 labs in Appendix B for switching, coupled with over 200 review questions and tips and tricks, Lammle has once again given the reader everything and more they need to have an excellent shot at the exam.Most books stop there but Lammle once again exceeds everyone by giving you 2 cdroms, the first is study tools like 200 practice questions, which include simulation type questions. 400 flash cards and 10 bonus exams along with the entire book in PDF format.The second cd has a virtual lab to work with, including instructions for setup and use.

It's the first graphic novel I've read cover to cover. It's a mix of manga and a Rold Playing Game, both of which I love.This is now my 4th favorite manga, the first three being Hikaru No Go, Naruto, and One Piece (all of which I recommend highly by the way).This is definately worth the money.

Beet is just plain boring.The plot is basicly just like BLEACH. only BLEACH is more exciting and more funny. All that main characters in Beet are doing is just slaying vandels/monsters and it gets so dull. And its not great for all ages. I was bored of it when I was 8 years old and right now Im 11. And if you think Im one of those people that only read the 1 st book, your wrong I read volumes 1-9. The only reason I gave Beet 2 stars is because the drawings looked cool.Over all its a dull and boring sieries.If you want a good manga to read try Naruto, or Mar.

When I put the cd into my player, nothing played. I tried the cd on another player at home, and still nothing played. The cd must be blank. Can I not get my money back because I didn't receive what I ordered?"},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"This is a 9 CD collection of live lectures that Hill conducted in Chicago in 1954. It covers the 17 Principles of Personal Achievement (also known as the 17 Keys to Success) over 12 hours. It amazes me that something so wonderful exists and is so inexpensive. I am more amazed by the fact that so few people are aware of it. It is a joy to hear the principles explained in Hill's own voice. I was not fortunate enough to take his classes, but this is the next best thing. This is the best way to get to know this great man. He was wise, humble and funny.There are thousands of self-help books out in the market and hundreds of self proclaimed \\"gurus\\" who have made a living by copying the wisdom in Napoleon Hill's books. As I went through some of those books I realized that there was not much in them that Hill had not already written about. I recommend quality over quantity. Instead of reading through many books, I recommend that you study the following works of Hill and internalize his wisdom:1.The Think and Grow Rich Action Pack(1937) - I recommend the Action Pack edition,2.Napoleon Hill's Keys to Success: The 17 Principles of Personal Achievement- this is an excellent guide to his principles,3.Your Right To Be Rich[Unabridged] - this item.By internalizing, I mean studying in depth - analyzing the ideas, making notes and summaries. I own more CDs by Hill, but I believe that these 3 items make the perfect study plan on the Philosophy of Personal Achievement.This philosophy is the end product of two decades of research conducted by Napoleon Hill. His research started when Andrew Carnegie (the steel tycoon who was then the richest man on earth) gave him the assignment of organizing a Philosophy of Personal Achievement. Hill, who was a poor journalist, armed with just an introductory letter from Carnegie, set out to interview over five hundred successful people including Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, John D. Rockefeller, George Eastman, William Wrigley Jr. and Charles M. Schwab. Hill then revealed the priceless wisdom of his research in the form of the thirteen steps to success (in Think and Grow Rich) and the seventeen principles of success (in courses and lectures he conducted).The concepts taught by Napoleon Hill transformed my life. Some of these include developing a definite purpose, building a Positive Mental Attitude (PMA), channeling the power of the sub-conscious mind and dealing with adversity. Everything he wrote about or talked about is thought provoking. His philosophy is universal; he did not mix it with religion. The riches he referred to were more than money, for the Philosophy of Personal Achievement can be applied to anything in life.Hill was well ahead of his time. \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" has a chapter dedicated to some of today's most important issues - Specialized Knowledge, Decision Making, Imagination and Organized Planning (in which he deals with Leadership). And his principles deal with Teamwork, Creative Vision, Health, etc.I am greatly indebted to Napoleon Hill. The purpose of my writing this is to spread awareness of his work so that more people can benefit from it. This, I believe is the best way in which Hill would have liked to have been repaid."},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"If you've read Think and Grow Rich, or any other of Hill's books, these tape recordings of Hill speaking live will set your heart on fire! Here he is, the Man who's made more millionaires than anyone else in American history...and he'll show you how to be SUCCESSFUL at fulfilling your purpose in life.These tapes are DYNAMITE! You'll hear Hill and his audience having fun with the powerful principles he taught so well... and listening to these recordings will inspire you to GO FOR IT! Can't recommend them enough!"},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"If you're feeling discouraged or lacking direction, listen to this and other recordings like it. I like this one better than \\"Think and grow rich.\\" Napoleon Hill has good guidance to keep you on track towards success and words that will lift your spirits and drive away the dark, negative thoughts that try to drag you down into failure. I think this recording should basically replace the bible. This IS my bible.Lately, I have started asking my subconscious to give me guidance on what to do, to tell me what the best course would be to get to my goals. I recently started out with a certain business plan, but soon after I started, I realized that plan was seriously flawed. It would require too much work for too little profit. So I asked my subconscious to give me a better plan. I did this by visualizing getting the exact success I wanted. Within a day or two, I got a much better business plan from my subconscious. Then I asked for further help with the plan and I got that also. Now all the pieces are falling into place, and NOW, finally, it looks to me like success is imminent and I know exactly what I'm doing. I have recently studied marketing a lot, and I've also studied my particular field of business and thought about it. Then I left it up to my subconscious to process that information and give me the best plan to follow to achieve my goals. It all seems so easy now.I used to be skeptical about using the power of my subconscious, but if you put yourself in a totally positive frame of mind and free yourself from doubts and fears, and then use the visualization techniques to see your success, then it DOES WORK. You open your mind to your subconscious and allow it to give you the answers you need - the direction and steps you need to proceed to your goals. You cast off your psychological limitations and allow yourself to proceed rapidly towards your goals. NEVER doubt your abilities. Do not worry about anything. But at the same time, act prudently, do your research, and use all the wisdom you've learned. Don't act foolishly or recklessly. Know what you're doing. Don't guess when you're starting a business.Make sure you have plenty of paper and write down plenty of notes while you listen. You learn FAR better that way. Also it's nice to use pens of many different colors and alternate between them. Your notes stand out much more that way."},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"I wasn't sure if I needed yet another Napolean Hill program. I already had Think and Grow Rich and few other tapes that Hill had produced. And I really didn't know if I was ready for 12 hours of tapes.Now that I have bought the tape set, I can honestly say that this was one of the best investments I ever made. Hill covers the 17 principles like never before. Hill is witty and funny too.This tape set is almost like a audio version of The Law of Success. It contains live lectures done by Hill in the 50's. If you have never heard Hill do a live lecture, then you must get this set. It is outstanding. Hill is fantastic and the material is incredible."},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"Great Investment! To hear Mr. Hill share his personal stories and place emphasizes on certain principles is wonderful. You will enjoy listening to the original motivational speaker.

You will be glad you purchased this set (especially if you can get it at a discounted price)"},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"Hello, I have listened to a lot of self help speakers and read a lot of books, about 150. I have to say that listening to mr Hill live is mesmerizing, 12 hours!!!. He talks and screams so i get very motivated and influenced. He is also very funny. He outlines all character traits and actions one needs to do to succeed with whatever one wants. He outlines 17 universal principles of success. It is not exactly the same as in law of success, it's like a mix between law of success and think and grow rich. It contains many things that are not in any one of those two books. I will listen to this program consistently since it contains almost everything i need to know to succeed and be the best i can be. I recommend everybody to buy it. It is extremely lowpriced for what you get for the money."},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"What makes Napoleon Hill's work last the test of time is the fact that it's not hype.

It's best to take notes.This collection is a must have for everyone."},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"If more people spent less time watching tv and more time educating themselves through these live lectures they would find more energy and probably get more excited about life, you only go round once.

I would also recommend the Science Of Personal Achievement and Think and Grow Rich."},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"I have listened to many motivation speakers over the past several years and this comes very close to the top. This program is the source; and I would have bought it long time ago if I knew it was available. Napoleon was ahead of his time! He was articulate, practical, humble and intelligent. This program is not about financial riches, it is about giving us a road map for success in all aspects of our lives (health, wealth, communication, relationships, growth and development, faith and more). The 17 success factors were explained in great detail with examples so we can put them to work immediately. If you travel this program is ideal for listening on the road. The fidelity of the recording is great and hearing Napoleon speaks was a treat! I recommend this program to anyone who is serious about taking charge of her or his life."},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"If you are a Napoleon Hill fan, (I became one not from \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" but from \\"The Master Key to Riches\\"),this will expound upon the great insights and truths he illuminates in his other works.

I also appreciated some of the \\"negatives\\" that are not referred to in his other works, such as keeping away from naysayers who will put you down, and the part envy plays in people who have no purpose wanting to sabatoge those who do (not the theme of his lectures, but showing you that his understanding is not a Pollyana type panacea).All in all, this is more from the greatest genius in self-help. Wonderful~"},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"Mr. Hill is the Godfather of teaching The Law of Attraction. Just listening to the first few minutes of him talking, he reveals the LOA in an easy and simple way for people to understand it! Listening to this audio mp3 cd, makes you feel like you're really there with him, and that he is teaching you the info that Andrew Carnegie taught him back in 1908. Mr. Hill is very witty and has sense of humor. One thing I liked what Mr. Hill said that a lot of self-help gurus out there don't talk about is, you didn't get the way you are overnight. It will take time to change the way you have thought, acted, and believed all these years! If you want the no-nonsense truth about how to be, have and do anything you want, listen to this, and you won't regret it. Another thing I liked was how he got the audience to interact with him when he asked questions. By getting them to answer the questions that Mr. Hill asked."},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"I have given this CD as gifts to many friends after it is my own personal favorite for personal development CDs I have listened to yet.

For me, listening to this disc, sticks in my brain more than just reading Mr. Hills books. After years of research Mr. Hill has covered all the bases, if anyone did even part of what Hill recommends they would almost have to be sucessful in their endeavors. The trick is that most people just will not do what they have to do for as long as they need create exceptional sucess for themselves. But if you want to commit to changing your life for the better, this one disc tells you everything you need to know and do. You need not buy any other book or disc, this one alone will do it. One small problem.

While much of what is in the CD can be gleaned from the book, it is good to listen to Mr. Hill's lectures to reinforce the material.That said, I must say I made the mistake of listening to the CD's in the car while commuting to and from work. The angst of driving in Southern California doesn't allow for proper attention to be paid to the material in the recordings. My suggestion is that you find a quiet, isolated place to listen to the CD's and then really focus on what Mr. Hill is saying. He is full of knowledge and is also an entertaining speaker. You will not get bored listening to him! It will be so much more valuable than zoning out watching mindless, worthless television shows.Much of what he says is really nothing more than common sense but it is helpful to have it all contained in one setting, plus how many of us know what we ought to do but don't do it? I believe if a person truly applies the principles and techniques advocated by Mr. Hill, there is no doubt they will be successful.The Amazon price for the 9-CD set is well worth it.

Audiobooks are usually are better choice anyway. As far as my research has taken me, this is the only Hill product needed, if any. He goes into all the principles in detail and leaves no stone unturned. Also, he gave these lectures in his later years so his ideas were much better developed than in his earlier books. I personally don't like Think and Grow Rich but they are different products. Your Right To Be Rich is actually about success. Think and Grow Rich is more about money.The funniest and most insightful part I heard in this massive set was when he \\"forcibly demands from his subconscious mind a million-dollar title for his new book\\". From what I can gather, he prayed so hard, with so much emotion, that the highest aspect of his being woke him up in the middle of the night and put the title in his mind: Think and Grow Rich."},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"I love this audiobook set.

I have never heard Hill speak but you can just tell he is absolutely committed to his philosophy by being such a shining example of it! He was paid a pittance when he was interviewing the hundreds of successful people that Andrew Carnegie introduced for Hill. It took him around 20 years to get all that data into a systematic philosophy for personal success! Who else would be more qualified to speak on personal success than Hill?!?This lecture series contains material that is not in Think and Grow Rich and the Keys to Success books. This should be the bible of success for everyone!"},{"Title":"Your Right To Be Rich","review":"I recommend this mp3 version with all 9 or 10 lectures on ONE CD. You can play this Mp3 CD on newer car radios, CD Players with Mp3 capability and even some newer DVD players through your TV speakers.

RCA also has one small CD Player that plays MP3's.And, THIS set of lectures IS VERY WORTHWHILE. I like this lecture series even better than his book in certain ways.

Also check out &quot;The Federalist&quot;, number 51.Now then, Bagehot, like Madison, describes the operation of a modern liberal regime. The trick for founders of liberal government is to produce a government that permits the people civil liberties, but does not permit the people to abuse those liberties, or in the words of Madison, to create a government that is &quot;democratic yet decent&quot;. Madison and the American Founders accomplish this end by so constructing the institutions of government that mens' selfish natures will be turned against each other (&quot;ambition is made to check ambition&quot;), rather than united in tyrannical concert.Bagehot too describes the operation of a system of government that rules by the consent of the governed, yet which does so by restraining the vices of those who ought not to rule. Bagehot argues that the English government is moderate and decent because of a division of government into the &quot;dignified&quot; and the &quot;efficient&quot; parts, and a &quot;noble lie&quot; about the relationship between the two. It is this noble lie that permits the government to operate without the interference of those who would turn it away from the public good. But to discover the noble lie, you'll have to read Bagehot.Warner WinborneProfessor of Political ScienceHampden-Sydney CollegeHampden-Sydney, VA"},{"Title":"The English Constitution","review":"If this is the unaltered version of the book of the same name and same author that I read about 30 years ago, it is a classic. It describes how the classic English Constitution worked, before Britain joined the European Union. Especially it explained how it worked without being written down, largely by constitutional convention which was morally binding but (quite often) not legally binding."},{"Title":"The English Constitution","review":"I am a law student in the university of Plymouth and i would like you to send me some information that this book contains, concerning the subject of the separation of powers. Your advice will be of great help. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Sound Pattern of English","review":"I'm going to disagree with the other two reviewers. It did not kick-start linguistics or phonology, which had been going for decades (if not a century). But it did give phonology a needed kick in the pants, for it showed that (a) native speakers of English had indeed internalized *some* means for predicting stress, and (b) it gave a set of rules that would predict stress.While phonologists have long since moved beyond believing that those particular rules are what native speakers have internalized--it is anything but the last word--it set a standard for what an account of phonology needed to accomplish. For it came closer than anything before (and than a lot of things after) to being observationally adequate, if not achieving descriptive adequacy. Accounting for a large set of data--a corpus--has certainly not been replaced by experimental techniques; the latter are simply another arrow in the phonologist's quiver.As for being obsolete, I guess SPE falls into the same category as writings by Galileo or Newton or Darwin: superseded in some sense, but still worth reading."},{"Title":"The Sound Pattern of English","review":"Despite the impressive phonological apparatus Morris Halle contributed to this work, the reader needs to look closely at the derivations proposed. In almost every case, the rule applications are no more than diachronic restatements. In other words, they simply recap the historical evolution of the current forms.That is because the concept of underlying forms is the stumbling block of Chomsky's theory, and although Chomskyians and their ilk try to avoid diachronic data, they really cannot in the long run."},{"Title":"The Sound Pattern of English","review":"The Sound Pattern of English (known as &quot;SPE&quot;) is the most complete study of the phonology of any language that has ever been undertaken. It is the last word on English stress, vowels, and consonants. It will also tell you everything you need to know about how to write phonological rules, covering complexities like parentheses, parenthesis-star, curly brackets, angled brackets, and everything else. Chomsky and Halle also tell us about their discovery of &quot;distinctive&quot; &quot;features&quot;, which are the universal sound system of every language. We owe them a great debt of gratitude for this stunning achievement. &quot;'SPE'&quot; was Chomsky's last work on phonology, so you can see what a loss it was that he decided to switch to syntax."},{"Title":"The Sound Pattern of English","review":"This is the only work on phonology by a worldwide known linguist Noam Chomsky. It has become classical on the matter being thoughtful and seminal. The book may be recommended to anyone who is seriously involved in phonology and general linguistics. The work can be considered exemplary for similar investigations in other languages due to its wide scope and scientific rigor."},{"Title":"The Sound Pattern of English","review":"Tis book kick-started the fields of phonology and linguistics, but it is long since obsolete. It's a work that is based on intuition, and the field has moved on to experimental techniques. Rather, I should say that experimental fields have grown up, like Psycholinguistics and Computational Linguistics, but linguists in Chomsky's tradition have largely ignored them.It's a work that describes English, but gives the impression that it is providing deep explanations of English. For instance, it popularized the idea of a \\"feature\\" as a basic, atomic entity in linguistics. But, 50 years on, features have led to many publications but few insights that have proved themselves useful outside the tightly knit community that uses them. Speech technology, for instance, never found features to be particularly useful.It's a Bible among a certain class of linguists, but it's not clear whether it has actually led to much."},{"Title":"The Blue Star","review":"This fantasy novel is set in a parallel world modeled on 1700s Austria; it's a conversation and society-building story, as opposed to a blood-soaked sword and sorcery tale. In this world, witchcraft works, and the talent is passed from mother to daughter at the moment the daughter is no longer a virgin. The daughter's lover takes possession of a five-pointed talisman from the young witch, the blue star, and with it can read the true thoughts of anyone by looking into their eyes. Rodvard is an ineffectual clerk in the government geneaological offices. He becomes part of a secret organization called Sons of the New Day, who want to destroy the whole corrupt Empire and build a totally new system. He is pushed into seducing a virgin witch named Lalette, so he can use her Blue Star to enhance their political schemes. Neither of them really care for the other. The whole affair quickly goes wrong, and they are both forced to flee an empire that barely tolerates witchcraft. This is a quiet story, though not without its moments of adventure. It will take some effort on the part of the reader, but it is very much worth it."},{"Title":"The Blue Star","review":"The fabled Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series began with the publication of this novel, and set the tone of the series immediately: high literary quality & genuine imagination, as opposed to by-the-numbers adventure. The word \\"adult\\" really applies here, in its best sense, because this is a tale of intrigue, nuance, and characterization. To be sure, there's plenty of world-building ... but it's a world not unlike that of Europe in the 1800s, where a certain amount of despised magic works, while gunpowder doesn't. No pseudo-Medieval claptrap here!Rodvard is a minor clerk in the bureaucracy of a corrupt, crumbling empire, who becomes caught up in an underground revolutionary movement to overthrow the current regime. To that end, he's assigned to seduce the young witch Lalette. As her lover, he'll gain access to the Blue Star of the title, a talisman allowing him to see if others are telling the truth or not. A useful tool for any revolution!Both Rodvard & Lalette are drawn as real human beings, both with unlikeable qualities, both rather shallow at first. They don't particularly like one another, and the heights of swooning romance don't enter into it at all. They're essentially using one another for their own purposes, and neither understands how unimportant they actually are in the greater scheme of things. At least, not at first.To me, this makes them far more interesting than the latest clones of heroic clich&eacute;s found in too many identical fantasy novels -- but it also explains why this novel is currently out of print, since it doesn't fit any neat mass-market niche. And that's a pity, because it's truly imaginative & different.So be warned! Those expecting swordplay, buckets of blood, and monsters of every special effects variety will be disappointed. Those who want an exceptionally well-written novel, however, set against a fascinating background, will find much to enjoy in these pages. And if possible, get this first Ballantine edition, with the gorgeous cover art & the informative introduction by Lin Carter, whose love for the genre comes through in every word.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Blue Star","review":"This is a long overlooked fantasy classic.

It is a remarkable, adult book."},{"Title":"Binding of God, The: Calvin's Role in the Development of Covenant Theology (Texts and Studies in Reformation and Post-Reformation Thought)","review":"Much more than an analysis of Calvin on Covenant, this is a really helpful discussion of the historical development of Covenant Theology in general. Exposing various past misconceptions of Covenant Theology's roots, and carefully documenting its distinct progression through various reformers, Lillback in this work skillfully paints his picture with primary source material.He details how the concept of covenant in the Reformed tradition is much more than a section in a confession or a chapter in a systematic theology, but is an integrating principle or presupposition which functions as a paradigm, regulating and informing not only every area of theology, but our entire relation to God in history and eternity.This work will be very useful also for the careful gathering and exposition of numerous quotes from Calvin and others, detailing what distinguishes Reformed theology from Lutheranism, on such things as the relation between law and gospel, the relation between Justification and Sanctification, and the role of the Law in the life of the believer.There is so much more here of value which could be mentioned, I'll just mention one other: the relation of the covenant to the sacraments, namely how one's view of either the mutuality or one-sidedness of the covenant impacts whether the covenant meal (Eucharist) is seen as mutual or merely testamentary.The bibliography here is extensive; the index quite adequate; there are several helpful summary tables and charts; footnotes are (thankfully) at the bottom of the page.This work is Peter Lillback's Dissertation at Westminster Theological Seminary (PA), completed in 1985. After he turned it in, they set a page limit of 400 pages on dissertations, his being almost twice that (double spaced).If you are interested in Covenant Theology, the development of Reformation and Post-Reformation thought, Calvin, or simply how you are to understand the relation between faith and obedience, you must purchase this book."},{"Title":"Binding of God, The: Calvin's Role in the Development of Covenant Theology (Texts and Studies in Reformation and Post-Reformation Thought)","review":"Professor Lillback counters many deliberate modern misconceptions surrounding the origins of Reformed covenantal theology, above all substantiating through historical sources why the inaccurate claim of Perry Miller and Charles Ryrie that Calvin had nothing to say or add to the covenantal debates that surrounded him, have no real grounds. When you look at theInstitutes, it's hard to imagine.In the Middle Ages the Continental feudal system of lord and serf, as did the soldier's oath of allegiance sworn to his military commander, provided a cultural frame of reference for common covenant usage and its terminology, all of which came to be included under one classical Latin term - the 'testamentum'. It was fully binding. The merging of the two concepts - cultural and religious - was inevitable as 'in time the sacraments themselves began to be conceived of as oaths of allegiance' (p 31) to the Vicar of Christ - the pope. Under it the pope, ordained to power by God, enjoyed absolute papal supremacy and allegiance, and the abuse of ecclesiastical authority remained uncontested for fear of sanction, or much worse, accusations of religious heresy. In this historical context, on pain of death, Martin Luther's stand in bold lines was larger than life. Luther was the first to say: 'We are saved by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone.' But Luther permitted covenant theology 'to fall under the table.'Covenant theology began with the German-Swiss Reformed. Ulrich Zwingli of Zurich was not alone in considering the covenant years before the arrival of the struggle with the Anabaptists. In Basel, Oecolampadius' views too predated the conflict. In the earliest stage of its shaping, writes Lillback, 'Oecolampadius assumes covenant unity, since this is true for the circumcised and the baptised. Thus he joins the unity of the covenant with the sacraments.' p 84 Zwingli saw the independent Anabaptists, who in their scheming acted autonomously from Scripture, as a threat to comprehensive reform. In conclusion, in a public disputation called by the council of Zurich in 1525, Zwingli and Bucer won the day. Zwingli then, insisted on unity between the two covenants and for the first time in Reformed antiquity, appealed to the Abrahamic covenant for the legitimation of infant baptism, as it is still in force today.After the death of Zwingli, Calvin developed close relationships with his successor, Heinrich Bullinger of Zurich, and Martin Bucer of Strassburg. Two years before Calvin's first edition of theInstitutes, and a year or two before Luther lectured on Genesis, almost a decade after the Anabaptist controversy erupted in the cantons of Zurich, Strassburg, and Basel, Heinrich Bullinger publishedDe Testamentoin 1534, the first Reformed defense of covenant theology. Justification was the first blessing of the covenant, per Genesis 15, but covenant obligations, blessings and sanctions remain, per Genesis 17. The Rhinelander saw a strong element of promise in the sacrament signs of Genesis 17, much of which was to be fulfilled with the first coming of Christ. Lillback summarizes in part Bullinger's contribution: 'When the Savior came, the covenant itself was realized. God's duty in the covenant is fulfilled in the 'Immanuel' or God-with-us. The duty to obey the God of the covenant is seen in all of Christ's teaching. The apostles also fit this pattern as is seen in Paul's constant citations of the OT, where he continually sees Christ.' p 111Luther was no friend of Anabaptism, but hisCommentary on Galatians(1535) unwittingly did much to revive its cause. Luther's Law vs. grace dichotomy was largely the result of his Reformational emphasis being placed on the ordo salutis, by which he applied the two covenants of Galatians as two stages: one to the old man, and one to the new man. In contrast, the magisterial Reformers of the 16th century took the two covenants in Galatians and applied them as two successive, yet interconnected stages in redemptive history, its unifying thought being that hereby God binds Himself to the redeemed people in all ages through one eternal covenant. Luther's severe comments show that he concluded that they were guilty of confusing Law with Gospel. Bullinger saw the charges of Rome or anyone else against the covenant as an attack upon the Gospel, the oldest of all religions (Gal 3:8). 'There were tremendous tensions between Zurich and Wittenberg reformations.' p 113Martin Bucer took the time to write the Lutheran community with the signing of the Augsburg Confession (1530), restating a constant objection from all quarters to Luther's 'dashing the teeth out of the law' that it led to licentiousness. 'But all of the sacraments, whether circumcision or baptism, point not only to the forgiveness of sins by justification, but also of the necessity of the obedience of faith.' p 119 Lillback offers historical evidence to refute Baker and Trinterud and to carefully conclude that all the Reformers held to a mutual agreement, rather than a monolateral promise as Luther insisted. 'The gracious work of the Holy Spirit was inseparable from the free gift of righteousness in the Son none the less.' p 124 Bucer saw the gift of the Holy Spirit as the principal promise of the new covenant, written by God upon the heart, and with it the enabling grace to perform what was commanded in Scripture. 'For Luther, it was 'faith alone'; for the Reformed it was 'faith working by love.' p 125 Hence, Oecolampadius insisted that new covenant salvation is accomplished through the giving of the 'new law' or 'the law of the Spirit'. The Reformed response came in the form of the First Helvetic Confession (1536).Lillback then summons the intentional testimonies of the eminent Reformer, John Calvin. Calvin responded with the Genevan Confession of Faith (1536). Calvin's apologetic disassociation from the radical Anabaptists is also a warning to Lutheran theology. Calvin unfalteringly insists: 'In asserting a difference between the covenants, with what barbarous boldness do they dissipate and corrupt Scripture! And not in one passage only - but so as to leave nothing safe or untouched! For they depict the Jews to us as so carnal that they are more like beasts than men. A covenant with them would not go beyond the temporal life, and the promises given them would rest in present and physical benefits. If this doctrine should obtain, what would remain save that the Jewish nation was satiated for a time with God's benefits, only to perish in eternal destruction?'Institutes4.16.10 The strength of Calvin's argument for the continuity between the old and new covenant was that, in anticipation of criticism, it allowed for discontinuity. The French Reformer also upheld apostolic analogies to a tee. Calvin significantly improved on Luther's cessationist view of the Law in his ownCommentary on Galatians(1547) where he employed a three-fold use of the law in his masterful hold on the great themes of sin and grace. Harmonized with the other Reformers, Calvin taught that faith alone justifies, but faith is not alone: 'For when this topic is rightly understood, it will better appear how man is justified by faith alone, and simple pardon: nevertheless, actual holiness of life, so to speak, is not separated from free imputation of righteousness.'Institutes3.3.1 Moreover Calvin, following Augustine, used the term 'new covenant' in two distinct senses (p 158).The prospect of modern critics to separate the magisterial Reformers is undone with the finding that Calvin and Bullinger's works on the covenant agree. Based on the plurality of his comments, assessments and profitable treatments, it can no longer be denied that Calvin's mature federal understanding in his works 'possesses a logical consistency tied directly to his exposition of Scripture.' p 161"},{"Title":"Binding of God, The: Calvin's Role in the Development of Covenant Theology (Texts and Studies in Reformation and Post-Reformation Thought)","review":"I liked it, though evidently it is considered \\"off-limits\\" in some Southern Presbyterian circles. Lillback gives a painstaking analysis of the history of covenant theology, seeing it culminate in the Calvinist tradition.I liked how he notes that infant baptism for the Reformers was grounded on Zwingli's continuity between Old and New Testament.Lillback makes the claim that whereas Law-Gospel was the architectonic framework for Lutherans, Covenant Theology was so for Reformed. I think that is brilliant. I got in trouble, though, when I said it.Questions:What do you mean by \\"Calvinist tradition?\\" Lillback's reading presumes some form of objectivity and continuity in the covenants, and I think that is certainly a superior way to read Scripture. Presumably, Calvin thought so as well (see Mcgrath's work on Calvin). However, as many American Reformed scholars have pointed out, the later Calvinist tradition also posited areas of *discontinuity* and non-objectivity in the Covenant as well (the reader needs to consult Heppe, and for what it's worth, Scott Clark's gloss as well; though I agree with Lillback contra Clark in the end. I just acknowledge that Clark, too, has legitimate sources)."},{"Title":"Victoria Rose's Christmas Caroling Party","review":"Anyone who goes Christmas caroling needs this book.This book has the lyrics and music of the songs:Jingle BellsThe First NoelDeck The HallsO Christmas TreeSilent NightHark!

A fantastic mystery story and a fantastic cat!!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"Robert Farrar Capon is a very enthusiastic, passionate author with a very definite point of view. It is definitely in his favor that he takes a biblical approach, patiently explaining why the Bible, in his view, teaches that the whole world is in Christ, and therefore the whole world will be saved. This is the \\"mystery of Christ\\" to which he refers. The only ones who will not enter into heaven will be those who pointedly reject the free grace of God, which the author believes will be continually offered even after death.Capon loves Jesus' parables (he has written three books on them, one of which I have read), and draws much of his theology from those parables. Some of the parables presented in this book (the Sheep and the Goats, for example) are interpreted in the light of Capon's universalism, which results in some novel interpretations. Not that that's always a bad thing, indeed, his interpretation of the parable of the Ten Virgins is quite enlightening. Just the fact that the \\"wise\\" virgins are portrayed as being selfish and snippy show the reversal in the Kingdom of the good and the bad, and that nothing is received on merit, all on grace.I don't give this book a relatively low rating because I'm anti-univeralist (I don't happen to be a universalist, although I'm always open to change), but because I have some issues with certain things in the book that just cannot be easily resolved. Capon gives far too much value to astrology, and without much explanation except for the fact that his wife is a professional astrologer. It has always been my conviction that astrology is anti-Christian and anti-intellectual (in simpler terms, both Satanic and a crock), and those who engage in it are either deceived or are spiritual flim-flam artists. Anyone who deems astrology acceptable and then tries to teach me Christian theology suffers a severe credibility problem. Another stumbling-block is that the author doesn't seem to take sin very seriously. That problem is addressed in the book, but not in a very convincing manner. Some things that, from a biblical standpoint, are indeed sin are deemed a non-sin in this book (sprecifically homosexuality).I enjoyed the format of the book, alternating between one-on-one counseling sessions or conversations and group discussion of those situations. One of the discussion participants fits my profile really well. That participant, while he learned a lot, still had reservations at the end. That is my position as well."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"Robert Capon paints outside the lines! He doesn't attempt to appease the Evangelical religious mind by re-stating what everyone else is saying or have said. If you are really interested and not afraid to think deeply and desire genuine intimacy with the LIVING LORD JESUS, concider the mystery of the gospel; it is really great news.If you are still enjoying the religion of Christianity, you are probably not ready for Mr. Capon's works. If you are tired of trying to measure up and \\"serving\\" and pastor worshipping, and just know the Gospel is much more than what you are living in; then, I encourgae you to read this one---IT IS FOR YOU! You are free, you know?"},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"Robert Capon is a dedicated thinker, but he is a bit too cute to get to some real meat of the thought problem. The book did nothing to answer some of the theological questions that I have as a Christian of strong faith but still one with many questions. He provides little reasoning or rationale, just an admonition that faith and belief is all that is required. Christ is a mystery so leave it there and just believe! Just don't think to heavily."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"Several of the reviews have mentioned astrology in relation to this book. Don't let this put you off. It's only mentioned briefly in one chapter, and only then because the author's wife is an astrologer. People are making a mountain out of a molehill.Unfortunately this book only managed a three star rating for me. The fictionalized discussion group chapters dragged the whole book down."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"When I was just starting out in my new Christian faith I stumbled onto Robert Capon's writings, including this book. Perhaps it was providential, because the insanity of his theology mirrors that of Luther, and it drove me into the arms of the Roman Catholic Church. This stuff is Luther's inconsistent, confused take on the Gospel, carried to its logical conclusion. Luther denied the value of human works and efforts to do good in the economy of salvation, and so does Capon. They both trample roughshod over the Epistle of St James, not to mention the Gospels and the Epistles of St. Paul. Capon extracts the teaching on the necessity of faith for salvation, from its context in all of the New Testament, and, like a follower of Luther anxious to push the boundaries even further, makes even the act of faith \\"trash\\". Yes, that's in this book.I spent many sleepless nights trying to reconcile Capon's insistence on our universal salvation, granted by God through Christ's death whether we repent or not, with the many sayings of Our Blessed Lord and the teachings of St. Paul that insist on repentance and amendment of life in order to be saved from eternal damnation. Remember, Our Lord warned that the Tower of Siloam may have killed some people who happened to be in the way, but that we would all likewise perish unless we repent. Capon gets around these hard sayings by putting irony in the mouth of Our Lord. That irony is certainly a reflection of Capon's twentieth-century Northeast-Corridor mindset.What Capon is missing is that after we are moved by the gift of faith to be baptized, the Holy Spirit, if we cooperate with Him, will give us the graces we need to overcome our vicious tendencies. This is ignored in all of Capon's writings (and I've read them all). So according to him, we are home free, acquitted in full and in advance of all our sins, and left to deal with this weird \\"freedom\\" by a God who (in Capon's words in another of his books) is \\"rooting for the cancer cells\\" as much as He roots for us. He has invented an extreme form of Luther's doctrine, one which leaves us with no reason to add our works, penances, love, and sufferings to the work done by Our Lord on the Cross.In sum, avoid this book unless your faith is strong enough to take on the author's bad theology. You'd be far better off reading \\"Summa of the Summa\\" by Peter Kreeft as an intro to Thomistic philosophy, and then reading the Summa Theologica. (Luther, by the way, despised St. Thomas Aquinas, and that tells you what a poor thinker Luther was.)It would nourish your mind far better than this nonsense, and would be a better introduction to the essentials of the Faith held by the Church right up until Luther's rebellion."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"If such concepts as &quot;Both heaven and hell are populated with forgiven sinners&quot;, &quot;God isn't in the sin-prevention business....He is in the sin-forgiving business&quot;, and &quot;the argument between Cheap Grace and Costly Grace is ridiculous, because Grace is FREE&quot;, are intriguing to you, then get and read this book. It is a thought provoking delight!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"With his characteristic wit, humour, digression and depth, Robert Ferrar Capon has delivered another book centred about grace. In his always inimitable way, Capon is able to present an old theme in a new way, using various writing styles and techniques to get his point across.Having read &quot;From noon to Three&quot; and this book, clearly Capon wants to emphasize - no, pound into your head - the idea that God has done it all, that grace is free, that God simply does not see our sin anymore. He must have quoted the verse &quot;there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&quot; and it is the entire world who is in Christ, and we are in Him. This is part of the mystery.As a pastoral tool Capon's perspective is refreshing and greatly needed in our works-loving, bookkeeping Church. Capon writes like a prophet, warning us that we fall too easily into the danger of thinking we have to &quot;do&quot; something. I also enjoyed his discussion of ways that we can view the resurrection. This was an education and well thought-out section of the book.Of course, I have a &quot;but&quot;....I was continually uncomfortable with Capon's approach which, while he claims is theological, often plays fast and loose with the Bible. He was unconvincing in his analysis of the sheep and the goats parable. Moreover, I did not appreciate his several jabs at Bonheoffer, nor his implication that the &quot;medieval&quot; theology of Luther and Calvin, qua medieval theology, was unacceptable. Capon claims that, instead, he is more &quot;biblical&quot; - a term too often bandied about these days.He speaks near the end of ways that our lives need to be, not acceptable to, but &quot;congruent&quot; to the mystery of Christ. And this would seem to me to mean that congruent should be biblical, but no....instead it is okay to practice astrology as if it gave us even the &quot;weather&quot; of things. Meanwhile the bible specifically indicates that it is not a godly practice. How is it then congruent that his wife is a practicing professional astrologer? No, I do not &quot;condemn&quot; her for it, only to question how he can make this claim.Given that Luther has expounded so well on the grace of God, I think Capon takes it too far somehow and goes somewhere that is not warranted. Now, if he read this, he would think that I was falling back into &quot;medieval&quot; or &quot;works&quot; theology. No, I just am not convinced that what he argues is fully biblical. It's not that I want grace to cost anything, just that I think he is not convincing."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"I read this for the first time shortly after becoming a Christian. Earlier, I thought Christianity meant constantly avoiding sin. Capon points out that we will always sin, but the Good News is that God loves us anyway. He emphasizes love and hope, and does not waste energy on the little questions. And he exhorts us also to remember that we do not need to waste our energy on the little questions, but to instead remember Jesus' commandment to love God, ourselves, and each other. This book increased my new-found joy in knowing God's love."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"I am not a Christian, and certainly not well read on the subject. But after living around strongly Christian influences my whole life, I feel safe in saying this book is the healthiest, most responsible expression of Christianity I've ever encountered.

And anyone who puts themselves on a sanctimonious pedestal would do well to give it a go too!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"This book was one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read on Christian theology.

Like a skilled surgeon, Capon gently moves his reader through the maze of misrepresentations many of us heard and read in church or on t.v. toward the most convincing array of facts concerning not only the many sayings attributed to Jesus, but also to how we can confidently and safely live into the Way that He promised to us.I found so many useful interpretations and questions in this little volume that I will continue to study and admire it for decades to come.I urge anyone serious about Bible study and living Christianity to read this, one of Capon's best in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"I am a fan of Robert Capon. This book is an addition to an already impressive list of books on issues of faith, forgiveness, grace and relationship. Using his typically reader friendly style, Capon puts to rest those pesky arguments for adding works to the \\"finished\\" work of God in Christ. He deftly illustrates that the Bible is clearly a book about GRACE, redemption and forgiveness.Religion is about control, rules, judgement, and exclusion . . . genuine faith is about inclusion, forgiveness, love and above all . . . Grace."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"James Carpenter's review on the back of this book states: &quot;This is an exuberant, triumphant theology... A rigorous Paulinist, Capon is at least half right--a very good score for a theologian!&quot; I tend to agree--Father Capon is at least half right. He focuses on grace as a free gift to such an extent that he loses the transformative aspect of Christianity almost completely. As long as you have faith/trust/believe then you're home free! As God has already done away with the consequences of all sin, all guilt, in Jesus' death and resurrection, no one is condemned any longer. Therefore, the only people who will be in hell are those who reject the free gift of grace. They will not be there for their sins. I agree, but see sin as the blocking off of God's grace. By sin I don't mean the mistakes and stumbles we make along the way, but pure out-right nastiness.Capon is so adamant about the fact that no works can earn grace and that no sin can separate you from God's love and forgiveness, that he leaves one thinking you can go on doing whatever you like as long as you accept God's grace. Once again, I agree, but apparently have a different understanding of what accepting God's grace means. To accept God's grace is to let his love and grace flow through you. It's transformative. You can't be nasty when God's love is flowing through you, and when you are, you're cutting off the flow. When God's love is flowing through you, you *can* do whatever you like--it's just that you want like to do anything nasty. ;)Sin blocks one's acceptance of grace--its still there, but you can't see it. God never stops loving or forgiving, but if you blind your vision by clouding it over with sin, you can't see the grace all around you. Its not that &quot;works&quot; are necessary to accept God's grace through faith, but that they naturally flow from you as a result of that acceptance. &quot;Faith without works is dead&quot; as St. James wrote. In Capon's theology, you apparently don't have to follow Jesus to be a follower of Jesus. You don't have to &quot;take up your cross&quot;--just believe that Jesus did.Near the very end of the book Capon does add that &quot;I myself take sin very seriously. As far as I'm concerned, it's what messes up my life, so anything I can do to resist it will make me, and those around me, a lot happier than we presently are.&quot; That, to me, is the key to the Christian life. Capon, however, simply sees it as an option of the Christian life, not it's point. While I don't think God will judge us for our sins, I do think the clouding of our vision caused by our sin is what puts us in hell--now and later.I very much agree with Capon's rejection of &quot;transactionalism&quot;, however, and think he has some wonderful things to say about the &quot;Mystery&quot; of Christ that is everywhere present. I agree with him that &quot;what God revealed in Jesus was his Incarnation in the whole world.&quot; He has a panentheistic understanding of God's Incarnation, seeing the world in God and God in the world, and Jesus as a sacrament and revelation of that Incarnation.I give the book four stars, however, not because I agree with all of Capon's theology, but because his theology makes you think and brings up some very good points. Plus I found the book to be an enjoyable read and like Capon's sense of humour. :) So it's recommended, with reservations."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"Who wrote the book description for this book here on Amazon? It is so far off base!The book description says this: \\"Capon uses a variety of exchanges to drive home his point that salvation can be achieved not just through faith, but by active works.\\"This is the exact opposite of the message of the book. He goes out of his way to show that works has nothing to do with it! We have complete forgiveness from all sins, past, present, and future, apart from any works whatsoever on our part! That is part of the central message of this book, and to say that \\"salvation can be achieved not just through faith, but by active works\\" is to completely misrepresent the book.Anyway, this was a great book!I have been a proponent of the radical free grace of God for about fifteen years now, by which we get eternal life as a completely free gift of God, with no strings attached, and no works required on our part to gain, keep, or prove that we have eternal life.This is one of the best books I have read which defends and explains this central truth of the biblical gospel.But the book is no dry theology book. Drawing on his vast counseling experience as a pastor, Capon lets us listen in on six counseling sessions he has with various people as they deal with various sins, doubts about faith, and issues with life. The issues range from a woman who is having an affair, to another woman wants to know about reincarnation and astrology.The reader gets to listen as Capon gives alarming, yet shockingly refreshing, answers to their questions and fears. After these counseling session chapters, Capon provides a chapter where he tries to anticipate and answer all of our objections to what he told the person in his counseling sessions. For most of the book, he puts these questions and challenges in the mouths of a diverse \\"discussion group\\" which meets to discuss his counseling sessions.Throughout the book, Capon presents a view of grace, the universal forgiveness of all sins, and the presence of Christ in everybody at all times which is contrary to most of what is taught and believed in most churches today, but which seems to be closer to the radical grace of God which is presented in the both the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.I strongly recommend this book! Even if you disagree with most everything Capon says, you will still be challenged to think about the central claims of the Gospel."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Christ . . . and Why We Don't Get It","review":"I have cherished this author ever since I discovered The Third Peacock as a young adult.

Nevertheless, in anticipation of that and in response to another review posted, I would just say that this is one of the best commentaries on Song of Songs available now. To be sure, others have offered worthy and provacative theses r.e. female authorship, etc. What Exum provides is exquisite attention to the language of the Song. Where past commentaries tried to nail down the Song to just one meaning, Exum offers here a commentary that consciously and explicitly explores alternatives. That may be frustrating to some who expected a bold single reading, but it is more true to the Song of Song's multiple meanings. In years to come there is a good chance that Exum's commentary on this multivalent book will be seen as a predecessor to a new, more useful form of the commentary genre. This commentary is recommended for anyone working on the Song of Songs, for courses on Song of Songs, and for those who just want an excellent companion as they work through the book -- there are no better choices."},{"Title":"Song of Songs (Old Testament Library)","review":"Cheryl Exum has done the most thorough investigation ever of the Song of Songs, exploring its eroticism to the fullest while expounding and critiquing the full range of perspectives found in the history of Christian commentary."},{"Title":"Song of Songs (Old Testament Library)","review":"Feminism is what it is, feminism. It isn't truth, but it can be entertaining. I think these are women with a grudge. Entertaining."},{"Title":"Song of Songs (Old Testament Library)","review":"I will be upfront about this - the Song of Solomon is penetratedby a profound feminine interiority. Surprisingly, this workby a recognized feminist biblical scholar resists this understanding. In her earliest writing, Professor Exumtreated the author as male at face value. Quickly learning that this position was untenable, she then took the view that the poem could have been written by a male or female but she would not stake a claim to the sex of the author. Now, in this book, she retreats to the position that feminine authorship is a distant possibility. Curiously, at a time when even conservative Christian theologians concede that (more likely than not) the poet was a women, the position of J. Cheryl Exum makes little sense in light of her other feminist thinking.Due to her other books, I expected a daring and imaginative analysis. Instead the work is so...mainstream. Its fundamental flaw is that the author never develops a theory that unifies the language of the poem. Marvin Pope and Michael Fox see it as entertainment at love feasts; Andre LeCocque understands it as a protest poem subversive of the prophets; Ellen Davis sees it asa celebration of the sacred. Renita Weems argues that the Song is a poetic model for individual empowerment. Perhaps it is some if not all of these things. But Professor Exum grasps the Song of Solomon as nothing more than a canonical work of lyric poetry. Even if that were the case, one would expect a translation sensitive to the musical idiom. Instead, her translation is quite pedestrian. Due to the author's studied effort to provide uncontroversial opinion, this work is appropriate to high school as opposed to critical university study."},{"Title":"The Pharmacy Technician Companion","review":"This book is great for those considering a career as a Pharmacy Technician.

Having lived most of my life among holocaust survivors and their children, I have heard and read alot of stories in several languages.

Extensive research in archives and interviews lead to short sketches of courage and rescue.Gilbert divides the book up by geography which gives the book some order. Many of the stories of courage are very short and thus the number of them is overwhelming, at times you don't realize that he has shifted to another story. Another fascinating element of the stories is the various methods that were used to save lives. Some so ingenious and others so horrific you can't imagine how anyone could survive under those conditions.This book is at turns a wonderful monument to those who risked everything to save others but in the end you are struck with the fact that every 100 saved from some town -- 1000's died. It is well worth the read but be prepared."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"There are no words to do justice to this book or the people whose stories are featured in it. It should be required reading for all those who insist this horror didn't happen."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"Martin Gilbert has written extensively on Jewish issues. His main contributions are this work, a 'History of Israel' and 'The Holocaust'. His other books are far superior to this one and I was disappionted by the seemingly sloppy writing style and jampacked but shabbily constructed book.This is a ONE OF A KIND affair. This book details those that saved the lives of the Jews during the holocaust. it details gentiles and Jews who went out of their way, risking their lives, to save even one person, but int he case of Schindler or the Bielski brothers thousands.The book is arranged by country and region and details the number of Jews living in the area in 1939 and the number killed in the holocaust and then explains the number saved and by what means.In countries like Italy Gilbert shows how the people did not have the anti-semetic vigor of other places and so many of the Jews survived.The author shows difinitevly that the French collaborated with the nazis and were quick to volunteer to help round up the Jews, this is because France is a profoundly anti-semetic country and the stain of the holocaust must be broguht to bear on its present nazilike actions. Gilbert shows the many competing politics of Poland that also fueled the hate and destruction of the Jews in that country.Gilbert does not show, however, the importance of the Danish King who did so much to save the Jews. This is a lost chapter that deserved more work.The book is one of a kind and deserves to be read. Gilbert obtained his list of the 'Righteous' from Yad Vashem and he has been loyal to the Israeli official list of those that helped the Jews.It to bad that with such a long list of people that saved even one person the book ends up sometimes feeling like a long list of names and short descriptions of deeds. Their might have been a better way to present it and still uphold the message Gilbert was trying to make. Gilbert also shows how it has taken so long for people to be recognized for their deeds, a tragedy unto itself. These people that risked their lives to save just one person, are so important because they show to us what can be done in the face of evil.This book will help you understand how if you save one life you save the world."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"Top Yad Vashem rankings (p. 462): Poland (5,632 rescuers), Holland (4,464 rescuers), France (2,171 rescuers)...as of January 1, 2002. Gilbert also includes detailed maps of the European cities and towns where the rescuers lived. This book is also chock-full of photographs, and has an extensive biography.Rescuers from the German-occupied nations surveyed include those from France, Germany and Austria, the Scandinavian nations, the Low Countries, and especially Poland. The reader learns about Zegota, the only underground organization of its kind devoted to the aid of Jews. Irena Sendler, who lived to nearly 100 before recently passing away, is also featured.Unfortunately, Gilbert uncritically repeats Jan T. Gross and his charge that Poles were the unassisted killers of Jedwabne's Jews. Other sources, including strictly Jewish ones (The Warriors: My Life As A Jewish Soviet Partisan (Religion, Theology, and the Holocaust)andDeliverance: The Diary of Michael Maik, a True Story) identify the Germans as the main killers of Jedwabne's Jews, along with a few mostly-coerced Polish accomplices.There is, of course, much, much more to the subject of gentile assistance to Jews than can be covered in this book. Those readers specifically interested in an in-depth and candid study of both Polish rescuers and denouncers of Jews should go to the Peczkis Listmania: Righteous Among Gentiles: Polish Rescuers of Jews...Betrayers Too."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"I have long appreciated Martin Gilbert's works. His compendium of the Holocaust, titled \\"The Holocaust\\" in my opinion is one of the best works on the subject. This book may not be in the same league, but is of no less importance, for it focusses on the people who risked their lives to help the Jews in occupied Europe during World War Two.Some of the accounts are just mere sentences, but reading them all gives one a better picture of these heroes, many of whom were ordinary people who had everything to lose, yet through individual acts of heroism, made a difference in the lives of the saved Jews."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"I received this book as a gift one Christmas (kind of an ironic time to get a book on the Holocaust) and this book so caught my imagination that I started reading it that evening and finished it by 5:00 am the next morning. Is this a book to sit there and analyze the Holocaust, no it's not. This is a book to record the actions of those who chose to risk their lives, to look the other way or partake in the destruction.As a former history teacher who has talked to students many times about World War II and about making choices personal choices, I really appreciate a book that tells the stories of real people who made \\"righteous\\" decisions. It is a tough read with much that is hard to stomach, but at the same time it is the story of those who were saved and that is so uplifting. I appreciated that it was broken down into regions and countries in regards to the stories of these rescuers. It is so good that as part of the Holocaust someone realized that these stories need to be recorded also and not forgotten. For me as a person I really enjoy books that tell how people overcame extreme hardships or showed positive characters traits in tough times when everyone was struggling just to survive. An amazing book to read!"},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"Author Martin Gilbert had written yet another excellent book, this time detailingthe darkest time in human history and that is The Holocaust.This book deals mainly with those who rescued Jews during The Holocaust and somestories may seem familiar because a few, maybe more, I have read in Gilbert's bookThe Holocaust (1986) which was another well written book on the subject.The rescuers of the Jews, there stories are told in this book. Not every story can be toldof course but many are and each nation is listed in each chapter followed by the storiesof those whom dared risked their life to save a Jew or perhaps hundreds of them or more.A great book."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"This is an excellent book that makes known the relatively few wonderful people who were willing to risk their lives to save others innocent of any crime other than their jewishness.The heroic deeds of the few thousand gentile rescuers were all the more praiseworthy because they did it despite their societies, despite the anti-semitism that was often part of their own cultural background.Most people were with few exceptions such as in Denmark willing to sacrifice their jewish communities without protest or worse. The nazis in many places could only carry out the Holocaust so efficiently because of the collaboration of the local populace such as in Ukraine and the Baltic countries. In the Ukraine the locals were known to be worse than the Germans, in that they were happy to be able to torture the jews before killing them.But there were many wonderful people in all the occupied countries prepared to risk not only discovery by the germans but also being informed on by their neighbours. Being betrayed by locals was a very real risk and led to many deaths."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"This book is misleading in that it minimizes the incredible collaboration of not just Germans but Poles, French, Dutch, and other Christians who made the holocaust possible. This is especially true in the chapter about Poland Government General. This chapter recounts maybe 20-30 Christians and gives details of how some risked their lives to save Jews. Approximately 5,500 are recognized by Israel as \\"righteous Christians\\". But at the very end of the chapter , the author states that there were very likely as many as tens of thousands of Polish Christians who went out of their way to assist the Germans in capturing and sometimes killing Jews themselves. So a good analogy of the thesis of this book is if a group of people, 25 to 50% of whom committed serious crimes but 2 to 5% of whom cooperated with the police even though they faced retaliation from the criminals, they are somehow to be forgiven. The author seems to have difficulty facing the reality that the overwhelming percentage of Christians hated Jews. In another book he authored, he revealed he can't face the truth that his idol Winston Churchill, was the worst offenders amongst British leaders in stealing most of the Jewish National homeland, which includes not only present day Israel, but Samaria and Judea (the misnamed \\"West Bank\\") and the most fertile part of Jordan, giving it to Arabs who had no connection to the land and attempting to prevent the Jewish people from governing themselves in their homeland, and collaborating with the non-indigenous Arabs who only in the 1960s became the \\"Palestinians\\" which are a fictitious people. It is only typical of Churchill, whose main concern during WWII was protecting the British Empire and secondarily fighting the Nazis when threatened the British Empire. Gilbert should write a book on how the British who were given \\"temporary\\" governing rights to the Jewish National Homeland \\"Palestine Mandate\\" ,until the Jewish people could organize self- government and develop the necessary infrastructure to reestablish self- rule in their homeland, gave almost all of the land to a non-indigenous people (Arabs), and are responsible for the current \\"Arab\\" Israeli crisis. Speaking of European nations who collaborated with the Nazis, Britain by barring Jewish immigration to their own homeland from 1930 to 1945 in order to have access to Arab oil , were indirectly responsible for the deaths of perhaps up to several million Jews."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"I read this book to learn the motives of those who risked themselves to shelter Jews in WW2 (a valuable subject) but was sadly disapointed. It's as readable (and interesting) as a telephone book.Try Browning, Kuznetsov, Sereny, Rhodes, Hilberg, Wiesenthal, etc"},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"Martin Gilbert has written more on the Holocaust than, perhaps, anyone else. This, his latest work, is deserving of special praise. Gilbert looks at the many non-Jews who played personal roles in saving small and large numbers of Jews during WWII. He spends time discussing the better known saviors such as Schindler and Wallenberg, but he also looks to the lesser known people who risked their lives to save one or two at a time. He examines the many married couples who took in Jewish children and protected them as their own, and he looks at the many religious officials who hid children in convents and churches. Gilbert's examination of these relative unknowns is very good reading, and his detailed and painstaking research into so many people is obvious. This book is wonderful for so many reasons. It is an excellent history -- a history of a subject all too forgotten -- and it is a refreshing portrait of an otherwise horrible time in the history of mankind. These individual saviors stand out against a black background, and Gilbert's writing serves them justice and gives them the recognition they deserve."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"After attending a seminar on teaching the Holocaust, I needed a little inspiration, so I purchased this book, which recounts the stories of hundreds of Jews who were rescued by non-Jews during the course of the Holocaust. Each chapter addresses a different part of Europe and the rescues that took place within that region, mostly through first-person accounts. The stories are very compelling and show quite clearly how much people were willing to risk in order to do the right thing when so few were willing to do so. The downside to the book is that each story is probably worth a chapter on its own and not just a paragraph or two; however, since this is one of the few books I've seen that puts all of the stories together in one place, so it's a worthwhile trade. On the whole, a very good book--though it is depressing to think how few were ultimately willing to help out their neighbors and do what what right and decent."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"This book has gotten a lot of praise for its treatment of a subject that has been overlooked for too long. That being said, this book -- as a work of history -- has some serious flaws. It is a collection of anecdotes, lacking analysis.Each chapter contains scores of tales and anecdotes of rescue. The author does little to link them up. He provides scant analysis contrasting his different anecdotes or establishing patterns of rescue (e.g. those who did it for money vs. those who acted out of religious belief or ideology, cities vs. villages, etc.). The chapters are arranged by country or geographical region of Europe, but there is hardly any discussion explaining why some countries had higher rates of rescue than others. It doesn't seem as if Gilbert has a working thesis that he wishes to defend through his evidence. Rather, it seems that he went to the Yad Vashem archive and collected as many interesting tales of rescue as he could find and then categorized them by country for his book.Because it is filled with many, many interesting stories, this book will chiefly be of interest to \\"lay readers\\" or armchair historians with an interest in Holocaust studies. Professional historians and scholars of the Holocaust may use this book as a resource (esp. for teaching), but they will quickly stumble upon this book's limits."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"This is the first book that I am aware of that deals with the indescribable bravery of the multitute of unsung heroes all across Europe.Thus it is a nice complimentary effort to his other book entitled \\"The Boys\\", which narrated the stories of the several hundred children who survived the horrors of the Nazi death camps.The only reason why I did not award it a 5 star rating is because each incident is invariably condensed in one or two paragraphs. This was perhaps made necessary by the sheer number of acts of rigteousness that the author had to cover. In my opinion, he could have covered fewer number of situations but covered them in greater depth.Nevertheless, the book astonishes the reader by narrating the acts of supreme courage shown by the rescuers when they perfectly understood that they could lose their lives if their acts of kindness were discovered.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"I can't say this is a 'Happy' book. The period in which it is set is too terrible and many of the misdeeds described are too terrible to speak of.But the Joy in this work, the proverbial Silver Lining is there were good people during this period. Many of whom happily risked their lives for strangers. Opening thier pockests and their homes to the hunted with no expectation of rewards of any kind. Some of these heroes were actually anti-semites who drew a line within thier own souls to do good for those they did not like. Just as many of the villeins were mercenaries who did what they did for just money, not caring who thier victims were. And the Author admits he can not tell the stories of all these heroes but just the few mentioned here.Besides the noble deeds of the great humanitarian scoundrel Oskar Schindler, who so reminds me of the hero of the Film The Music Man, and the simple Dutch farmsers the Bogaards who turned their farm into a sanctuary hiding Jews from the Dutch police, We hear of an SS man who hides a Jewish inmate from one of his superiors in Dachau. A gypsy family who hides a Jewish Girl. Nuns and priests who hid Jewish children. So many risked their lives and liberty for strangers. And many paid for those lives with thier own. So many heroes, just not enough to do any real effective damage to the beast at work.It is good to know some good people did exist during these evil times, and that is the joy of this book.I must also say I do not like the Israili supreme court changing their designation from Righteous Gentiles to Righteous Persons.It cheapens these heroes and prevents the casual observer knowing the full extent of their nature. There are Men. There are Women. And then there are 'persons'."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"This book isn't so much &quot;written&quot; as it is &quot;assembled.&quot; On the other hand, the research task accomplished here is gargantuan, and it's a good deed to make these testimonies easily accessible under one cover.There were a larger number of good people who helped Jews and put not only their own lives at stake, but the lives of their families, than I imagined. Many of whom gave their lives and those of their families in their effort.Splitting meager rations of food among too many people, creating special hiding places around their homes, smuggling documents, all to save the lives of neighbors and strangers; all these selfless acts and more are recorded to offer a different view of ordinary citizens during the War.Mostly the rescuers are Christian because of the region, but there are a few Muslims in the mix and even a few sympathetic German soldiers.One story that I was familiar with, I was kind of disappointed with the treatment it received in this volume. A Polish woman named Irene Opdyke saved 9 Jews under the very nose of a German Major. One day, he accidentally caught her with those she was hiding. The book (p. 45) says she was able to convince the Major &quot;somehow&quot; not to turn her and the Jews in. It does not say that she bartered her innocent 17-year-old body on an on-going basis for the lives of the Jews she protected. (I have not read it, but her book is called &quot;In My Hands&quot;). I don't know a 17-year-old who can figure out how to bag groceries let alone hide 9 Jews from a German Major in his own home.I suspect there was much more of this kind of exploitation going on than the book would lead one to believe. Not an especially good read, but a good deed, and uplifting information."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"One element of Martin Gilbert's writing has been the telling of individual stories which normally would have not had a part in most works of history. He has written of the Shoah( Holocaust) in a way which gives the name and story of many ' ordinary' individuals a place they would not ordinarily have.His collecting the accounts of righteous Gentiles is the same kind of holy work.There is another important point about the moral value of this work. Even among the most cruel and evil peoples involved in the Holocaust there were exceptions, human beings who give hope that there is a ' saving spark' in all peoples."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"I've never read anything of Gilbert's before. Apparently he is a major documentarian of the Holocaust, and this book is very much needed for reasons I will explain later. The format of this book is basically a chapter concerning each country invaded by the Nazis and the efforts of the few (compared to the many who turned their heads and ignored the fate) who attempted to rescue their friends, their neighbors, and the strangers who came to them who were of Jewish backgrounds. Each chapter names those whose names are known, who are honored in Israel in the Vad Yeshem Righteous Among the Nations. It also tells the stories of some of these rescues, and though given the fact that little is known concerning these rescue attempts (as many involved are dead)...the book could have been written in a better way than a mere listing of those involved.What is interesting about this book, is the surprising number of those who were complete strangers who took Jews in. Also, information concerning those who were anti-Semitic but totally disagreed with Hitler's Solution who risked their lives and the lives of their families in order to save individuals and family groups. It becomes evident that more children and women were saved, then men. Many ministers, and Catholic monks and Sisters also saved many Jews on their own initiation, with disregard for their own safety.Even though this book is dry reading, it is necessary reading. Why? Because in this day and age, when inroads are being made on individual rights across the world, it becomes necessary to ask ourselves, 'what would I choose to do in this situation?' I would hope that I would show the courage of the many Gentiles demonstrated in this book, regardless of the fact that my religions and beliefs differ from anyone involved in a move towards genocide regarding one group or one people. In the U.S. we have had this happen (regardless of those who would ignore our history) with the Underground Railroad...but these persons were not threated with immediate death for protecting those of color. As so many of these righteous gentiles said \\"Do it, because it is the right thing to do. ..."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"My reaction to this book was that it showed two different themes. One was the theme mentioned in the title, the unsung heroes of the holocaust. The other was its opposite, the villains of the holocaust.As we read about this or that Christian who risked all to help a stranger, we also read about the Nazi collaborators, the anti-semitic actions taken, the villains of the period. This book makes you angry, with a cold hatred. It makes you hope there is a Hell, a suitable punishment for acts of cruelty committed during this life on Earth.How many times do we read about helpless sweet children below the age of six being hunted down by grown men, insane men, stupid men, sadistic men, Germans and their collaborators.In one of the reports, we read about a little 5 or 6 year old girl who is asked her name. She answers with the Christian alias she was given, and then she cheerfully adds that her real name is something else, a Jewish name. Why must this little child be careful? What kind of world was she living in, that forced insane, unnatural caution on an adorable child?Perhaps my \\"favorite\\" report in this book is when the Germans were tipped off by an informer that a little 5 year old Jewish girl was being cared for by a Christian family. These grown German men tracked the little girl down. They had already decided to kill her, but that was not enough for them. First they had to make her final hour one of panic and pain. They whipped the child. When they were done with their sadistic fun they killed her. Then they killed the Christian family of eight that had cared for the little girl.It is amazing that this sick German culture actually believed that they were in some way \\"superior\\" to the Jews. Not for nothing, but these Germans were morally inferior to a pack of wolves, certainly sub-human.The book is infuriating. If it does not infuriate you, there's something missing in you.But there are positive things in here too. I am not referring to the acts of individual heroism, which, by the way, seem to be carried out more often by women than men. I'm referring to the nations in which there was no anti-semitism.Denmark, Albania and Bulgaria are described that way in this book. I knew that Denmark wasn't viciously anti-semitic but I learned from this book just how beautiful a people the Danes were. And I had absolutely no idea that the Albanians and Bulgarians were so kind. I'm impressed. Belgium also came across very well.I was disappointed to learn that Holland was not as gentle and civilized as I had thought. This book tells us that Holland had its share of anti-semites and informers. It seems to be about equal to France in the fact that while the majority wished to protect the Jews, a sizeable minority were quite happy to slit Jewish throats.This book tells us just how bad the Polish people were in general, most of them perfectly happy about the holocaust. After all, the Jews killed Christ, so they were only getting what they deserved. Amazing that people think that way. Some people seem to have descended (as opposed to ascended) from the ape. There were also many Polish heroes in the book, all the more impressive given the general attitude prevailing in the country, with its added risk of informants.But of course the inside track to Hell is owned by the German people. Even their allies the Italians considered anti-semitism the German disease, and refused to cooperate with the murders. Italy, and the Pope, were portrayed very positively in this book. I was told elsewhere that the Pope was a Nazi collaborator, but he didn't appear so in this book. The Pope, here, was a strong supporter of the Jews, and saw to it that all of Italy was too, except for those Italians who milked Jews for every penny they could extort.I understand why other reviewers would object to the writing style of this book. It is a series of anecdotes. They are just piled one on top of the last. But it is a reasonable way to approach the subject, if your aim is to recognize the unsung heroes of the holocaust. Okay, here's this hero, here's the next, and this is what they did. It's not a novel. The organization and the writing style are what they are.I expected to read more about the Croat attempt to exterminate both the Jews and Serbs during this period in history. The Croats were cruel, which prompted the reprisal by the Serbs as soon as Marshall Tito died. We think of the Serbs as the villains of Yugoslavia, but during World War Two the Eastern Orthodox Serbs and the Jews were victims of the Catholic Croats in an extermination that was truly German in its cruelty. I mention the religion of the Serbs and Croats only because that is the only way to tell them apart, since they are one and the same people racially, differentiated only by religion, according to another book that you can buy on Amazon, whose name I have forgotten.The next time some racist idiot says there was no holocaust, hand it this book."},{"Title":"The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust","review":"Martin Gilbert is the greatest historian on the subject of the holocaust out there, and is one of the most prolific historians of today.In The Righteous, Gilbert describes the many cases of righteous gentiles, throughout Nazi-occupied Europe, who risked their lives and all they had to save Jews, many of them children, from certain death at hte hands of the Nazi killing-machine.Gilbert describes the heroic actions of those brave and righteous gentiles, by region describing the action of the unsung heroes in Eastern Galicia, Vilna, Lithuania, Poland, Warsaw, Western Galicia, Germany and Austria, Central Europe and the Balkans, Norway, Finland and Denmark, France, Belgium and Luxembourg, Holland, Italy and the Vatican and Hungary as well as in the Camps and on the death marches.In some cases, entire nations came together to say no to Nazi evil, and to save the Jews of their country.Denmark, Bulgaria and Albania stand out in this regard.Irene Grunbaum wrote in her memoirs that one day she would tell the world how the Albanians 'protected a refugee and wouldn't allow her to be harmed even if it meant losing their lives. The gates of your small country remained open, Albania. your authorities closed both eyes, when neccesary, to give poor persecuted people another chance to survive the most horrible of all wars. We thank you'.Morechaie Paldiel writes that 'An overwhelming majority of the Albanian population, Muslim and Christian, gave refuge to two thousand Jews in their midst, resulting in the almost total rescue of the Jewish community'.While Gilbers describes the hroism of the Danish and Bulgarian people, he does not write enough on the very special and noble roles, to save Jews, taken by King Christian X of Denmark and King Boris III of Bulgaria.Despite the collaborators and local anti-Semites in these nations, whole towns and villages came togehter in some cases, in France, Belgium, Holland and Greece, to save their Jews from Nazi anihilation.Nazi Germany's allies, Italy and Hungary rejected Nazi genocide of Jews, and did what they could to save the Jews. Italian occupied zones in France,the Balkans etc were safe zones for Jews. Only after direct Nazi ocupation were the Jews of these countries taken to the death camps. Finland also protected her Jews, and the neutral countries like Spain, Portugal and Sweden played a role in saving a number of Jewish refugees.Many Jewish children were taken in by Christian families throughout Europe and looked after them as their own.In Poland and the East, the penalty for just having contacted a Jew was death.There are many accounts of the recue and care of Jewish children by saintly people and families, during the war.I will mention a few of them.*In the Novogrudok region (which is today in Belarus), one of those saved was a baby, Bella Dzienciolska. 'Her parents had entrusted her to a farmer to hide. She was blonde and did not look like a Jewish child, but at two years old she already spoke Yiddish. So the farmer made a hole under the floor and kept her there during the day for a year until she forgot to speak. He then took her out and told the neighbours that a relatives child was staying with them.'.Bella Dzienciolska suvived the war, and fifty years later, returned to the farm, and found the hole under the floorboards where she had been hidden.Other children were hidden and raised by nuns and churchmen, in abbeys, monasteries, churches and hospitals and schools run by the Church.* In the small town of Licskowke, in Eastern Galicia, Father Michael Kujita hid eight year old Anita Helfgott, a fugitive from the ghetto of Skole, in his parsonage. Later a Catholic couple, Josef and Paulina Matusiewicz gave her sanctuary. She survived the war.* In Czstochowa, in Poland, Genowefa Starczewka-Korczak gave sanctuary to a little Jewish girl, Celina Berkowitz, shortly before her parents were killed. When the Nazis executed Genowefas husband she was forced to place her Jewish charge and her own two daughters in a Catholic orphanage. But each weekend she brough all three girls home.* In the Siedlce region east of Warsaw, a poor peasant widow gave shelter to two Jewish girls, Eva, aged 11, and Batja, aged 5, sisters who had escpaed from the Warsaw ghetto and wandered for several moths through the Polish countryside.Fearing betrayal, the peasant woman took Ester and Batja for sanctuary to Sister Stanislawa Jozwikowska, in the Heart of Jesus convent, near the village of Skorzec. 'I was dirty, ill, weak and full of lice' Batja recalled years later, 'The nuns washed me thoroughly, put me into soft pajamas and put me in a clean bed'.Despite the convent being occupied by German soldiers, nobody knew of the girls Jewish identity except the Mother Superior, and.Sister Stanislawa Jozwikowska. Sixty years after having been given shelter Batja recalled \\"Mother Superior Beata Bronislawa Hryniewicz healed me; she recovered my soul by great love; she pampered me as her own child; she dressed me nice and neat; she combed my hair and tied ribbons in my plaits; she taught me manners (she was from an aristocratic noble family). She was strict but fair with my duties; to pray, to study, to work on my character, to obey etc, but every step was with love, love love!'Children, who were rescued by righteous gentiles, included Israel Lau, later Chief Ashkenazic rabbi of Israel, and Aharon Barak (out of the Kovno Ghetto in a suitcase as a child and hidden by a Lithuanian farmer), later President of the Supreme Court of Israel from 1995 until the middle of 2006.Many people chose to help out of moral reasons or out of love for their charges. These people were Saints!These stories are being re-examined at a time when some, like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad deny the Holocaust happened-while working to carry out a real holocaust against the Jews , while others forget history and aim to dismantle the Jewish State, built to a large extent by Holocaust survivors."},{"Title":"The modern corporation and private property","review":"About 6 years ago I visited the White Eagle Conference Center in beautiful central New York. This is a quaint place that must have been a real marquee in its time. On one of their obviously long under used book shelves (seemed like nothing had been touched for at least 2 decades) I noticed this book, an original copyrighted 1932 version. I couldn't put it down. It presented a thoroughly well written, seminal treatment of the conflicts that senior leaders exhibit even today, a full 75 years later. It explained in vivid detail the deeply entrenched, inextricible human behavior that is observed consistently by senior leaders from organization to organization today. The plain and simple bottom line is that unless you're an insider, you're nothing more than overhead to be tolerated. The SEC was created by sheer necessity to protect the public. Businesmen 'talk' about how they care about other people but the unvarnished truth is that their friends and family are the only ones who matter. This book is great foundational work providing insight to the reasons why we need a strong SEC. The only thing that has changed in the human conditon is technology. The DNA that drives human behavior hasn't changed for thousands of years."},{"Title":"The modern corporation and private property","review":"\\"The Modern Corporation and Private Property\\" was hailed as an instant classic when it appeared in 1932. To my knowledge, it was the first book to spell out how modern corporate capitalism is characterized by pervasive oligopoly and the separation of management from ownership. These points are still valid today, and remind us that modern capitalism has little in common with the social system analyzed by Adam Smith and other Classical economists. However, most of \\"The Modern Corporation and Private Property\\" is taken up with an out-of-date, pre-SEC review of corporate finance law as it existed in 1930. As a result, the book will be of little interest to most modern readers, even though it is a \\"must\\" purchase for any serious library of books on economics or corporate governance."},{"Title":"The modern corporation and private property","review":"This is an excellent, timely book on modern corporate structure and its philosophical and legal underpinnings. It was written over 65 years ago, but it is as relevant now as it was then. The large scale government chartered collectivist enterprises we know as corporations were well developed by the early 20th century. Over 80 years ago, most of the economy was controlled by these collectives, and most of those collectives were controlled by their management and not their owners. In fact, some of these enterprises might have hundreds of thousands of owners.Berle and Means dissect what this change means in terms of Adam Smith's theories and more modern legal theories. What does it mean when one owns property that is controlled by others. What checks are there on the authority of corporate officers in their fiduciary roles? Who is the beneficiary of their trust? These questions are as relevant today as they were when this book was published.The world of the unbridled modern corporation has its defenders, most of the sort that George Orwell called bully worshipers, that is, those who worship power, the more, the better. Unfortunately, as we seem to discover every generation or two, these structures have serious shortcomings when it comes to providing the goods and services that we expect. Today, as when the book was published, we are in a period of reassessment. The private sector has failed horribly, showing itself unable to manage the nation's finances, produce automobiles or deliver health care.When times are good, people forget that corporations are just government chartered collectives, and what the government creates, it can monitor, modify and control. Berle and Means point this out clearly as they outline the rise of modern corporate structure. It was not created in one step, nor did it evolve naturally. Berle and Means then turn to the remedies that might restore the nation's faith in its private sector. In fact, one section of the book underlies much of modern security law, including such innovations as bans on insider trading, the creation of the SEC, reporting requirements, and restraints on the assignment of earnings and on issuing shares.Berle and Means, and those who followed their advice in the New Deal did their job well. For decades, the markets ran smoothly, and when things are running smoothly, people forget the lessons learned. The engine of our economy needs a tune up, perhaps even a rebuild. This makes it a good time to learn something about how the engine works, and how it came to work that way."},{"Title":"The modern corporation and private property","review":"I was lucky to have Professor Berle as a teacher at the Columbia Law School. I read the book then (in the early 1960s) and re-read it recently. It is timely reminder that the corporation--that great engine of our prosperity--has undergone significant (and not for the better) changes--not only from when the book was written, but also in the forty-four years since I read it last."},{"Title":"The modern corporation and private property","review":"This book has been a classic in legal literature since it was first published. It is amazing how current and up to date it is!

Perhaps one of the greatest.Sincerely,Paco Manolo"},{"Title":"The modern corporation and private property","review":"This book was NOT the first to stigmatize giant corporations for \\"the separation of ownership and control.\\" Rather, the key to the book's success was the timeliness of its appearance, during the Great Depression, not because it had anything new to contribute to our understanding of publicly traded big businesses. Far from being a riveting spellbinder, the prose is dry and never eloquent. But it possesses far more serious defects, e.g. that the alleged novelty of 20th century corporations -- that passive owners contribute funds to an enterprise that is run by others, professional managers -- is hardly anything new. The same status has always existed for limited partners in a firm with a managing partner; they must keep silent, exercising no voice or vote in management, lest they lose their limited liability status. The \\"innovation\\" actually began five centuries earlier in the great Italian merchant ventures: noblemen, clerics, widows and others unsuited to business affairs or uninterested in business decision- making, entrusted their wealth to entrepreneurs, in exchange for a share of the resulting profits. Berle & Means never acknowledged that dividing investment and management into two distinct functions is an example of specialization or division of labor-- and that everyone's participation is voluntary. Common sense asks: if shareholders really are being systematically shortchanged or abused, why do people continue to buy shares in giant corporations, and why do they buy new stock issues or reinvest their dividends in these companies? For a devastating dissection of the Berle & Means book, see Robert Hessen's essay, \\"The Modern Corporation and Private Property: a Reappraisal,\\" in the Journal of Law and Economics, June 1983. Or, more accessibly, see Hessen's 1979 book, IN DEFENSE OF THE CORPORATION, in which he rebutted the Berle & Means thesis which Ralph Nader had invoked to justify federal chartering of corporations."},{"Title":"The modern corporation and private property","review":"Detail review of how corporations operate and the role shareholders play in buisness.

A book at the graduate level like Cox and Hinkley or the combination of Lehmann's two books. This is the book you get if you want a comprehensive treatment of the subject.If you are interested in a more concise text,see Essentials of Statistical Inference by Young and Smith.

Schervish covers the necessary probability background, classical and Bayesian decision theory, and hypothesis testing comprehensively, while maintaining a level of rigor suitable for math majors (the appendix nicely summarizes requisite results from measure theory and mathematical probability). It covers most if not all of the classical results found in Lehmann's TSH and TPE, but from a more modern perspective. This permits a more coherent, well organized presentation. The only (minor) drawback I found were some typos here and there -- to be expected from a first edition of a 600 pager.

A Collection of Independent Studies","review":"This book is a collection of independent articles by various authors. It ends with a letter of Saint Athanasius himself. These various essays try to answer the questions that came about in 1988 about excommunication and schism because of the Episcopal Consecrations of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. And by association so was the status of the Society of Saint Pius X. Both the Archbishop and the Society are known supporters of Catholic Tradition.The articles do a good job on showing how he did not incur an excommunication according to canon law. This is one of the strongest arguments in the book. Also shown is how the Vatican II instituted new ideas that ignored the tradition of the Church. And we can see some support from both sides. The book also tries to answer, is Catholic Tradition arbitrary?These essays are a good collection of studies explaining the situation of Tradition within the Catholic Church. Even though this was first published in English in 1993, many Catholics are still unaware of this conflict within the Church.Two quotes on the back cover grab your attention. The first is by Pope Saint Pius X, \\"The true friends of the people are neither revolutionaries nor innovators, but men of tradition.\\" And \\"Even if Catholics faithful to Tradition are reduced to a handful, they are the ones who are the True Church of Jesus Christ,\\" by Saint Athanasius."},{"Title":"Artes Latinae,","review":"Dr. Sweet was a professor of Latin who had the very brilliant idea of teaching classical Latin by means of programmed learning texts.

The main characters are likable enough, certainly, but nothing. ever. happens. There is no narrative tension and no real plot, no conflict, no obstacles for the characters to overcome, nothing of substance--just a vaguely pleasant meandering toward an indefinite conclusion. Even the much-anticipated baby seems to disappear into the background once she arrives, like a sitcom baby whose birth is a great episode for sweeps week but who is conveniently asleep off-camera for every episode thereafter.Perhaps my opinion was tainted by reading this book too soon after Alison McGhee's \\"Shadow Baby\\" -- a book with both style AND substance. Colwin suffered in the comparison. However lovely her sentences and paragraphs may be, in this case they don't add up to anything greater than the sum of their parts."},{"Title":"A Big Storm Knocked It Over","review":"Although it has a few gems, this book desperately needs an editor. With all the character's pedestrian musings on life, marriage, sex, children, and the meaning of true happiness, no conclusion is reached, no epiphany occurs, nothing *happens*. Character and scene development rely on descriptions that are repeated in each chapter with no new information; the main character feels the same emotions again and again with no new insight. The result, to me, is a dissipated, meaningless manuscript containing some glaring mistakes (Germany is 6 hours ahead of the east coast in the winter, not 15; no woman drops to her original weight a few weeks after having a baby). I feel an editor is needed to make this into a novel I would enjoy and recommend."},{"Title":"A Big Storm Knocked It Over","review":"Where is the big storm? Where is the story?

Some have been accurate in their depictions, but i find that i read a lot about love and don't quite connect with the emotions or with the characters. With this book, Laurie Colwin wiped me off my feet. I can totally put myself in the shoes of Jane Louise, who wants desperately to make everything OK for her husband, who cannot understand how someone so lovely could have been treated badly by others, who gets outraged at the thought that her beloved suffered at some point in his life. This is one of the key corners of love, and i have yet to find other authors that put their finger right there. This was an awesome love story. I watched a movie on PBS called &quot;Ask me Again&quot; some 12 years ago, and i have not been able to forget it. What do you know? Laurie Colwin wrote the script. Thank you for leaving us with such terrific books and movies."},{"Title":"A Big Storm Knocked It Over","review":"Years ago, I used to look forward to issues of Gourmet to see if another of Laurie Colwin's whimsical, insightful, and so well-written essays would be included. Then, with no warning, came the announcement that \\"this will be her last submission to Gourmet,\\" as she had died unexpectedly and at far too young an age.That's the first I learned that she'd written several novels, so I began reading all of them. A Big Storm Knocked It Over was her fifth and was published posthumously.Happy All the Time is my favorite of her books, but this one is pretty damn good. Like all of Colwin's books, it's quiet and introspective. Jean Louise is a NY book designer whose boss, Sven, comes on to her all the time - and JL can't deny the attraction. But she's totally happily married to a calm and pretty ordinary chemist. Then she gives birth to a daughter, and her joy is complete - almost. She still has those unspecified hankerings, the feeling she's maybe missing something. It's Colwin's wisdom about relationships, her sharp eye of always watching, watching that make her books so special. Unlike this Big Storm, Colwin's books don't knock you over - but you find yourself thinking about them for a long time afterwards.She is greatly missed."},{"Title":"A Big Storm Knocked It Over","review":"I am not normally given to overstatement. I can, however, thinkof no other work I have encountered yet that can rival LaurieColwin's &quot;A Big Wind Knocked It Over&quot; for reinforcing thebalance between idiosyncracy and pure happiness that comesfrom a union, whether it be one of marriage or of friendship.Colwin's prose, while spare, rings with images and emotional relevance.I, as well as everyone else I have discussed this work with,have found myself, the smallest details of my personality, echoed in her words.The characters, without exception, are wonderfully flawed and human, drawn with anattention to detail that brings life to their written existences,and transcend the reader-text barrier to make them as presentas a coworker or a friend.Anything more I could say would throw this review into therealm of the hyperbolic, so I will close by recommending thiswork to any and all readers.

To me, her writing is sophisticated yet very comfortable. I can identify most with the main character in this particular book of hers as I also married a bit later in life and am trying to have a child despite being a little long in the tooth. The longings Jane Louise has for the domestic bliss that other people in her life seem to have so easily are all too familiar. This book will not hit you over the head with a message, and it does meander ... which is just like life for most of us. And I for one sometimes enjoy a book that doesn't leave me with a headache. Reading is so much like eating - balancing what's good for you with satisfying cravings for those things that aren't - and for me, Laurie Colwin's books are like hot tea with milk and sugar on a cold afternoon. Grown up, but sweet and comforting - they always hit the spot.

The story is dreamy and evocative with beautifully drawn characters and scenes.

Rogers' easy to read,informative style the best ever. He tells his readers about many Africans and others of African descent that achieved great feats while many Europeans were still in savagery. He discusses the first recorded Dr. Imhotep. Hatshepsut (Queen ruler who has a temple that still stands). Makeda, Clitus (General with Alexander the Great), King Taharqa (mentioned in the Bible) and many other great figures. I have all 14 of his books and would not trade one for a bar of gold. His research vastly improved my confidence in the achievement of Africans the world over that have been hidden from general knowledge for lifetimes. If anyone doubts the works of J.A. Rogers I would debate them any place using his research and embarrass you with the research you bring.The great thing about his works are he just calmly states the facts without tearing any other race or civilization down.

The old kingdom and predynasty clearly shows so-called African negro's as the rulers of Egypt not the fantasy semitci nonsense born of 17th/18th western racist... As far as Cleopatra, there were quite a few Cleopatra's through different dynasty periods... of course one would know this if they cared to research properly... Also, Hannibal was always described as being a Afrikan... regardless of in mulatto traits... Its funny how europeans when they can't take Afrikans out of the area which would give us high regard, they must somehow convince others they would should be seen as sub-human, stock, negro, primitive, simple minded, etc... This is clearly white male dogma, since these particular white males are obviously suffering from a inferiority complex, [...] envy, etc.. which activates some defense mechanism within them as they can only see themselves in a competition with other males outside of their circles... Of course this also reflects on what most women desire as well... But, thats too obvious to point out...Anyway, J.A. Rogers has done a excellent job of putting Afrikans back into the civilize arena where we belong... Of course any fool who would listen to the empty ramblings of angry insecure white males as being some say all authority of what is legit, needs a wake up call...Notice that racism over a 2,000+ period has been the perpetration of white males or indo-aryans who try to justify such uncivilized behavior through their socio-political opinions, their empty spiritual system (religion), and psuedo-science of survival of the fittest... I guess the latter makes sense for these groups who have genetically undergone a mutated change do to hardship of having to survive with limited resources in areas that did not produce enough edible vegetation... Which led to heavy consumption of eating animals and stealing from others... a habit the europeans are still practicing... as a badge of honor... p.i"},{"Title":"The Indian Sign (Mysteries & Horror)","review":"This is a superb ex-cop turned private eye mystery, meeting all three criteria for excellence: ATMOSPHERE--The reader can feel the shivery, wet February of Cleveland; inhale the sweet-smelling ethnic restaurants; sense the almost tangible atmosphere of the city. Without the proper ambience, even the best mystery would fall flat. CHARACTERS--The detective and all he meets are well-drawn and believlable. I never doubted for a second. PLOT--There are two distinct plots, actually, that eventually merge with a common theme. The ending is no great surprise, alas, but it works well enough and shouldn't be considered a negative.To this fine mix, Les Roberts has added the spice of uncertainty on the part of his hero. Is he doing the right thing, and will he ever know if he did the right thing? That's what transforms this whodunit into fine literature. Most mystery novels simply never question the morality of it all."},{"Title":"The Indian Sign (Mysteries & Horror)","review":"One of the best Milan Jacovich adventures yet, this one raises disturbing ethical questions for the Slovenian private investigator that the wily Roberts leaves for the readers to answer. From the first glimpse of the elderly Joseph Ettiwagishek sitting stoically in full tribal regalia on a park bench in a northern Ohio snowstorm to the exciting shootout at an upscale Cleveland shopping center, the images in this book are haunting. And though Jacovich's separate cases--the murder of the old Indian and the possible espionage in a local toy company--might seem disconnected, they are not at all; they both deal with issues that affect children. An exciting and thought-provoking addition to one of the best series around."},{"Title":"The Indian Sign (Mysteries & Horror)","review":"Roberts always fascinates me with his ability to make Milan hard-boiled and intelligent at the same time. As this series goes on, Milan is becoming more and more mature and culpable for his actions and the actions of others as well. I have personal knowledge of the Slovenian Community and although he is a transplanted Clevelander, Roberts has made good use of his resources here to project a very believeable character. The moral dilemmas he presented in THE INDIAN SIGN still have me uncomfortable and undecided after 8 months. Roberts is becoming more confident in his success with this series as he writes each book and relies not so much on the shoot 'em up and punch 'em out as he does on making Milan Jacovich a very believeable character. And if anyone knows anything about characters, it's Roberts."},{"Title":"The Indian Sign (Mysteries & Horror)","review":"Armand Treusch, CEO of Troy Toy Inc. hires Cleveland security specialist and private sleuth Milan Jacovich to check out his recent hire, accountant David Ream. Treusch feels Ream asks too many questions about &quot;non-accounting&quot; matters like production. Although he does not like Treusch, Milan accepts the job because the money is green.Near his home, while winter freezes the city, an elderly Native American stands tall for two whole days until someone kills him. Feeling a bit guilty for not finding out what the old man wanted, Milan begins his own inquiries only to learn that an assailant abducted the great great-grandson of the deceased, a tribal historian.In his eleventh novel, the Jacovich mysteries retain its freshness when the hero is on a case or on two as he is in this tale. However, when Milan conducts soliloquies on his personal habits and desires (chocolate lovers beware), instead of wonderful insight, the exciting story line is slowed down. Fans of the series will enjoy INDIAN SIGN as Les Roberts knows how to make his intriguing protagonist seem real and his two investigations entertaining, but too much trivial characterization hurts an otherwise wonderful mystery."},{"Title":"The Indian Sign (Mysteries & Horror)","review":"With each new book, Roberts seems to get wordier and wordier and more cerebral and P.C. instead of &quot;hard-boiled&quot; as he claims to be. I liked the older Milan books better and wonder if his new one, &quot;The Dutch&quot; will cause me to read with a thesaurus nearby. He also had Milan eating dinner twice in one evening--once in Chagrin Falls, and a few hours later at the Inn at Turner's Mill in Hudson with an associate. I'm a big fan of Roberts, he is a very intelligent and aware person and an all around nice guy-mostly. For a transplanted Californian, he treats our city very well. I'm happy he gave up the Saxon novels for the Milan ones. They're a lot better read."},{"Title":"The Indian Sign (Mysteries & Horror)","review":"At least one review has called Les Roberts a 'hard-boiled' writer. Not so! &quot;The Indian Sign&quot; is a mystery of intricate structure, and overtones of Greek tragedy...with traditional elements from the tragic hero/stoic Indian grandfather to the chorus of whining women who populate the novel and comment mournfully on the action.

During the summer of 2001, Bob took a break from the mag for a couple of weeks and took to the road to gather material for this book. To many of us, a road trip, especially in the U.S., is the quintessential freedom experience. A road trip with the sole purpose of checking out the tattoo shops and artists along the way certainly isn't a bad way to spend a fortnight. The area that Bob chose for his book is the Pacific Northwest, basically covering the states of Oregon and Washington and dipping over the border to Canada, into British Columbia. This makes the book particularly interesting and pertinent for me, because this is one of my favorite parts of the world. I have been tattoed many times in Vancouver, B.C., and the very first article I ever had published in Skin Deep was an account of my own tattoo road trip through Canada. Tattoo Road Trip is a beautifully produced hardback book with the high production values we have come to expect from Schiffer. It is packed with luscious colour pictures showing the scenery, the characters and, most importantly, the tattoos that Bob came across along the way. The text is part travel journal and part interviews with tattooists famous and unknown. Names include well known artists such as Vyvyn Lazonga, Terry Tweed, Dave Shore, John the Dutchman, London Bellman and Dave Lum. Bob also interviews the world's most-tattooed woman, Krystyne Kolorful. Some people you may not be familiar with include Jennifer Billig, Aaron Bell, Teresa Johnson and many, many more. The book conveys the sense of adventure and the journey into the unknwon that accompanies a road trip. Bob Baxter's writing style, honed after many years as a journlaist, is clear and evocative with a wry touch of humor. The book touches on the tattoo history of the Pacific Northwest and the colourful characters of years gone by as well as giving a sense of the vibrant tattoo scene there today. Trouble is, reading it will have you itching to pack a bag, sling it in the back of the car and head on down the road.

Its phrasing in \`rotten English' gives it a particularly tragic accent.Ken Saro-Wiwa's death is also an utmost tragical one.

The novel is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who tries to come to terms with the realities of the Third World."},{"Title":"Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English","review":"The skill with which Ken paints his characters, using very few words, and fewer adjectives is unsurpassed"},{"Title":"Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English","review":"Ever since I took Charles Larson's class, The African Writer, I have been completely intrigued by Ken Saro-Wiwa. I presented multiple projects depicting the horrendous execution of this activist/author as the most severe example of the precarious situation in which African writers are forced to live and work. However, only recently did I realize that I never actually read a work by this influential author. For this reason, I sought out Sozaboy: A novel in rotten English. To put it simply, I was blown away by the creative innovation, timelessness, and critical content of the novel. Ken Saro-Wiwa is a man that should be studied for not only the significance of his death, but the accomplishments of his life.The plot follows a young man named Mene, who is eventually only known as Sozaboy, living in a small, rural village in Nigeria while tensions begin to build and suggest an upcoming war. The seemingly petty events of Mene's life, like his obsession with Agnes, the beautiful Lagos girl, eventually transform to create a heart-wrenching war novel. While growing up in his village of Dukana, Mene becomes an apprentice driver when his mom decides this to be the most lucrative career path for him, since she can no longer pay his school fees. His limited education is reflected in the mixture of pidgin English, corrupted English and \\"occasional flashes of good, even idiomatic English\\" that is used to narrate the novel, which Saro-Wiwa dubbed \\"rotten English\\" (iii). Although the narration can be, at times, difficult to follow, it is generally easy enough to figure out with the help of context clues and the glossary in the back of the book. Nonetheless, Saro-Wiwa succeeds in narrating an unbelievably eloquent novel, while criticizing the many facets of war. The language is absolutely innovative and allows for a very raw understanding of the events taking place. Above all else, simply reading the novel had a very artful air to it.It is never specified when this war is taking place during Nigerian history, but many speculate it to surround the events of the Biafran War. There are various clues scattered throughout the novel that suggest this possibility, such as the difficulty of determining who is the Enemy, the vast exile to refugee camps, and the intense famine from which the majority of the population suffered. I spent the majority of my time while reading this book attempting to figure out what war Saro-Wiwa was discussing. However, upon finishing the book, I realized that this is only a minor detail that is of really no great importance to the general purpose of the novel, which is to condemn war. Despite the fact that it is a very Nigerian novel at heart, with its use of \\"rotten English,\\" it clearly appeals to the universality of war, making the time period in Nigerian history an irrelevant discussion point. This extroverted novel is situated ambiguously so that all readers can understand war in the context that Saro-Wiwa frames.Specifically, Mene's transformation from Mene to Sozaboy does not demonstrate his identity; instead it indicates his absolute lack of understanding regarding what it means to be a soldier and to be in war. Various instances throughout the novel, Sozaboy attempts to understand \\"Why are we fighting?\\" and the phrase \\"war is war\\" (90). He is never able to determine who is the real Enemy, when he has seen both sides of the war commit such great atrocities. Saro-Wiwa succeeds in his war criticism by portraying this arbitrary nature by which death and suffering is brought about during war and how war as a whole can never be truly justified because there is no such thing as a \\"good side.\\"Sozaboy decides to become a soldier because of the taunting from the World War II veteran in his village and his love interest's desire to be with a man that can protect her. He wishes to impress all the residents of Dukana by returning with his uniform, gun, and some medals, but the truth of war taught him, \\"now if anybody say anything about war or even fight, I will just run and run and run and run and run\\" (181). The innovative language and strong social/political commentary within Sozaboy makes it a masterpiece of our time."},{"Title":"Flight 427: Anatomy of an Air Disaster","review":"\\"Flight 427\\" is a book that Gerry Byrne can be rightfully proud of. I have been interested in this subject for many years now both as an airline pilot (I flew the 737 for almost two years, and must in all candor say that it was my least favorite of the nine different airliner types that I have flown; In all fairness to Boeing, many of my colleagues seem to really enjoy flying the 737, but after my personal experience with the plane, I still can't understand why) and a student (I wrote my Master's thesis on a quantitative systems safety comparison of 737 and A-320 primary flight control systems.) Of the two books on the market which focus on USAir flight 427 (the other, by Bill Adair, is also excellent) I give this one the slight edge for the average reader or the person most interested in how the NTSB \\"Party System\\" functions at a major aviation accident.Byrne carefully weaves the story of flight 427 in with the earlier United 585 accident (same cause) and the later Eastwind 517 incident (also the same cause) skillfully and with generally quite good technical accuracy (there are a couple of very minor technical errors, but they are inconsequential and would not be noticed by most people.) What I really appreciate about the book is Byrne's breadth of sources in reporting on not only well known and understood matters, but also on very obscure, but important background information like all the early Frontier 737 rudder malfunctions, which few are familiar with.The real story here is of the frustrating experience of investigating such a complex and politically charged investigation. There is no question that Boeing comes off looking bad by the end of the book, and I have to admit, deservedly so.The only weakness in the book is the total lack of illustrations. This is a topic that could really use illustrations, particularly when Byrne starts discussing things like the interior functions of the dual-concentric servo valve, which was ultimately the problem here.This is a great book, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Flight 427: Anatomy of an Air Disaster","review":"The author Gerry Byrne ought to be proud of this book. The book starts off with the crash of United flight 585 in Colorado Springs, another Boeing 737 aircraft that mysteriously flipped over and crashed while trying to land. The investigation of the United accident opened the door to a possible design problem with the rudder on the 737 airplane. The book then covers the US Air flight 427 accident that crashed in a way very similar to United 585. I couldn't put this book down. Even though this book is non-fiction and at times very technical it is written in a way that is comfortable to read and you really understand the detail in context with what is very complex story. There is one point in the book where Gerry describes a rudder test conducted at Boeing on a rainy night where an engineer finally is able to reproduce a rudder reversal problem which was suspected by the NTSB for a long time. In context with the story this was a point where you really breath a sigh of releif... But even than the story the investigation takes more unsuspected turns. Great book."},{"Title":"Flight 427: Anatomy of an Air Disaster","review":"I agree with the other reviews of this book in that the author does a great job of keeping you interested and making it entertaining. However, I feel that book would have been greatly enhanced with the addition of some technical drawings or illustrations. The descriptions get somewhat complicated at times, and a diagram or two would ensure clear understanding. If you aren't interested in the details, then as it is written should be fine, but if you want to understand completly, diagrams are required. I also think the text jumps around quite a bit in time, not following a strictly linear timeline. While this makes for easier reading in following specific tangents and topics, it clouds the overall understanding of what is going on... I have read many crash investigation books, and this one does a credible job of mixing storytelling with technical explanations."},{"Title":"Flight 427: Anatomy of an Air Disaster","review":"Despite the lack of pictures, I was surprised with the ease with which this writer pulled me into what becomes a very complicated technical detective story about the problems which caused two 737s to crash and few other near misses. He carefully introduces things and explains them early on so that even the layperson who knows nothing about flying can easily follow the plot (my girlfiend can't change a lighbulb and she's reading it now). For example, I'm fascinated by aviation but never knew so much about the way crashes get investigated. Apart from telling in some detail the story of two 737 crashes, this book is a good introduction to the field of air crash investigation and one of the best of the four on the subject I've read so far. It's a departure from the norm of disaster books where there is usually a lot about the victims and their relatives. This book lets the issues speak for themselves and exposes the real scandal of these crashes. This book is a wakeup call for the FAA and the people who design airplanes."},{"Title":"Flight 427: Anatomy of an Air Disaster","review":"It's hard to imagine that a book about an air crash could be a page-turner in the style of a Ludlum or Clancy, but Flight 427 manages to be just that: it's a book about hi-tech sleuths racing against time and looming danger to solve an unfathomable mystery: why commercial airliners in seemingly perfect working order flipped over and fell from the sky. Author Bryne manages this in a style that is both suspenseful and educational: I learned a lot about wind, weather, piloting, and flight without ever feeling I was being taught. The most astonishing thing I learned was that the suspected culprit in the crash of 427 (and other crashes and near-crashes) is still in the tail rudders of 737s flying today: that the fix would take so long to implement tells you a lot about the intersection of commerce (the already tottering airline industry could not withstand a grounding of 737s), science, and government. And that could be the most chilling aspect of this jet-age spy story. Highly recommended for anyone interested in technology and/or aviation. (Maybe not for anyone already afraid of flying!)"},{"Title":"Flight 427: Anatomy of an Air Disaster","review":"I would have preferred to have had some pictures/diagrams to help explain the more detailed technical aspects of the book.

Mr. Byrne spends just enough time on the politics of the investigation to remind you that most of those involved are not disinterested parties. Though he touches on the feelings and frustration of the survivors, that's not the focus here. This glimpse into the \\"longest crash investigation in commercial airline history\\" reveals the depth of knowledge and the persistence required to find useable answers in the wake of a shocking tragedy."},{"Title":"Say Good-bye to Johnnie Blue","review":"This book is a virtual roller coaster ride, filled with twists and turns that will really keep you guessing.

It was a grand house. The family always arrived in the rain, Violet thought. The servant, Annie, noted that Violet's husband Charles did not show his age and Violet did. Charles and Violet were not alltogether comfortable with each other.Charles was a good observer. He was able to reconstruct some of the history. A ballroom had been designed but had not been completed because the money gave out. Violet's grandfather had been efficient. Charles was an enthusiast. He had learned the language in Burma. He knew about village customs. It seemed that Charles used excuses to get away and go and talk with the men at the pub. Annie knew how to cheer up Violet.Notably, an American niece, Sally, comes to stay with the couple. She is sent to Ireland by her parents because she has become involved with an actor, Ian, whom the parents believe is misleading her into hoping for a marriage. Sally believes that Violet and Charles are still in love. She watches them. At Vassar Sally had revolted against a sense of responsibility being imposed upon her. She tries to resist the influence of Violet and Annie and their attempts to become close to her.Later in the summer, Ian, through curiousity, attempts a visit. The visit is not a success. The couple parts.The book was inspired by the circumstances of Elizabeth Bowen I learned from reading another book by May Sarton. This is a psychological story of considerable interest. The atmosphere of Ireland is very well done."},{"Title":"SHOWER OF SUMMER DAYS","review":"Not my favorite May Sarton novel by any means, but, by virtue of Ms. Sarton's extraordinary grasp of human nature, a remarkable read nevertheless.Time passes slowly at Dene's Court, but even as we watch rain drip and roses droop, we are uncomfortably aware of the undercurrents of human interaction therein. The characters, who apparently have no life, read, misread, and over-read, that which passes between them both verbal and non-.Curiously, the fourth character--and a substantial one at that--is the house in which all this angst takes place. Solid if somewhat mildewed and more than a little gloomy, the manor itself provides an anchor and stability that even the peanut gallery of venerable relatives hanging in portraiture on its walls cannot. Sally grows up, Violet and Charles grow old, and Ian remains excluded and clueless.Interesting. I enjoyed it but rate it at four stars with an uncertain shrug."},{"Title":"THE LIFE AND SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE","review":"In the literary world it is perhaps blasphemy to say a bad word against Daniel Defoe's most acclaimed novel. So here goes. The fact that the book was originally titled The Life And Strange Surprising Adventures Of Robinson Crusoe illustrates the major flaw in Defoe's literary form. Put simply, this would be a far more interesting and gripping story were it not so superfluously lengthy. The author makes a habit of repeating himself, especially when it comes to the act of dispatching kittens, which seems to be more of an obsession here than octogenarian ladies are to MatronsApron. It is difficult, you may think, to keep the subject matter fresh when describing the daily tribulations of a fellow stranded on an island for thirty years, without occasionally repeating yourself. True, but perhaps a straightforward solution to this diminutive quandary would be to simply truncate the duration of the story. There are some wonderfully intriguing and suspenseful moments, and some juicy action to boot, but sadly these are gratuitously diluted by lengthy descriptions of the unremarkable everyday goings on in Crusoe's life, and rather than serving to build up the suspense, they merely obstruct the reader's relationship with the more exciting parts of the story.However, those with more patience than my ignorant self will find in Robinson Crusoe a delightful tale, which as well as being a fictional documentary of the most unusual thirty years of Mr. Crusoe's life, also has time to ponder upon philosophical and theological ideas, in a style that makes the reader feel as if they are involved in the conflicts between the functionalist and cynical thoughts going on in Crusoe's mind. It may not be a gripping white-knuckle adventure, being rather more leisurely and acquiescent, but it is still rather easy to see why Robinson Crusoe is regarded by some as one of the greatest novels of all time."},{"Title":"Logic in Linguistics (Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics)","review":"\\"Logic in linguistics\\" is a very detailed book about the use of logic signs and on the theme logic in itself.

The writer lost me at the first sentence: \\"Like many born at the tail end of America's postwar baby boom I grew up in an affluent suburb.\\" You have got to be kidding me. It seems she has never known the world outside of upper class comfort and sheltered academia, and it shines through in her book. Readers interested in studying weddings, where the traditions stem from and what urges us to continue them, the wedding industry and its effect on/representation of our society and its values and the psyche of the American bride will be bitterly disappointed by this book which at its best is thinly veiled militant feminism and at its worst a bunch of movie reviews. I'm serious; in the chapter entitled \\"Will you marry me? The Proposal Scene in the Contemporary Imagination\\" Geller gives 3-4 page long synopses of \\"Moonstruck\\" and \\"Honeymoon in Vegas\\"Readers will glean a few interesting wedding trivia tidbits and the book does raise the important question of why erotic love is seen as one's raison d'etre in our society, but unfortunately this book doesn't live up to what it could be; Geller fails miserably in execution.

I'm sorry that Ms. Geller wasn't the beneficiary of such a marriage &amp; family, but her warped view of life is partially the result of her parents having taken the road she so heartily recommends."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"As a folklorist and someone involved in alternative relationships, I looked with great interest upon this book, espescially since I am very interested in the current scholarly examination of the primarily het-white-wealthy wedding (and the current Third Wave feminism's dubious obsession with weddings.) Overall, the book provided a great deal of food for thought, espescially upon examination of the current wedding narrative that each (het/white/wealthy) couple fulfills; ie, that they are kooky and delightful, which makes their marriage even more darling--a story that is played to by manufacturers, retailers and the wedding industry.I also admire how Geller elegantly deconstructs the overstuffed, high-priced personalized wedding and the process of creating a het-white-patriarchal fantasia white wedding. However, Geller slips into a very vitriolic, classist tone, espescially when describing lower-class women and weddings, who I would think would be the primary dupes of the wedding frenzy. This really turns an innovative and important work into something that is at times very difficult to read, even from a sympathetic audience member. Likewise, as a former graduate student, I find her graduate school pastorale to ring just as false as wedding magazine promises of castles, fairytales and buttercream icing.I was also disturbed that there seemed to be no room in reexamining weddings for examining any type of romantic relationship. I would have also liked to see what happens when groups that do not normally get the white wedding veneer of privilige appropriate the traditions and tweak the proverbial nose of the white wedding.(It's this anger and classism that keeps me from giving the book 5 stars; the ideas are strong enough for 5, but the execution only leaves it at 3) Still, I suppose the great success of this book is that its ideas do linger and provide interesting context and thought long after the book is closed. I do, however, wish that Geller had toned down her anger--it detracts from a book that with a bit more editing would have been a masterpiece on par with Jessica Mitford's _The American Way of Death_ and severely limits the audience to an academic one when the ideas really should be further disseminated. My hope is that Geller keeps writing and is able to balance her ideas and her style and keeps writing--perhaps her next book will be able to build on this foundation."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"In _Here Comes the Bride_, Jaclyn Geller attacks modern \\"wedding culture\\", from staged proposals to thousand-dollar white gowns to the forced sexiness of the honeymoon, and ties modern traditions back to the marriage customs of old, in which women were a commodity sold between father and husband. She asks us, why do we still get married, when the institution is a relic of a sexist past? Why do the invitations still hint at the bride being \\"given\\" by her parents? Why do brides get so many gifts lavished upon them? Many good questions are raised. However, for several reasons, the book left a sour taste in my mouth.First, Geller seems too close to her subject, perhaps a bit too personally bitter about it. Maybe she should have left out the personal anecdotes--she comes off sounding like she is just mad because her married friends are drifting away from her, and because nobody is throwing her a spinsterhood shower and giving her loot. There's a good point here. Married folks are much better off if they hang on to their old friends and don't retreat into a cocoon of coupledom. And maybe we'd all be better off if our relatives helped us get started in our first \\"place of our own\\", whether we entered it as single or married people. It's just that she sounds so shrill on these points that it makes her polemic sound more like a personal whine than a political statement.Second, and this didn't jump out at me at first, but was pointed out in a wonderful review on Salon.com, Geller doesn't interview any brides! She never asks any engaged or married people why they're taking this step, whether they feel \\"oppressed\\", etc. (In my own experience, most people who marry have already been living with their lover for years, and get married to please the parents. They already consider this person the most important in their lives; the ceremony is just an antiquated formality. This puts the lie to Geller's thesis that marriage artificially creates closeness between husband and wife.) Her lack of personal stories makes the whole thing ring rather hollow, in retrospect. When Betty Friedan wrote _The Feminine Mystique_, she interviewed many housewives and quoted them to show their discontent.And so, without any personal testimony on the subject of marriage, Geller is left analyzing pop culture. She lambasts self-help \\"get-a-man\\" manuals, bridal magazines that recommend lavish and expensive nuptials, and the fascination with celebrity wives, who are always asserting that they're \\"traditional\\" wives and mothers despite the fact that they have full-time nannies and probably never even *see* their kids unless they have a photo shoot together. All of this stuff, I agree, is obnoxious as heck! But what Geller never challenges is the assumption that these things reflect the true feelings of the average woman. Most women I know, married or otherwise, think big weddings are just displays of wealth, that \\"celebrity wife\\" stories are sexist and annoying, and that dating manuals are the best way to ruin your relationship by analyzing it into oblivion. In _Backlash_, Susan Faludi exposed the \\"nesting\\" culture of the eighties as something cooked up by the media, not an actual trend among regular people. What if this marriage culture is the same way? Geller never finds out, since she doesn't talk to the brides themselves, whether women getting married really feel the way she thinks they do.This book is a remarkable expose' of the marriage culture, but really doesn't say a darn thing about actual marriage. So go ahead and toss those bridal magazines, but don't let this book sway you too much about whether to tie the knot at all. That's up to you. Geller says it's not OK to be married, but we never do find out why."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"While I found the book to be witty, and at times insightful, I couldn't quite escape the notion that these were not the women that I knew. Women who register (if they do, in fact, register) at the local &quot;Bed Bath and Beyond&quot; alone (or with husband-to-be) with a scanner and a tablet of paper. Women who buy dresses from catalogues or at the same store where they bought their prom dresses years ago. Women, in other words, who live in the middle and lower classes. Women who have worked for years, living on their own terms. Women who are paying their own way -- including for their own weddings.More and more women (and men) that I know have found that the expectations (often from guests) as to what is a &quot;proper&quot; wedding have made formal wedding harder to have, impossible to enjoy. More and more have chosen small family affairs, or less showy ceremonies and receptions because the difference between spending 5 thousand on a wedding and using that money to put down on a house (you can still buy a house with a 5K downpayment in most of the country) is just too stark.Again, the social history was interesting, but I do wish we could, as feminists, realize that just because we can (and always seem to) make sweeping generalizations, doesn't mean any of us speak for all women."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"I read Geller's book with interest and found many of her ideas significant, accurate, and downright common-sensical.Her central argument is that American society has become wedding-obessessed without deeply analyzing the problems inherent in the institution of marriage. She insightfully points out that while the wedding industry booms and women of all ages seem to be embracing a kind of Cinderella attitude toward their weddings, never has the divorce rate been higher in the U.S.This is a message of enormous importance, it seems to me. Unfortunately, however, Geller weakens her own credibility by delivering her ideas in a tone of tremendous personal anger, frustration, and bitterness. This emotionalism detracts from her ability to deliver a clear-headed, reasonably-argued, persuasive point. This is a shame because Geller's ideas do deserve to be heard."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"To put it simply, I will never look at the people around me in the same way again. Since reading this book, I've begun to notice the ways that marriage affects people and the price that people pay for buying into the institution. Before &quot;Here Comes the Bride,&quot; my views were mildly anti-marriage. Something about wedding bands, bridal showers, and white gowns gave the hives, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Jaclyn Geller remedied that quandry. Her argument against marriage was succint, well-informed, passionate, intelligent, insightful, and innovative. I've rarely read a non-fiction book that was such a page-turner. The ideas contained within &quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot; are powerful and life-altering. Do not read it if you aren't prepared to see male/female relationships in our society in a wholly different light."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"This first book (by a grad student at NYU) issued by a small publisher, lacking any significant ad or promotion budget , - (and if the truth be told, egregiously copyedited , with typos galore) -is getting a high-decibel spontaneous buzz.. Barely two months after publication, HERE COMES THE BRIDE is already an almost-famous book..The reason is obvious. It raises questions that should have been raised many times in many books, but weren't., - questions that are long overdue for public discussion, but that up until now have remained almost unmentionable. It's not that the author is against marriage, but given the drastically changed and changing roles of women in our culture , she wonders exactly what the purpose of marriage is today. Understandably, many people find this book upsetting, but just about everyone finds it provocative and for some ( particularly those who are instinctively wary ) HERE COMES THE BRIDE can be a source of comfort and revelation.. For those who do marry , as most will, the realities that this book illuminates may increase their chances of making it a success. .. Alix Kates Shulman captured the spirit of HERE COMES THE BRIDE in her enthusiastic : blurb: &quot;Like a gust of fresh air Jaclyn Geller blows away the perfumed fog of romance and illusion that obscures the nature of matrimony in the West.&quot;We all enjoy romance and illusion-- in their place, but do we really want to gamble our lives on it?? That is the central question at hand."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"I am one of those giddy brides Ms. Geller was writing about--and I could have been one of her friends from the dorm who spent her college years developing wonderful relationships with friends from college and eventually graduate school, only to &quot;give it all away&quot; to get married. I admit that I am enjoying being engaged, I am enjoying weighing the pros and cons of china patterns and the cathedral veil vs. the fingertip one, and while I do recognize that I am caught up in an enormous cultural and societal machine that strongly favors marriage to remaining uncoupled, I do not see how that is something I should avoid--something standing in the way of my personal, individual happiness.There were a number of reasons why I was not convinced by the author's very readable and provocative book. The primary one, though, is that while she offered scathing observations of the overblown, highly commercial wedding industry, she just didn't explain in adequate detail why getting married today is bad news for every woman. I don't see marriage as being anti-intellectual at all--or at the very least, it does not require giving up intellectualism. Although I enjoy the occasional Modern Bride, a guilty pleasure as much as reading Cosmo at the hairdresser's is a guilty pleaure, my bookshelfs continue to swell, and the relationships I cultivated in college and grad school, many of which had an intellectual basis, still exist, just in changed form. And my fiance is not some random, keep-the-little-woman-down patriarch: he treasures me for my independence and we both spend plenty of time thinking and reading on our own. It is nice to have a life partner with whom I can share such passions.Admittedly, getting married has been a huge commercial free-for-all, with gifts and advertising and huge quantities of tulle being thrust at us both, but that sort of stuff hasn't change who we are--or who we are to each other--at all. I've enjoyed the attention, but it has not made me want to give up my soul and become a Scarsdale housewife.I do agree that favoring marriage over being single or over alternative types of families is not fair, fundamentally, but I still don't see how marriage is bad for the people for whom it suits. Because marriage came about during a highly patriarchal time doesn't necessarily mean that a male-female partnership recognized by the state has to be patriarchal. Our culture, in my opinion, continues to be patriarchal, just in more subtle ways than in previous eras discussed in the book. Individuals, however, have the freedom to make their marriage, if not their culture, what they will of it."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"A bride-to-be myself, I picked up \\"Here Comes the Bride\\" while looking at wedding guides in a bookstore.

And I did buy it expecting to read a critique on the marriage industry in the U.S. But I was not prepared for how anti-marriage Geller is.This book is half dissection and half rant. Perhaps if she had stuck to dissecting, the book would be easier to stomach--not to mention easier to follow. Examination of the wedding dress turns into a 10 page list of reasons why any woman has to be insane to walk down the aile.My fiance has spent the last week harboring fears of me calling off the wedding after skimming through this book.

The disdain that the author has for all women who engage (pun intended) in the institution of marriage pervades her entire analysis. It is reminiscent of the anti-woman tone of WITCH's 1969 Bridal Fair protest. In 30+ years, haven't we found a way to critique patriarchy and its institutions without bashing women? Admittedly, this model is endemic to higher education and Ms. Geller is a doctoral candidate, but it is unfortunate that she could not focus instead on her insightful comments about the bridal industry, compulsory heterosexuality, and the marriage mystique. I would be concerned about using this text in an undergraduate course with students who might lack the critical thinking ability to separate the chaff of Ms. Geller's editorializing from the wheat of her solid scholarship."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"Like a lot of other people who are in their 20s and have seen divorces left and right, I've always been cynical about the whole idea of marriage. I never understood what the point was or just how self-centered a couple would have to be to have one of the monstrous weddings I often witnessed in the South within a year of my college graduation.However, I was asked to be a bridesmaid for the first time last fall, and in the last eight months, I have witnessed so much of what was discussed in this book first hand that it's not even funny--the search for the \\"perfect\\" wedding site, the search for the \\"perfect\\" wedding dress (and someone competent enough to alter it!), the pressure from family and friends to conform to outdated, if not flat-out ridiculous, traditions just because \\"that's how it's done,\\" etc.Needless to say, I was thrilled to read \\"Here Comes the Bride.\\" It blows a whistle on the one industry that seems untouchable, the one that capitalizes on women's lifelong hopes and deepest dreams. It criticizes the smug wedding gown saleswomen and the whole idea of having themed showers in an attempt to have friends and relations outfit every aspect of a couple's life.Granted, the author seems to have a near obsession with the need to make friendships recognized in the eyes of the law, and the press that published this book could really afford to hire a proofreader or two (or ten). But, I congratulate them both for having the guts to research, write and publish this book.\\"Here Comes the Bride\\" throws all of the unchallenged ideas about marriage into our society's face, screaming \\"Why is a practice that so blatantly undermined the power of women still embraced as the ultimate goal for and, more disturbingly, by them?\\" If I hadn't already shown my disdain towards modern weddings before, this book would put me squarely on the anti-marriage side of the fence. Of course, I'll still have to wear a plum taffeta separates with the shoes dyed to match next weekend. Luckily, after reading about where such wedding customs come from, I will NEVER ask the bride to return the favor."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"Jaclyn Geller's *Here comes the Bride* offers an important and very readable challenge to the mythology of marrriage. While critiquing the common rituals of the wedding in the United States -- with hilarious moments on a visit to the bridal registry and to the wedding gown shop -- Geller provides an insightful look at the implications of marriage for contemporary women. While many women will respond with the cry &quot;marriage is a free choice!&quot; Geller makes clear how our choices carry with them historical and cultural baggage that connect them to oppressive ideas about women's roles. There's no escaping this ideological context for marriage, despite all the fairy tale stories about marriage that constantly bombard us in everyday life. This is the value of Geller's book -- she shows us the everyday ways that marriage is still contantly being re-created as a false mythology for women.This is book will be important to feminists -- to place alongside work by those like Naomi Wolf. But what's so special about *Here Comes the Bride* is that it is clear and readable, full of stories and humor along with its doses of history. A book for anyone who has ever considered getting married. Fun and fascinating stuff -- even if you just want to read the chapter about the different ways that wedding invitations have been written and why -- or about the absurdity of wedding gown selection. In short, a book I've been recommending whenever possible."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"Geller is funny, wise, and endearingly cynical in this indictment of marriage and weddings. I am married, but found Geller's critique of marriage to be right on target. People who are married reap heaps of rewards, while the unpartnered (especially women) must deal with discrimination and scorn. This is a must-read for anyone who has ever contemplated marriage."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"I've watched my friends marry one after the other, and I've watched them all divorce.

My thoughts printed in a book. I got this book when my own wedding ceremony went badly and I decided on a vow renewal to make up for it. After announcing this I was treated as a pariah for attempting a ceremoney twice so I started reading up on what make people act the way they do concerning weddings. I have to admit this pretty well explained it"},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"Geller has written a very persuasive critique of marriage and weddings. This book makes you question why being married automatically brings status and why not being married brings a sense of shame (especially if you're a woman). Geller analyzes wedding guides, bridal magazines, Jane Austen, and &quot;Sex and the City.&quot; She questions why romantic monogamy is revered so much more than platonic friendship. In one hilarious passage, she goes undercover as a bride at the Bloomingdale's bridal registry and recounts the way she's treated by the salespeople (basically, like royalty). I recommend this book to anyone thinking about marriage. Even if you are married, this is a very worthwhile read that will get you to re-examine your lifestyle."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"I've watched my friends marry one after the other, and I've watched them all divorce.

I read it cover to cover last week, finishing the last chapter in the back seat of the car on my way to a friend' s wedding. This wedding played out exactly as Geller predicted - right down to the poetry the couple chose, the scripture recited, their &quot;personalized&quot; vows and the songs performed - word for word. Frankly, everyone in the audience seemed bored. It's obvious that people look at marriage as something all civilized people have to do - like paying taxes and receiving regular dental check-ups. Geller's observations are revolutionary and the truth hurts."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"This book could have been great, this book should have been interesting, It should have been provactive discourse on the return to patriarchy &amp; the societal pressures on women to wed.I wanted to hear about the new feminine mystique - the nameless dread of being in the &quot;leftover bin&quot; as one approches her late twenties unmarried, the societal message that men are in a positon to &quot;reward&quot; a woman with the gift of marriage.So much to write about -- and instead this book is one long movie review, the shaggy dog story that leaves one wondering what the point is.Jaclyn Geller's tone comes accoss as a slightly bitter woman on a mission. Her assertion that friends be considered equally important to one's significant other is laughable. The critique of such fleeting popular culture references such as Ally McBeal and Betsy's Wedding is pathetic and indicates that Ms. Geller was grabbing at straws to fill up space and back up her point - which she never got around to making."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"This book presents very interesting and provocative ideas, no doubt about it. I'm one of the happy giddy brides for whom Ms. Geller feels pity and slight contempt. I do enjoy the registry and all the gifts and attention I get. However, I am by no means a mindless self-absorbed creature that Ms. Geller's bride is. I consider myself and my fiance intellectuals. Our home is full of books we've read and discussed together. When we went to register at Macy's, we went together, and we saw many couples registering at the store. In fact, I haven't seen a single bride registering alone or with older women. That may have been Ms. Geller's experience at Bloomingdales, but it certainly wasn't mine. Our decision to get married was a mutual one. We chose the engagment ring and the wedding bands together, and we're planning our wedding together. It's true that in the past women were opressed by men, but modern law allows a woman to be as independent as she wants. It's up to women now to choose husbands that will love and cherish them for their independence.As a side point, this book is very convoluted. If Ms. Geller wants to reach and persuade a wide audience, she should write more simply. The book won't be less interesting or academic for that. In fact, one of the reasons the marriage experts' books are so popular is that it's very easy to read them. Maybe Ms. Geller should look to them for style."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"How times have changed. Feminism used to be about women making their own choices of what they wanted to do with their lives. Not anymore. Now it's about doing exactly what other, more prominent feminists tell us. Take the author of this book, Ms. Geller. She clearly loathes the whole institution of marriage. Therefore, in an argument that demonstrates a profound lack of logic, she argues that NO ONE should get married. Her evidence? Marriage was once heavily oppressive to women, and she gives hundreds of historical vignettes to support this. But she conveniently forgets that marriage has also existed in such remarkably egalitarian societies as ancient Egypt. However, the bulk of Ms. Geller's wrath is reserved for the modern wedding: her descriptions, dripping with bitterness, of the modern bride and groom, are priceless. I, too, question the motives of lavish, enormously expensive weddings, and sexist, tacky customs like throwing the garter and \\"giving away\\" the bride. But to say the whole idea of marriage is wrong because of a few customs that have become associated with it? That's going a bit far. The message I got from this book: Don't get married. Why? BECAUSE I SAID SO! And people are listening: just look at the reviews from new brides, claiming that if they had known they were joining such a sexist, musty old institution by daring to get married, they never would have gotten married at all. They were nothing but dupes, while Jaclyn Geller alone knows the true, righteous path. Talk about not being able to think for yourself! Entertaining as it is, this book wouldn't stop me from getting married (minus the being given away part), with a white gown and all."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"Oh, yeah.I love my husband, my best friend, the man I want to share my life with.While this is very true and remains true even after I finished Geller's stirring and gripping analysis of weddings and marriage and why women want them, I can't help but look inward and reflect on my motivations, beliefs, and seemingly blind acceptance of this time-honored social convention.Here I am -- a college-educated, smart, hip, forward-thinking feminist living in the big city, who prides herself on leading an examined life. Yet Geller's book struck a chord within me, prompting me to look carefully at myself and society's promotion of marriage as the ultimate ideal and quest of adulthood. Why? Geller articulates and supports the reasons with the sophistication and finesse of a seasoned scholar. Her arguments are sound and persuasive. See for yourself.I found myself reading the book and saying to myself, &quot;Well, whew, I'm glad I'm not like 'that.'&quot; Or, &quot;well, even though I am married, I didn't have a big wedding or a shower....&quot; Blah, blah, blah. All nonsense on my part. What it comes down to is the fact that I did get married and in so doing, support an institution that has a legacy of subjugating women. Am I proud of this. Of course not. I like to think that I am doing my small part to change the &quot;institution.&quot; Do I say this to appease my battered conscience or can I really enact the change I'm looking for? The jury's still out on that one.The most fascinating and thought-provoking aspect of Geller's study, I believe, is not so much her desecration of the modern wedding but her historical characterization (and contextualization) of marriage as a life-long institution, officially sanctioned by the government. After all, the party is over in five short hours; the marriage may last much, much longer. I wished Geller had focused more of her talents on the latter and less on the frivolous steps leading to the walk down the aisle.Nevertheless, Geller's account is mind-altering. Read it. Let her ideas transform your thinking. Share your thoughts with your girlfriends. Be the change you want to see in the world. I plan to do this and love my husband. I hope that's OK.Thanks, Jaclyn!"},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"This should be required reading, not only for any newly engaged woman, but for EVERY unmarried woman in America. I am 39 and will be 40 when my fiance and I marry - and I wish I had read this book sometime during my 18 \\"single\\" years as an independent adult. The notion of marriage as the most, even the only, valuable social unit in our culture is so widely accepted that we fail to see how cruelly we force ourselves to adhere to its demands. As women, we have the right to be nurtured, understood and encouraged in our own right, not only as wives or potential wives. And as women who choose to marry, we need to know what traditions we are truly carrying on; as the author insists, it is incumbent upon us to generate independent intentions for our own lives outside of these outmoded expectations."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"This interesting, provocative overview of the American ritual of wedlock begins with dating and ends with the honeymoon. It assumes that wedlock is not natural in the way that, say, belching is, but that it is a culturally constructed phenomenon -- hardly a controversial claim, but one that many forget in our current marriage-obsessesed times. Examining the entire process through this detached, anthropological lens, the author is able to see what those embroiled in marriage -- in the marriage hunt, as she calls it -- cannot: the wedding rests on the single morally dubious belief that romantic love takes precedence over Platonic friendship. This is a valid and timely point, although it probably won't win its author any popularity contests!"},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"During a time when it seems critical thinking about any traditional institution is considered passe, reactive or blasphemous, Jackie Geller analyzes one of the most sacred of them all, marraige. Geller walks us through the economics, the politics, the psychology and the traditions that drench weddings, coupling and &quot;love.&quot; By simply contextualizing all that happens during the wedding ritual, Geller helps to underscore the severity of the social pressure that manipulates all of us, married and unmarried, men and women, gay and straight.Like any critique of a revered social custom, hers is bound to provoke controversy. But she does not back down. In explaining how it is that so many people cling to the trappings of marraige, weddings, et al, Geller resists the temptation to sugar coat her perspective. She sticks to her position that choosing marraige has consequences, both politically and socially. That may strike some as closed-minded. But the anti-woman history of so much that surrounds marraige, not to mention the faintly revised rituals which attempt to make themsleves seem contmporary or feminist or modern, is too often ignored. Instead of seeking to justify the so-called modern wedding, Geller exposes it. Good for her. A little discomfort might not be such a bad thing when we think about happily ever after. For anyone who believes they can make the marraige decision independently, without commercial, familial or emotional pressure, this book lays out the reality with important implications for all our love lives."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"From beginning to end, I found myself admiring Ms. Geller's strength of mind and the cogency of her argument. What she proposes amounts to no less than a fresh critique of the institution of marriage- not only of its excesses (the big white wedding, the lavish honeymoon) but of the historical foundations on which marriage is based. The book will be controversial, but it is fearless in its willingness to ask tough questions about a ritual central to our culture that we take too much for granted."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"Jaclyn Geller's excellent new book blends a finely observed social comedy with a thoughtful critique of the cultural ritual of marriage and an exposure of its complicity with the normalizing forces at large within capitalist morality. Taking the elaborate preliminaries, crises and consequences of the wedding event as her central theme, Geller's gentle irony plays over the terrifying subjection of modern woman by the systems of production and consumption. Geller is both eye-opening and vastly entertaining on the subject of marriage. Her writing is stylish, astringent and restrained, her empirical and historical research of the wedding event very full, and her insights into deeper motivations often chilling. Highly recommended for all inside or outside marriage."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"I am anti-marriage, both personally and institutionally.I've had this book on my \\"to read\\" list for a couple of years, and yesterday while I was in the library, I checked it out. This is really an excellent book.I am anti-marriage, both personally and institutionally.I've had this book on my \\"to read\\" list for a couple of years, and yesterday while I was in the library, I checked it out. This is really an excellent book.Ironically, as my own blissful relationship has unfolded over the past five years, my feelings on marriage have evolved in the direction of a strong revulsion on a personal and political level (I'm one of those annoying, old school, 1970s feminists who insists that the personal is the political). As my own fairly conventional, heterosexual romantic relationship developed, the unpopular views I hold on marriage, weddings, etc., have become very clear to me. I've been refining my arguments for the past couple of years, and am encouraged when I meet other women who eschew the trap-disguised-as-fairy-tale in favor of having an unscripted life as an autonomous human being.So imagine my glee when I happened across this book in the library yesterday. I've started to read so many books about women seeking unconventional lives, and almost all of them (with the exception of, say, \\"A Room of One's Own\\") turn out to be disappointing insofar as they are sloppily written, badly argued, or - usually - not really radical at all. There are still very few examples to consider when one sets out to live life on one's own terms as an independent woman. The popular press seems to assume that we are all ball-busting, free market worshiping, workaholic \\"career women\\" (why is there no such term for \\"career men\\"? - that's a rhetorical question) who want to succeed in a man's world, on men's terms, like a man. That is anathema to me. While I do want to life as a man insofar as men are generally free to a enjoy self-directed lifestyle choices and total bodily sovereignty, I do not want to be a man or ape the conventions of male culture (see: Ariel Levy, \\"Female Chavinist Pigs\\"). Corporate culture is part and parcel of that (and has succeeded in metastasizing beyond Wall Street and into all strata of our working lives), and I therefore don't view it as an option for a meaningful feminist life.Geller's opening salvo starts with a quote from Mary Wollstonecraft, \\"My own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures, instead of flattering their fascinating graces, and viewing them as if they were in a state of perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone.\\" She then quotes de Beauvoir, Friedan, and Woolf within the first ten pages.Chapter titles include such gems as \\"Courtship and the Marriage Quest,\\" \\"The Proposal Scene in the Contemporary Imagination,\\" and \\"The Politics of Marriage Entitlement.\\" There's even a whole section critiquing Gloria Steinem's decision to marry at age 66 as a refutation of her own, earlier, more demanding political feminism in favor of the popular, choice-based personal feminism of the 90s and 00s: a capitulation and a disappointment.This book is the best thing I have ever read on marriage and outlines all of my own, hard-won thoughts in a rational, feminist voice. Not only is it a relief to have my own arguments and opinions on this subject validated by another thoughtful woman, but the fact that this book exists has freed up a lot of time I otherwise would've had to spend writing it.I cannot recommend this book highly enough if you are interested in mapping out an unconventional life as an autonomous human being; if your goals are either professional or artistic in nature; if you have persistent, lingering doubts about whether marriage is really good for women, or for you in particular; if you don't yearn for some dude to choose you and give your social existence validation and your private life meaning; if you sometimes wonder if all the wedding-crazed women around you are insane or if you are; if you feel alienated from contemporary wedding culture; if you've struggled to define your beliefs and values as I haveHere is an article from The New York Observer about the author, which I enjoyed more than anything I have read in months:[...]Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"I think Geller makes a good point with the role that women play and the commercialization of marriage. However she seems to present interesting facts on the history of marriage and the cultural role of marriage. But she then jumps to the argument that marriage and weddings are not a healthy thing for women and society?? What about a marriage based in equality and respect? What about a prenup?? What about having a wedding where you do not have to pay as much??I think that this is a fascinating book to read being interested in the cultural issues of marriage and courtship. However I find her arguments a little unsettling. I still recommend this book to people who seem to get all caught up in the marriage culture so that they have a chance to get another perspective.I would reccomend the book Pink THink for this audience"},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Geller explores the history behind marriage traditions, and explores the pros and cons (admittedly, more cons than pros) of marriage in the 21st century. It's refreshing to see someone address what I see as truth in such a logical way. She is successful in presenting objective arguments throughout the book.I do agree with the reviewer who said she would be happier if Geller wrote more about the alternative types of relationships that she found acceptable - but then, the book is about marriage. I found the book's style to be at times TOO argumentative, but I overlooked that in favor of the facts Geller presents."},{"Title":"Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique","review":"Like Jaclyn Geller, I'm an unmarried woman with divorced parents. I am also probably around her age. While I agree with what she says about heterosexual marriage being too overhyped in corporate America and the media, and I also make fun of self-help books about husband-hunting, I think she takes all of it much too seriously!I also don't subscribe to her belief that women \\"must stop repeating the absurd mantra 'it's okay to be single,' and adopt the more aggressive stance that 'it's not okay to be married (page 72).'\\" With that kind of attitude, she's no better than the radical conservatives who say just the opposite.Although I'm no expert on this subject, I did find her research on the history of marriage throughout ancient Greece, the Middle Ages, and up to the last fifty years thorough and well-written. But I think one of the reviewers here made a very good point about her not interviewing any brides or married women. I would have liked to see her interview both women who were happy being married and women who weren't, and try to find out why the unhappy women got married in the first place.Perhaps part of the answer - but not all of it - is that the happy wives got married because they really wanted to and the unhappy wives got married because they felt pressured to do it. But this way, Jaclyn Geller would have found that many women are not as vulnerable to marketing hype as she seems to believe.I think she should have made this book an expose or study of the wedding industry itself. If she explored why it's a multimillion-dollar industry and how its advertising exerts a big influence on our culture and ordinary Americans, she would have made a much stronger case."},{"Title":"The Battle of Cowpens (Kenneth Roberts Reader of the American Revolution)","review":"When he died on July 21, 1957, Kenneth Roberts was working on an historical novel of the American Revolutionary War which featured the battle of Cowpens. The description of the battle which was published as the fourth volume of the *Kenneth Roberts Reader of the American Revolution* was his last piece of historical writing. It was published in an abridged version by *Collier's*, and reprinted in 1976 as a booklet by Herbert Faulkner West. West also included a five-page extract from a piece written by Roberts in 1936 and originally published in *Modern Book Collecting for the Impecunious Amateur*, describing Roberts' method of historical research and setting forth his belief that historical novelists, by the nature of their art, are often much more careful with their historical sources than professional historians.*The Battle of Cowpens* itself, an eighty-page essay, starts by describing the general context of the battle, with Clinton first occupying Charleston then leaving Cornwallis in charge of South Carolina, and Cornwallis disobeying Clinton's orders by deciding to strike at Virginia, resulting in the defeat of Horatio Gates at Camden, South Carolina. (Those who have read *Rabble in Arms* know Roberts' opinion of Gates, which he reiterates here.) The two protagonists of the Battle of Cowpens are then presented: Daniel Morgan, the leader of the American troops, whom Roberts compares to his hero of the Northern Army, Benedict Arnold; and Banastre Tarleton, &quot;an incomparable cavalry leader&quot;, who later became a member of Parliament and died in 1833, aged seventy-eight (contrary to the fictional character of William Tavington in Gibson's *The Patriot*, who was loosely based on him.)The battle itself is described in detail, sometimes polemically or in a dramatized way, with extracts from Nathanael Greene's orders to Morgan, and from Morgan's and Tarleton's own accounts of Cowpens (the latter wrote a *History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America*, which Roberts used as a source.) Strategic and tactical maps are included at the end, together with a profile of the Cowpens, as relief played an important part in Morgan's battle plans.The booklet is just as gripping as an episode from the British TV series *In the Line of Fire*, with Roberts' evocative style doing the work of the computer graphics. It is definitely a good place to start for those who have seen Mel Gibson's *The Patriot* and wish to know what really happened at the battle that inspired its climactic action sequence."},{"Title":"The Battle of Cowpens (Kenneth Roberts Reader of the American Revolution)","review":"As a history buff, I enjoyed the book but not as much as Kenneth Roberts' trilogy on the Revolutionary War (Arundel, Rabble in Arms, and Oliver Wiswell), which are novels against the historical backdrop of that period. History told as part of a novel seems to me to be more exiting. But don't get me wrong; the Battle of Cowpens is insightful (as were, as well, the novels of the aforementioned trilogy). Kenneth Roberts (a Pulitzer Prize winner)did extensive research in writing his accounts of the Revolutionary War, and one can place unquestionable credence in what he wrote. In the Battle of Cowpens, one can see how clever Daniel Morgan was in using terrain to his advantage for the battle and confirm what an incompetent fool Horatio Gates was, a so-called hero who received false credit for winning the Battle of Saratoga (covered in Rabble at Arms). Morgan appeared in Arundel but was overshadowed by Benedict Arnold. In this book Morgan is shown to be just as heroic as Arnold and just as capable, skillful, and heroic."},{"Title":"Baby's Book of the Body","review":"My 14 month old son loves looking at the photos of the other babies and having an adult name the body parts.

The paper is good, there are little to no printing errors, and the spine is relatively in the same condition as the day I pulled it out of the box. One of may favorite qualities of this book is the inclusion of four illustrations from the hand of Tolkien himself, offering further insight into the story as Tolkien envisioned it.Even though this book is geared for a younger audience, I found it a quite enjoyable read. At just over a hundred papers, it isn't very long--taking me only a few days of very casual reading. However, this perfectly suits the tone of the story: the journey of a young dog after being cursed by a wizard."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"in a sentence or so: a naughty little puppy named Rover is quite rude to a crotchety magician. the magician, needless to say, does not take too kindly to Rover's rudeness and turns him into a toy pup. will Rover be able to ever become a real puppy again?Rover, who reminds me a lot of the Pokey Little Puppy (which is like my FAVE children's book ever), ticks off a magician. his journey then begins on finding his way back to becoming a real dog. he is put in a store window and purchased by a mom for her son, Boy 2 (her second child). Boy 2 is smitten with the toy Rover, but Rover is more concerned about become real again, not just being some little boy's toy. one day on the beach, Rover slips out of Boy 2's pocket and waits in the sand for another magician to help guide him on his journey towards real-dog-hood again.this was a really creative story. and no wonder, i mean it is written by Tolkien and all. Rover spends equal time on earth, on the moon, and in the sea. the writing feels like a parent telling their child a story, which it is. this was written by Tolkien for his son (Boy 2) after he was distraught over losing his toy dog at the beach (Rover). Tolkien draws heavily from Norse mythology in the weaving of his story and has plenty of nods to (then) cultural references. there is a note section in the back of this edition that helps guide the reader who may not be the most familiar with the year 1925 - when this was originally written.complete with dragons, wizards, and the stuff dreams - and nightmares - are made of, Rover remained a realistic and sweet character. he meets lots of fun people and has lots of wacky experiences along the way, as any good adventurer does. this is a cute, fun, sweet and quick read for people of any age.fave quote: \\"The moon-dog did not blush, because he could not; and he did not say anything, but he went and sat down in a corner and wondered how much the old man knew of everything that went on, and everything tat was said, too. Also for a little while he wondered what exactly the old man meant; but that did not bother him long - he was a lighthearted fellow.\\" 37fix er up: i got a bit impatient for things to be wrapped up. i don't really know why...it's all of 80 pages!"},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"For people who like Tolkien's \\"other\\" stories like \\"Smith of Wooton Major\\", etc. this is a great book.

I know, it's a children's book, and Tolkien was busy with The Silmarillion (this book was finished in 1925, The Silimarillion started at 1919 and ended at 1973.), but the story's WAY TOO FAST! I couldn't finish this book without saying &quot;Why? Why? Why did I read it?&quot;I'm giving it 2 stars because this is just Tolkien and it was just a children's story, way before his genius came into being in 1935 with The Hobbit."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"What a treat! The unpublished works of favorite authors nearly always disappoint. I pick them up in hopes of experiencing a fresh taste at an old table, only to find kitchen scraps intended for the garbage heap. This was not so with Roverandom. The story is a delight. The word play is delicious, with lots of rhyme, rhythm and rutabagas. Children love words like Persia and Pershore, Psamathos or Roverandom, for that matter, that they can roll around in their mouths like a handful of jelly beans. These remind me of the word play in the Alice books or a marvelous picture book I once read to my nephew about a woman named Euphonia. (I wish I could find it, or at least remember the title.) This is a children's book. However, it does not talk down to children, and it has lots of literary references most nine-year-olds would miss. These can be enjoyed by the older reader with a wink from Tolkien. I am at the awkward age. My children, in High school and collage, are too big or too busy to have children's books read to them. And I do not yet have grandchildren to regale with the wonder of books. When I grow out of this stage, Roverandom will certainly be on my list. Until then it makes splendid reading for a Summer afternoon."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"To those who would criticize this lovable little book I say, &quot;Understand a work before you judge it.&quot; Maybe you just didn't know, but Tolkien wrote this book to be read aloud to small children. Similarly, The Hobbit was actually written to be read with children. Roverandom is NOT Lord of the Rings, but it is a very good, enthralling little story..."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"For a little kid, losing a favorite toy is downright traumatic. So in 1925, when four-year-old Michael lost his little toy dog on the beach, fantasy author J.R.R. Tolkien made up a story to comfort his son. It explained away the loss of the toy, and wove a magical story around a little dog named Rover.Rover is an ordinary little puppy near the seaside in England, until he runs into a grumpy old man and ends up biting off part of his pants. The old man happens to be a wizard (Artaxerxes by name), and promptly transforms Rover into a toy dog (and no, I don't mean a tiny dog -- I mean a real toy). Rover subsequently gets picked up and sold to some little boys (presumably the Tolkien kids).Fortunately, Rover encounters another magical being, a crusty, kindly sand-wizard named Psamathos. That wizard, in turn, gets Rover (who is renamed Roverandom) flown to the moon, where he spends time with the Man in the Moon and his winged dog Rover. And then he's heading off to encounter a talking whale, a mer-dog, a sea serpent -- and a dragon.Like the vastly underrated &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham,&quot; &quot;Roverandom&quot; is a charming little bit of whimsy. No deep themes, no epic clashes, not even really a villain. The writing is charming and magical, with phrases like &quot;There was a cold wind blowing off the North Star&quot; sprinkled through it. It almost gives the feeling of being in another world. Best of all, in the middle of the book are Tolkien's own illustrations, cute little drawings and ethereal paintings.Rover is well-named, since his adventures are all over the map and don't really progress from one to the other. It's merely a cute little dog roaming over the moon, the ocean, and the land, conversing with shrimps and bothering wizards. He's an outspoken little guy, but likeable. The grumpy wizards are also excellently done, reminiscent of Gandalf.While &quot;Roverandom&quot; is a book aimed at children, adults may enjoy the whimsical humor and beautiful writing. A charming and timeless story."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Roverandom takes place once upon a time in England. The main character in this story is Rover (Roverandom). The other main characters are Artaxerxes, Psamathos, the Man-in-the-Moon, the moon-dog Rover, Mew, Two, and the mer-dog Rover.The conflict was that Rover (Roverandom) was turned into a toy dog by the old magician Artaxerxes, and then sold to a little boy named Two. Rover then runs away hoping to be free but then runs into the wizard Psamathos who sends Roverandom on many journeys and he meets many new friends. But Rover longs to become a real dog again and hopes to find the magician.My favorite character probably was the Man-in-the-Moon's dog Rover because he kept Roverandom company while on the Moon, even though they argued some. And because it is very unusual for a dog to live on the moon so it makes Rover extra special to me. I think this is a fun little book that all ages would enjoy. Tolkien orginally wrote Roverandom 70 years ago to comfort his 4-year-old son Michael who lost his favorite toy dog on the beach. Tolkien started to write this book after The Hobbit was published, and he stopped to begin writing The Lord of the Rings. So in 1998 Roverandom was finally published. This book would make a great read aloud book for kids and adults of all ages to enjoy."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Roverandom is a sweet little book which would probably be best used as a read-aloud introduction to Tolkien for small children. It is neither profound, nor a masterpiece, but it is fun to read. It is the story of a puppy that is turned into a toy dog by a passing wizard, and his adventures as he tries to get back to real-dog-ness. This edition has extensive endnotes, almost to the point of being silly (they explain a reference to Humpty Dumpty!). But the endnotes are otherwise helpful and entertaining if you are curious about the current event allusions in the text. All in all, it is an entertaining book, and worth sharing with a young friend."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"I quite enjoyed Roverandum and thought it very enchanting and pleasant.It had lovely descriptions and very pleasing and interesting characters. Some may think it too cute or rather pale beside of The Lord of the Rings but you have to remember that this story was orginally written for a child.It reminded me of the Doctor Dolittle books which have also been called rather whimsy and cute. Anyway Roverandum is a nice little story, pure humor and enchantment."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Nor, do I think, was it intended to be. There is no battle between Good and Evil. The characters are not larger than life. It is not a morality tale (unless you're in the habit of biting the trousers of strange wizards). This story seemed to me more A.A. Milne than Hobbit or Lord of the Rings.The title is perfect. The adventures of Rover are pretty darn random. But you've ever worked with first graders, you know that a child's world (and mind) is filled with randomness. The humor is delightfully British. Take for instance, this excerpt in which Rover (after being turned into a toy and bought by the mother) is taken home in a bag with various other purchased items (bear in mind that, at this early point in the story, Rover is a rather cheeky little pup):&quot;Rover soon managed to wriggle his head out of the paper. He smelt cake. But he found he could not get at it; and right down there among the paper bags he growled a little toy growl. Only the shrimps heard him, and they asked him what was the matter. He told them all about it, and expected them to be very sorry for him, but they only said:'How would you like to be boiled? Have you ever been boiled?''No! I have never been boiled, as far as I remember,' said Rover, 'though I have sometimes been bathed, and that is not particularly nice. But I expect boiling isn't half as bad as being bewitched.''Then you have certainly never been boiled,' they answered. 'You know nothing about it. It's the very worst thing that could happen to anyone - we are still red with rage at the very idea.'Rover did not like the shrimps, so he said: 'Never mind, they will soon eat you up, and I shall sit and watch them!'After that the shrimps had no more to say to him, and he was left to lie and wonder what sort of people had bought him.&quot;Yes, this is a children's book. But I bought and read it halfway through a very grueling masters program, and it was just the escape from academia that I needed. It's absurd, and silly, and light-hearted, and absolutely wonderful. I recommend it for children of all ages, especially the grown up children who need a quick breath of magic to liven up the reality of adulthood."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"This book was a delight for my 10-year-old (and me), even after already having read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. A clever, enchanting story with lots of fun and unexpected twists. Our thanks to whoever found this &quot;lost&quot; work."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Granted, this is a book written for Tolkien's children, and it does contain some nice little word-play elements -- but lets face it: This is not a literary masterpiece -- but niether is it trash either. With Tolkien's children's fiction, with the exception of THE HOBBIT, its not so much the quality of it but the fact that it exists. These activities culiminated in the composistion of THE HOBBIT. When Allen &amp; Unwin accepted it for publication and it became a runaway hit, they wanted more about 'hobbits'. This book, MR. BLISS, THE LOST ROAD, and THE SILMARILLION (OF BEREN &amp; LUTHIEN, the poetic form, was submitted with perhaps FARMER GILES as well)found its way to the publishing house in 1937. But Sir Stanely Unwin wanted not these but a hobbit sequel, of which we all know what happened with that.This being said, ROVERANDOM shows Tolkien delighting in the position of a story teller for his children. The love and warmth shows clearly in these pages, and while its not the best thing ever written, it does have its charms. Largely, however, this work is for Tolkien completists, and by and large will not win over any fans. But if you looking for a book to read to your younger children and you want it to be Tolkien, this is a good choice. But if they're a little older, give 'em the real meat and introduce them to that lovable Bilbo Baggins. Its worth a look, but not necessarily a second or third."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Not that I disliked it; I just couldn't get into it. The characters seem to be introduced too fast and I didn't feel as if I knew enough about them to care. This book didn't have the pacing or, more importantly, the ambiance of The Hobbit; never mind anything else. If it had those two elements, I would have enjoyed it more. Still, the book had some nice imagery and dialogue and would be a good way to wean younger readers on Tolkien's later books."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"This lovely little book is similar to the Hobbit in style but shorter and smaller in scope. Great for those who enjoy the Hobbit or Farmer Giles of Ham. Also great for anyone who enjoys lighthearted adventures even if they have not read Tolkien before.Not similar to the epic grandeur of the Lord of the Rings nor connected to Tolkien's 'Silmarillion' mythology, this book still holds a place in any collection of literature to dazzle and delight."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Reading Roverandom, by J.R.R. Tolkien, was like opening a dusty box of childhood memories left under my bed. It has a sort of playful side to it. When Rover was journeying to the moon on the back of a seagull named Mew, and almost traveled an actual road in the sky to get there. Tolkien dragged you into the plot by drawing you in as a part of his outrageous world, giving you a sense of belonging. For instance, he'd mention the names of the flowers on the moon, as if it were nothing and as if they were common knowledge. Fairbells, tinklebells, ringaroses, pennywhistles, tintrumpets, feathergrasses, fairy-fiddlestrings, etc... Roverandom was short and extremely fast-pace. Tolkien consumed big slices of time like homemade bread. He would say, \\"Rover and the Sea-dog had many more adventures under the ocean, but we can save those for another time.\\" It left a lot of room for your imagination to run wild. Strangely, it was very entertaining. When Rover is under the ocean and causes the sea serpent to awaken on accident, his shy little attitude makes you sad for him. But, of course, good books are the ones that make you feel something. They are the ones that make you feel like you're the main character without ever having been in their position.This little novel is about a little dog that goes on many strange and magical adventures. It starts off with Rover biting Artaxerxes's trousers. Artaxerxes is an old grumpy wizard who just happened to be strolling by, and some say it wasn't coincidence. The old wizard become furious with Rover and turns him into a miniature toy puppy. Rover goes through many bizarre complications trying to get back to his original form. The entire journey not only turns out to be a lesson for Artaxerxes and his anger-control, but for Rover as well.Despite all the wild journeys, the uncanny characters, the abnormal locations, and Rover's involuntary arbitrary movement, I found that the best part of Roverandom was remembering how to be a kid again. Fantasy books tend to do that to me, and this was most definitely one of those enchanted stories. It is the kind that you can curl up with on the couch, and ponder all the strange and magical adventures you've had over the years."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"This is a great children's story. As is stated in the introduction, Tolkien created this story about a dog for one of his sons, when he lost his toy dog. The dog in this story (Rover) goes on many fantasy adventures. On his adventures, Rover encounters wizards, and mermaids, and other magical creatures. Throughout the tale Rover is trying to get back to a young boy he met on one of his adventures. The vocabulary in this book is occasionally a little advanced for a young reader. Tolkien always believed in challenging young readers, he felt this is how they got better. Also present are some familiar Tolkien themes, such as a negative portrayal of technology."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"I feel that Roverandom, although short, is a good book. If you are wondering whether or not to read it, I think you should. This story of a dog that is turned into a toy and then sent to the moon is fun for all ages!"},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Long before Tolkien constructed the sweeping landscapes of Middle Earth, he created this charming series of improbable events. It started on a summer holiday, when a small nephew lost a favorite stuffed toy at the beach. In order to console the stricken child, Tolkien narrated these rambling adventures of a stuffed toy much like the one lost. 'Roverandom,' as the little toy dog is eventually named, meanders across the countryside, to the moon and back, and to a mermaid land beneath the sea in a series of gentle adventures, carefully stripped of any truly dark moments or frightening parts. It comes across as a mild-mannered but pleasant way to entertain a small child, much the same way that Beatrix Potter'sFairy Caravandid.As a result, it charmed me at a level too deep to resist. My own father told my brothers and me similar rambling, safe adventures when we were small. Perhaps his stories, like these, were slightly inane in themselves and he was certainly no Tolkien, but that doesn't matter. They arose from a base of paternal caring, they were created uniquely for us, and we loved them. Even if the editors hadn't done such a meticulous job of documenting the stories' origins, I would have recognized the same affectionate spirit in these as in my father's.But the editors, Scull and Hammond, did a fine, scholarly job of researching these stories. Roughly twenty pages of introduction describe the stories as they grew in their telling, by comparing different editions from Tolkien's files. Then, another fifteen pages of endnotes explain literary references and obscure terms scattered throughout the stories. Although academically rigorous, these bits of research contrast sharply with the tone of the stories they describe.If you just take the Roverandom stories themselves, you'll find a fine bit of literary comfort food, well suited to any read-to-me kid with a bit of imagination. Tolkien completists might also be interested in this early stage of Tolkien's storytelling skills, but the gentle warmth in these stories is enough for me.- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"So much fun for adults and kids. I read this to my kid brother often and he loves it as much as I do."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"How different the world looks when you are made from small to tiny! How much fun you can have, and all the amazing things you can go and see, even when you are only a small dog, turned into an even smaller toy.Roverandom! A children's novel written by JRR Tolkien, but an actual event. No, his dog was not turned into a small toy, and sailed over the world, too the moon meeting the man in the tower, the great dragon, seagulls and gods, but by his Son, who had lost his toy dog on a family vacation.JRR Tolkien is more famously known for his epic story of: The Lord of the Rings. However, a large amount of work written by JRR Tolkien were children's stories, and this was one excellent. It is about a small dog, Rover, who gets changed into a small toy dog by a wizard, after taking a bit at him! Think before leaping!After being picked up and placed into a toy shop, Rover is bought, and his adventure begins. Ever looking, and trying, to return to his home, Rover goes on an amazing adventure, around the world, below the seas, and too the moon. We meet amazing characters such as the man in the moon, another, old Rover, who can fly, great dragons, where children go when they dream.The story is very well wrapped together, and even though was written, people of all ages can enjoy it. We have all lost thing, precious and not, and maybe we'll stop to think where they actually go! Many fans of Tolkien will see correlations to other pieces of his work, but Roverandom stands on his own 4 legs as his own little big adventure!"},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"After the hobbit, our younger children who love Tolkien had very little to read. We did get farmer Giles of Ham, but Roverandom was liked much better. Tolkien's imagination and word play are really delightful."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Up until relatively recently, Roverandom existed in the minds of Tolkien fans as a mysterious open secret: an unpublished work. For a man whose notes to the milkman and getting-the-pen-to-work scribbles on the inside cover of the Yellow Pages were trumpeted by publishers and family alike as 'masterpieces', this was remarkable. Look the old professor up on Amazon and it's not long before the list of works begins to look significantly desperate (Tales from the Perilous Realm, Finn and Hengest: The Fragment and the Episode, Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-Earth, etc.). Did he mean for all this stuff to be plundered for public consumption? So, finding a complete and illustrated work that hasn't seen the light of day in almost 70 years is odd to say the least. The five illustrations were seen in a couple of academic books, and also at the Bodleian Library's centenary exhibition, but the text was unknown until 1997/1998.The story is based upon an incident that occurred when the Tolkiens were on holiday in the Yorkshire seaside town of Filey, in 1925. Tolkien's four-year-old son lost a small toy dog and became distraught. To console him, his father created a story about a real dog that is magically transformed into a toy and is forced to seek out the wizard who wronged him to be returned to normal. In the course of his search he goes to the Moon and the bottom of the sea and being a mischievous little tyke, gets up to all sorts of adventures. Much like The Hobbit, there are wizards and dragons and huge flesh eating spiders, told here in the singy-songy voice of a good-humoured children's tale. But unlike The Lord of the Rings, this time there is none of the thunder and bombast of, for instance:&quot;...for answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse. 'On Shadowfax! We must hasten. Time is short. See! The beacons of Gondor are alight, calling for aid. War is kindled. See, there is the fire on Amon Dn, and flame on Eilenach; and there they go speeding west: Nardol, Erelas, Min-Rimmon, Calenhad and the Halifirien on the borders of Rohan...'Instead, we get:&quot;Once upon a time there was a little dog, and his name was Rover. He was very small, and very young, or he would have known better; and he was very happy playing in the garden in the sunshine with a yellow ball, or he would never have done what he did.&quot;Which, frankly, is much better.Tolkien was only in his early thirties when the first draft was written, and it's full of the sort of easy jokes and casual references a well-read young academic might throw in for his little boy's amusement. Old Mother Hubbard's dog has a walk on part, there's a gentle and affectionate explanation of what happens when we dream, there are sly nods towards his work at Oxford, carrots dangled perhaps to entice his youngsters into enjoying the things he himself loved? Well, possibly.What we have ultimately is a slight tale - it's only 80 pages long - clearly created for reading aloud at bedtime for young children eager to believe that their toys can become animated and exciting (it'll come as no surprise that Rover can only become 'alive' at night when his owner is asleep) if they allow their imaginations to run riot. And that can't be a bad thing. I also can't find the phrase 'a fairy tale for all ages' in the notes or press blurbs and that's surely a boon. More importantly, it happens to be a handy stopgap when you leave your grown-up book on the bus.So will I be reading any more JRRT? Has this fired me up to try LotR again after a twenty-year break? Amon Dn, Eilenach, Nardol, Erelas, Min-Rimmon, Calenhad and the Halifirien?!

In fact, some of the hardcore fans--the kind that dress up like elves and things like that--probably won't even like it. It's a silly little story about a small dog who bites a wizard on the behind and gets turned into a toy, and then goes on to have a number of adventures on the moon and under the sea. What I liked about the book is its wonderful freedom from the strictest constraints of plot, and Tolkien's whimsical willingness to throw whatever takes his fancy--like the musical plants one finds on the moon.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Let's face it, the only reason most people would read this story would be because they're curious to see how Tolkien writes when his subject is not rings and Hobbits. I was, frankly, surprised to see that he'd ever published anything non-Middle-Earthy. Roverandom certainly wasn't advertised much. It is set in a rather fantastical version of the present-day (or at least of Tolkien's present-day) and is definitely a story for children (with a few winks to any adults who may be reading the story aloud). True, the narration contains all that is wryest and most whimsical of Tolkien's humor, but other than that, Roverandom bears no resemblance to The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit. But there's a warmth and affection in Roverandom that those other books do not contain, and that is best explained, I think, by the story's origin. According to the introduction, Tolkien and his family were on vacation near the sea one year when his children were young. One day when they were visiting the beach, one of his little boys lost his favorite toy, a tiny lead dog, in the sand. The whole family searched hard that day and the next, but they never found the toy again. To comfort his grieving son, Tolkien invented a story about how the toy was truly a real dog who had been enchanted and how he had to go off and have marvelous adventures in order to regain his proper shape. And so Roverandom was conceived--a love story, not in that it contains a tale of romance, but in that it was told out of love for a child. And that alone makes it beautiful."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"The genius of Tolkien - that of fantastical and wonderful story-telling - simply cannot be hidden! Even while vacationing with his family, incidents there would provide inspiration for new tales. When his son lost his toy dog on the beach, Tolkien started \\"Roverandom\\" as a comfort for his son...and so it became a tale that Tolkien grew, worked & reworked until it became the delightful, full, nostalgic piece that it is today.The story starts off with a little dog playing with his yellow ball in his owner's backyard. Suddenly, an old man appears, and he and the dog have a misunderstanding. The old man turns out to be a wizzard, and so he turns the dog into a toy. From there, your mind is constantly stimulated as Tolkien brings so many unexpected twists and turns to the story...from the dog's existence as a boy's toy dog to his trip to the moon over the sea to his adventures with the dog on the moon.As with Tolkien's other works, the presence of wizzards is omnipresent and highly entertaining. He has 3 dominant wizzards with very different personas and responsibilities. Their eccentric, sometimes wise and easily-annoyed temperaments remind one of Gandalf...but these simplistic characters are just shades of that great character. Tolkien also explores such ideas as where we go when we dream and the special access children have to other dimensions but he does this with a light, exploratory tone...not at all with the serious convictions of some of his larger works.In a similar way as \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\", this wonderful tale helped give me some more insight into Tolkien's phenomenal mind. While Lord of the Rings shows an untold depth to this man, these smaller stories show how he takes delight in comical, ironical, classical tales as well. It seems that he naturally was drawn to worlds in which wizzards, giants, dragons, and pathways to the moon exist...and he had a true talent in relating these worlds to others."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Roverandom is a great book no matter what age you are.

Little Rover, a real dog turned into a toy, gets into various scrapes, lives with the Man in the Moon (and the Dog in the Moon) for a bit, and meets a whole lot of people with very silly names.To get a feel for the style, it's really a lot more like the Father Christmas Letters than the Hobbit, and is full of Tolkien's scetches and paintings."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"The roverandom book is like a tale of child hood memories wrapped together with tales of fantasy and folklore to lure the reader in ."},{"Title":"The Constantin Marriage","review":"Description on back cover:Alex Constantin agreed to a marriage of convenience to Tatiana Beaufort because this inexperienced young woman intrigued him.

Once you have read one Dirk Pitt novel, you have read them all."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I had eagerly been waiting for this book for quite some time, but after I read it, I was really disappointed. I've read all of Clive Cussler's books, and this is the worst one I've read so far. There wasn't any of the magic or fun that I've come to expect in the books, nor the passion. It's almost like Cussler couldn't quite make up his mind in what direction he wanted to go, and in the end, he went in too many different directions."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a Clive Cussler fan and love to escape into a good adventure with Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, Admiral Sandecker, and other NUMA characters. I have enjoyed all of his books including this one. However, I like my science fiction to be based in sound science and almost all of the science fiction in this book is absurd. Good science fiction should deal with phenomena that we don't know about. For example: existence of extraterrestrial life, faster than light travel by means yet undiscovered, thinking computers, etc. Unfortunately, this offering by Cussler serves up numerous science tales that are known to be not so. Beginning with a comet impact in Hudson Bay a mere 7500 years ago, which didn't happen, and a tale of global plate movement that did occur but slowly and during the past 200 million years rather than in a few years, Cussler causes groans and cringing in the geoscience community. Simple things such as cold water in a warm mine should have been edited out. Alas, the worst flaw is the premise that moving the Ross Ice shelf would cause an imbalance in the distribution of mass on the surface of the Earth. On this little gem, Archimedes would groan loudest of all if he were still around. Of course, the notion of Atlantis is fanciful and fun, but there isn't a scrap of physical evidence that would support its existence. So my recommendation is this. If you perceived the &quot;science fiction&quot; in this book to be plausible, please go buy and read Carl Sagan's &quot;The Demon-Haunted World.&quot; On the other hand, if you don't really care, the unfortunate fact is that you have lots of company."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Having read all the previous Cussler (Pitt) novels I was looking forward to this one. I can only say I was disappointed from page one.Cussler continues to paint Pitt into corners but, instead of using his wits to escape, Pitt is too often saved by the serendipity of another character's actions.Nothing is gained with difficulty. Need an explanation of what the heck the plot is about halfway through? No problem. Bring in an ex-Nazi to explain, in detail, about the Antartic base.The impossible comes too easily. The good guys and bad just blab, blab, blab about things one would not normally speak of. Documents and historical records are found with no real effort.Either Cussler is getting too old or Pitt is. I found the book incredibly boring.Every woman who meets Pitt automatically falls in lust with him, and the on-going thing with his classic cars is getting old.Physical descriptions primarily run to hair and eye color, and are just thrown in instead of being incorporated into the writing.Mr. Cussler needs to take a refresher course in creative writing and remember &quot;SHOW--Don't TELL!&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read only half of the book, but can't seem to get interested in it. It isn't what I thought it would be. I'm halfway through and nothing has really happened in it to make me want to read more. This is my first book by Clive Cussler. I thought maybe it was just a 'guy' book, but I have read several reviews by women who liked it. According to some of the reviews I have read, this is Clive's worst book, wouldn't you know it. I plan on finishing the book, but will probably not buy another from the author. There was also a misspelled word in the book, can't remember the page number, but it has &quot;craved&quot; instead of &quot;carved.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I had never heard of Clive Cussler or Dirk Pitt when I borrowed this book on the recommendation of a relative. They shall both be quickly forgotten. This was one of the worst-written, ill-conceived books I have read in a long time. The plot was sophmoric and the dialogue inept. This books is best described as a cartoon, a comic book, that somehow made it into hardcover form."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I had never read Cussler, so didn't know what to expect. Eventually, after reading half the book, and seeing a bookstore display touting Dirk as the hero, I came to realize that Atlantis Found was one in a series of quasi-techno-thrillers akin to my favorite Tom Clancy/Jack Ryan novels. Clive even has the chutzpa to associate Dirk with Jack Ryan by name in the story. Name dropping only served only to make poor, lame Dirk all the more pale and second-rate.I was heartened in the beginning by the Atlantis theme, being a fan of Atlantis lore. This promising start quickly disintegrated into mere study of the improbable. Dirk's arrival on the scene and rescue of some of the characters trapped in a mine for starters. I was confused as well as to how the goons of the Forth Empire could discover, infiltrate and destroy a hitherto unknown underground room from a single phone call, yet are unaware of a little old lady who had the same artifact on her mantle for 80 years -- when apparently their predecessors had a hand in trying to killer her grandmother some decades before in the Antarctic. Huh? Exactly.The hero and his buddies seem to have a psychic ability to know exactly what is going on at all times. For example after a parked helicopter explodes marooning two characters on a remote island one announces that it was a bomb put on the chopper before they left and set to go off while they were over the water on the return trip -- a kill averted by their unexpected lingering on the island. At every turn Dirk knew that whatever happened was no accident, they, or &quot;the killers&quot; had elaborately planned it, and he knew exactly how with only the evidence of the clearing smoke.Tying the improbable and implausible together throughout is the inane dialogue. I thought I was reading the work of a 7th grader. I started getting a tic when, after watching a group of characters have their first experience deep in a mine (unnerving in itself), be trapped inside by an avalanche -- which knocked the lights out -- then followed by an explosion which creates a cave in and somehow causes the water level to rise (I'm not sure this is geologically possible), the sudden appearance of Dirk to the rescue and a trial by water buddy breathing on scuba to &quot;safety&quot; for people who had never been on Scuba (one who couldn't swim), in freezing water, a long tromp through the mines, then being confronted by gun toting guys on motorcycles (refereed to exhaustively as &quot;the killers&quot;) who announce that they are going to kill the haggard trio (actually a quartet but they don't know about Dirk... until he springs into action and kills the killers right in front of the shocked on lookers). Sounds like a bad day. All that and they still aren't home safe. Are they freaked out? Upset? Let's see, in the next conversation...Then Pitt paused and asked, &quot;Have any of you ridden motorcycles?&quot;I rode a Harley for ten years,&quot; answered Marquez.&quot;And I have an old Honda CBX Super Sport that belonged to my dad,&quot; Pat volunteered.&quot;Do you ride it?&quot;Rode it through college. I still hit the roads with it on weekends.&quot;Pitt looked at Pat with newfound respect. &quot;So you're an old leather-crotch, hard-in-the-saddle woman.&quot;You got that,&quot; she said proudly.Where is the fear? Where is the shock at the ordeal? Where is any hint of reality in this entire book? I couldn't find it. I could only take so much of this bad writing, and quit halfway through. Take my advise and bypass this one entirely and go straight for Without Remorse by Clancy."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I thought the book was totally gay"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is not the sort of book I usually read, but I decided to give it a try for something different. I surprised myself when I liked it. Great read!If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I had a blast reading this book. Dirk Pitt adventures are usually pretty fun. BUT what more can U ask for?

The plot moves fast, there's alot of action. At times you are thinking &quot;come on&quot; when Dirk and his pals take on unimaginable odds and win. But it's sort of like an action movie with James Bond or Arnold, fun if a bit unbelievable.The plot twists and turns and when I thought &quot;it's over&quot; it wasn't. Even Mr. Cussler shows up as a character in this book. One thing though &quot;WHO was the leak at Numa&quot;? That never got answered. AND the advertising?...Dirk and his girlfriend drink Ray Martin Cabernet.

The mind's eye paints a beautiful picture of Cussler's description of people, places, and events. My only complaint about this book is in the editing. There were several instances of contradictions and inconsistencies in the subject matter. A good editor should have caught these."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Fascinating story, BUT, good Lord--the dialogue! Clusser is in desperate need of a partner to handle the dialogue; people do not talk like that, and I cringe/am disappointed anew every time his characters open their mouths."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"There are two kinds of people: the ones who love Clive Cussler and his books and the ones who despise him and his books. After reading &#65533;The mediterranean caper&#65533;, &#65533;Inca gold&#65533; and &#65533;Raise the Titanic&#65533;, I was struggling not to be part of the second group. After reading &#65533;Atlantis found&#65533;, I&#65533;m more convinced to be part of the second.These four books made me understand the following: A) Clive Cussler&#65533;s characters have enormous potential to be unforgettable. B) His plots, though mainly implausible, can be cool. C) Cussler doesn&#65533;t know how to write. D) Cussler is becoming megalomaniac, like, say, Tom Clancy.&#65533;The mediterranean caper&#65533; is one of Cussler&#65533;s first books. In it, the set is confined, the plot is OK, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino are amusing and even interesting characters, sort of (clich&eacute; coming) a blend of James Bond with Indiana Jones. That&#65533;s OK. People like their heros to be undestructible, women falling all over them, etc. I supposed Cussler, along the years, would improve his writing style, develop more his characters and plots. &#65533;Inca gold&#65533; was clearly an improvement compared to &#65533;The mediterranean caper&#65533; and &#65533;Raise the Titanic&#65533;. But &#65533;Atlantis found&#65533; is something else.Dirk Pitt and Giordino are still immortal, superior human beings. All other characters, no exception, in &#65533;Atlantis found&#65533;, are sadly poor. The plot and its premises are laughable. Neo-nazis responsible for a great world-wide catastrophe in order to rule the world is nothing new. The beginning of the book is good and gets the reader hooked, but after a hundred pages everything falls apart. In fact, some passages of the book were interesting, but this only made the worst parts of the book more visible. In the end, I just wanted the book to finish fast.Still, I would give &#65533;Atlantis found&#65533; three stars, but two things made it drop to two:1) Cussler&#65533;s mania in giving every object its complete specifications, characteristics, etc. Example:&#65533;This is the new german Glock Super .358 Caliber Two Chambers Silver Reloadable Master I just got.&#65533;Or &#65533;I&#65533;d like a bottle of Chateau Perriere Sauvignon Dandini Zidane Alain Prost Cabernet 76 please. If you have one of them, of course&#65533;.2) Cussler in fact is a character in his own book! This is ridiculous!To sum it up, in my opinion, Dirk Pitt is a great character in the hands of a bad writer.Grade 4.5/10"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"To say I was disappointed in this novel is an understatement. The promise of an interesting premise is quickly destroyed by illogical action, verbose exposition, unrealistic dialogue and non-existent characterization. The hero--Dirk Pitt--is so superficial it is impossible to care about him, as are the other characters. I realize characterization is not always a priority in plot-based novels, but, as a reader, I expect at least some sort of sympathetic bond to the people about which I'm reading, especially if I'm asked to commit my time to more than 500 pages. So many flaws abounded in this novel that I found myself amused by its incompetence. For example, in one scene an underground location is described as nearly completely dark, yet one of the characters notes the color of another one's eyes. And that is only one of the minor problems with this novel. Much larger gaps of logic and probability occur throughout the work. I finished the book only because I chose it as a part of my reading regimen. I don't plan on reading any more Clive Cussler novels."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"&quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is without question the most poorly written book I have ever read. I finished it out of curiosity as I wondered, how bad could it actually get? I am embarrassed for Mr. Cussler, his editor (did he have one?) and the publisher. This book could help a middle school english class learn about bad writing.What stands out? Now that's a challenge. I'll pick the first few things that come to mind. Large portions of the the text reminded me of the old &quot;Tom Swift&quot; books, not only because of the outrageous technology (&quot;nano&quot; technogy was fun - microscopic machines that spontaneouly manufacture other little machines that can somehow carve off a 1,500 mile long ice shelf), but also because of Mr Cussler's often hilarious invention of new adverbs, created by appending &quot;-ly&quot; onto the ends of unsuspecting adjectives and nouns. (Remember the old joke that goes; &quot;What we need is another man who can hit sixty home runs a year, said the manager, RUTHlessly.&quot;) Or how about the plotlines which go nowhere, or the unending grammatical mistakes. Or how about the time one of the heroes notices &quot;..a bulge in the pants...&quot; of the other hero. (Don't worry, the bulge turns out to be his Bushmaster (!) handgun.) Or how about... Well, you get the point.Anyway, it occured to me that there might be other explainations. Perhaps the publisher was performing a test market to see if huge quantities money could be made by getting an orangutan or a chimp to do the writing, thereby eliminating those pesky fees often demanded by homo sapien authors. Or, perhaps Mr. Cussler lost a bet in a bar. Or perhaps tired of the limelight, Mr. Cussler wrote a book intended to destroy his reputation, only to be thwarted when thousands of mass market readers bought it and actually liked it! Are good authors measured by skill, or getting distribution on those little racks you find in supermarkets, drug stores, etc.?Well, Mr. Cussler is no doubt laughing all the way to the bank. I have to admit, &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; made me laugh as well, so it wasn't a total loss from that perspective."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first and last Clive Cussler book I will read. Interesting premise...poorly written. He's a master of the extended metaphor and run on sentence. I prefer better written stories. Try some Crichton instead...this is a typical guy book in the same way there are typical gothic romances."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The only thing wrong with this book is that we will have to wait another two years for Mr. Cussler to do another Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Congratulations Clive Cussler. You read \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\" by Graham Hancock. You thought to yourself it would make a great piece of fiction. And you managed to comletely screw it up!I had never read Clive Cussler before, and I never will again. First of all, the dialogue was utter nonsense. No one speaks like these characters. Also, why in the world does the author insist on describing in detail every piece of machinery, or gadget that Dirk Pitt (and what a stupid name!) or his enemies are using? This is inane. Is Clive Cussler getting kick backs from all of the brand names that he mentions in his books? Everything about this book can be summed up in one little 5 letter word.Silly.If you respect your intelligence, stay away from this one! I would have given no stars if it was possible."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The only honest way to sum up this novel is to come right out and say the sad truth: thus book is god-awful trash. The plot is so outlandish ( yes, I realize it is a VERY fictious action novel, however, when your characters make 007 seem plausible in comparison then you have crossed the fiction barrier and entered the comic book zone.) that it is almost stunning in its servile inanity. I have enjoyed many of the authors other novels, but his creativity, not to mention his prose stylings, reached their zenith with &quot; Inca Gold&quot;. The plot revolves around a family of Nazi indoctrinated, ego-manical, genetically engineered family of would-be world destroyers. In an attempt to create a society that is flawless, these beautiful ( Though, being as Cusslers yardstick for measurement of emotional intelligence is a womans swooning at Dirk Pitts very image, these females are portrayed as a collective of fridged women )ladys and their brainy, brawny and buff brothers attempt to purge the globe of the lesser beings who account for 99.99% of the worlds population. The hackneyed, contrived manner in which this plot unravels is so laughable it is almost a study in stupidity. The authors protagonists, Dirk Pitt and his trusty sidekick Al, have survived more disasters than the entire U.S armed forces combined. The only thing these two indestructable Uber-heros lack are blue body stockings, capes and iron on S's. I can not express enough how bad this novel actually is. I would have given it negitive 5 stars had I the option. If this pap infested tripe had been sent to a publisher from an unpublished writer, the manuscript would have been set on fire. Save your money and spend it on something more entertaining and enjoyable, like watching your clothes tumble about in a laundermat dryer."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Clive Cussler book. I didn't realize that I was jumping into the 15th or 16th book in the series. I can't wait to go back and read the previous ones. This book combines ancient history and adventure, as well as politics and the military, in an effort to provide a first-rate novel. The character development that went into this book and the series is phenomenal and is second only to the creative storyline that keeps you guessing until the end. If you like me are a fan of paperback novels packed with action and adventure this series is for you."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first Dirk Pitt novel and I must say that I was rather disappointed. The idea of the story was interesting, but the writing made it very hard to enjoy. From the horrible dialogue-some of the worst I've ever read in an actually-published book, to the action scenes that just became frankly ridiculous, the author really got in his own way while telling this story. Though I like action and adventure and wild, far flung ideas do not bother me in the least, it was that I never had any sense of danger for Pitt or his friends. I knew nothing would/could happen to Dirk, he is just too good, and that drained the suspense and excitement out of the action sequences. I can understand how some people would enjoy this though, as it reads just like a movie. In fact, I can't believe this or other Dirk Pitt novels have not been adapted to the screen, I can't imagine it would be that hard. But I think this will be my only Cussler novel, and I do not recommend it. Now, if I can only get that dialogue out of my head...."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I will continue to read cussler and dirk pitt. I just wish the way the story unwinds would differ a little.....This is another good one."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"...Then you'll find Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures a bit silly, too. I actually had to begin reading a second book in the series to make sure he really intended to write the way he does. Atlantis Found is a little Indiana Jones, a little James Bond (Roger Moore days) and a bit of a spoof on both of them. Let's see, greedy rich people don't care if what they do to further their own dreams causes chaos on a global level, so government employed adventurer Dirk Pitt shows up in the nick of time to save the day with wit and uncanny reflexes and endless knowledge of how to survive almost anything. How many other titles are this same story line? Who cares? Despite putting himself in each story like Hitchcock popping up in his own films, I'm starting to find Cussler almost annoyingly likeable and his fast-reading tales wryly enjoyable. You may roll your eyes and say, \\"Nuh-uh!\\" a lot, but once you've read Clive's opaline green-eyed alter ego and his exploits, I'd be surprised if you didn't find yourself hooked, too. Atlantis Found is well crafted, intriguing, and just plain fun...."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Clive Cussler book I've read and from the very first page I was hooked. This book has a wonderfully eerie and ingenious introduction. But the more I read, the more irritated at his writing style, or lack of it, I became. I can't recall reading more wooden dialogue in my life. It is painful. His sentence structure and phrasing would have been red penciled by my sophomore English teacher. I found myself wanting to rewrite almost every paragraph, and groaning out loud, but I couldn't put it down. If only he could combine his clever ideas, action, impressive technical knowledge and eye for detail with a writing style that was not cringe-inducing, I would read another."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read a number of Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures and my general reaction is that his earlier ones tend to be better than the later ones.The plots of ALL of his books are pretty fantastic (i.e. unbelievable) but the earlier ones are more attentively written. By the time you get to ATLANTIS FOUND, you pretty much know Cussler's tried and tested format: 1. Something weird happens somewhere; 2. Dirk and Al get involved in it; 3. On the way, Dirk meets and beds a smart, pretty woman who is somehow involved with the weirdness Dirk and Al are solving (poor old Al never seems to get the girl); 4. Many cool gadgets and cars later, problem solved, Dirk gets to save the world and celebrate over a glass of vintage tequila.ATLANTIS FOUND contains some really shoddy writing and some creaky and predictable dialogue, but for pure macho escapism, it's good fun."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I would love to give this book a full five stars just for the unbounded creativity of the story; this ain't literature, folks, this is pure fun. And, this is pure SF. I've read all of Clive Cussler's books, but this one is really over the top. He's thrown caution to the winds, given his characters the most utterly humanly impossible odds, and of course they always win. Not realistic by a long shot, but who cares? This is good stuff, truly enjoyable to those who like SF, adventure, hi-tech, or thrillers. Oh, yeah, why only three stars if I like it so much? Well, the similes and metaphors can be pretty bad, the dialogue is silly and unreal, and the prose just adequate. But then again, this ain't literature, is it? Just a terrifc story. Go for it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews! This is Dirk Pitt! This is Clive Cussler!

I understand how long research takes, but please hurry with your next one!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Again Clive Cussler has Dirk Pitt in all his glory and a story line to go with it that could be close to actual events and history.

The best book since the last Clive Cussler book. Clive Cussler is the greatest author I have ever known. I just can't say enough about the book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I would go to 4 1/2 stars if I had the choice. This is a definite page turner. There are unlikely coincidences, improbable plot devices, occasional syntax errors, and a few erroneous details. But reading books like this is about suspending reality, at least to a certain extent. It is the indominable hero vs the overwhelming odds of the evil corporate/family empire (that has never before tasted defeat) in a battle to the death at the bottom of the world with civilization literally riding on the outcome. And for extras, there is a 9000 year old archeological find which will forever change the way of thinking in the world if it survives. What else could you ask for? If you want reality, watch 60 Minutes."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm giving this 3 stars only because I respect Clive Cussler's other works which I've read and enjoyed more than Atlantis Found. The title and premise are captivating enough, sadly, it did not go further than that. I feel like he didn't quite live up to his potential on this one. I found the characters boring and predictable, the evil genius too stereotypical (and don't even get me started on the women)! I'm also getting tired of having &quot;Clive Cussler&quot; in the storyline. I don't normally part with my books but I don't mind letting this one go. Maybe next time we'll see the Dirk Pitt of old. I really miss him!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Well, not even pretty. It starts off with an interesting angle, but thereafter goes rapidly downhill and the ability to suspend disbelief disappears completely after about the half-way mark. However, I bravely stuck it out to the end, and it just became steadily more ludicrous, the characters more and more cardboard cutouts, the successful adventures against hopeless odds ever more absurd. The paperback cost me SFr10 (about $US6) where it was being sold off presumably in an attempt to move it. I paid too much."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Sure it required a huge amount of suspension of disbelief and there was lots of coincidence and luck, but this book was fun.

THat's the case with Cussler and his &quot;Bond&quot;, Dirk Pitt. They are all there again: Giordino, Sandecker and Loren. But the story ? IT's good enough to read in three days. &Oacute;f course the plot is so grandious.. Fourth Reich Nazid are not exactly new in novels ..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a big fan of Clive Cussler, and have read all his books. I read Atlantis Found and really enjoyed it. Just recently I bought the book on tape (read by Michael Prichard), for my husband to listen to. He is not a fiction reader, but we listened to Harry Potter with our kids and became addicted to listening to the tapes while driving. Well, the narrator of Atlantis Found was just terrible. He read in monotones, and brought little excitement to the story. Each character sounded the same, except the females and he read them sounding really silly! My husband did enjoy the plot, but we will not listen to Michael Prichard reading a Clive Cussler book again. Mr Prichard should take notes from the Harry Potter narrator (Jim Dale), who was outstanding."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am only 13 years old (I started reading Cussler's works when I was 12 )and I am a die-hard fan of Clive Cussler. I am in the process of making a homepage right now about him. I have read Inca Gold, Dragon, and Atlantis Found. I will soon start to read either The Mediterranean Caper, Treasure, Cyclops, or Blue Gold (I dont really know much about the Numa Files series). I think this is by far the best book I have ever read. The technology is fascinating. Once you pick it up you can't put it down. I once read this non-stop for 3 hours on a plane and until we got to our condo. You just always want to read one more chapter. If you are into Cussler this is a must buy!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Since Shock Wave, Adapted for young fans, appeared, I read it out of some interest. After that, I was hooked. I picked Inca Gold, and then this one, Atlantis Found. I had not seen any Cussler books for sometime, and I found this one through a research project on Atlantis. I loved it. Now I know that I read beyond my years. But if you like Harry Potter, but want more action, here's the book for you!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a first timer of his series, and If what i read in this book is present in all of his I look forward to reading more! His startling degree of accuaracy and predicitions of the future and current technology is very much on the spot. He combines the best elements of action and adventure while still making it not seem improbable or impossible. This is one of the best books I have read in a while and finished it quickly. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Many years ago Cussler invented a sea going James Bond named Dirk Pitt who works for a mythical National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA naturally). Pitt has all the sophisticated tests, physical abilities, raw courage and looks and charm, which is required for a heroic figure. What keeps him from becoming a caricature is the fascinating vision of life at sea and the complexities of the ocean gives to any activity.Cussler clearly can spin a good story and in this case he unveils a Nazi project to launch the fourth Reich (It is fascinating that there are far more novels about totally improbable Nazi revenge than there are about tragically real Islamic medieval terrorism and there are far more novels about bad Germans 56 years after the Second World War than there are about all too real current acts of terror against Israel and the West or for that matter the terrorists who seek to destabilize India, the Philippines, Indonesia, etc.).Cussler brings to life the threat to the modern world and in an adventure, which is in many ways closer to science fiction than to traditional adventure fiction. He creates a threat to humans everywhere and a Nazi plan to inundate the world with massive oceanic and climate changes and then provide very large Noah's arks which they will control so they will be the only effective survivors (anyone else who manages to survive they plan to wipe out during the aftermath).While the story is wildly implausible Cussler builds it step by step so that you find yourself both fascinated by how it will turn out and totally rooting for the good guys led by Pitt to win."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I generally enjoy Dirk Pitt. I have read almost all of them, even if I only hazily remember the earlier ones, but never remember being as disappointed as I with this one. First, the good points. It was an incredible concept.... Atlantis has been a favorite (with good reason) for many authors over the years, and the possible explanations and themes they explore are endless. Cussler's interpretation is a bit less exotic than, say, Greg Donegan's, but still viable and has the added benefit of being at least somewhat plausible. The Characters are classic Cussler villians and hero(ine)s, and the action scenes...nice. However there are flaws here as well. The framework of the book didn't seem to hang together well. My primary complaint is that the villians were entirely too stupid. There was absolutely no reason for them to be doing what they were doing when Pitt and company stumbled upon them. Even if the artifacts were discovered, everyone was going to be dead in, what, three weeks anyway, so what would be the big deal? Antarctica is a big place; it would have been unlikely that it would have been revealed. Even if it had been discovered, there was no indication that the bad guys were up to anything especially nefarious - aside from building a complex in a prohibited location, of course. Still, pay a fine and move out, and your ok. Everyone's gonna die in a month, and the court case will take longer than that. Sigh. As a geologist, I find the disaster theory somewhat dubious, but it's been ten years since college and I don't keep up on the breaking developements as much as I might. The concept was floating around back then, but none of my profs gave it much credence, and I haven't heard anything in the public media to convince me otherwise. Once things get moving it's a good read. Cussler's writing style is clear and easy to follow, without any needless ramblings. However, I just felt that the whole scenario was somewhat forced...I couldn't get past the fact that the antagonists should never have been doing what they were doing when they ran into Pitt. Oh well. Maybe the next one will be better. 2 stars from me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I can't believe I keep reading this dribble. The stories are fair, but the characters seem to keep getting more moronic. I can't figure out who is older - the cliches or the characters (who seem to be going through a neverending mid life crisis). This is the last Clive Cussler book I buy. My suggestion is to get this one at the library and spend your money on good books."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis found is superb! So good to see Dirk Pitt back in full form, running all over the world with Al... it seems that in each chapter they somehow escape death and danger. It's all so well presented, so believable and a real adventure-packed page turner. Second to only &quot;Sahara&quot;... this book gets major high marks."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I found this book to be a very entertaining and exciting read as are all the Dirk Pitt books. It is similar to the others in that Dirk once again saves the world, unbeleivable but isn't that why it is called fiction! I am wondering whether Dirk will ever age and is he really going to settle down!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Let's start by saying that the plot and action are top notch Cussler. But...the author seems to have taken it for granted that most readers aren't first time readers to his books. As such he left out considerable character development. All the action in the world gets stale fast if the entire cast of characters are two demensional. By merely providing simple observations into who the characters really are makes all the difference. You see this at the end when the writing becomes much more enjoyable to follow (love involvment, change of relationships, etc.)"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A promising plot becomes mired down by Mr.Cussler's portrayal of Dirk Pitt as the James Bond wannabe. The storyline is well thought out and the twist at the half way point will catch many readers {like myself, for example} off gaurd. The explanation of an Atlantis culture's existence is presented in a plausable manner. The supporting characters are not very well developed and show little depth. The bad guys are transparent with very little to make a reader like or dislike them, they are just single minded. Dirk Pitt's obsession with proving that the old is always better than the new in weapons, cars, and just about anything else is wearing thin. It seems that Mr.Cussler has Dirk suffering more and more injuries in his adventures and this is perhaps to cover up his character flaws to make him seem more human. All in all I enjoyed the book but it is well below the standards of his previous books such as &quot;Raise the Titantic&quot;, &quot;Inca Gold&quot;, and &quot;Sahara&quot; to name a few. I look forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The main question here is are Dirk and All too old to save the world one more time? Does Mr. Cussler need to resurrect the Nazis or could he come up with a more creative enemy threatening world destruction and domination? I was hoping for some bad guys who were really worth hating, you know, a real challenge for our heroes. These neo-Nazis are a little wimpy, created from the seed of Hitler to become tall, blue-eyed blondes. I'm not sure I like the idea that Mr. Cussler believes a superior race could be genetically engineered from Hitler. On the bright side, the author does come up with an interesting plot but the enemy is too easily thwarted and Dirk and Al seem to win more by happenstance and rugged determination than by out-thinking the bad guys. If you're a Cussler fan you won't miss this one but I believe you'll hope the next in this series is a bit better. However, I do wonder if this is a swan song for our heroes? They both comment on feeling their age (Vietnam vets pushing 50), and Al makes an unheard of commitment. Can retirement be far behind?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first time to have read any of Clive Cussler's work. I was skeptical at first but soon found it difficult to put down. I was expecting another Indiana Jones; but it was better!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have my grandson reading all of hios books. It is so much fun reviewing them together. He can go through them much faster than I can."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Boooring! The hero is of course taller, stronger, and smarter than anyone, and all of the women are sexy, sensuous and in love with him at a single look. Moreover, it was a re-hash of the old Nazis-rising-again theme, with a generous dose of German-bashing. Tries for a Crichton archaelogical depth, but never achieves credibility."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I first became a fan of Clive Cussler's novels at twenty years ago when my interest in the Titanic led to my reading his classic &quot;Raise The Titanic&quot;, which was a magnificent novel and led to a fascination with the author's books ever since.However, since Cussler's golden age of Pitt novels, which to me encompasses &quot;Raise The Titanic&quot; through &quot;Cyclops&quot; I really think the novels have lost a bit of their magic since then because ever since &quot;Dragon&quot;, Cussler has fallen into an annoying habit of basically writing the same story with variations on the setting, stakes etc. &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is no exception to this because once again, the villain(s) is some major businessman and his/her family who have been plotting their treachery for so long. Strike one because this is once again very unmemorable for me. Then, strike two in that the opening prologue set-up once again has very little to do with the actual storyline in the final analysis and serves more as window dressing. This is a far cry from &quot;Raise The Titanic&quot;, &quot;Vixen 03&quot; and &quot;Night Probe&quot; when the set-up tied into the story and the payoff in a major way. Instead, the story of the neo-Nazis trying to build their &quot;Fourth Empire&quot; is something served up to us out of the blue, along with a subplot about Nazi &quot;sacred relics&quot; that is given to us by a convenient duex ex machina character (a retired Nazi admiral) who is there to dispense his info and then disappears completely.I also regret to see that Cussler no longer acknowledges his previous Pitt stories in a new novel simply because real history caught up with the events of the Golden Age of Pitt. As late as &quot;Cyclops&quot; it was still not uncommon to see a reference to Pitt having raised the Titanic, or to the aftereffects of the North Atlantic Treaty of &quot;Night Probe.&quot; Today, we're lucky if we see one oblique reference to the last Pitt novel and only when Cussler describes the train in Pitt's collection of cars is there a faint echo of &quot;Night Probe.&quot; (Yet oddly enough Cussler still refers to Pitt and Giordino as having served in Vietnam, yet he doesn't seem to realize that would have to make them in their mid to late 50s at least by this point!) The end result is that Pitt has become much too formulaic for my tastes. The Cussler style of describing interesting locales and making the storyline interesting is still there, but I fear the Golden Age of Pitt has passed us by now (and Clive, will you please stop with those annoying cameos of yours! Enough!)"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was intrigued by this book because of its title, rather than the author. I had never read any of Clive Cussler's books before and found this one to be very intriguing and well written. I read it in one day and enjoyed it. It was a long book but it kept you into it by not being repetitive and boring. I appreciate that even though it was much like James Bond, it did not have sex scenes and trashy language throughout, in fact I don't recall any language or scenes. Well done."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Mr Cussler is starting to believe his own hype and has moved away from fast moving stories into self indulgence with tired and predictable characters.By the end of this, I am afraid I was with the bad guys and was hoping for Pitt's early death.Avoid."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first Cussler novel and although the dialogue was a bit flat and stilted the fast paced action kept me turning the pages. I must admit I am hooked on Dirk Pitt and plan to read his other Bond-like adventures."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I love Cussler's books, and was ecstatic to see an unabridged tape. I have to say, however, that this was the first tape (of dozens) I have listened to where the reader was so awful I could hardly stand to listen. Mr. Cussler, PLEASE find someone else. Listen to how this guy massacred your story. Did you have a computer scan it and sound out the words? It sure sounded like it. I have come to enjoy tapes more than books, but not in this case. BE WARNED, this particular tape is not worth the money. Read the book instead."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler does a masterful job of writing outrageous stories that sound real. I have read nearly all of his Dirk Pitt novels, and I have enjoyed each of them. This one sounded like it might be a stretch (finding Atlantis), but it had a story just as ingenious as many of his other books. Yet again he weaves a story that has just enough in it to render it possible. His only real weakness is for his main character--Dirk Pitt. Those of us who have stuck with the hero through all of his other adventures feel like we know him, but I can't say I've ever heard of someone who can stand up &quot;without moving a muscle.&quot; So our hero is still pretty unbelievably good, but if that's what it takes for an incredible read, I'm game."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm a big fan of Cussler, ever since I picked up one of his early books many years ago. Unfortunately, the last couple of books have ended up with James Bond syndrome: A large group of bloodthirsty sociopaths all working cheerfully together to destroy (the world, a country, whatever).The problem is that this yields very shallow characters, and limits the believability. During one passage which has the heroes riding a train around inside a ship, it takes on a Disney-esque quality - you can almost picture The Goons singing &quot;whistle while you work&quot; as they machinegun Dirk Pitt and his companions.Cussler has a talent for bringing historical events into a very personal perspective - and then tying those elements into a wild story. Hopefully he will pull back from the cookie-cutter mode that he seems to have slipped into."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Any fan of Cussler and his Dirk Pitt Character will once again find themselves caught up in the adventure and intrigue of the characters. You will wonder, again and again, how they will save themselves and their charges; and be amazed at the ingenious efforts. Superman Pitt comes through with flying colors with the help of Rudy, Hiram, Giordino, and Admiral Sandecker not to mention a few other newcomers. The ending will be a BIG surprise! Am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk is back, in his usual indomitable way. Everything that you've come to expect from Cussler is there, in spades. Who else can take such a grandiose plot and make you not only enjoy it, but believe it? As usual the villians are as enjoyable as the good guys, and there's plenty of them. Cussler speeds you along on a non-stop roller coaster ride of excitement and intrigue, culminating in no holds barred battle royale at the finish."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"For those unfamiliar with the DIRK PITT series, yep, this may very will be as corny a novel as you will ever read. However, one cannot escape the fact that Clive can spin a GREAT yarn, interweaving past and present issues/stories, some interesting historical and factual data, and action at a breakneck pace. This novel has more depth and texture that a lot of 'turn the page thrillers' out there today, as Clive does his homework to present us with some neat historical gems to tie a modern-day action thriller (end of the world, of course) with the past (a 'Fourth Reich' bunch of wackos from South America who are from the Nazi bloodline, and are hell-bent on running the world in their way, and will do anything to do it).I have read nearly all of Cussler's novels, and yes, I do expect a certain level of action, unreality, and over-the-top plots - but, heck, that is why I still read the books! This is not literary genius here (it would be like Star Wars getting an Oscar for Best Film!). In a world like the one most of us live in though, one can find a great escape in entering into Dirk's world. For those who dismiss these kind of books, I do feel sorry for - however, all of us need a good romp into adventureland once in awhile with Dirk and Co. - and CC is the man to take us there!!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Why o' why do so-called literary experts take such delight in trashing Clive Cussler and his Dirk Pitt series? For those of us who are devoted fans, we're getting a little tired of all the bashing. Thousands of fans can't be wrong! &quot;Atlantis Found&quot;, while widely panned by the &quot;experts&quot;, will be a great addition to the &quot;Pitt collection&quot; for Cussler fans. Well, let me get off my soapbox long enough to give my impressions of another exciting, escapist trip with Dirk Pitt, Al, Admiral Sandecker and every one of the great characters that we've come to know and love! &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is a throw-back, in a way, to some of Cussler's earlier works. The plot, albeit somewhat ultra-fantastic, is founded enough in factual data to be at least somewhat believable. And, as usual, great action, terrific villians and plenty of gadgets abound. Suspend your world of reality for a few hours and plan on a taking part in a fantastic journey to locations spanning the globe! If you haven't had the opportunity to read one of the novels from the Dirk Pitt series, this is probably a good place to start as any because, as mentioned earlier, almost every major &quot;player&quot; is part of this book. Perhaps not as strong an entry as &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;, &quot;Deep Six&quot;, &quot;Pacific Vortex&quot; and &quot;Treasure&quot;, &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; will not disappoint Cussler fans (Back on my soapbox, let me say...) To Cussler critics everywhere - back off! For true fans of a great series, as long as Clive keeps writing &quot;them&quot; we'll keep buying them!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"what the heck, even if I give it only two stars for poor writing, lame charectors, and contrived situations, it is fun in the same way those old Captain America and Bucky cartoons were.

Loneghrin's Spear (aka the Holy Lance, per Cussler \\"the holiest relic in Christianity!?!)! .... Butwait, there's more! You can have a bundle of fun laughing at Cussler's grasp of science and history. I always thought Star Trek was the low point of pop science, but no longer, Clive has taken the nadir for himself. .... And the history is even sillier. Cussler has a historian say \\"it's a fact that the more advanced a civilization, the less they leave behind them\\". Huh? That makes no sense whatsoever. ...."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Clive Clusser book I've read; I selected it because people told me that anthropologists/archaeologists are main characters and I'm an archaeologist. Oh lord, I got my first huge chuckle from mammoths freezing solid where they stood (in preface or intro) and continued laughing from there. Not sure what is funnier: Atlantians colonized Antartica, the Forth Richt (as in Nazi's were the Third Richt, not sure how to spell 'richt&quot;), the so-called archaeologist acting like a hired killer/adventurer, or the author writing himself into the novel-on Antarctica of all places. Read this book only if you want a good laugh and have much freetime, its long with tiny print."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"My fist time to read C.Cussler, and likely last one; although the story could have been appealing, it lacks scientific accuracy of Michael Crichton, or thrilling military storry telling of Tom Clancy; the all story is set up to make D.Pitt a super hero if not a living legend; that goes too far, too fast, and looks non plausible; at the end of the book, one don't take anymore the story; too bad."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The aim of any fiction writer is to get the reader to suspend belief. My ability to do this was greatly impaired by Cussler's writing. His characters are hardly even one-dimesional, his grammar is no better than a schoolchild, and his dialog is, frankly, dreadful.In the book's favor, the storyline is strong and well thought out. That didn't, however, outweigh the many, many faults."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Let's all admit it -- Cussler does not write great literature, but he sure is a lot of fun. I just so happened to read a (nonfiction) book regarding yet another Atlantis theory at about the same time as I read this book and I was favorably impressed with some of the research he included about crust displacement theory. I was also glad to see Cussler wrote hiimself into the story again -- I had missed &quot;seeing&quot; him in the last couple of novels. And I'm very glad he's gone bakc to writing his novels himself without any poetic help. The thesis of this book, which includes Atlantean mythology combined with genetic engineering, is quite interesting and once again Cussler's imagination brings us to imagine the &quot;what if?&quot; in a story. Of course Dirk and Al survive every trap, setback,injury and diabolical plot and manage to save the day, but one expects no less from them or Cussler. The closing pages of the book disturbed me a bit -- I'd prefer not to see any changes in the Dynamic Duo. All in all a great, fun, &quot;till 2:00 a.m.&quot; read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I agree with the Kirkus Review cited above: a good story, driven by a fascinating hypothesis, crippled by just amazingly bad dialogue. How a writer as adept storytelling as Mr. Cussler obviously is and has been throughout the entire series of Dirk Pitt adventures can continue to be so chronically tone-deaf when it comes to dialogue is one of the great mysteries of popular fiction."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The book might have been alright, but the narrator of the unabridged audio tape left a great deal to be desired. It sounded like he was reading to an audience without a microphone and was trying to be heard by the person sitting in the last row. There was no feeling in his voice. I listen to all of my books by audio tape on my commute. I had to quit listening to this one because it was so awful. A weak story and a very bad narrator. I will make sure that if the narrator Michaiel Prichard I will NOT BUY the audio tape."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read most of Clive Cussler's books and this should be rated among the best. Dirk Pitt and the Numa Agency boys are at their best. The Fourth Reich is one the best villians yet. The action is almost non stop. It was hard to put the book down once I started reading it. If you like fast paced action this book is for you."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is another solid work but Cussler describing the adventures of Pitt and Giordino. In this book, Cussler does a pretty good job of fooling the reader with the grand scheme of the antagonist. The reader is led to believe a comet or asteroid is headed towards earth (like in the movie Armageddon) when in reality it is something different. It kept me wondering how the heroes were going to pull it off until the truth was revealed."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Strange artifacts and writings are found in a cave in Colorado that turn out to have a connection to more artifacts found on an eighteenth century ship trapped in the ice in Antarctica. Everyone who tries to explore these finds is killed or an attempt is made on their life. It all leads back to a German family living in South America who are descendant of the Nazis and have a grand scheme to build the 4th Empire.The pros for Atlantis Found are that it is a fast-paced action adventure that will hold your attention and keep your interest as the plot grows more and more absurd. There are also a lot of interesting historical facts and theories to help propel the story. The cons would be that its too long and sometimes gets bogged down by too much technical data about what kind of plane they are flying or weapon they are using. The biggest drawback is the awful dialogue. Mr. Cussler apparently leads an adventurous life and has a deep imagination for storytelling but he's not a great writer. None of the characters speak the way a normal person does and it just gets worse as the book progresses. Cussler also has a propensity for over-the-top metaphors.I enjoyed the book to a degree and wanted to keep reading to find out the full story, but it was a chore at times because of the poor writing."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found was a greatbook. It was full of twists and turns that keep you reading. In the story some billionaires are trying to continue another third riech! They have a dominant plan to flood the entire world.

The ingredients are formulaic, as with most of the Dirk Pitt novels, but in Atlantis Found the plot is constructed with trademark Cussler flair and punctuated by thrilling Pitt action/adventure.Yes, one could argue that similar plots have been used in his previous books, but Atlantis Found possesses a panache greatly lacking in today's action offerings.A classic Dirk Pitt novel and definitely one of the best."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"then you're just plain crazy...or snobbish? Look, if you're looking for well written deep character driven plots that reveal something about the human condition, you're in the wrong place. But if you're looking for an entertaining, fun, exciting &quot;page turner,&quot; this is your book. Cussler has his faults (I, too, had to physically resist rolling my eyes when he turns out to be the minor character &quot;Dad&quot;), but he's certainly far better than his peers of the same genre like the once decent but now insufferable Tom Clancy, Michael &quot;Master of Banality&quot; Crichton or the absolutely horrid Grisham."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is definatley one of my favorite Dirk Pitt Novels.

The book was good, action-packed."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found written by Clive Cussler is a Dirk Pitt novel. This is the fifteenth in a series of action-adventure books that involve our hero Dirk Pitt against the bad guys.What Cussler does is weave in some truth with his fiction to make the fabric of the novel believable and this is no exception. Engaging from the start, this adventure is dramatic and involves some exotic locations. The concept of this book is that we are to find, or rather Dirk Pitt is to find Atlantis.Cussler follows his adventure formula to a &quot;T&quot; as he starts out in the past with a adventure that lead in to something that Pitt will find later in the book. As the clues and the excitement mount the bad guys try to get rid of Pitt, but Pitt has more bounce than a super ball. Pitt seems to find a way to foil the criminal element and use their weapons against them.Cussler has some intricate plotting and builds the suspense to a fever pitch as Pitt connects the clues and all of the incidences Cussler has put in the way. Of course there has to be some time limit till the whole world reaches Armageddon. And by the narrowist of margins you wonder if our hero can accomplish the task.Of course, Pitt has his best friend Al Giordino and the whole NUMA team for support making the odds more even. This is a very engaging story and will grab you as you are engrossed in the story till the end. The prose moves well as there aren't many dry spots, but the narrative is true Cussler till the end.As Pitt is a more mature in the book, we can feel his limitations in the writing making for a more believable good guy. As Pitt takes on the bad guys, wins the battle, the spoils go to Pitt and so does the girl.You'll find this book has dazziling suspense with an adventure/ mystery quality to it.

In between there is almost always a beutiful but strong and intelligent woman who hangs with the good guy.There is also a fantastic mystery/historical artifact/save the world from a virus/time is running out adventure happening thatonly these guys from NUMA can solve. Dirk Pitt and Giordino, his compardre goes search for an old iron confederate ship in the Sahara, raise the Titanic, search for Inca gold and check out red viruses in these book. Here in the latest, they are demystyfying Atlantis.I am on Blue Gold now, which doesn't have Pitt, but two other good guys--not bad. Oh, it gets fun when an old laid back guy aka the Kid aka Cussler shows up every now and then"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk and Al are back in business dealing with a megalomaniac with homicidal tendencies. The action starts quickly and doesn't let up even though this a very long book. Maybe Mr. Cussler doesn't have the best grammar or literary skills, but he writes some of the best action novels in the business. Are we out to critique his work or escape into a world of action and suspense? I love Cussler books because of the history mixed in with the action. The different story lines are weaved together well and the characters are second to none. There were some surprises at the end of the book and I was glad to see Dirk get knocked off his pedastal just a little bit( you will have to read the book to see what I mean).All in all, this is a good book to get away with for a while."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read every Clive Cussler NUMA, Dirk Pitt book that has come out. The last one, &quot;Inca Gold&quot; was maybe one of the best. When I got my copy of Atlantis Found, which was bought by my daughter, I was in Pitt heaven. It was a signed copy by Clive himself. The first and major problem is that it has become NUMA goes Star Wars. Flying cars???? Whats wrong with the old Dirk? I still love reading about guys from NUMA and I get so involved I forget all about Clive Cussler and just call it the Dirk Pitt author. I haven't finished the book yet and I am enjoying it. Maybe Clive can invent a time machine and Dirk can go back to the 20th century, or how about back to a time like the revolution. Old Dirk is OK with me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It could have been so much better. There are plenty of Antediluvian &quot;resources&quot; available that could have been taken made use of to flesh out more life into the book. The plot is so darn straight forward that nothing surprises the reader anymore. Cussler's world has so many secret organisations that are so high-powered super-financed with links to every government that they cannot be prosecuted (add the baddies from all his earlier novels) that it is a great wonder that they don't run into each other or conflict each other's interests. It seems that only the mainstream government is completely infiltrated. What is so terrible about the Fourth Empire (so unimaginative) is that they are supposed to comprise of so many people (hundreds of thousands) and yet remain undetected even though they have hit teams everywhere in the world. That the Wolf sisters were genetically engineered served absolutely no purpose in the story other than to indicate advances in biotech which the Wolfs couldn't find better use. Neither was the nanotech which if they really had it, could be better used than what they had to achieve their purpose. It's like having an aircraft carrier to fight a war and using it only to fire grapeshot cannons. And how many times must Hitler be revived in novels ? His inclusion again served no purpose at all other than to irritate readers."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler is at it again, with his duo of Pitt and Giordino romping through another save-the-world tale of derring-do. Cussler's stories are so thoroughly researched, that half the time the novels read as though they were fact! I'm sure that in most instances, his novels are indeed factual, with a mysterious quality of fiction woven so tightly around it that one cannot help but accept as 100% truth. It is extremely easy to enter into a state of suspended belief in all of Cussler's books, as his writing stems from his own personal experience and the experiences of those with whom he consults for research.Atlantis Found was an exhilarating ride, from one corner of the globe to the other. I found myself feeling chilled and frozen, along with Pitt and Giordino, as they crossed the Ross Ice Shelf on the Antarctic...and had to step outside into the hot summer sun of Arizona to warm up. Their exploits seem to know no boundaries, as they overcome endless situations that have the odds severely stacked against them. One wonders if these guys (Pitt &amp; Giordino) are human! They have bottomless sources of energy and determination; they always come out on top, regardless of how many opponents they face; they have a knack for always making the right choice when faced with the unknown.I love how Cussler always works himself into his books; this time, he shows up as &quot;Dad Cussler&quot;; Pitt &amp; Giordino, I think, by now should recognize Cussler whenever they meet him. With all their travels and wild adventures - they always seem to run into Cussler. Pitt &amp; Giordino are no slouches when it comes to remembering names &amp; faces - so why then, is it, that they vaguely recognize him, but can't figure out who the heck he is?Petty observations aside, Atlantis Found is a thrilling story, from start to finish. I love the way Cussler begins this novel, with a historical perspective that lays the foundation thread that weaves its way through the fabric of the book. I was fascinated by the idea that a culture like the Amenes might possibly have existed, and the treasures and knowledge that their society could reveal about our world today.I could not put this book down for three days (aside from the usual disturbances of life, that is). Definitely one of Cussler's best works to date!Peace Out."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"At first, I was thinking: &quot;A book about a diver? Yeah right!&quot; But I was wrong. Dead wrong! This is one of the best books I've EVER read! The plot keeps changing, and there is so much suspence! You can't put it down! If your a Cussler fan, you'll love it. And if your not, you'll get right into his books. The main star, Dirk Pitt, is witty and dangerous, but keeps you on the edge of your seat. You need to find &quot;Atlantis Found.&quot; (I know that's pretty lame.)"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler really researched his ideas and then had a lot fun with this novel. I found it very entertaining all the way through. Written with action and implants of nervous humor, the villian and the plot almost seem possible even though it is very James Bondish in a &quot;world domination&quot; theme. The book is very readable, and entertaining. Well planned hero stuff. A very good read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Sure, Atlantis Found is wordy, macho, 8th grade level reading, etc, but hey, it wasn't designed to be a literary masterpiece. All I know is that after a stressful workday nothing beats a tall cold one and a little mindless trip into a Cussler novel, and this one worked for me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Every time I read a Dirk Pitt adventure novel, I wonder to myself, &quot;How in the world is Clive Cussler going to top that in his next book? Read on. ATLANTIS FOUND is one of the best adventure novels I've ever read! Dirk and Al fans will be pleased!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I like all Clive Cussler books but this was one of the better books. It had a great plot and great summary. But, the best part of the book was the end when Giordino gets... I won't tell you. My opinion is Clive is retiring as a solo writer. You should read read it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I became a fan of Clive Cussler and his hero Dirk Pitt after reading Raise the Titanic as a sophomore in high school. Through all the great adventures and near death experiences of the fictional Pitt, I have always had one question when I finished each new novel --- what will he do next. In Atlantis Found, Pitt and company tackle one of the great mysteries --- the lost continent of Atlantis. Along the way, Pitt travels to the Antartic while battling the next generation of Nazis determined to rule the world. As in past novels, Pitt uses his mind, a horde of gadgets and friends in his fight to save humanity. Where Cussler shines here is that he doesn't bring Pitt so close to Death's door that the suspension of disbelieve is shattered. Pitt is not getting old, he's just getting better --- like his collection of antiques."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I believe Dirk and Al could whip James Bond. Nobody tells a more plausible thriller than Cussler and this book is no exception. So well researched it is a pleasure to read. Although Dirk and Al have 99 lives - we revel in their adventures against the evil in the world. Read this book and keep 'em coming."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I believe Dirk and Al could whip James Bond.

Cussler's main character is getting older, like the rest of us, yet Cussler is keeping him fit and still ready to tackle the adventures we've grown to expect. It's another book I hate to put down and can't wait to pick up again. In writing my first book I've come to respect the quality of Cussler's work, the rivitting story line, and the word flow. Way to go, CC!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This latest entry in the Dirk Pitt franchise moves with the breakneck pace Cussler fans have come to know and appreciate. If you like your stories filled with action, battle scenes, gentle history, geography archeological theories, and rife with intrigue, this book is for you (though at times I thought I had strayed into a techie Rogue Warrior novel by mistake).Cussler likes action and keeps the plot simple; it's good versus evil. As in past titles in the series, Dirk again is pitted against a worldwide association of evil with tentacles stretching even into his beloved NUMA. This cartel, however, has roots in old Nazi Germany.The books takes you to many venues, among them a claustrophic cave sequence, a chilling south pole battle and the usual Washington haunts.The only reason I don't give this five stars, however, is the Hitchcockian habit Cussler has of injecting himself in the novel.The question that comes to me now is: What's next? How do you top finding Atlantis?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the best Cussler novel since &quot;Treasure&quot;! Dirk Pitt and the gang are back and clicking! Dirk and Al have their heroics but they don't come off as Supermen as they have in past adventures. My only negative is that Clive is continuing to insert himself in the novel which I have never liked. But I got over it. Clive's ability to connect the present with the past is once again ingenious!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"True, the readers who are used to Crichton's over-the-head scientific &quot;facts&quot;, and Grisham's law babble might find a lot of flaws with Cussler's writing, but for a Dirk Pitt fan, or anyone who has an imagination and wants to just forget his/herself for a while, this book is a lot of fun. If you still have problems with the book, my suggestion is to read a couple of the older ones (Deep Six, Treasure) till you find within yourself a devotion to Dirk Pitt and the crew. Then you might see the light. To Mr. Cussler: Don't let this one set you back! Keep writing them, and I'll keep buying them!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Pure enjoyment, just a fun book to read. Dirk Pitt fans are sure to love it, I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is a great airplane book. Excellent diversion that keeps you hooked. The mental imagery is vivid and exact. Can't wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I never grow weary of Dirk Pitt, or the cameos by Clive. It was my most anticipated Christmas present. Yes, I also caught the one typo (craved) but worse yet was the blatant contridictions on page 55 and 95. Having just become a certified diver this really stood out to me, unless there is something I am not understanding about dive suits. But no matter! Pure escape and entertainment which is why I read. However, I always thought Tom Selleck would have made a perfect Dirk Pitt and too bad none have been made into movies. However, James does corner the market on the silver screen and Clive Cussler would no doubt face considerable criticism trying to put Dirk on the big screen."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It was wonderful watching the plot unfold, everything pieced together perfectly. This was my first Clive Cussler book and it has sure encouraged me to buy another one. Non - stop action combined with classic Hitchcock style writing will leave you hooked to every word."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive, you keep writing them, I will keep buying them. This ones not to shabby, information is too easily obtained and that 'Nano-Technology stuff' is too far advanced for a truly believable plot. Just please don't retire Dirk and Al! I read that Serpent novel and i just kept substituting Dirk and Al's names for those other 2 guys in my mind. I won't do that again though. This one just came out for Christmas and luckily i got it, I had just re-read Cyclops and Treasure (my 2 favorites) thinking that your next book would be too far off since Serpent. This book isn't your best, but it's much better than Shockwave (your absolute WORST!). Keep em coming Clive, Keep em coming.P.S. STOP! writing yourself into these things, I CANNOT stand that! If i wanna read about you I will pick up a copy of the SEA HUNTERS."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I just finished Atlantis Found and thoroughly enjoyed it. At times I found it difficult to get through, only because I wanted to find out what happened! I have read several Clive Cussler books and always enjoy the detail and history written in to the story line-Atlantis Found was no exception. A true candidate for a great movie."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read every CC novel and was excited to see a new one. I read it quickly, though it was long! It was highly suspenseful, well based on scientific fact and probability. It's a thinking person's adventure, full of stops to look on the maps included in the book, comparisions to larger maps to see the area as it really is - and allowing you to feel fully part of the adventure. I wonder if Admiral Byrd's Snow Cat is real? This is a definate high adventure keeper... Very enjoyable to escapism as well as broadening knowledge and a feeling that this could really happen!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I enjoyed this book better than some of the recent Dirk Pitt adventures. This was because I had gotten the impression that Clive Cussler was trying to up the body count and extravagant exploits of Dirk Pitt with each passing novel. In doing so, they were becoming unbelievable even for an action/adventure series. Although I enjoyed Dirk Pitt as a larger-than-life hero, I felt the increasing violence was getting old. However, with Atlantis Found, I felt the story to be more believable and tamer than, say, Sahara. Some felt the dispatch of the Wolf leadership to be too tame, but I felt it to be more like Dirk's old style: no more violence than necessary to protect life and limb, but justice properly served. THAT is what a hero does. As usual, the science involved was within the realm of believablity, and I learned something both historic and scientific I did not know. As a 20+ year Dirk Pitt fan, I felt this to be worthy of the series. I am glad I received this book for Christmas, and look forward to the next."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all of the Clive Cussler novels and unfortunately Atlantis Found brings nothing new to the series. The story starts very well but soon it falls into the well known formula of Dirk and Al beating all odds and most annoyingly, Dirk fighting off the blackness that is closing in on his vision. Still I am found enough of this series to enjoy the read but I wasn't fascinated by it. If you haven't read Cussler, get Raise the Titanic or Sahara before reading this one. Sahara being the best of the series largely because Cussler did not continue the same story line from chapter to chapter. Most chapters ended with a cliff hanger that wasn't answered right away, creating anxious and fast reading. Why Mr. Cussler abandoned this style escapes me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all of Clive Cussler's books. They always get better. I hope that he's not going to retire Dirk and Al since they both were talking about marriage and their age in this book. The book kept my attention all the way. I'm looking forward to the next one. This book was a little harder to follow then some of Clive's earlier ones. However, the plot always keeps my attention. The detail given makes me imagine that I'm right there with them."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk and Al do it again! I've followed every single one of their adventures and am proud to say that they are two marvelously fearless characters who I would follow anywhere.Cussler, while perhaps not sticking to the facts of earth's evolvement, has some grand description that is worth reading and even educational.It never ceases to amaze me how Cussler manages to take an event that happened hundreds, or in this case thousands, of years ago and weave it into a modern tale.This book is a wonderful read. It is exciting and contains the usual Dirk and Al wit. This is a perfect action yarn to read on a cold winter's day by a fire - or even on a sunny beach.Dirk and Al, once again, become embroiled in a conspiracy that might end life as we know it. Once again, Dirk and Al are victorious over evil. To know them is to love them.If you like intrigue, adventure, and an almost blase attitude toward danger - Cussler's Dirk and Al are for you. Read them all and you won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk Pitt, special projects director for the U.S. National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), is a James Bond-type character who is involved in perilous activities on an almost daily basis, but seems to escape relatively unscathed with aplomb and finesse. His best friend and sidekick, Al Giordino, is an equally colorful character.The action begins in the abandoned Paradise Mine in Colorado, where Pitt and Giordino become involved in the dramatic rescue of a scientist after the tunnel collapses and floods when she in brought in to analyze some ancient hieroglyphs in an underground cavern. It soon becomes obvious that the tunnels were sabotaged by some evil murderers who didn't want anyone to know of the existence of the ancient cavern.Pitt and Giordino determine that their pursuers are hired killers employed by the Fourth Empire, which is a militant group involved in advancing Hitler's evil reign of 50 years ago. The plot becomes very complicated, moving from one continent to another. Hugo Wolf and his perfectly cloned family are the designated leaders of the Fourth Empire and are ruthless in their pursuit of world domination. Their vast wealth seems to be a result of the many purloined art treasures stolen by the Nazi's during the war.Pitt uncovers Wolf's plot to cause a cataclysmic worldwide flood that would destroy all civilizations, except for those that have been designated to live on several floating cities designed to withstand the flood and sustain life for many years until the floods recede. Pitt and Giordino make a heroic death-defying attempt to thwart the plans of the evil Fourth Empire.Atlantis Found is filled with complex, high-tech, non-stop action, although at times it veers into fantasy and is too unrealistic to be believable. Pitt's relationship with Loren, his long-term romantic interest, as well as Giordino's blooming romance with the rescued scientist, Pat O'Connell, provide some relief from the frantic, non-stop action."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Like most of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt series, \\"Atlantis Found\\" involves a wildly intricate plot that ties together disasters from the past with imminent catastrophe in the present. In this case, one of the disasters in the past was a comet that struck the Earth about 9000 years ago, causing massive tidal waves and shifting of the continents. Unfortunately for us, the comet had a twin that missed at that time, but that was predicted to come back . . . 9000 years later. Throw in neo-Nazis, nanotechnology, and the remains of an Atlantis-like civilization, and you have the latest Pitt adventure.Prior to \\"Deep Six,\\" Cussler wrote fairly realistic adventure novels -- \\"Raise the Titanic!\\" was as much about the engineering feat of lifting the Titanic from its resting place as it was about an adventure to find an incredibly rare and potent crystal. But starting with \\"Deep Six,\\" Cussler began weaving more and more science fiction/science fantasy into his book: mind control, lunar colonies, artificial intelligence, and so on. \\"Atlantis Found\\" is probably an extreme even for Cussler, and as it turns out the science/fantasy part is the weakest element. To begin with, the comet strike in 7000 BC just is too hard to swallow. Supposedly it wipes out 99 percent of animals and humans through floods and climate changes. But nothing like that remotely happened in real life -- sure, woolly mammoths and sabre-tooth tigers died out, but there's no mass extinction as one would expect.Besides the influx of science fiction, \\"Atlantis Found\\" continues other trends of Cussler's more recent novels: the appearance of numerous recurring characters (Perlmutter, the maritime history expert/gourmand; Congresswoman Smith, Pitt's on-off love interest; more abuse heaped on Rudi Gunn, the second in command of the fictional Nat'l Underwater and Maritime Agency; Yaeger, the computer expert), as well as yet another deus ex machina by the author himself, who has appeared in a number of adventures as an \\"old\\" and \\"grizzled\\" character, sometimes a prospector, sometimes a bartender, etc. It's actually quite bizarre and I'm not sure what to make of it.In the end, this is more of what you can expect from Cussler. I stayed up until 2 in the morning to finish it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler is an amazing writer with an amazing character, but his plots are getting repetitive and his stories are getting old. He deals in adventure and intrigue, and is making his plots more complex with each book. Gone is the good old days of the quick, pulse pounding adventure of his earlier books (Night Probe, Pacific Vortex and The Mediterranean caper). In thier place are cumbersome and exhausting books with more depth than adventure.Don't get me wrong, this book is still a great read, but the same story could be told with a hundred or so fewer pages by removing some of the plot thickeners Cussler is so fond of adding these last few years."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The 15th installment of Dirk Pitt has 'borrowed' the Atlantis underneath the Antartic theory to spectacular effect. Thrown in with several superships, the villains, beautiful women and plenty of undersea escapades with Al Giordino this is a great addition to the series.The best thing about the latest novels is you simply have to read them in one go. Good beach novels, train novels - anywhere you have time to fill from the humdrum of daily life.I eagerly await the next one after Valhalla Rising."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler as always hit's a home run out of the park.Dirk and Giordino again led us on another adventure, but this one has personal twists unknown in the previous books.Dirk &amp; Lauren relationship grows (if that's possible ) and Rudy finds his happiness.With all the pretenders to the Cussler throne out and about, it's ncie to know the master can still produce work that is the benchmark that all others are compared to."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Wow. I read this book a few month's ago and was surprised at how good it actually was. The ones i had read before it were good but not the best boooks i had ever read. Espeacially &quot;raise the titianic&quot; which really made me have to theink about buying the next one. But when i had barely even gotten into the book the adventure started to begin. I thought it was amazing. Three poeple had to be saved from a flooding cave and guess who was able to get there in time to save the day. Well it was pitt. Also in this book i got to see Rudi Gunn actually help out in a fight when he and Al Giorodino were searching an island when Pitt was somwhere on the other end of the world. They did not have much of a way to fight back but Gunn's master plan saved the day. The showdown was amazing and i could hardly put the book down and grumbled every time i had to. Plus there is another appearnce of Cussler. I admit it is very stupid how he has started to show up in every book lately but who cares. I though it was Hilarious in Dragon when pitt raced cussler and ithought it was prett funny that Cussler just happened to be at Antartica at the same time as pitt and that they just happened to come upon each other. Well i really don't care to much for the fine details as long as it could make the slightest bit of sense no matter how bizzare or unlikely it could be. As long as you are not totally hung up on everthing being completly realistic yuo will love this book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The only way I could finish this colossal waste of time was to skim the final 200 pages. It have the worst dialogue I have ever read in print, including stories written by my children. The plot, the hero, and everything about the book are extremely juvenile. Here's my advice if somebody gives you a copy of &quot;Atlantis Found&quot;: throw it back at him."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I must admit to being a bit biased in favor of Dirk Pitt, having read a lot of his more famous adventures. Therefore, there's no way I could think too ill of a new Clive Cussler novel. The Indiana Jones of literature is still up to his usual world-saving heroics, and even happens to be battling Nazis this time.Now, for all those people that criticize Cussler for putting in unrealistic plot elements, please take a look at the spine of one of these books. This is adventure, not science fiction. It doesn't need to have a foundation in proof or theory. Nevertheless, Cussler does an admirable job of making this one a reasonably believable story. In fact, I would say he tried TOO hard to establish a factual foundation, perhaps at the cost of some good old swashbuckling action. Atlantis Found had a lack of the famed 'Dirk Pitt blasts in and rescues hot women' scenario that is oddly prevalent in the most popular Pitt novels. I only counted two such rescues here, where Sahara was essentially full of them. The usual Machiavellian plot was in place, with a pretty sinister set of crooks, but I don't think Karl Wolf measured up to his evil equivalents in the older novels.Aside from the worldwide cataclysm, et. al. perhaps the thing that really surprised me was a hint of a certain romantic arrangement that I won't blow here. Read and find out for yourself, but let's just say that some people (Bond, Jones, you know the type) just can't conceivably end up that way. I think Dirk Pitt definitely falls into the same category."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Hidden chambers with indecipherable inscriptions and exquisite artifacts from a long-lost civilization add wonderful elements of science fiction to this mystery thriller. &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; makes for perfect escapist reading with plenty of action and espionage and charmingly stereotypical heroes and villians."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler has written an interesting addition to the Dirk Pitt saga, but I wish he would stop writting himself into minor roles in the story. The first couple of times, it was interesting, now it seems like an ego issue.Dirk and Al find themselves in another thriller, facing a ruthless family of &quot;Aryan&quot; types who have the blood of Hitler in them. The Wolf family is dangerous and bent upon changing the world to their sense of a &quot;perfect world&quot;. Pitt and friends encounter murderers, plenty of narrow escapes, exotic locations, ancient secrets from a lost race, beautiful women, mercenaires along their path to lost Atlantis. Add in generous portions of shoot outs, German U-boats lurking among the ice flows, gigantic ocean liners, the &quot;Holy Lance&quot; that speared Christ, a huge comet, Hitler's ashes, a mad battle under the Antartic between SEALs, Marines, Delta Force troops and mercenaries and you have the latest Pitt adventure.Good stuff for a long rainy weekend. Has potential for the films Cussler signed up for, if done correctly. Over all a fun read, leave reality after the first page and go for it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'll admit it: Clive Cussler is my favorite guilty pleasure. Dirk Pitt is definately the Bond of the new century: cool, sophisticated but also caring and sensitive. This latest went with me on a skin diving trip and it it did not disappoint: cool breezes, sandy beaches, cold beer and Clive Cussler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Interesting reading. Although I was caught up by the action, what really hooked me was the opening pages describing the comets approach and impact. The rest of the book (99%) was OK. I found the main character/s to be a bit improbable. Dirk's abilities out James Bond to shame."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Another hit for Cussler. And once again our hero, Dirk Pitt, saves the day. But it looks like he may be losing his cohort and life long pal, Al Giordino. Let's hope Clive doesn't keep us waiting too long to find out!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"If you've read Mr. Cussler's previous Dirk Pitt novels this one is very similar, kind of far out and sort of implausible but very entertaining. I've noticed in the last few books Cussler includes himself, sort of, as a character, he does it in this one too. You will also find the heroes getting wounded several times but still managing against all odds to save the day.My only real complaint is that this story seems to ignore the discovery of the Alexandria Library (surely it would've had something about the Amenes)In the end Al tells Dirk they're getting too old for this and need to quit. I think I agree, it is time for retirement."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Clive Cussler book I've read, and looking at the reviews, it seems as though maybe I should give him another chance.I actually liked the plot and ideas behind Atlantis Found, however, I had a hard time getting &quot;lost&quot; in the book, as I love to do, because of the grade school level of writing! Also, I found the Pitt character to be such a cliche of a hero that I was hoping the bad guys would win just so there would be some sort of surprise.Even though I've given it only one star, I would recommend this book in one instance - as an assignment for someone learning English. The plot is interesting enough for an adult, while the English is simple enough for an intermediate learner to follow along. If I was still teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) I would definitely use this book in my class."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Typical story of Dirk and Al's adventures. Always enjoyed his books. Have read every Dirk Pitt tale that has been published. Clive is definitely trying to close the chapter on Dirk and Al. The ending was a surprise to me. Looks like there is room for one more though."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Glad to see that clive Cussler is back on track after the rather mediocre 'Shockwave' and 'Flood Tide'. This book, although undoubtably formulaic (How many times is Dirk Pitt going to career through the streets of Washington? '), is awesome. The relationship between Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino just keeps getting better and better - the one-liners between the pair are easily worth the purchase price. However, a revelation at the end might shock purist fans of Al Giordino, but I don't want to give too much of the plot away...."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have always enjoyed Cussler's Dirk Pitt series. But, Atlantis Found disappointed me. The novel starts off in typical Cussler fashion, with a great premise, good background facts, and typical Dirk Pitt adventure. But, then, the climax and ending trail off, in an incomplete and unresolved manner. For example, Cussler tells us that there is a spy at NUMA (possibly Admiral Sandecker's secretary, Julie Wolff?), but there is no follow-up, and we never find out who it is. The significance of the magnificent obsedian skulls is never explained. The clues regarding the Nazi connection are thrown together in an uncharacteristically sloppy way. I was disappointed because Cussler is capable of better organization. I hope the next one is better (I'm sure it will be)."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was the first Dirk Pitt novel i've read, and I found it to be a great book. It was filled with action and adventure. I seemed to not be able to put this book down until i finished it. My only complaint was that there was too much detail about brands of items in the story, I don't think anyone honestly cares why Dirk chose to use one brand of scuba tank over another. All in all, it was a fantastic story."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is my first C.Cussler book. These stories were once described to me as &quot;The Hardy Boys all grown up.&quot; Perhaps this is true - the story included history, science, adventure, science fiction and all the action you can handle. Fast and fun reading. A great escape from the humdrum. Easy reading-fun and fast."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The 15th book in the Dirk Pitt series by Clive Cussler is an enjoyable, if sometimes annoying read. I'll skip over the plot details as you can read a much better version in the book description.The Dirk Pitt series has always been full of action and suspense with a dash of humor thrown in and this book doesn't dissapoint. Sometimes it's difficult to put the book down because you want to see how things will turn out for our heroes or what will happen next.My only problem with this book, and the entire series, is that the books follow the same formula. Something happens in the past, beautiful woman investigating/connected to it gets in trouble, Dirk Pitt steps in and saves the day, several times. A plot is discovered that could change/destroy the world, Dirk and friends try and stop it. It seems that almost all of the Dirk Pitt books follow this general formula.This is a decent book and a very worthwhile read, but it doesn't really have any real depth to it. A kind of book that is good to read on a plane or while waiting for someone, but one that really doesn't hold up well."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found was a book that I greatly enjoyed reading. It is easy to get caught up in the novel's plot, and the climax was the most captivating of all the books I have read. Some critics complained about the factual info given in Atlantis Found, but some background information has to be given for a reader to sufficiently comprehend this book. Although I would not necessarily say that Atlantis Found is a book for everyone, anyone who enjoys a great action book or movie should consider reading it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Well I ordered this book on a whim....I thought it was really going to be blah. However, as soon as I started reading the book I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN! I was so into the book that I finished it in one night...it was so good..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A room carved into the solid rock of a defunct Colorado gold mine holds the key to the latest catastrophe facing the world. But what do the strange glyphs and even stranger black obsidian skull mean? And who are the assasins who will stop at nothing to eliminate anyone who has seen these strange writings? Once again Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano are thrust into a mystery that could ultimately lead to the end of the earth as we know it.Like all Dirk Pitt novels this is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a fun read as long as you don't delve too deeply into the whys and wherefores of the story. And to me, that's fine. I always feel that Mr. Cussler has a twinkle in his eye when he spins these yarns. His Pitt and Giordano characters have always been larger than life and almost over the top. Another reviewer mentioned that this is Cussler's formula, and I have to agree. So, take it for what it is. A fun read and not earthshaking literature. The writing is not up to the level of a James Lee Burke or Stephen Hunter but it entertains and really, what more can you ask for? I've never really understood why these books haven't been made into movies. It seems to me they have all the requisites for a good movie series just like the James Bond movies. In my mind's eye I've always seen a young James Coburn as Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As a TRUE Cussler fan since the 70's, I have been with Pitt through the good times and the bad, including the better Pitt books, and the, well there is no such thing as a BAD Pitt book, some are just more thrilling than others. 'Atlantis Found' is DEFINITELY one of Cussler's better Pitt books. I have come to almost refer to Dirk as a personal friend. I know him as good as I know my wife (almost...) and his friends are MY friends. Cussler has given me countless hours of satisfaction and entertainment over the years, and the search for the possible origins of the fabled land of Atlantis is right up Dirk's alley. I have to admit the outcome was a bit different than what I expected, but that is all a part of the fun of reading about Dirk's adventures. Let's face it, James bond...? A WIMP. Indiana Jones...? NERD. Arnold Schwarzenegger...? BIG Nerd. Dirk Pitt is the REAL deal. Tough but sophisticated, Dirk knows how to handle himslef, and in the most dire of situations, heSTILL manages to say just what YOU would like to say if YOU were stuck in the seemingly hopeless position he finds himself in on just about every other page. Cussler has once again given us a thrill ride that is every bit as entertaining as any rollercoaster. Clive makes us wonder WHY the bad guys are planning on the end-of-the-world when science says it isn't going to happen...will it or won't it? Read and find out for yourself as Cussler takes you on an adventure that only he couldhave written. After reading Pitt books now for going on 20 years, it's nice to know that seeing a new novel at the bookstore can STILL get my pulse pounding and make me anxious to get it home and crack it open. Very few, and I mean VERY FEW authors have that kind of talent...and Clive Cussler does it best...and 'Atlantis Found' is one of his very best books."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It seems that Cussler has faltered with Atlantis Found and has given a plot that seems to Indiana Jonesish with a new history of the world. Cussler's high points were reached with Cyclops and Inca Gold, but this one seems to drop down. While I did like Flood Tide and others in the series, this one was just like a history lesson and wasn't as good as other books of his I'd read. The beginning seemed like a copy off of Inca Gold, with Dirk Pitt saving scientist's from a temple and later realizes a clue that leads him to the villain."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Unbelievable as the plot is, I find myself entranced, as usual."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The return of Pitt sent my pulse racing and reading the book only hightened the experience. It is in my oppinion his best work since Inca Gold. Nice work Clive, keep em coming!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cusler has done it again. I have read every Clive Cusler book ever released and can tell you that the non-stop action, of his hero Dirk Pitt, is what makes his books so outstanding.With his fast paced narrative and the intricate weaving of several simultenous story plots, he keeps you on the edge of chair, waiting for that unexpected and exciting ending that is true Clive Cusler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Dirk Pitt novel; it will not be my last. I loved it. This was a spellbinding read, well worth the lost sleep. Full of rich personalities and memorable sceens, I can't wait to read more. This is a must for any Jack ryan, James Bond, or Indianna Jones fan. The suspense never stops."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As Cussler is one of my favorite authors, I eagerly awaited the release of his latest Dirk Pitt thriller. I enjoyed being reintroduced to the familiar cast of characters. The plot moved along briskly as usual but there was a noticeable lack of suspense. The conclusion lacked a great deal of excitement and left me with a &quot;is that all there is&quot; feeling. I only hope that Cussler isn't getting bored with characters. I still think Sahara was his best."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Thank goodness Dirk Pit is back, we all missed him. Once again Clive Cussler has woven an almost believable tale with just enough historical supposition to add to the realism, and to keep the reader enthralled. The new Cussler reader should be warned that once you read one of his books, you will soon be looking for all the Dirk Pitt novels. Those of us who love these stories can't wait for the next book in the series to go to press. Mr. Cussler, thanks for a great read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Having read all his books, this one falls a bit short, but is none the less a fun read. If you have the time to get through 540 pages this holiday...it won't be time wasted."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I own every one of Clive Cussler's books. I enjoy reading them again and again. I picked up Atlantis Found on a Friday evening. I could not put it down! I finished it Saturday afternoon. Cussler develops his characters to their fullest. He weaves the storyline so that you never know what will happen next. I did not think that Cussler could get any better--I was wrong. The paths he allows the personal lives of Dirk and Al to take are ones that TRUE Dirk Pitt adventure fans have been waiting for. Cussler's storylines have always been such that the reader wonders &quot;Could this have really happened this way?&quot; With Atlantis Found, Cussler has surpassed his prior books with believability. I am still wondering if what he described is possible. Atlantis Found is truly Clive Cussler at his best. I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm sorry to say but I am disappointed in Atlantis Found. Cussler is known for his brilliant plot twists and his ability to weave unrelated ideas into a suspenseful journey through a modern day treasure hunt. Inca Gold for example is one of Cussler's finest works of literature. He combines the death of two unrelated heroes and the idea that the Earth will be destroyed by a deadly microbe. The final outcome is both suspenseful and energetic. You would expect his strengths to only get stronger, but Cussler seems to have lost some of his creative genius. Atlantis found has virtually no plot twists or in-depth characters. We see none of see none of Pitt's legendary ability to pick up any woman he wants. Each character is only summarily described with no emphasis placed on their strengths or ability's. I recommend you read this book, but a library is a much better place to get it. This is one of the few Cussler books that when you put it down at the end, you may never want to pick up again."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As usual Dirk Pitt and his friends save the country, but it is his adventures that make the story. Dirk Pitt may be bigger than life, however he is the man dreams are made of. Life and messages of other characters are not what to look for in reading unless it is history. Dirk Pitt takes the mind away and along with him on his adventures. The stories are plausable and take a true or unproven source and it becomes reality. Atlantis has always been a mystery and whether it is true or not has never been proved. Dirk's discovery of the lost continent seems almost real. Mr. Cussler's habit of putting himself as a character in the book makes the story more believable. To escape the problems of the world around us I find Dirk is the best person to be with."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This book was a great disappointment. The story line is completely rediculous. I only finished reading it, because I wanted to know if it would get any better, but alas it didn't. I use this book as an example for a bad book, if somebody asks me.plot - I guess Dirk is a superhero, he dodges every attack story line - can it get any more stereotyped?Never Clive for me again."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Honestly, it didn't start out bad, (If you don't mind egotistical, macho, womanizing, alpha-male main characters). That is expected in most of Mr. Cussler's work. However, I lost all interest in the book when my eyes fell upon the words \\"Hitler's sperm\\". I picked up this book because I enjoy adventure books. It's a nice way to escape the dullness of everyday life. A book about \\"discovering Atlantis\\" seemed particularly captivating. We had gotten as far as escaping flooding mineshafts, near death shoot outs, and chases, shooting down choppers, and exploring ancient ships encased in ice (which I enjoyed, actually). I even stuck with the plot when Nazis were introduced into the story. However...in this particular novel, Pitt's enemy is a family of rich, cunning criminals.....who are essentially genetically engineered from Adolf Hitler's sperm that was collected, frozen and transported via U-boat to an ancient Amenes cavern in the middle of Antarctica, before the fall of the Nazi party. Their main goal was to disrupt the Earth's rotation causing massive floods and devastating ecological changes by drilling through, and detaching the Ross Ice Shelf, as to throw off the Earth's sensitive rotation based on the poles. I mean, come on. A super rich, evil powerful family of genetically engineered Hitlers planning to destroy the earth, and survive \\"Noah\\" style by building gargantuan ships that would supposedly survive the cataclysm. By the time it hits you what a sodding piece of crap this book is, you're already more than half way through it, and it's too late. Just too late. I did finish the book. I forced myself to. I cannot stand to not finish a book, once I've read more than 10 chapters. I hoped that something would happen near the ending that would resurrect my faith in Mr. Cussler's writing...however, I was sadly let down.If you want to read this book, I would recommend a library, because if you purchase it...you're going to want a refund."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all his books and this one is just BAD (as in not good). Cussler will waste a whole paragraph on what the characters are eating or what color Pitt's eyes are (for the thousandth time) but he has no problem skipping over whole sections of the PLOT. I was repeatedly asking myself &quot;is Cussler stupid, or what?&quot; This book was SO unrealistic that I was left wondering why."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Fast-paced, mind-teasing, sprawling, historically-related, gadget-filled are adjectives that accurately characterize this action thriller starring James-Bondesque Dirk Pitt. I often couldn't put it down. But sexist, shallow, surface, hastily done, unintellectual, silly are also apt. Cussler writes so poorly that it often made me ache, but I still wanted to see what happened next. I am a buff of historical detective fiction, and Atlantis Found has enough bogus history and archaeology in it to be attractive. A fascinatingly competent, apparently non-sexist bronze age culture disappeared... But Cussler writes too hastily, too thinly to sustain the hunger. His characters are emotionless zombies, his fundamental attitudes simple, male and conventional, his research lazily sophomoric, his ability intelligently to complicate his bright flashes of historical imagination nonexistent...Cussler seems to confuse the massing of pseudoprecise details--the brand names of high-tech equipment, for example, or impossibly exact distances and dimensions--with actually working at his research or writing. This book could have been written by a gang of bright seventh graders."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Who is this guy's editor? I'd like to have a talk with him. Atlantis Found would be a great book, if only someone else had written it. Or if someone had, you know, proofread. I have to give Cussler credit for having good intentions and ideas, but his characters are more like caricatures (when they're given any sort of distinction at all), the dialogue is horrendous, and his tendency to write himself into the plot is a bit tacky. I also found it a bit disconcerting to find every boat, plane, cycle and piece of gear Pitt was toting described by brand and model...is Cussler picking up endorsement money somewhere? In spite of what most of the fan reviews are saying, Dirk Pitt has none of Bond's panache, and I can't understand comparing the two.Good science fiction makes the impossible believable. Atlantis Found even makes what little hard science it contains hard to swallow."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have seen Clive's books in the bookstore. Finally a friend passed one on to me when we got on the subject of previous civilizations that might have been the root of the Atlantis myth. I should have known when he qualified the book by saying it was kind of simplistic - even compared to Clancy and the like. But I adjusted my expectations downward and gave it a real chance.It takes a real stinker of a book to get me to stop reading it after getting through 3/5ths of a book, but it has achieved that distinction.I started off strong, too. The set up of the story with secret tombs, civilizations etc... was great! (and for that I give it 2 stars rather than one) But the action story with the corny characters just wasn't for me. I find myself rooting for the Nazis to win. I guess I will start writing myself - obviously the bar is pretty low if works like this can make an author rich. I guess I respect Cussler and the fact he does things in real life like NUMA, but if this is representative of his writing he should stick to diving."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I had never read any of Clive Cussler's books before this one, and now I will be sure it is the last. It is appalling to me that such a poor writer can make an apparently good living turning out such asinine, amateur garbage. I will brush aside the completely ridiculous plot points, since they are actually the least of Clive's problems. I wonder if the man even goes back and rereads what he has just written at all, since he contradicts himself in the most careless, I-don't-give-a-crap manner I have yet seen from an author, apparently forgetting what he himself has just written! Example: Dirk Pitt is cut by shards of glass and shrapnel on the face, which Cussler makes clear &quot;would not require stitches&quot;. Only pages after this, Pitt's wounds are addressed again, but this time Cussler tells us that the gashes &quot;would require stitches&quot;. I am not kidding. Is this lazy writing at its worst, or has Cussler some sort of short-term memory problem? He certainly does not respect his reader.Dirk Pitt himself is annoying- a cartoonish, corny, testosterone-laden character that is impossible for anyone on this earth to identify with, since he is in all respects, perfect. He is stubborn, snobbish, and of course never makes a mistake or shows an emotion.The metaphors in this book are particularly ghastly- &quot;trapped like ducks in a closet.&quot; Huh? Once again, I imagine Cussler hunched over his keyboard, typing furiously, not pausing to think of a metaphor that actually makes SENSE, because he is in such a hurry to move on the the next explosion scene. I have a feeling Cussler desperately wants for his books to become action movies, since every time things get dull (frequently), something just blows up.Bad dialogue is another trademark of Cussler's, especially dialogue that sounds like it came from either Scooby Doo or Dr. Evil, such as the time worn- &quot;This goes far deeper than any of us imagined...&quot; Yawn.Putting himself as a character in this mess of a story was the topper for me. I can't recall any other time in my life that I physically rolled my eyes as I read a book, but I did at that moment. I cannot imagine ever reading anything by Clive Cussler again...just the name Dirk Pitt gives me hives."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Maybe I just dont get it - this is the first Dirk Pitt novel I read and I found it predictable, dull, poorly written... and just plain bad. Lame dialogue... ugh the list goes on and on!I am all for James Bond type thrillers but this is just NOT it. I will never read another novel by this author as I just found this thing a complete waste of my time."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was amazed to read of the educational institute of one of the characters to be Saint Andrews College, Scotland. As a graduate of St. Andrews University (note St. NOT Saint) I can assure Mr. Cussler that The University consists of several colleges ( St. Marys and St. Salvators, to mention two). This is a distraction in the usually accurate writing and research of this accomplished author. Do your homework a little better next time!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Please note: This review contains some major spoilers.Although Cussler is a fairly distinguished adventure writer, and given this was the first Cussler novel I read, his novel was quite disappointing. It wasn't so much the story, which whilst stretched credibility very far, it paled in comparison to the glaring errors in the parts that dealt with Astronomy and Geology. The basic premise of the novel is that a giant, 10km wide comet crashes into Hudson Bay, Canada 10,000 years ago and destroys an ancient civilization in the process. Whilst the comet impact is not implausible, there are a number of major flaws.1) In the novel, the impactor was described as being worse than the 'Dinosaur Killer' asteroid that hit Earth 65 million years ago. If something of this magnitude had hit Earth it is certain that most mammal life would have gone extinct, including humanity, which at that time only just begun to develop the basics of civilization and agriculture. The restoration of ecosystms and animal life would take many thousands, if not millions of years to recover from such a disaster. It seems ludicrous humankind (as well of the rest of the planet) could have recovered so soon after the impact of a 10km wide comet.2) The geological events Cussler describes are wrong. If such massive disruptions had taken place, there would be geological or fossil evidence left behind, especially as the event had occured so recently in geological time (less than 50,000 years). Secondly, whilst the part about the post-impact earthquakes is correct, the wild reshuffling of the continents isn't. To speed up plate tectonics would require widespread heating within the core and mantle, or mantle plumes of massive proportions, processes that would take time and a huge amount of energy, more than the impactor could provide. (Note: An impactor may help to trigger volcanism, earthquakes and other geological upheavals, but it would not cause changes on the scales described by Cussler directly.) An impactor releases most of its energy locally, vaporising itself and excavating a crater much larger than the impactor in the process. Unless the impactor is very large (i.e. &gt;100 km) it would not cause widespread heating of the mantle or core. A very large impactor, such as the type that hit Earth during its early accretion phases, would cause extensive melting of the crust and annihalate any existing landforms. It would also boil the oceans and probably also create a hellish atmosphere made of rock vapor.Cussler claims that the Amenes (the advanced seafaring civilisation) knew about the orbit of pluto without telescopes. Pluto, due to its extreme distance from the sun, is incredibly faint. It shines at about magnitude 13. To put that in perspective, the faintest object visible is about magnitude 6 (the lower the magnitude, the brighter the object). It is simply not possible, without the aid of a powerful telescope to know about the existence of an object such as Pluto, let alone determine its orbit.I suppose all this sounds very nitpicky, but as Cussler incorporates so much science in this book, he should try to get it right.-Greg"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"My interest in this book stemmed from my seeing a piece on Discovery (or was it The Learning Channel) a few years ago about \\"the orange peel theory,\\" which hypothesizes that some natural cataclysm caused the Earth's crust to slip at the molten mantle and shift about 2000 miles on the core some 10,000-odd years ago, causing at once the quick-freezing of the Asian Mammoths, the end of the last Ice Age in North America, and the disappearance of Atlantis, the latter beneath Antarctic ice. Maybe Cussler saw the same piece and decided to base a novel on it. The orange peel theory could have made a good premise for a novel, but \\"Atlantis Found\\" doesn't come close to fulfilling that potential.I, too, am unable to finish the book. The California reader's take on the book is correct (see \\"Improbable...,\\" below).For a fan of Clancy's technodramas, and earlier of Fleming's, this book is a nightmare of bad research and technological inconsistencies. For example, on p. 53, shortly after making his first appearance, super-hero Dirk Pitt, swimming through the \\"icy cold water\\" of the mine, \\"stayed warm inside his DUI Norseman dry suit.\\" [What is this, a commercial?] Then, on p. 78, safely out of the mine, he is described as \\"the bruised and fatigued man in the torn diver's wet suit.\\" Which was it, Cussler? A wet suit or a dry suit? They are technically different. Then, a bit later, Pitt dons yet another dry suit, explaining why he prefers it to the wet suit. Rule No. 1 of technodrama: Get the technology right!And why is the water so cold? According to earlier text, the temperature in the mine increases the deeper one goes, and the water level decades ago reached just a few feet below the 1200' level where another character was working. If the air and rock are warm, that cold water needs explaining.Finally, as a lover of the logic of English I am offended to read a sentence such as: \\"They [the ancients] discovered that the stars Betelguese, Sirius, and Procyon remain in permanent positions, while other constellations move imperceptibly over thousands of years.\\" If they discovered that stellar motion, they perceived it. How can it then be imperceptible? Still more annoying is that Cussler put that sentence in the voice of a computer named Max. No self-respecting talking computer would be so illogical.This book seeks to target us Tom Clancy fans, and it will bomb with us. Heck, we even get upset when Clancy refers to a WWII Japanese flying boat as a \\"Kawasaki H8K,\\" since the H8K \\"Emily\\" was a Kawanishi aircraft (some say the best 4-engine flying boat in the war), not a Kawasaki. For us, Atlantis Found is a nightmare.But Atlantis Found is crazy enough, and has enough far-flung exotic settings, that I expect Hollywood to make it into a huge action film. I suspect that movie potential to be the reason the book was written. Sure hope the film turns out better than the book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Honestly, it didn't start out bad, (If you don't mind egotistical, macho, womanizing, alpha-male main characters).

But.........I could not get into Dirk Pitt. He is always at the right place at the right time, I became very annoyed with his one-liners. What started out as what looked like a very good story turned into a very unbelievable tale of idiocy. The ending reminded me of an old A-Team episode where everyone turns to Hannibal with a suprised look, he leans back in his chair with cigar crooked in his mouth and grins. Everyone begins to laugh, the screen freezes and the credits role.Sorry, this will be my first and last Clive Cussler book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Clive Cussler book, and it will also be my last...How can anyone get away with publishing a book so appallingly written? To describe the characters as two dimensional would be crediting them with one too many dimensions. While the plot may be derivative, it does I suppose, entertain and would probably make a better 'exploding helicopter' movie than it does a book.By far the worst aspect of this book though is the quality of the writing: it is so bad it would make even the clumsiest amateur blush with shame. Cussler hasn't the faintest clue when it comes to believable dialogue, his handling of exposition is atrocious (people spout what seems like whole sections of text books at each other throughout the book), there are also entire paragraphs of unnecessary detail because he just *has* to make use of his research materials...The editor of this book should have sent it back with a note saying &quot;Rejected: re-write completely&quot;. Or was there even an editor? I see little evidence to suggest that even the laziest critical eye was passed over this book before it went to print.I'd have given it no stars, but unfortunately that wasn't an option."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a big Tom Clancy fan and this was my first Clive Cussler. Clancy's stories are excellent, but they get me lost as well. Clive Cussler stuck to the point and didn't go off and use unfamiliar terms. The reading was very fluid and relaxing. The only thing that I felt was wrong with it was that I felt as if I were watching a movie. I never really got to know the characters. After I was finished, I left before the credits were done. I also found myself not believing how Pitt got out of some of the situations that he was in. I thought it was a good touch to include himself in the novell (Cussler). Another weekness I found is how did all the archeology and the comet relate, when at the end, the plot was totally different. It seemed to me that to throw Pitt off and searching for these artifacts, was a waste of a couple of hundred of pages."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler's latest Dirk Pitt novel, Atlantis Found, is as exciting as its predecessors. As usual, Cussler pits Pitt against an organized crime group. This time, that group is headed by the Wolf family, decendents of Hitler. They are trying to take over the world and the heroic Dirk Pitt must save the day.Cussler begins with a plausible theory that could have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and buried Atlantis. Discoveries in a cave bring a beautiful female into the story. Cussler uses his descriptive talents to make you feel like you are really experiencing the action packed events. He uses his extensive knowledge to create believable situations and creative solutions. I always enjoy the relationships of the unique individuals on the N.U.M.A. team. In this book, Dirk and Al begin to feel their age. I hope they have a few more good adventures before they throw in the towel.I gave this book a four star rating because Cussler always write a good, suspenseful novel. It is fun to read and hard to put down. I enjoy the incorporation of classic cars, weapons, technology, and good old fashion romance. I really liked this book. (I usually save my five star ratings for Robert Jordan.) I believe you will enjoy this book even if you are not familiar with the Dirk Pitt series."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is a pretty good adventure tale. The story is compelling and the action rarely stops. There is very little &quot;filler&quot; and it's an absorbing novel, difficult to put down. My only criticism is that the Wolf family is no where near some of Cussler's other villians in real hands-on-rotten-ness. General Kazim from &quot; Sahara&quot; and the evil sister/brother from the diamond empire in &quot;Shock Wave&quot; are still my favorites. It was a little surprising to find Dirk and especially Al settling down at the end. Bravo, and keep up the good writing, Mr. Cussler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler consistently writes wildly entertaining books. Atlantis Found is one of his best. Like an Indiana Jones movie, you overlook inplausibilities in the story simply because you are having too much fun."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Any Pitt fans, this is a must-read, if not just the final chapter. Dirk's character mellows a bit in this novel, doesn't have his usual &quot;edge&quot;. Great family reading, I don't mind passing these on to my 60 y.o. Dad and 25 y.o. little brother!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I admit it. I enjoy reading Clive Cussler novels even though Clive really believes that he is Dirk Pitt (scarey!). The plot is the same, the characters are the same (whatever happened to those other guys from the previous book?) and I still enjoy the stories the same. But, it seems as if Mr. Cussler did it again. In his attempt to complicate the story, he forgot to tie up an important loose end. Who in NUMA leaked the information to the Bad guys? Someone please tell me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Nine thousand years ago, two giant meteors hurtled toward the earth. One of these meteors barely missed, skating past into outer space. The other meteor plunged towards the earth at upwards of 130,000 miles an hour. Upon impact, the meteor dug a hole in the planet the size of the entire island of Hawaii, setting of a chain of cataclysmic events that would change the face of the entire planet. Seas boiled to become deserts, giant tidal waves caused entire continents to be drowned under layers of ocean, volcanoes erupted, spreading hot ash into the air, making it noxious to breath, and the polar ice caps shifted greatly, causing the earth's magnetic poles to shift. Instantly the population of the earth was wiped out near its entirety. Only those who remained on high ground survived.Centuries later, a whaling team finds an antique shipwreck, its crew frozen solid, a strange batch of antiquities, and a perfectly crafted, black obsidian skull. A decade later, as anthropologists find and study these relics, a secret underground group will kill to keep them from finding out the truth, that these artifacts from the lost city of Atlantis tell of the comet's return to finish what it missed doing nine thousand years ago.Clive Cussler will never win a Pulitzer prize. It's a shame too; his novels are extremely entertaining action packed, page-turners. In Atlantis Found from Putnam books, we have all the classic elements of Clive Cussler, ancient cataclysm involving some sort of artifact or relic, years later, someone finds out about relic and are killed, present-day archaeologists find artifact and someone attempts to murder them. Miraculously out of nowhere comes Cussler's main character, Dirk Pitt to save the day, and foil the evil syndicate's plans. After 14 novels, you would think that Cussler would tire of his formulas, but all the favorite characters return to save the world once again from the clutches of a maniacal world conglomerate, intent on taking over the world.Cussler's Dirk Pitt is an amazingly fleshed out character. His adventures of the years have had him doing everything from raising the Titanic, to crossing the desert in Amelia Earharts lost plane. Each adventure has him cheating death, finding a piece of history, unraveling secret plans for mass destruction, and still getting the girl. Pitt is a James Bond, without a decent movie to popularize him. His time will come though.In Atlantis Found, the stakes are a little bit higher, but the book's attention to detail is definitely lacking this time around. The &quot;bad guys&quot; are a weakly formed group called the Fourth Empire, descendents of Nazis who absconded from the war with all of the Nazi war chest and stolen artistic treasures. The Fourth Empire, using their vast resources, has become a corporate company of great size that uses its wealth to build four gigantic ships that will ride out the coming cataclysm, and allow them to be the rulers of the new world. The plot is ingeniously simple, yet Cussler still manages to take the reader on a ride that makes for page after excitement.Does the world really need another 523 pages of a mindless, action-spy-thriller to read on the train while they commute to work each day? Should you really spend $26.95 for the hardcover edition of Atlantis Found, when you can pick up a paperback version of any of Cussler's other books, and be assured of the exact same experience? Then again, does the world really need another romance novel with Fabio on the cover? Probably not, but we all need our secret guilty pleasures. Atlantis Found is a nice addition to round out Cussler's series of Dirk Pitt novels. At some point his character is going to be bit too old to continue to save the world, but if Cussler is anything like Dirk Pitt, it won't be that easy to get rid of him."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was one of the better novels I have read. The plot is nicely tied together and was very engrosing. I normally hate this type of book but I just could not put it down. This was a great buy, if you like a little romp with Dirk Pitt. The man makes Bond look like a girl."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"For lovers of Cussler, this is a classic. Exciting adventures, improbable rescues, and a great ending.Pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am not a great fan of fiction novels. My new husband (3 months) goaded me into reading this novel and told me it would be fun and a great escape. Well, he was 100% correct. This is a terrific book, riveting and a wonderful way to relax. Thank you Clive Cussler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is a book that is true to the author's genre - oceanography/aviation and science. It is rivetting and I could not put it down until I had read the last page! I don't need to &#34;invite&#34; readers, as they will know who they are - Fans of Clive Cussler/the Dirk Pitt series!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"In general I like Cussler's books. They're exciting, entertaining, and easy to read. However, this one didn't impress me much. About half way through I found myself rolling my eyes a lot and getting annoyed with the character and narration. I'm not a huge fan of Cussler's writing style in general but the plots of his books usually keep me going. Atlantis Found just got confusing, over involved and over detailed in addition to the typical unrealistic nature of the Dirk Pitt novels. If you want to read Cussler's books I would go with Sahara, Raise the Titanic, or Trojan Odyssey which I consider to be much better."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Great read! A real page turner. I liked the idea of Atlantis being found and what would be a plausible story of the people who lived so long ago. Cussler has a way with words to grip your imagination and drag you into the story as you read it.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in naval vessels and Atlantis."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"One of his earlier books with a great archeological story, and top shelve villans, although, I would like a date with the woman villan... she was pretty interesting."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Unlike many of the assumptions here, I am a female, age 58. I never felt these were 'guy books'.This one was just ok. There were many tedious descriptions that were truly unnecessary - they didn't contribute to the plot or the story or were commonly known already. When it would have benefitted the story for MORE descriptions, there were none (i.e. better descriptions of the mummy's they found). It felt to me that Mr. Cussler had to produce x number of pages and was just filling space.I plowed away to the end of the book. I gave it three stars only because I like the characters. The read was not an easy one as most Pitt novels were."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It was a good novel , but it did not have the suspense grip that one expects in Clive Cussler,s novels."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Fast paced and enjoyable read. Cussler as usual. Not read one of his books that was below a 4 star"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The dirk pitt adventures, always an involving story line. Cussler can always make hours go by quickly when reading his books."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is one of the most intriguing novels of Cusslers.It keeps the reader interested and although the heros always seem to have the upper hand this amazing adventure screams along its treacherous path to a predictable but exciting conclusion."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I hadn't read a Dirk Pitt novel in several years, and this one picks up where the others left off. A stretch of imagination mixed with some science fiction, or at lease, we hope it is. The pieces tie together pretty neatly, although the ending is very tame compared to some other parts of the book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler has done very well again. Atlantis Found is a great novel planned out perfectly by Clive Cussler. It is one of those books that once you start reading you can not stop until it is done. It is very well written. The book does not bore you with facts; it is all an adventure. It may be a long book but before you know it you are way into the book and almost done. It is a very fast moving book. One second a character is in a lot of trouble and the next second he or she finds a way out or gets in more trouble. The book never stops for a second. It all starts when Mr. Marquez, a miner in Telluride, Colorado stumbles across a chamber which is built in a perfect cube. The chamber has inscriptions not known to the current world. What do the inscriptions mean? As soon as Mr. Marquez stumbles across the chamber he is wanted dead. But who wants him dead? And why? A skull is found in the chamber; one that is identical to the one found in an extremely old ship with a crew of dead people. What is the connection? This book should be read by anybody who is able to read. A wonderfully planned book written by Clive Cussler. No one should miss it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"...but who cares. This book is 544 of solid rocking fun. The action does not let up for a page, Dirk is always Dirk and Al is in rare form. It's all there, fun, action, larger than life heroism, an evil madman out to literally destroy the world. What more can you ask for in a holiday read? I loved it. I have read every Pitt novel, this may not be my favorite, but I loved the ancient Amenes, Pat, Loren, Sandecker, even the Wolfs, you just want to jump into the pages and kill them yourself.This book will never be required in LIT/341, future generations will not study it for inner meanings and deep philosophical messages. So what? Enjoy yourself, get lost in adventure, quit being so damn stuffy, have a great time, have a fantasy or two, and read Dirk Pitt again and again. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler delivers again. Dirk Pitt involved with the lost city of Atlantis is a natural undersea adventure, and I'm glad Cussler is utilizing this bit of history. It's a real page-turner, the best thriller since Craig Furnas' THE SHAPE. Incidentally, I saw Clive Cussler himself just last night at a book signing, and the line for him was very long. Cussler looked great, all dressed in black."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk and the boys and girls are back again. No matter what anyone says Clive puts together a great read. I feel like Dirk, Al and everyone at NUMA is part of the family and with any family they have flaws, but we love them all the same. Clive Cussler is one of the few authors my wife and I both enjoy. Atlantis Found will make a long plane ride short."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Why did I finish this book? It took sheer willpower and a niggling hope that a great plot twist would make it all worthwhile. Tedious and unnecessary descriptions were thrown into the mix. For example, Dirk would be scrambling over a mountainside with vast hordes in pursuit and Cussler would pause to describe, in excruciating detail, the shirt and pants being worn by our hero. Well, it wasn't as strange as all that, but it seemed that many paragraphs were throwaways and did little to move the story along. What was the deal with the gourmet meal of rabbit and sweetbreads situated in the midst of all the mayhem? It sure brought everything to a screaching halt. I think &quot;Dad&quot; should learn to write more better."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dear Teacher, A while ago I read Atlantis Found, by Clive Cussler. I started reading it because I thought it would be about the lost contenent Atlantis, but after a few chapters I realized it was mostly a murder mystery, with Atlantis tied in. I really enjoyed the book. The author gives you some hints as to whose fault it is, but you can never be quite sure. I liked the way Cussler wrote Atlantis. There were many adventures, and just when you think somethings over, something else comes up. That way, it keeps your attention. Books that you can't out down are the best kind of books. One interesting thing I noticed was how Clive Cussler put himself into the book. He is always a subtle character, like a bartenter. This book kept my attention until the very end, never letting on how it's going to end. It was exciting and full of suspence. I could read it over and over again and get something new out of it every time."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read every Clive Cussler book published and think this is one of his best. I enjoy how he brings background information into his story and shares this with the reader.The theory of Atlantis is fascinating and I'm glad he finally chose to write about it.As always, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano are great partners! It seems a little twist is added as Al is finally getting married...could Dirk be next?All in all, I couldn't put it down until the last page was read. Can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I bought this book the day it was released. What a guilty pleasure, these techo/adventure/thrillers that Cussler puts out. Before opening the book I know what will happen and have a pretty good idea how, but I still cannot resist. For those of you who have read Cussler in the past, 'Atlantis Found' gives you a lot of what you expect. Thankfully, Cussler has made the plot a bit more plausible than what has been found in his recent efforts, but it remains a fantastic story nonetheless. It's a classic Dirk Pitt novel: he and his friends thwart the best laid plains of previously unstoppable villianry. A bit of a twist at the end was a (pleasant) surprise for me, but for the most part the action was gloriously predictable, as is wont to happen if you've read all of Cussler's work. For those who haven't read Cussler before, this is a first-rate adventure novel, just like 'Raise the Titanic' and the rest of the Dirk Pitt adventures. The technological details make the stories more believable, while Cussler's knowledge of seafaring yore and appreciation for fine autos makes the reading that much more enjoyable. The action moves at a break-neck pace, and it was with great reluctance that I sat the book down for matters such as sleep and work. A couple inconsistencies in the storytelling and some surprisingly elementary grammatical errors took away some of the pleasure of the book, but for the most part it was as good as anything I've read in the past year. Classic Cussler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is typical Dirk Pitt. For complete Cussler readers like myself, is was too long a wait. My ONLY complaint has to do with a few editing issues, but they did not detract at all from the pure enjoyment of a typical Dirk Pitt adventure. The reviews here reflect the fact that true fans of Cussler actually like the same formula over and over, as I do. It's something you just count on. Dirk and Al are like no others I read. Yes, you have to stretch you imagination to buy into some of the plot lines, but if you couldn't do that, you wouldn't have read all of the other adventures, either.If you have never read a Dirk Pitt novel, this is as good as any to start with. After reading this book, however, you may find yourself back to order the whole set.For long-time fans, if you want another thoroughly enjoyable adventure with an old friend, read Atlantis Found. It did not let me down, and after 15 books (true Dirk Pitt novels), Clive still has what it takes to keep me wanting more. It's the kind of book you hate to finish because you know it will be two more years before you get another."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm not a picky reader, nor do I routinely bash far-fetched pulp fiction. However, it seems that after 20 years of Dirk Pitt, Clive Cussler wrote this book solely for money. The characters are cliched card-board cutouts with ZERO character development. And it seemed that nearly every character had cold blue eyes with bodies that Mr. and Ms. Universe would envy.But the biggest complaint I have, is the book read like the author was just punching out the words as fast as he could, and then running off to play golf. I like to read through books in one session, but this took me five or six.On the posotive side, the ending action sequence was neat. Lets just hope he ends the series mercifully, and not have it end up like the comic series Penuts..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"When you pick up a Clive Cussler novel, you already know pretty much how it's going to end. It's almost a foregone conclusion. I went into this book with a small amount of trepidation. I didn't really care for Flood Tide because I felt it went on too long. When I saw the page count on Atlantis Found, I was afraid yet again. But, happily, I was wrong. It turned out to be a very enjoyable book. I finished it after only a few days.The trick to Cussler novels isn't the fact that the heroes save the world at the end. Or that the villains are dastardly. It's the way Cussler takes a small piece from history (or a myth) and weaves it into a credible tale that makes you want to read. I have always read and enjoyed Cussler's work and will continue to do so."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler has once again written a novel based on his successful formula that has worked again and again. With the starting grand entrance of Pitt to the predictable ending of Pitt saving the human race. (Yes, Again.)What makes this book highly interesting is Cussler's theory on the people of 'Atlantis', what happened to them, and the legacy that was left behind. Cussler was able to tie in the crash of a comet, the disappearance of Atlantis, a vehicle built by Adm. Byrd, and the rise of the Fourth Empire (Reich).The ending by Cussler leaves the book open for sequels, with the start of a new NUMA book, (serpent) and the hints given in the book, one wonders if this might be the last of the Pitt novels. Overall, the book is predictable as a James Bond movie. The bad dudes gets what they deserves, hero gets a few scraps and bruises, but saves the world and gets the girl. But the theories and knowledge of the ocean and historical tie-ins are worth the time invested in this book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Cussler book. It was recommended by a friend. From what I've read, I have to conclude that Cussler heard a great story and then turned it into a miserable book.1. Dialogue - horrible. Unreadible. Its stiff, it tries to be funny, and it tries to be James Bond type wit. It fails in the worst way.2. Characters - Dirk Pitt, say it aloud: Dirk Pitt. Bad name. It doesnt't work. Also, let's review the character: an ex-marine, works as a diver for a government agency called NUMA, collects classic cars, and dates a beautiful congresswomen who adores him. That can only be a string of Cussler's fantasies fused into one person. Doesn't happen.3. Humour - whoever told Cussler he was funny should be shot.If you read this Cussler I'm sorry I don't think you're a good author. Take heart - you're obviously good at something, because the book seems to be selling well."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"OK let's face it -- no one reads a Cussler book for the highbrow prose. He has GREAT plots. And this one is original for the way it combines two old plotlines (Atlantis and the Nazis) into an original story. It's well-researched, I might add. And personally I'm THRILLED that he ditched the co-author from the last book and wrote this one himself. Something about Cussler's writing grabs you from the first minute -- who wants poetic writing in an action adventure for Pete's sake? From the discovery of the skull in Colorado to the ultimate discovery in Antartica, this book is a thrill a minute. Who cares that Dirk and Al have been blown up more times than any of us can count? We all secretly want to be Dirk Pitt (and I'm a woman saying this!) surviving with aplomb and humor and worst anyone can hurl at us. Well worth your reading time."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As all my previous Cussler reviews have said, I read this series in order and they just seem to get better as I go through them.This series is simply the most fun you'll have taking a little trip through your imagination with Dirk and Al.It's over the top, full of more than a few cliches, and often has bad dialogue. (Most from the vile bad guys)It's also daring, action packed, and even a little informative at times.Everyone picks on Cussler for his dialogue but, they seem to forget these books are just for fun and take place in a pseudo-fantasy world.If you want \\"real\\" people living a \\"real\\" life, read Jane Austen or something.Enjoy Atlantis Found for what it is then read Valhalla Rising."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler has done his research. After reading and thoroughly enjoying the further adventures of Dirk Pitt in Atlantis Found, I discovered that the Holy Lance is a real object and that the Nazis had indeed surveyed the Antarctic for a base. Whether or not they ever built one is pure conjecture but it goes to show that Cussler tends to weave his fiction around solid facts. Additionally, his portrayal of the Ameenes (those who were later called the Atlanteans) is brilliant. Indeed there is much evidence pointing to just such a pre-historical civilization."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my favorite Clive Cussler novel. Atlantis Found offers a peak into what could have been for the human civilization before catastrophic events like asteroids wiped the Earth clean and started us over again. If you like treasure maps and scavenger hunts, this is a great read. Mr. Cussler does it again with his descriptive writing style. It paints a picture in my mind and allows me to watch the story rather than just read it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read every Cussler book. I enjoy the ones with Dirk Pitt immensly. He is the type of individual one can relate to, but most of us will never experience the adventure and thrills that Pitt survives and usually downplays the dangers that would kill most mortal."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Have read some of the negative reviews. I have read just about all the Cussler Dirk Pitt books. I find them fasinating and fun. I want to know when the next Dirk Pitt book is going to be out. Some of the reviews actually made me laugh. I read for entertainment. I like Pitt's style, his smoothness, and humor. Sure he is bigger than life, I live life every day and when I read a novel like this it lifts me out of every day, day after day. I don't think these books are written to teach us something. They are full of magic, adventure and romance. I don't want to read a story where the bad guy wins. Clive Cussler is the only author I collect in hard cover. I AM READY AND WAITING FOR THE NEXT DIRK PITT BOOK."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"To begin with, Cussler's novel (the first one of his I read) is actually rather good. It is pretty fun to read, and the plot is actually pretty good. It involves corny action-hero type Dirk Pitt (great name) who along with his pal Al Giordino from NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency) must stop Neo-Nazis from taking over the world with super-sized Noah's arkish ships. That being said, the reason this book gets three stars as opposed to four or five is because of the writing. Clive Cussler needs to re-enroll in English 101, as he is one of the hokiest and, well, worst writers I have ever seen. First of all, he persists in using rediculous similies such as \\"[His eyes] reminded her of the color of a coral reef beneath smooth water\\" (actually from another book, Serpent) and is absolutely horrible at describing the mechanical objects he so often uses. Don't get me wrong, I love his books and buy them whenever I have the chance, but I still shudder whenever I hear his horrible, horrible writing. Keep the plots, but learn to write!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read numerous Clive Cussler books - including Raise the Titanic, all the way up to blue gold, but I consider Atlantis Found to be Cusslers Classic. Dirk Pitt has never been better than he is in this entertaining novel. With willpower, grit, and smarts, Dirk gets the girl, saves the world, and rides of into the sunset again. If you are a Clive Cussler fan you'll love it, if your not you'll be racing out to grab another Cussler after reading this impossible to put down book. Do yourself a favor and purchase it today. Pure entertainment!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all of Cussler's books. This one is a Dirk Pitt adventure. I would have to say that this tale is a little over the edge as far as believability goes. There are a good cast of characters and there is certainly a degree of suspense but it makes Raise the Titanic seem almost possible by comparason. That's not to say it is totally unbelievable - there is a good deal of truth to the story; and a great deal of creative thinking as far as technology goes. All in all, I did enjoy the read .. but I have read better Cussler books.How lucky can one guy actually be?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This has been one of the best books I've read this year. I can not recommend it enough. Cussler pulled together a tremendous amount of ideas that continued to surprise me and enticed me as I read. Atlantis Found is a wonderful combination of lost civilizations, new nazis, Graham Hancock, Charles Hapgood, the Spear of Destiny and a few others. Alot of fringe ideas that are only now beginning to cause massive changes in ideas in the archaeological and prehistoric fields. What I liked so much was that I actually knew what he was talking about. Finished this book in just over two days. An immense joy to read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"So far, this is my favorite Dirk Pitt book. Cussler pulls out all the stops in a story that wastes no time. In Pitt's tightest schedule yet he has ten days to avert Armeggeddon, and he doesn't even know it! The suspense builds with each page, and you'll definitely be chilled by the nonstop thrills and action."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This Dirk Pitt novel involves a missing ship that reappears 56-years after it was considered dead. Pitt is lead to an ancient mystery with a diabolical enemy--but he is up to the task. Good, light read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"If you love adventure, this is a great read. This is my first Clive Cussler novel. I must admit that I picked this book up because I remember as a little boy watching my dad with his flashlight reading &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; until the wee hours of the morning on a family camping trip. I figured if dad couldn't put the book down (since he never read) then Mr. Cussler must be a pretty good author. I was not disappointed...if anything, Clive gives you more than you bargained for in terms of stories, thrills and excitement. While I agree with others assesments about the book being over the top, isn't that what a perfect adventure is supposed to be all about? The Wolf family, the beautiful but evil family spawned from the very seed of Hitler himself, makes for a great threat to world peace. The means of world destruction laid out in the book was quite fascinating and Mr. Cussler has no doubt done his homework on the subject. I was also intrigued by Cusslers &quot;Snow Cruiser&quot; which plays an integral part of the story and found that it is a real vehicle that truely exists. Dirk Pitt, the hero of the story definately deserves his status alongside the likes of James Bond &amp; Jack Ryan."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"What a book! This is the first one by Cussler that I have read and enjoyed all but the last few chapters. The ending was a little outlandish but overall Very good."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I just recently started reading the Dirk Pitt series, and I am thouroughly hooked. Mixing historical background, meticulous detail, and action has made Atlantis Found an enjoyable read. I could not put the book down!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I read Cussler a lot. THis is the same old formula used for the 15th time. The formula goes like this: an ancient event that will have consequences in the future, undetroyable Pitt appearing by page forty or fifty ( in mass market paperback ). Then the rest of his pals ( GIordino, Rudi Gunn 0 appearing subsequently, an enemy as bad as Satan himself, the old romance with congresswomen Loren Smith, admiral James SAndecker, etc, etc. COnclusion: it's good."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"this novel caught my eye due to the inspiring title including the word 'Atlantis' and hence i thought that the book might be of some good thing substance. yet it was not, although the underlying theory was interesting and provide some mild contenment for somebody interested in the subject. it was in a way very similar to previous factual books by the likes of George Hancock and Charles Hapgood discussing the possibilty of Atlantis being discovered under Antartica. the incredulous character of Dirk Pitt does nothing more for the book than the manner in which it was written. an involving plot seemed to be the only bonus from the novel that was ultimately a James Bond story told in a slightly more interlectual way."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I get tired of reading reviews of people who pick apart the 'science' in a fiction novel. Duh. Go read so-called non-fiction books that are totally bogus. Fiction is written to entertain and this book does that job quite well. Cussler has always pushed beyond the edges of science-- consider Raise The Titanic-- not likely now that we see the ship but, heck, it was a fun story. Another guy who does this same thing with fiction is Greg Donegan with his ATLANTIS book which goes into some very intriguing area, particularly the workings of the human mind."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have always avoided the Clive Cussler section of the bookstore because, quite honestly, I didn't trust someone with that kind of a name to entertain me for endless hours. I was under the misconception that he was just more Tom Clancy ala undersee. I WAS WRONG! Atlantis Found is one of the best books I've ever read of its genre. It's fast, furious and exhausting. It even has Nazi's and they always make the best bad guys. I am now committed to reading every Cussler out there. Read it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It is absolutely criminal that we wait 2-3 years between Dirk Pitt adventures. Clive Cussler weaves a tale like no other author I have ever encountered. You always begin his novels and say to yourself: &quot;how can he possibly tie these events together?&quot; The Lost Continent of Atlantis, professional hitmen, Colorado mines, comets, ancient caves, Nazis, etc. Cussler binds it all together like a pretty Birthday package. While I want to read on, I force myself to ration the book, for I know that the long wait begins as soon as I finish. Each and every chapter has you rooting for hero Dirk Pitt and constantly marvelling at his quick wit, skill and bravery. Of course Cussler has added a new twist to one of the baddest groups of all time...Nazis. To author Cussler, I say &quot;Bravo&quot; and sincerely ask...Couldn't you be a little more prolific?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all of the Dirk Pit novels and enjoy them. Sure they are fanciful and follow a standard formula. Like Dean Koontz novels do. However, when it comes to an entertaining read, I will always look forward to the next Clive Cussler novel about NUMA."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm about 2/3rds into this my first Clive Cussler novel. I've picked them up and put them down for years and now I wonder why I did that everything I really enjoy is in this book archeology, aliens, suspense,Atlantis. So far I am amazed at all the different plots and angles and twists and turns this book is taking and I intend not to let a Clive Cussler book sit unread again. Thanks for the adventure.."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive does it again! Excellent, tightly-woven plot, cool possible historical info, kickin' adventure. This has it all, along with humor and, dare I say it, romance! Cussler's books are always excellent, but this one is one of the best. Nobody does it better than Dirk!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Having read all Cussler works, I was a bit disappointed with Atlantis. Good settings and good action, for sure, but there was something missing. Perhaps Flood Tide was so good that this book, eagerly awaited, was a bit of a let down. I missed the prologue of history that ultimately gets rolled into the plot -- a streaming comet didn't do it for me. Cussler deserves great credit, however, for keeping Pitt as charming and heroic as ever but the &quot;aw shucks&quot; didn't seem to work this time. Still a fan and fervently hoping for the next Dirk Pitt Adventure"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I felt it certainly wasn't in the leage with some of his other novels, but as a huge fan of Mr. Cussler's work I read everything he puts out. Found this book tedious in places, especially the dialogue between him and Al Giordino, people don't really talk that &quot;stiff&quot; to each other. Also found the book in spots to be an advertisement for scuba gear, dive watches, etc...constantly telling us the brand names, apparently for each mention Mr. Cussler gets monetary reward. Again an enjoyable book, but though it lacked a lot of intensity. But as a loyal fan, I eagerly await the next Dirk Pitt adventure."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a big Dirk Pitt fan, having read all of the books (mostmore than once).

Dirk continues to be a cross between &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and James Bond&quot;. Once you begin to read this book, you won't want to stop until you finish it. Having read all his books, it is nice to have the &quot;old familiar Dirk and Al&quot; back again. I am not looking forward to waiting another year or more for the next Dirk Pitt. Keep them coming! Why hasn't Spielberg and Lucas made some his books into movies. This book surely could be a Oscar winner?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was looking for a good action book. i wanted to read ludlum,clancy etc. but my parents said that they wouldn't let me read anything that was not rated \\"pg\\". i was asking around and someone sugested clive cussler. i called my library and found atlantis found. it was amazing. my parents like it because it is between pg and pg13 and still has tons of action and mystery. this book consists of mystery, action, and most importantly, suspence. read it!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Oh dear oh dear. What do you say about an author whose plots would make a James Bond flick look plausible, whose villians and heroes are straight out of Saturday morning cartoons, whose writing skills are at seventh grade level, whose main character is named Dirk Pitt, and who insists on giving himself a \\"cameo\\" in every book? If somebody had told me this, my immediate response would have been to never go near the books. But, thankfully, I picked up this book without any advanced warning, and, despite myself, was hooked. The thing is, if plot (and fun) is the most important thing to you in a book, then read these. If you are such a literary snob that you refuse to have a little bit of escapist fun now and then, then stay away from these. Hey, more for the rest of us.Atlantis Found is my favorite of his Dirk Pitt novels. The plot reaches new levels of implausibility (evil cloned neo-Nazis attempting to cause global armageddon with ancient inscriptions found in Atlantis) and, oddly enough, the amount of fun one has as they read this seems to increase as well. You're not meant to walk away from this with any sort of insight into the human condition (except, perhaps, that evil cloned neo-Nazis who are trying to destroy the world are, well, evil). You're supposed to walk away happy and invigorated, and maybe go out and rent yourself \\"Moonraker\\" to bring yourself back to reality."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"One comet, ten miles wide and four billion tons in weight caused the end of all life on Earth in the year 7120 B.C. 99% of all species were wiped out. The only humans that survived were the Neanderthals who lived in caves, high in the mountains. And, another comet will strike, this time in the year 2001. The only people prepared for this disaster are the great-grandchildren of the Nazis, who will use the devastated Earth for the Fourth Reich: the world Hitler dreamed of. A miner in Colorado finds a chamber describing the horrors of 7120 B.C. Cryptologist specialist, Pat O'Connell, is brought to the scene as well as Dirk Pitt, master spy. He begins to find out about the comet that hit so long ago but the Nazis are determined to kill anyone who looks on this chamber. Again and again they try to kill Dirk Pitt, but he just wont die.This book is action packed and you wont want to put it down.

The first one wasn't even 200 pages (Iceberg), and although I was impressed with Cusslers ability to narate, the storyline didn't impress me. The seccond one was about an archeologist and a mad scientist-like artifact collecter in Peru, and ended up with finding an underground river near the California Peninsula (Inca Gold). The plot didn't impress me there, either. When I bought this one, I (intrestingly) did so not because of an interest in Greek mythology, but because of the Authors reputation. I finally found a story where Pitt is trying to stop a plot to literally concourr the world. I didn't belive the part about the Nazis using captured siberian prisoners during world war 2 to build a base in antartica, but the U-boat did provide an interesting twist. As a student of the German language, I was interested to hear the caracters discuss the name 'fourth empire' and also was interested with the introduction of SEALs...But the end is good in that it shows that not even Pitt--the scuba-diving Indiana Jones,James Bond, or Jack Ryan--can take on the reich without special ops. help...but that's for me to know, and you to read about!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found by Clive Cussler is by far one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down for three weeks straight. Atlantis Found is action packed from beginning to end. There was so many unexpected events and twists to the story that I am still baffled about what happened. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through till the last page. Everything about this book is exciting, especially the characters, the plot, and the crazy changes of events. Clive Cussler always seems to deliver in his novels that star Dirk Pitt. Pitt has to be one of the coolest heroes that I have ever encountered in a novel. He is incredible because he is so realistic but unrealistic all at the same time. Pitt's timing is impeccable; he always manages to show up just at the nick of time and save the day. For anyone who is an action junkie I would definitely recommend this book. It is a guaranteed good time thrill ride. So get to the library or the bookstore and pick up a copy today. Also look for Cussler's new novel Valhalla Rising."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"anything having to do with the end of the world prophecies or ancient, lost civilizations is cool....atlantis found was suggested by a teacher who was a huge cussler fan and said &quot;start with this&quot;...i did, and i am GLADthe subplots early on that tie together are a lot of fun, and the Antarctica setting is neat as well...i loved the big action scene at the end beyond belief, and when all was said and done, cussler threw in a monkey wrench...and himself.....the premise is great, obviously Pitt and Giordino are the best real world Batman and Robin ever, and the action is very coolA GREAT BOOK"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler has done it again. Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino save the world yet again, this time from the diabolical plans of a German Nazi family. Even though the plots of the books are getting more and more out of the ordinary, the action-packed books of the NUMA-series are still a pleasure to read if you are looking for a typical thriller to help you through your holidays. Superhero and renowned macho Dirk and his witty friend Al never have a dull moment in their lives..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"When strange artifacts such as black skulls carved from Obsidian begin appearing in various places around the world, the NUMA team, led by Dirk Pitt spring into action again. Where did the come from and why are people who have seen them having attempts made on their lifes? This is what the NUMA team wants to know.This book has many action packed chapters that made it hard for me to get out of the car; however, getting to them is the problem. Though far-fetched (fiction, remember) it was an enjoyable book to listen to.My dislike about this book was simple. To long and extremely far-fetched. Mr. Cussler killed to many tress with this one. In addition to taking what seemed like forever to set the plot and the scenes, Mr. Pitt went way out there. Ships larger then aircraft carriers being built in secret locations, snow tractors still working after being buried in the ice for years, not to mention a WWII German U-Boat sailing around and never being seen or reported.Mr. Cussler, I like your books, I especially liked Sea Hunters but I can only give this one 3 stars. Folks, if you like Clive Cussler, you will like this book but be prepared as I think it is the longest one he has ever written."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"While the plot of &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; while farfetched, it's what I come to expect when I do a marathon escape into the imangination of Clive Cullser. Ancient civilizations, modern supervillians, cataclysmic destruction and history bending climaxes are basic foundations of the world of Dirk Pitt. Sadly, though, I have grown extremely tired of the stilted dialogue and charecters. Cussler's descriptions of Pitt's determination and spirit don't need over-embelishment EVERY TIME he does something heroic. Between security guards shaking their fists at Pitt, Special Forces soldiers calling big trucks &quot;macabre,&quot; and listening to the bad guys describe in how they &quot;contemplated and trained&quot; for a battle makes me begin to wonder if Mr. Cussler needs a new thesaurus on his computer. It's a great story, cool concept and would make a fantastic mini-series. I just had a hard time reading the book without laughing out loud at the language and actions more in line with a 1930's science fiction movie serial."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"By far the best of his books - with an interesting twist for the major characters that I hadn't expected.

The evolution of the plot holds you from the beginning and goes to places you wouldnt even imagine.If you are an avid Dirk Pitt fan read this book.. If you are looking for a book that will take you in and give you a thrill ride.. read this book. The development of the characters and the story line are great. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good time and a break away from the doldrums of reality."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Where to start with this lamentable effort. Well, don't buy it would be a good place. It's dreadful and I'm going to give away quite a bit of the plot in this opinion to show you just how stupid it is. If you don't want it spoilt for you, then stop now, but I did warn you.Cussler has sunk to a real low by writing this book, and his biggest mistake as far as I can see is attempting to leave the confines of the narrow world he usually inhabits, to write about things in the real world, which he knows nothing about. If you've never read anything by Cussler, buy one of his early novels, as they are much better. They all revolve around a fellow called Dirk Pitt, an underwater secret agent, who makes Superman seem a bit like Mickey Mouse - get the picture.The plot has more holes in it than a very holey thing (Metaphors fail me). The story goes something like this - Some bloke discovers an extraordinary artefact 9100 years old. Lots of people try to kill him and all he tells of his find, but Dirk Pitt pops up and saves them all. These artefacts have been left by the Atlanteans to warn of impending doom, but things are not so simple. Oh no, Mr Cussler has a race of super nazis living under the South Pole and plotting to take over the world. Ludicrously, he would have the poor dumb reader believe that although 275,000 people are involved in the plot, none of the world's intelligence agencies have been able to penetrate the organisation during its 50 years of existence. Puhleease Clive, the National Enquirer would seem to be more your speed. Fortunately for us, Pitt uncovers the plot, convinces the entire US version of the MOD of it's genuineness in about 20 minutes, then saves our bacon pretty much single handedly.On the back of the book, some wag has penned \\"From the Grand Master of adventure fiction comes heart-pounding action and intrigue - And the answer to one of the great mysteries in human history\\". What a laugh. The \\"Answer\\" is that Atlantis was destroyed 9,000 years ago by, get this, a comet greater than the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Sheesh, and nobody realised until now.Pitt sees more combat in this book than you average Vietnam Vet, receiving in separate incidents, err, well, cuts to his hands, feet and head actually. Two of his unarmed mates successfully take on a helicopter gunship and six heavily armed mercenaries, who we are led to believe are all ex SAS or similar. This is just stupid and I was getting very bored by that point. However, this was one of my holiday books, bought for easy reading by the pool, so it had be finished, but at 7 pounds I wished I'd bought a bottle of Raki (Greek alcohol) and half poisoned myself instead.Cussler likes to show off his technical diving knowledge, and as he has led a number of successful exploration expeditions you'd expect this to be done well. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. I suspect he is just so patronising that he assumes the reader won't realise when BS is being waved under their nose. He has Pitt diving in mine shafts using totally ludicrous equipment just to make it sound exciting. I can genuinely say anyone who dived using the gear he suggests would be laughed at if they left the confines of a swimming pool (A solo dive in an overhead environment, using a single regulator on a twinset, for anyone that understands). In the technical diving world he would firmly be described as a \\"Stroke\\" (Origin unknown, either about to look like a stroke victim due to bad diving practice, or a total W**ker are the favourite guesses)Name dropping and gross egotism are a couple of other of Cussler's little faults. He has himself making two cameo appearances to aid Pitt's bid to save the world. How arrogant can he possibly get I ask myself? Well, we all know he actually fantasises that he's Pitt, so I suppose there's room for him to get worse yet. He also drops in the names of expensive wines, at 60 ukpounds a throw, just to rub the readers nose in the fact that he's loaded and we aren't. Martin Ray Cabernet Sauvignon - \\"An excellent choice Sir, not many of our Patrons know it exists\\" says the waiter. Ho ho, Clive did though, didn't he, and just had to share his expertise. Well if its anything like his diving expertise it'll probably taste like urine, 60 pounds or not. He then goes on to denigrate Gallo, the stuff most of us in the UK would consider a decent wine at 3 to 4 pounds a bottle. Snob.So what else was good about the book. His characters are all nearly identical, apart from the token women who wet their knickers every time Dirk enters the room. Wooden, soulless, boring, with stunted dialogue and not a swear word amongst them. It's almost impossible to tell the difference between the Nazis and the Americans as they behave pretty much in the same fashion. They all lead a bourgeois existence that died with F Scott Fitzgerald, but at least he had the wit and feeling to mock the world he inhabited.Cussler's literary skills are very limited too. Quote - \\"A long lost race who discovered the world\\" said Giordino, philosophically - On that evidence Cussler wouldn't know philosophy if it swallowed him whole. This sums up his absence of talent and lack of ability to convey emotion or thought for me, and I won't be reading another of his books unless I wind up in jail with no other option. This dreadful offering is Mills and Boon (Trashy Romantic Ladies novels in the UK) for the boys, at its worst."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"What I liked: 1. Cussler, as usual puts together a fast-paced adventure novel (action, some suspense) 2. I wouldn't mind one of my kids finding it(no &quot;f&quot; words, no gratuitous tacky sex scenes) 3. It's a totally unbelievable plot, yes--but picture any James Bond film since Dr. No and compare.Didn't like: 1. The villian characters were really predictable and acted like they came off of Scooby Doo (&quot;It was a perfect crime and it would have worked if it wasn't for those meddling NUMA guys&quot;!) The same villian characters didn't act like real people--they talked too much and revealed way too much of their evil plotting to Pitt instead of being protective. 2. Pitt and his friend Al should face the consequences of their bad negotiating tactics.In spite of its faults, it is an enjoyable read that doesn't take all of your attention."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first book I've read by Clive Cussler and I doubt I will read another. The writing is amateurish at best, the dialog is poorly written, and many of the situations in the plot are ludicrous. Much of the plot reads like a teenage boy's daydream during a boring algebra class, an issue that is exacerbated by Cussler's tendency to write himself into the story in a variety of ways.The science background that is supplied to support the storyline is full of serious errors and inconsistencies. This I could forgive if the book provided a 'rippling good yarn', but the overall story is pretty lame and highly derivative. By the end I was surprised that the Nazi bad guys weren't also zombies.One of the biggest problems with this book is that it is just PACKED with inconsistencies and ludicrous statements/situations. Examples of this can be found on almost any randomly selected page of the book, but here are a few samples: (1) At one point in the book a group of special forces soldiers find themselves helpless to deal with an armored snowcat that they don't have enough firepower to damage. The author's solution is to have the hero take out the snowcat by throwing a perforated gas can into the snowcat through its open windows! Apparently the special forces people too dense to shoot through the windows of a snowcat, the nazis are too dense to roll up their windows, and the author is too dense to recognize how ludicrous the whole thing is. (2) Shortly after the snowcat episode, these same special forces are exposed to a suspicious light mist that begins to envelope them. The leader of the soldiers takes a big sniff of the mist and announces it is not poisonous; part of his training is to recognize toxic gas. Yes, I am sure that soldiers are routinely exposed to toxic gases so they can recognize them and that their training tells that to take a big snort of any suspicious gas to identify it! (By the way, there are plenty of toxic gases that have no odor whatsoever, so not only is this approach an incredibly dangerous one, but this is also a approach that can't be counted on to work!)All-in-all, I'd have been far happier to have left Atlantis Lost."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I devour books. I usually finish a book within a few days (I finished the 6th Harry Potter in one day and it was a massive book!). I bought this book in an airport bookstore - I had two 3 hour flights ahead of me, and I figured that I could get through at least half by the time my last flight ended. (I had read Sahara earlier this year, and seemed to remember enjoying it, or maybe that was just a shirtless Matthew McConaghey in the movie!).Anyways, this book is utterly inane. The first few chapters are interesting, as Cussler sets up for a quite interesting storyline... but then the whole novel spiralled downhill, and I could not read more than one chapter a day.I agree with everyone who said that the dialogue was utterly ridiculous. It is true that noone talks that way. I also got very irritated by the fact the characters explained everything they did to each other. The characters also have this irritating way of coming up with wise-ass things to say in life-threatening situations (of which there about 20 in this novel). Just shut up and fight for your life!However, the thing that irritated me most was the narrative. I found this to be most child-like, and just simply BAD writing. The last two paragraphs on page 472 (continuing onto page 473) are the MOST ridiculous things I've ever read. One is a full run-on sentence that is about 6 lines and is a whole paragraph! The other actually begins a sentence, \\"Bedlam!\\"Furthermore, there is a whole scene at the end where one of the guards is killed right in front of Hugo Wolf. It came completely out of left field. I had no clue who this \\"sargeant\\" they mentioned was, even when I went back and searched the previous 25 pages for any mention of his name and he was never mentioned again. It was just bizarre. Cussler writes like he has no editor!I honestly didn't know writing could be so trite. Cussler may want to invest in a copy of Stephen Kings \\"On Writing\\" because he certainly could use a few lessons on how to handle dialogue, narrative and characterization.The characters in this book are not sexy or attractive. They are over the top, especially the villains. The Wolfs did not seem evil or crazy to me (and they were often described as crazy)... they just seemed compltely unrealistic.The only reason I didn't put down this book after I hadn't finished it in a week was because I was interested to see what ridiculous, over-the-top, implausible ending Cussler had given us. And he certainly delivered that.I gave this book two stars, because although it sucked enough for one star, I did finish it, which I suppose says something."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my second Cussler novel. I don't know if I would have read a second one, but I already had this one. In fact, I have yet another waiting on my shelf -- a gift from someone. The first one didn't impress me that much and this one, ATLANTIS FOUND, is just more of the same. On the positive side, there's lots of action. The story never slows down, which is probably all most Cussler fans are looking for. Character and plausibility take a back seat to fast-paced action, and if that's all you want, then ATLANTIS FOUND is great stuff.Beyond the action, however, the characters here ARE wooden. Dirk Pitt, the hero, is always flawless and never experiences a moment of doubt or uncertainty. Someone has described him as a combination of James Bond and Indiana Jones, and he's every bit of that and more. He's the ultimate hero. The nasties are of the cookie-cutter variety. Further, the plot verges on the ridiculous. This is typical of the genre and many are okay with it, but it can get difficult to swallow, even for a reader like me, who is comfortable with fantasy and science fiction. It's my opinion that if a writer sets a story in the real world, then there are limits to how far the bounds of reality can comfortably be stretched. Cussler skirts my limit very closely.The worst thing about this, and the other Cussler novel I've read, is that the writing simply isn't very good. Other reviewers have made the same point. Cussler's metaphors often clanged in my mind. For example, he writes \\"The waning stars in the early-morning sky blazed like a theater marquee when seen from 9,000 feet above sea level.\\" Huh? Not only does it read clumsily, but the idea of comparing stars to a theater marquee must have Shakespeare turning over in his grave. Also, words are often simply misused. Cussler writes \\"The day was typical for the nation's capital, the climate hot and sultry.\\" The \\"day\\" may have been \\"hot and sultry\\", but the term \\"weather\\" would be more appropriate in this statement than \\"climate\\".If lightweight, fast-paced action is all you want, Cussler's books will work fine for you, and ATLANTIS FOUND is no exception to that. This book will NOT put you to sleep. But, if you seek a small degree of plausibility, character development, or simply competent writing, my advice is to look elsewhere. I zipped through this book quickly and was entertained, but was mildly disappointed by the time it was over. Things got further and further over the top as I got nearer to the end. Overall, ATLANTIS FOUND was entertaining enough to rate four stars, but flawed enough to hold back to three."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first Clive Cussler read, and it is my last. A suspenseful prologue aside, this book is awash in shallow main characters, silly plot twists, and inane dialogue. Add a doomsday plot so implausible that it would make Ian Flemming blush. The dialogue between Dirk and friends seems to have been copied from some bad cop show, with tasteless, cliched, campy similes by the dozen. I happened to read this book in the audio form, which also had an awful narrator. Save your time and sense of self-worth, and read something by Clancy, Ludlum, or perhaps as one other reviewer suggested, the excellent novels of Patrick Obrien."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I love Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels.

Yeah yeah yeah - the dialog could have used some help, but if you wanted good dialog *why* are you reading a book like this? This is adventure, the unknown, lost secrets uncovered, etc. I really wish the book would have gone a different direction at some points, but I was never left to feel empty. If you want to research Atlantis, this book is not for you. If you want science and technology that exists in the real world, read non-fiction. If you want to be entertained for a few weekends, this is it.For me, this book was an exciting non-stop read. I don't think I've ever been so rushed to get home from work to read a stinking book before, until now. The lady from the local library recommended it to me, and said I was lucky to get it because as soon as it hits the shelves it's gone again.Dirk Pitt is a Bond type, but not as cultured - which is good. The characters are not entirely fleshed out, but it didn't affect the story for me. The plot moves you around the world in a whirlwind manner, searching for clues and help to uncover the mystery. Just read the first chapter and you'll be hooked. Some of the ideas he proposed in the book were burned in my head for a month after reading it. I can still see the author's vision for his world in my head - which means he did his job.

One should not be a literary snob, when it comes to good adventure novels. They are not meant to elevate you to the next levels in academia and erudition, but to entertain with a good story (and who does not like a good story? I'll bet even the critics secretly enjoy curling up on the couch with a fun adventure book sometimes) and along the way, drop enough tantalizing technological, historical, oceanographical and geological facts to make a demanding reader like myself, notorious for trashing books he does not like, impatient to get to the next page. Sure, read the critically acclaimed books. But once in a while, a smart adventure novel will not hurt. It's like eating a healthy diet, and enjoying that slice of chocolate cake sometimes. What the heck?That said, the novel does not live up to the promise of a great read, because Mr. Cussler bites off more than he can chew in the further development of the events, which are really not believable at all. I find that the scale is just too grand, the escapades just too impossible, the odds just too high, the technology just too perfect. There is a quip about James Bond in the novel, but the irony is that it is even less believable the old Fleming novels.Sorry, cannot give more than 2.5."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Great book have to keep turning the pages until the last page..seller is top notched and had the book in no time"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Rapid fire action, and has the reader unable to put the book down!

My only minor complaint is that he sometimes spent a bit too much time describing details that weren't relevant.

The only highlight I can find is that it isn't (thank god) tedious. But what bothered me the most was his need to explain things such as Precession, Diffusion (in relation to the populating of North America), and even sky charts (among many other things) for goodness sakes! I understand some people may not have ever heard of, say, the Theory of Diffusion, but they are capable of looking it up! Cussler need not badly attempt to work the definition into the story!! Ugh.

Lines like &quot;mudslides that were almost 30 feet wide or more.&quot; (What's almost more?) Everybody has &quot;white teeth&quot; in this book. It's filled with the model numbers of the machines, but it lacks any development of the people. This is Judith Krantz with fighting instead of shopping. It's bad.What's more, the reader has little intonation and his voice grates. It's just bad."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Like most of Clive Cussler's books, ATLANTIS FOUND was another thrilling book. The only thing is that the plots are getting a bit too predictable for my taste. I think that Cussler has worn out the evil family trying to take over the world plot. He should come up with something very novel. Otherwise, Dirk Pitt was yet again trilling and daring."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A friend had recommended Clive Cussler to me. I like to read popular authors and see why the reading public finds their novels so interesting. I picked up \\"Atlantis Found\\" to read on a long flight abroad. I assumed that his writing was like Ludlum, Grisham or Follett. I call this genre \\"airplane books\\", nothing too heavy, just an interesting plot that keeps my attention during the flight.From the beginning, I was amazed how utterly ridiculous this story was. I realize this is fiction; but I felt like I was reading a \\"comic book\\" staring a very flimsy superhero called Dirk Pitt. The story is populated with Nazi clones and ancient sophisticated civilizations that had traveled all over the globe leaving etchings predicting Armaqgeddon.Although, I was ready to put this book down soon after starting, I gave all those individuals who highly rated this book a chance-I was also on a long flight- and trudged on. It only became more implausible and painful. The incredibly successful and sophisticated Nazis that are introduced half way through the story had \\"secretly\\" built a number of giant ships to serve as \\"arks\\" for a select few thousand to populate the earth after the soon to be created \\"man-made\\" flood inundated the planet-those diabolical devils. Despite the Nazi clones-from Hitler's DNA no less- sophisticated weapons, security, and man-power our boy Dirk and his wise cracking side-kick Giordino save the day.By the way ,what is the deal with naming and describing all the vehicles and apparatus that Dirk uses? Like descibing the Bell-Boeing 609, or the 36' Ford Cabriolet or the U.S Diver's Aquarius air regulator and Mark II face mask. Is this some type of product placement or is it supposed to make the story more plausible. I hope that it is product placement because it only makes the story seem more ridiculous.There are many great fiction writers available in this genre. Save your self the time and money and pass on this book by Clive Cussler. If you want a comic to read pick up something from Marvel."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am about half way through this book and I just can't finish it. Its not usual I do that but it is just sucking my will to live.The dialogue is a joke. I can't stand the main character. I'm mostly just hoping that between dodging 'killers' and bombs, he gets wacked in the process.It seems every paragraph is just filled with the make and model of every piece of gear he has on. Do I care that he looked down at his x3-500 Supermega watch with intel microprogramming digitalizers? No. And no one else does either.Sorry but I just dont think I can finish it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Maybe I didn't enjoy this book because I have not read any of Cussler's other works, but I must say that I was severely dissappointed in this book. I finally gave up trying to be interested about half way through, and that is extremely rare for me. Considering the rave reviews I read, I tried hard to let this book win me over, but all I can tell you is I wont be reading any more from this author."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"OK, can someone tell me why the average rating of this book is 4 stars! @$ I have been totally misled. It's so childishly predicatble, like a bad Hollywood action movie. Alright, the story line could be a PASS. But, my goodness, a flat lacking of narritive skills. It's my first time reading Clive Cussler and LAST. It's for kids age 8-10 only."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Reading about Dirk Pitt is like eating popcorn...you just can't stop. Some say that Cussler is not as good as the past but I say he is the same...fun...far out...full of adventure...and nine or ten? lives. This book was a little long but very typical of Cussler books. I still don't know who the leak was in NUMA maybe someone can help with that!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Mr. Clussler never fails to entertain me. This one is no exception. The thrills keep coming. Dirk Pitt is a great hero. And the messes he and Al get into and out of are just plain fun. With the added bonus of the historial information that Mr. Clussler packs into his books is first rate. Mr. Clussler does a lot of research to get his facts right which makes his books even more fun. I look forward to another book by Mr. Clussler, soon I hope."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler is back and the action sequences are well written, but the plot suffers a little bit from the many different aspects of the plot. Well written but the story could have been simpler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Once again Clive Cussler earns my award for the Best Fiction Writer! Dirk Pitt returns in an action packed thriller that I couldn't put down until I read it from front to back. The Atlantis concept is intriguing and well researched. Gives a new answer to the question of what happened to those dinosaurs. This is another MUST READ book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all of the Dirk Pitt novels, and enjoy them as escapist fiction that I don't have to think about very much while I am reading. I was wondering if Mr. Cussler had perhaps read &quot;Icefire&quot; by Judith &amp; Garfield Reeves-Stevens, (which was published in l998) and has to do with terrorists, Antarctica, and the Ross Ice Shelf. Hmmm - nevertheless, the book is entertaining, and much more plausible than some of Mr. Cussler's previous novels."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I haven't read a Cussler novel in quite some time so when I saw this one at the store I picked it up and thumbed through it before purchasing it. I must tell you, the beginning of the novel is very interesting. Cussler sets up the schemes and characters pretty well and has some interesting twists on earth's history (although the dates don't match up according to current archaelogical research...but hey, this is fiction). That being said, it is pretty much hype after the third chapter. A lot of James Bond style action with Indiana Jones research and back-drops. All in all I would say that the book is fun to read but not much substance."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk Pitt is back! For the Clive Cussler fans, I think this is one of his best yet! Instantly into the action."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Great read! Stop reading these reviews and either order it or buy it. One of Cussler's best."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I notice that all the reviews on this page are for the hardcover book edition; so I must emphasize that I am reviewing the abridged cassette edtion.This author is new to me, therefore his hero is also. Frankly as I heard the cassette, as well-read as it was, my interest began to wane into the second of the four tapes; and I began to wonder why this should be.None of the characters are particularly interesting or even believable. Now for a work of action-adventure fiction, credibility can go by the board. Does anyone really believe that James Bond can do all the things Flemming has him do? But Bond is interesting, he is funny, he is semi-mythical in a way that this hero simply is not.Secondly the plot seems put together of shreds and patches from other works. Being trapped by water in a supposedly sealed room and being rescued at the last instant is strictly Indiana Jones, while the Fourth Empire is nothing but the evil organization that first showed up in &quot;Thunderball,&quot; and the ancient runes in the ruins find their origin in &quot;She.&quot; And so on.The story told on this tape is well-wrought--the author knows what he is about as a craftsman--but it offers nothing at all new to the genre; and what is old is not all that well done. Perhaps reading the book would produce a totally different estimation. But nothing I heard makes me feel the urge to do so."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The plot was OK enough to keep me reading, although a bit far-fetched at times. But the worst part was the dialogue! Good grief! It was some of the most inane reading I've ever seen!! Instead of using the narrative to describe what has happened, all of the characters describe it to each other. For example, in one portion of the book, two characters are in a plane, one wakes up and asked how long they had been flying. Since at this point we didn't know exactly why they were flying or where they had come from, Cussler has to explain it. But instead of using a narrative to explain it (\\"They left the airbase that morning....\\"), he has the characters explain to each other. One character said to the other \\"It's been four hours since we took off from suchandsuch ship near suchandsuch bay off the coast of Argentina\\". Give me a break! They both took off and knew where they were, did he really need to tell his friend where they took off from when all he wanted to know was how long he'd been asleep?? And this went on throughout the entire book.To make a short story long, Cussler just writes like a Scooby Doo cartoon. He has all the characters explain EVERYTHING that's happening instead of using the narrative to tell the background info. It's the tired classic of the bad guy explaining his evil plot to the good guys right before he kills them. If all of his books are like that, I doubt I'll read any others by this author."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read all of Clive Cussler books, and am amazed at one aspect of his writing. That is, he always seems to be able to write engaging, fast-paced novels even with some unbelievable and/or &quot;corny&quot; elements that always seem to wreck other authors. With &quot;Atlantis Found&quot;, he has pulled that off yet again.I always find myself having to &quot;disengage&quot; a portion of my brain when reading a Cussler novel, because of the unbelievable and corny aspects of his writing. Dirk Pitt is a kind of &quot;super Bond&quot;, who gets put through more abuse, injury, and utterly impossible situations than any other fictional leading man in the literary world. No way he can continue to singlehandedly save the world and survive, but that's fiction!The other thing I have to ignore is Cussler's quirky sort of writing, especially when it comes to conversation. He writes dialogue for his characters that you never hear from anyone in the real world. It is a style that is almost overly cliched, but in an elitist, Ivy League sort of way. This is amusingly highlighted in &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; in the dialogue between the Special Forces troops. I know of no troops in my experiences, including a stint in the Navy, who spoke as Cussler's characters did. He made them out to sound like they went through high society etiquette training rather than boot camp or SEAL training.Like I said, though, despite these corny and unbelievable elements, Cussler enthralls the reader with his historically and archaeologically-based plots. He manages to wrap the reader's focus around thes believable elements and lets the reader enter an Indiana Jones-esque tale.&quot;Atlantis Found&quot; has a great plot centering on the Amenes culture and its tie with the myth of Atlantis. Pitt's nemesis in the novel, the evil Fourth Empire, is a worthy foe that also adds a great historical element to the storyline. I too enjoyed the plot twist that came about midway through the book, as did a previous reviewer. It was one I did not see coming until you hit it. And, I enjoyed the fact that for once, Pitt had to have SOME help in saving the world, courtesy of Special Forces. Of course, Cussler has Pitt saving the troops' bacon once and making all the crucial decisions, but at least he had some help in thwarting the bad guys.If there was one element in this novel I did not like, it was Cussler's self-serving insertion of himself into the story to meet/help Pitt. However, this is a pet peeve I've had of his novels for awhile now. It was neat the first time he did it, and maybe the second time too. But now it's old and is a weak point that seems to do nothing more but to soothe Cussler's ego. I would hope he halts this aspect of his writing the next time around.All in all, though, &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is an enjoyable story. It is a nice cap to the 1990's for Cussler, who has put together a string of solid novels this decade after being sort of &quot;hit-and-miss&quot; early in his career. While this novel did not quite rank with my favorite Cussler novel, &quot;Treasure&quot;, it is still one I highly recommend to Cussler fans and also to those reading him for the first time."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I bought this book as soon as it came out even though I had been disappointed with both Flood Tide and Shock Wave. Being a huge fan of Mr. Cussler's I had to give Dirk, Al and the NUMA crew another chance, and I am really glad that I did. Mr. Cussler weaves a great story which makes the reader keep reading page after page, not wanting the book to end. Buy it and if you haven't read his other books, buy them too."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler fans will find his latest very like his previous novels. I'm more of a reader of historical fiction like &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; or &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, but I always make it a point to read Cussler's books when they are published. They always entertain, they are never too deep, in brief, they are like a roller coaster ride, packed with thrills and adrenaline but not exactly profundly moving."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Who edited this story? Dialogue was out of place, events contradicted themselves. Are we in too big a hurry to make a dollar? I want the job of editing the next attempt but it seems Dirk and Al are about to be turned out to pasture with their love interests. Does this mean we have to endure those two characters that surfaced two years ago in Cussler's collaboration with what's-his-name?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have been a Dirk Pitt fan for over 20 years and the only thing I found disappointing about this book is Mr. Cussler's threat to retire Dirk and Al. These two can do anything and find anything, anywhere, anytime (have they gone after the fabled 7 cities of gold, yet, or the Oak Island treasure?) and foil any scheme. They NEVER fail, they never age and they recover in superhuman time. Yes, it's impossible. So is Superman. Yes, the plot goes in all directions before coming together at the end. That's part of Clive Cussler's ironic humor, along with his James Bond type characters and the insertion of his own character and cars into the story a la Hitchcock and King. His ancient history prologues are attention-getters that keep you turning pages wondering how he's going to tie up all these loose ends, but Warning! If you have no sense of humor or if you're looking for logical, prosaic, real-world drama, read the newspaper. If you're looking for toungue-in-cheek, larger-than-life excitement with a couple of true superheroes, you've come to the right place. A hero should be a hero and Dirk Pitt is it, as he once again foils a world shaking plot and at the same time solves an ancient mystery. Keep him coming, Clive!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Like the classic cars that Cussler and Pitt collect, I thought Atlantis Found was vintage. If you were expecting Tolstoy then why would you pick up a Dirk Pitt Novel? If you want a full blast roller coaster ride then Cussler is what you want. Several times I thought&quot; Well they're about to wrap this up and there are alot of pages left...He must have a big preview of his next book in the back. Then Dirk and Al would take off again through another Loop-the-loop. WHEEE!What fun."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first try at a Clive Cussler book, and absolutely my last. Unfortunately for me, Mr. Cussler has written fiction here about a range of subjects that I have great deal of knowledge about (why I bought the book), so some of the inconsistencies with his facts & logic instantly flew into my face. Others took a few extra seconds.What annoyed me (and caused me to privately give this book a subjective 0-star rating) is that all the jarring lapses in facts & logic that I came across easily could have been avoided with a just a little imagination and research. If you're bothered by things like characters being concerned that their sailing ship (that's trapped in ice that will thaw when spring arrives) will be crushed by the ice one winter, while another sailing ship, only a short distance away, has been perpetually trapped in ice (that, I guess, never melts)for 70 years with no ill effects, AND it contains frozen and never-defrosted occupants*, then this will be a really damned unhappy read. I was stunned by his magic decoder ring ancient civilization alphabet, where a circle with one line through it corresponded with our letter 'A', and one with two lines through it with 'B' and so forth. That's not how written languages of this type work, and all the author had to do was NOT generate a somewhat predictable series of geometric characters that conveniently nearly perfectly matched our alphabet. If you don't get what the problem is here, no matter, but I will tell you that what the author has done is about what I'd expect from an old Nancy Drew mystery written for the 10-12 age bracket, if even.This goes on throughout the entire book--well at least to about a third in, where I finally threw in the towel and jumped to the last chapter, which was, without reservations, damned awful. He does mention a lot of subjects, but he doesn't seem to know much about any of them, which makes one review here claiming his books can be \\"educational\\" kind of sad. Mr. Cussler probably counts on his readership not doing any fact-checking, and as long as the books keep selling, the publisher won't care if he puts Antarctica in the middle of Lake Tahoe.If readers like his books, well, they like his books, but I sure don't sense that the author has much respect for his readers. A responsible writer of even the most fantastic fiction usually provides some substance to his or her story by using facts & logic. People can even learn things about ships, weather, the Antarctic, you name it, in the course of the storytelling, and people who actually know a few things can also enjoy the story without wincing too often. If I were writing for a certain market I'd flat out use my writing to help educate people (and prevent myself from feeling I was writing useless fluff).The quality of the writing is, after a drink, passable, and not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. By our low modern standards it may even be almost barely adequate. Illogical and fact-empty storytelling like this, though, puts this book in the same league as an episode of Scooby-Doo.PS The back of my copy of the book has a pic of Mr. Cussler with his 1936 Ford Hot Rod that his loyal readers financed. Given the writing, this strange display of its rewards to the author kind of bothered me. Its a nice car--far better crafted than the book.*not just frozen and never defrosted during any ship-freeing polar spring, but garbed in 18th century costumes, but NOT wrapped in blankets, or even sail cloth. The author's explanation for why they were dressed for a promenade in London rather than the Antarctic and why there was no attempt to use wood from the ship to make fires are just ludicrous. He needed an intact ship and a frozen crew and logic be damned."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Once again Clive Cussler has created another thrilling story that is realistic and to boot he has given me a wonderful tour down history lane. The plot moved along briskly and soon I found myself reading page after page. I thought there was less suspense in this story especially when I think of \\"Sahara\\" which I thought was just a terrific book. In summary, I would gladly recommend this book to all my friends. For me, Mr. Cussler is the type of writer that with all his novels, he has never disappointed me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler usually weaves together a couple of themes in his books, in this case, the secret plot of the Neo-Nazi Wolff family to \\"purify\\" the world and the coming doomsday prediction of the ancient Amenes civilization.The premise of the ancient Amenes civilization, much older than the Sumerians and completely lost to the world in a massive disaster, was fascinating and spellbinding. And the Wolff family were worthy opponants for Pitt, if a little unrealistic to have a whole family of clones of Adolph Hitler (enhanced, of course). One always discovers something absolutely fascinating in Pitt novels, and archaeology was always one of my favorite topics.All in all, it was another great Pitt novel, one in which Pitt wins against all odds and has a beautiful woman in the process, not unlike James Bond. But it's more of a combination of Indiana Jones and James Bond, and still manages not to be too corny or stereotyped in the process. Pitt is still relatively unique, so he's not intended to be an exact clone of either Bond or Jones, which is a good thing."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I came to the world of Dirk Pitt and Clive Cussler later than most. I had seen the movie based on his RAISE THE TITANIC novel and enjoyed it and even remembered seeing a copy of that novel in my local newsagents when I was but a young boy.But, it wasn't for another two decades that I finally picked up a Cussler novel and began reading - it was an experience that had me jetting off to the local bookstore and scouring the pages of amazon.com for more Pitt adventures to dive into. The book that had that impact on me was ATLANTIS FOUND, a book that single handedly changed my reading habits and entertained me through a number of business trips.Though the plot may be a little convoluted and improbable and the whole re-emergemce of a Nazi power somewhat cliched - its been done before and more convincingly in novels like THE HOLCROFT COVENENT and ICEBREAKER to name but a few. But, what Cussler does possess in ample quantities here is a knack for writing an action scene. In fact the book ATLANTIS FOUND can be seen as a series of action setpieces strung together over the span of 500-plus pages. No matter though, I liked the way the pot was developed, the idea of the giant ships and the way that Cussler was able to tie together an ancient meteor strike and the nineteenth-century discovery of an ice tundra bound ghost ship to present day events.All of the Cussler elements that have become trademarks for the writer over the years are here in abundance and although he still has some appalling dialogue and convoluted plotting, I personally found the novel to be a real page turner."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A new novel by Clive Cussler? Well then, I knew right where to look - the fiction section! Did I find it there? You bet! Was I disappointed by some less-than-perfect grammar and techno-isms? No way! You see, I read Cussler (along with Clancy, King, and others) for the sheer joy of escape. Yes, the characters and plot are all too familiar but this is precisely the reason I am drawn back to them, novel after novel (much like slipping into a pair of old favorite jeans). I have become used to the Cussler conventions (such as starting a story in the pre-historic, continuing another thread in the historic, and drawing them altogether in the present) and, quite simply, I like it - it works!Atlantis Found pulls together such diverse story lines (a comet, world-wide devastation, an old sailing vessel, Nazis, ice-caps, etc.) and weaves them into a wonderful escapist tapestry. To the vast majority of other readers out there I say, grab a copy of any Cussler material, sit back, and let the real world spin without you for a few fun-filled hours!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Well I've read every Clive Cussler book there is....and this one is pretty good. I was expecting something A LOT DIFFERENT but it was still very interesting. I thought the intro wasn't quite as good as some Pitt novels....and the overall story wasn't as gripping as some....but it was still good. Too bad Dirk is getting old......"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first time I read something to Clive Cussler. And I was amazed how he grabed my attention and kept my nose in his book, which I liked very much.The novel is very nice, full of adventure and mistry and once you finish a chapter, the writer makes sure that you will flip to the next one eagirly. I like this kind of books. Which reminds me of Michael Chrichton.I am looking forward to read his previous work, so enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"My hats off to Mr. Cussler, I have read all of his books and again he has led us through another exciting adventure with Dirk Pitt and all the other NUMA characters. I eagerly await another book with their further exploits."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This book marks a welcome return to stories like Sahara and Raise the Titanic which made us Clive Cussler readers in the first place. Yes, the story is over the top with Pitt winning at the end even more convincingly than James Bond ever did, but it is a heck of a lot of fun getting there. This is about as good a story as Cussler has written, it's just that readers are already familiar with NUMA's exploits - familiarity breeds raised expectations. Good villains built around the Wolf family which is presented like a goose stepping, pre-war version of the Osmonds. The main seismic disaster-about-to-happen was interesting as well. Has Mr. Cussler read the HAB Theory (a good read in itself) which has similar perils? Finally, I enjoyed reading about the high tech gear that Pitt and Co. employ, particularly the GPS and GIS mapping systems (someone's got to tell Pitt where the enemy is). There were some problems here and there but once the action got turned up the story was riveting. If you are buying this book to be entertained you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all Clive Cussler's books. The one true theme through all of his adventures in his Dirk Pitt novels and his true life stories, Is America needs a hero that is true to his country, his friends, and his belief in the American way. The books all have entertaining plots, and well defined characters. Even if you just picked up Atlantis Found for the first time, you would get a good read on all the other books. Dirk Pitt is an American hero, and we need more like him!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I picked this book up and could not put it down! What a blend of myth and adventure. Pairing our beloved Dirk and Atlantis was a stroke of pure genius. In the opening adventure sequence I found myself holding my breath just like the unfortunate three in the chamber. Only Dirk could make an entrance like that.Our favorite characters are all back and we realise how much we missed them. Al gets a girl of his own and Loren realises she might be missing something.The great classic car is a dream. Wouldn't we all love the chance to be behind the wheel?The bad guys are guys and girls that we really can hate with a vengence. The incredible odds just keep coming at our heroes and they never give up!All in all just what a Cussler book should be!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Mr. Clive Cussler does it once again! In Atlantis Found he continues his literary success in developing a very strong plot with many very interesting sub plots. The reader experinces the techno / political excitement of a great story written by a great story writer. With Dirk Pit, the main character, running the show, Clive Cussler make the reader feels that he or she is another partner just like Al Giordino to Dirk. In this book Clive does an excellent job of joining present day with the mythical past - Atlantis or Amenes, as it is called in the book, while taking the reader on a fantastic ride. This is a must adventure book to read. I can't wait for his next one. When will Hollywood take notice of this writer and screenplay this latest work and produce a movie. This book has all the makings of a very good, exciting movie. Maybe Steven Spielberg should do it! Read this book, you will enjoy it very much. Have a great day y'all!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Cussler novel. I had heard such great things about his books but I was sorely disappointed. Sure, the action was great. I love good action. However, the characters were so waaaaay over the top it became truly annoying. Dirk Pitt does everything so perfectly. He never makes mistakes. He is super-human and super-macho. The character is completely unbelievable. The book could have been great had the characters been more \\"down to earth\\"."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Where o where to begin with this horrid waste of ink and paper. God, and I am a Dirk Pitt fan, having read all the novels! If this is your first experience with a Dirk Pitt novel, I ask that you give him another chance and go read &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; or &quot;Treasure&quot;, neither one has the mind numbing amount of inane dialogue and seemingly endless product placement (I thought they just did that in the movies). This book is the literary equivalent of The Mummy Returns, fast paced with no idea of how you got from point A, the beginning to point B, the end. Here is a list of flaws:1. Character Development-NONE2. Overly ridiculous plot3. Dialogue-dear god, there is no excuse for dialogue this bad, if Cussler was an unknown author, this would have been rejected by even a high school paper.There are probably more, but I think my IQ has dropped several points reading this book and I can't quite remember any more.For all you people who gave this book anything over 2 stars, apparently you have never read a good book and have no basis of reference in differentiating between a 'good' book and a 'bad' one."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. I love the Dirk and Al characters and am looking forward to reading the next Cussler book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"After looking for a new book to download on my Kindle Fire, I remembered my husband telling me how much he liked reading the \\"Dirk Pitt\\" series. After only a page or so I was hooked! I am now on my second book and loving it!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler delivers a rollocking ride in this Dirk Pitt tale.

Really enjoyable, even if it's a little hard to suspend your disbelief."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Have read a lot of Cussler's books and enjoyed them all, but this one kept you on the edge of your chair all the way.

The intricate story seems alarmingly real and gives the reader a history lesson without even knowing it. KEEP THEM COMING MR CUSSLER."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I love Clive Cussler. His style of writing makes reading the fast paced adventures fun and exillerating. Atlantis Found is one of his best."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was actually shocked at how well this book was when I first got it, like a previous reviewer said, alot of twists and turns. And the fact that the third Reich, had made it into this century. And is waiting to take over the world, by bringing an ancient prediction to fruition. Was very plausible, we now know, that after WWII, many of the Nazi's were in fact recruited by our Govt to work for us, and many of them dissappeared. Or becoming powerful business people, as shown here in this book. And Cussler brings that vividley to life, particularly with 4 noah's ark type ships. And then the fight for all mankind, up on the north pole. With Pitt and Giordino crashing the party in the original snow cruiser, stopping the count down. They find ruins linked to a possible Atlantis, which is the race of people who predicted the end of the world in the begining of the book. I couldn't put this book down, an excellent read. No it's not poorly written, it's another high octane Dirk Pitt adventure."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first foray into the Clive Cussler series and at first the book was kind of interesting. I do like the occasional Atlantis/ Da Vinci Code kind of books but I was very disappointed towards the end. For anyone not wanting any Spoilers please DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW!!!!!So the thing that ticked me off the most about the second half of the book was that its written as if the readers are kindergartners who will not see the gigantic holes in the story. Here are the things that ticked me off the most -1- The Clive Cussler comes to the rescue part. Apparently this is a theme in all his books but I found it too self indulgent.2 - So they decipher the writings on the walls of the caves that state that the comet is coming back to hit earth. They also seem to believe the Wolfs 'experts' who predict the same. Why oh why then does it take the gream NUMA days and days to verify said fact from an expert? For a few chapters there they all seem to take it like the word of god! Its only when their expert ....Mr Friend tells them that there is no chance of any asteroid / comet hitting earth in the near future that they begin to consider other possibilites!!!!!3 - There is also no explaination given for why the great Amenes thought the comet was coming back to hit earth. They just left that hanging.4- Dirk Pitt and Al in the Snow Criuser.....why the heck didnt he bring a GPS? You are in freakin Antarctica...why would you not have a GPS handy?5- The great Dirk Pitt has no qualms about getting onto a supposed NUMA plane that has apparently just been painted.....and the the pilots refuse to open the cockpit door????? Are you kidding me ? He is supposedly travelling with some very precious cargo and it doesn't occur to him to call up NUMA and see why there was a sudden change in plans? That whole part about the 'hijacked' plane and the arrest was such a waste of time. It was soo not needed in the storyline.I am giving this book 2 stars only because the first half was kind of entertaining. The second half sucked big time however!!!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"THE LOWDOWN: Dirk Pitt, the invincible hero of numerous other adventure novels, returns to do battle with an evil legacy left behind by the Nazis. With plenty of action and a family of diabolical siblings to deal with, the stage is set for Pitt's greatest adventure, yet this book falls a little flat at the end of the day. Not the best, not the worst.THE PLOT: Dirk Pitt narrowly saves a group of archaeologists from a flooding Colorado mine, then from subsequent attempts on their lives by unidentified assassins. Along with archaeologist Patricia O'Connor, Dirk and Al find themselves on the trail of a wealthy family in Argentina descended from the Nazis, the Wolfs, who are planning to activate a \\"polar shift\\"(the same cataclysm that destroyed the prehistoric Atlantean society). Eliminating all artifacts from Atlantis to keep the polar shift plot a secret, Dirk and Al find themselves on the brink of stopping a plot to exterminate the Earth as well as find the world's most infamous lost city.THE PROS: Like Flood Tide, this book is probably one of the longest, with a large-scale world-threatening plot and a bevy of hard-hitting action scenes. One of my favorite scenes involves a vehicle known as the Moller Skycar, which is used to ditch the pursuing Wolfs' battle helicopters. Other action scenes include a U-Boat attack in the Antarctic, Al's use of three machine guns in tandem to take down an enemy helicopter, a wild airplane ride through the streets of Washington DC, a boat chase through the Wolf's harbor, numerous assassination attempts, and an enduring journey across the Ross Ice shelf in a snow vehicle. On a side note, it is refreshing to see Al get the girl for once instead of Dirk.THE CONS: As cool as this story was, it somehow felt a little more hollow than the previous entries, which were admittedly Cussler's best. The Wolfs were a surprisingly boring bunch, considering they were the progeny of the Third Reich. The plot seems a bit disjointed, as if the elements of the story were chosen first (Atlantis, Polar Shift, Neo-Nazis, the Holy Lance, Obsidian Skulls) then had a story crafted to bind the elements together, even if they don't quite fit. For much of the novel we are led to believe that the threat centers on a meteorite, which is such ominous-yet-realistic idea that the villains' \\"real\\" plot seems a bit lame in comparison (if not completely impossible). The idea of Atlantis being a pre-historic civilization that was destroyed in a polar shift stretches both science and history to the very limits of believability."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Once more, I'm left puzzled - why is Clive Cussler a best-selling author? This book has an interesting and inventive plot that weaves together ancient civilizations, modern civilizations, conspiracy theories, Nazis, cataclysms, astronomy, astrophysics, geology, geophysics, geography, linguistics, old technology, new technology, superheroes, superheroines, special operations forces, luxury lifestyles, unbelievability, and staggering inattention to detail - all hallmarks of a Cussler/Pitt product. Unfortunately, that product is just plain dumb. Why does an electric golf cart have an ignition switch? Why does Dirk refer to the Chief of Naval Operations as the \\"naval chief of staff\\" (Clive, I expect better of you)? Then there are the silly mistakes of the good guys that require the usual unrealistic heroics to recover from, the inexplicable actions of the bad guys that let the good guys triumph, and the constant drumbeat of brand names. Where does Cussler make his money - book sales, or product placements? However, even with all that, there are probably worse ways to while away a bit of time. The plot kept me wondering what was going to happen next, and how all the drama and danger would be resolved. If this is one of Clive's best novels, as so many people here believe, I can't even imagine what his worst one might be like."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Uggg.I'll keep this short - Cussler writes as if his primary goal is not to write a book so much as it's to write a movie script. Cussler has great ideas, does a bit of research to add a bit of \\"meat\\" to his plot, but almost all of his books need even more research, an editor's touch, and much less testosterone to make anything plausible.Cussler's books are fine if that's what you like, and it's OK if that's what you're looking for - just be warned that this and most of his books are just an excuse for another screenplay."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Im a new fan of Cusslers. Ive read a few of his books now in a row and this has to be the best. There were some long chapters but overall it kept my interest up until the end."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Cussler book I read, and I was entertained. I almost want to give it a 5 star, but it was just a bit lacking to put it up there. Dont get me wrong, a good book and fun to read. I enjoy the twisting of fact, science and technology, with popular myths, such as Atlantis. The characters are wonderful and easy to picture, and the action is pretty good. If there were a strong plot twist, this would be a 5 star, but it was a little straight forward, especially for a controvisial subject."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Another great Atlantean book I read, which happened to be Dirk Pitt's adventure. As one of my favorite fiction writer of all time, Cussler, managed to put up some muscle into this novel. More like the latter-day version of Indy. Nanotechnology, U-boats, Hitler, Atlantis, Antarctica, Al Giordino, Delta Force, The Third Reich... you name it. It's all in here.Atlantis is the final main battleground for these folks, where these heroes as usual, Pitt and his henchman, Giordion, saved the day again, thwarting their nemesis plan of doomsday prematurely. Though situated in Atlantis, it is only briefly depicted. Thus, this is not a \\"real\\" Atlantis novel.Though the eventual survival of all Cussler's main characters are preditable, I still enjoy being \\"duped\\" by this master story teller. This is fictional stuff, anyway.If you like reading fictions by Clive Cussler and James Rollins, then try reading this novel. A great book, a 5 star novel from a five star writer.Other recommended great Atlantis fictions:1. Raising Atlantis by Thomas Greanias2.
