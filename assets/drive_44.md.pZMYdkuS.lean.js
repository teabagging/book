Faith in Nature traces the history of environmentalism--and its moral thrust--from its roots in the Enlightenment and Romanticism through the Progressive Era to the present. Drawing astonishing parallels between religion and environmentalism, the book examines the passion of the movement s adherents and enemies alike, its concern with the moral conduct of daily life, and its attempt to answer fundamental questions about the underlying order of the world and of humanity s place within it. Thomas Dunlap is among the leading environmental historians and historians of science in the United States. Originally trained as a chemist, he has a rigorous understanding of science and appreciates its vital importance to environmental thought. But he is also a devout Catholic who believes that the insights of religious revelation need not necessarily be at odds with the insights of scientific investigation. This book grew from his own religious journey and his attempts to understand human ethical obligations and spiritual debts to the natural world.

In this ground-breaking book, Nick Timothy, one of Britain s leading conservative thinkers and commentators, explores the powerful forces driving great changes in our economy, society and democracy. Drawing on his experience at the top of government, Timothy traces the crisis of Western democracy back to both the mistaken assumptions of philosophical liberalism and the rise of ideological ultra-liberalism on left, right and centre. Sparing no sacred cows, he proposes a new kind of conservatism that respects personal freedom but also demands solidarity. He argues that only by rediscovering a unifying sense of the common good and restoring a mutual web of responsibilities between all citizens and institutions can we reject the extremes of economic and cultural liberalism, overcome our divisions, and remake one nation. He goes on to outline an ambitious practical plan for change, covering issues ranging from immigration to the regulation of Big Tech. Nick Timothy s original, forensic and thought-provoking analysis is a must-read for anybody tired by the old dogmas of the liberal left, right and centre. It is a major contribution to the debate on the future of conservatism as it grapples with geopolitical shifts, cultural change, and economic uncertainty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uyrfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Control: Overcoming Your Obsessions and Compulsions","description":"Thoroughly revised and updated the go-to book for OCD sufferers who want to master their fears and take charge of their lives The first comprehensive guide to treating obsessive compulsive disorder based on clinically proven behavioral therapy techniques, Dr. Lee Baer s Getting Control has been providing OCD sufferers with information and relief for more than twenty years.

But what was driving that decades rampant pursuit of individual pleasure? What were the cultural forces behind Madonna s  Material Girl  and Oliver Stone s Wall Street? These fascinating essays, collected by historian Gilbert T. Sewall from the major books, journals, news reports, and public addresses of the day, survey the tumultuous social change that engulfed the nation--and explain why we are still feeling the aftershocks today.With contributions by such diverse figures as Chistopher Lasch, Lewis H. Lapham, Eric Bogosian, and Hilton Kramer, The Eighties touches on the hallmarks of the age: celebrity culture and hype, exhibitionism and shamelessness, academic ferment, and the lure of money. Kennedy Fraser on the new trend machine. James Q. Wilson on attitudes toward crime, Shelby Steele on African American angst, Tom Wolfe on art objects as religious totems--this lively reader brings together, for the first time, the voices that defined an era.As Sewall so deftly tells it, the story of the 1980s is not merely one of politics or financial chicanery--although both get their due in the book. The 1980s were an era of disquieting attitudes, fantasies, and dreams. As Americans experienced new forms of social anxiety and spiritual crisis, the debate over what constitutes excellence in the arts and in education touched off the so-called culture wars. All of this is evident in the rise of identity politics as well as in films like The Big Chill and feel-good democratic displays of international activism like Live Aid, in the overnight sensation of cocaine-fueled, star-studded nightclubs like New York City s Limelight, in the flamboyant mood of hit television shows like Dynasty and Dallas, and in the success of The Closing of the American Mind, Allan Bloom s staunch defense of Western tradition.Invigorated conservatism in politics and society was, paradoxically, accompanied by the ascent of a new establishment of  tenured radicals,  for whom alternative values and cultural innovation supported lucrative careers. Finally empowered to make the social and political changes they had only dreamed about in earlier decades, these boomers stimulated an acrimonious debate over the nature of the good life and the soul of the nation.With remarkable verve, The Eighties sheds new light on the decade that brought us Ronald Reagan and MTV, a decade that continues to frame some of today s most vexing political, economic, and cultural debates","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xKvZAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Eighties:+A+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1001 Free Goodies and Cheapies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F2eRNAEACAAJ&dq=1001+Free+Goodies+and+Cheapies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Official Kubotan techniques","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The best home businesses for the 90s: The inside information you need to know to select a home-based business that's right for you","description":"Gives information on seventy moneymaking home-based businesses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_Sn9MLx0ohQC&dq=The+best+home+businesses+for+the+90s:+The+inside+information+you+need+to+know+to+select+a+home-based+business+that%27s+right+for+you&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let Me Tell You About Jerks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vhm6PAAACAAJ&dq=Let+Me+Tell+You+About+Jerks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","description":"In the little Polish town of Goray, ravaged by a terrible pogrom, expectations of the 'End of Days' foretold by cabalists run high.

Heisman's reflective, scholarly exploration of the symbolism in the ritual of Freemasonry for Freemasons and non-Masons alike. While there is much to discover about the meaning of the hallmark Masonic symbols, there is nothing secret about Freemasonry's defining love for humanity. What Masonic symbols do reveal about the guiding purpose of a Masonic lodge is brought to light in Meditations on Masonic Symbolism, Master Mason John R. Heisman's reflective exploration of the symbolism in the ritual of Freemasonry that reveals how they illuminate ancient knowledge about mankind's relationship to God. A compilation of articles written for the author's Masonic Lodge, Blackmer Lodge No. 442, in his year as Master, Meditations on Masonic Symbolism sheds fascinating new light on Freemasonry for Freemasons and non-Masons alike about the workings of this worldwide and ancient fraternity. Often described as a secret society, owing to its use of certain symbols, the essays in Heisman's book help demystify Freemasonry for those who are interested in a deeper understanding of its mission. For instance, a variety of charities that are supported by Freemasonry and its millions of men and women are well known and easily recognizable. Children's hospitals are operated by Shriners throughout the world. Speech therapy centers, educational grants, eye care foundations, and homes for the aged are funded and operated by Scottish Rite Masons, Knights Templar, and Grand Lodges everywhere they are situated. Heisman's book explains Freemasonry as a fraternal organization with many groups, several of which are designed for boys and girls. All Masonic organizations have a charity and are devoted to the ideals of brotherly love, relief, and truth. Scholarly and philosophical, Meditations on Masonic Symbolism provides insight on recognizable Masonic symbols, such as the square and compass. From the significance of beauty in its architecture to the pillar of wisdom, each essay in this thoughtful collection reveals in detail the significance of the symbols and how they come together in this intricate and long contemplated belief system. In clear, accessible language, the book explains all manner of Freemasonry principles, including harmony, knowledge, brotherhood, unity, and more. While the rituals of the organization may only be attended by Freemasons, its lessons may be studied by anyone interested in subjects such as philosophy, comparative religion, liberal arts, and geometry. Meditations on Masonic Symbolism is a thought-provoking, elegant addition to any well-rounded library.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=41KsngEACAAJ&dq=Masonic+symbolism,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Around the world in 2000 pictures","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hPUbngEACAAJ&dq=Around+the+world+in+2000+pictures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Softball Coaching Bible (The Coaching Bible Series)","description":"In The Softball Coaching Bible, Volume II, the NFCA has assembled a stellar lineup of coaches who share the insights that have helped them establish successful programs.

In 1912 the British colonial authorities earmarked the Giriama as a key source of labor for the plantations Europeans were trying to develop along the coast. The Giriama, prosperous producers and traders, could not become wage laborers and maintain their successful economy, and the British demands upon this scattered people therefore were spontaneously rejected. Increased pressure increased Giriama recalcitrance. Finally, military action brought defeat to the Giriama, whose only weapons were bows and arrows and whose decentralization prevented coordinated resistance. They lost their best lands, paid a heavy fine, and had to contribute a thousand laborers to the Carrier Corps. But the British costs were also heavy. The coastal plantations failed, few Giriama ever became wage laborers, and the entire area became depressed economically. Cynthia Brantley explores the precolonial Giriama's political and economic system and their dynamic trade relationship with the coast of Kenya in an effort to explain why the Giriama were so determined in their resistance to British pressure. She shows that even when the political and social structures of a people seem weak, it is unlikely that the population will submit to changes that undermine the economy. Moreover, their very lack of a centralized political or religious organization made the imposition of foreign administration extremely difficult. The British won the war, but their victory was hollow.

Noise and its acceptance as music was the product of the resulting spiritual confusion and, in its turn, became the further cause of its spread. Likewise, the recovery of modern music, the theme to which this book is dedicated, stems from a spiritual recovery. This is made explicitly clear by the composers whose interviews with the author are collected in this book. Robert Reilly spells out the nature of the crisis and its solution in sections that serve as bookends to the chapters on individual composers. He does not contend that all of these composers underwent and recovered from the central crisis he describes, but they all lived and worked within its broader context, and soldiered on, writing beautiful music. For this, they suffered ridicule and neglect, and he believes their rehabilitation will change the reputation of modern music. It is the spirit of music that this book is most about, and in his efforts to discern it, Reilly has discovered many treasures. The purpose of this book is to share them, to entice you to listen because beauty is contagious. English conductor John Eliot Gardiner writes that experiencing Bach's masterpieces \\"is a way of fully realizing the scale and scope of what it is to be human\\".

The Luftwaffe used many aircraft in the nightfighter role, primarily to combat RAF Bomber Command's nocturnal heavy bombing raids against German targets from 1940/1 onwards and a 'cat and mouse' development of aircraft enhancement, weapons, guidance systems and radar took place. The book contains a wide variety of aircraft. This volume, for example, concentrates on the single-seat Me109 fighter adapted as a nightfighter, early versions of the Me110 and the Ju88. The text will be accompanied by a wide range of photographs - many being published for the first time - together with the usual colour profiles, biographies of top nightfighter aces such as Falck, Schnaufer, Lent, Jabs and others. Furthermore, there will be pilot accounts and text boxes offering details of the Schrage Musik upward-firing, FuG202 Lichtenstein and SN-2 radar sets, etc.With the great importance attached by the Royal Air Force to its nocturnal bombing raids, the importance to the defence of Germany of the nightfighter squadrons cannot be overstated. This volume and its companion will provide the modeller and historian with a detailed examination of the Nachtjager forces deployed by the Luftwaffe during the war and will be required reading for all interested in the subject of the nightly battles over the skies of the Reich during World War 2.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gHGKGAAACAAJ&dq=Nachtjager,+Volume+One:+Luftwaffe+Night+Fighter+Units+1939-1943+(Luftwaffe+Colours)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadow Woman: A Jane Whitefield Novel","description":"In her latest adventure, Jane Whitefield, who helps people in trouble disappear from one life and establish a new identity, is hired by a Las Vegas gambling casino executive running from contract killers.

The Peterkin Papers collects all of Lucretia Hale s beloved tales of a thoroughly silly family. The Peterkin Papers record the antics of the most memorably and hopelessly bumbling of respectable American families. Confronted by the endless challenges of daily life, the Peterkins rise to every occasion with misguided aplomb: they sit out in the sun for hours and fail to go for a ride because they ve forgotten to unhitch the horse, they play the piano from the porch through the parlor window because the movers left the keyboard turned that way, they decide to raise the ceiling to accommodate a too-tall Christmas tree. Only the timely intervention of their great and good friend, the Lady from Philadelphia, can be counted on to get the Peterkins out of their latest scrape. A classic of American children s literature and a masterpiece of deadpan drollery, The Peterkin Papers restore our astonishment at the ordinary, finding a rich vein of humor and happy surprise in the mere fact of our surviving the trivialities and tribulations of family life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MhpOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Peterkin+Papers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ben Shahn's New York: The Photography of Modern Times","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"More Than the Sum of His Parts (Short Story Paperback 14)","description":"James Nagel offers the first systematic history and definition of the short-story cycle as exemplified in contemporary American fiction, bringing attention to the format's wide appeal among various ethnic groups.

For the past two thousand years, the philosophy of law has been dominated by two rival doctrines. One contends that law is more than politics and yields, in the hands of skillful judges, correct answers to even the most difficult legal questions; the other contends that law is politics through and through and that judges wield essentially arbitrary powers. Rejecting these doctrines as too metaphysical in the first instance and too nihilistic in the second, Richard Posner argues for a pragmatic jurisprudence, one that eschews formalism in favor of the factual and the empirical. Laws, he argues, are not abstract, sacred entities, but socially determined goads for shaping behavior to conform with society s values. Examining how judges go about making difficult decisions, Posner argues that they cannot rely on either logic or science, but must fall back on a grab bag of informal methods of reasoning that owe less than one might think to legal training and experience. Indeed, he reminds us, the greatest figures in American law have transcended the traditional conceptions of the lawyer s craft. Robert Jackson did not attend law school and Benjamin Cardozo left before getting a degree. Holmes was neither the most successful of lawyers nor the most lawyerly of judges. Citing these examples, Posner makes a plea for a law that frees itself from excessive insularity and takes all knowledge, practical and theoretical, as grist for its mill. The pragmatism that Posner espouses implies looking at problems concretely, experimentally, without illusions, with an emphasis on keeping diverse paths of inquiry open, and, above all, with the insistence that social thought and action be evaluated as instruments to desired human goals rather than as ends in themselves. In making his arguments, he discusses notable figures in jurisprudence from Antigone to Ronald Dworkin as well as recent movements ranging from law and economics to civic republicanism, and feminism to libertarianism. All are subjected to Posner s stringent analysis in a fresh and candid examination of some of the deepest problems presented by the enterprise of law.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cWn9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managerial Economics","description":"Discover how to use managerial economics to both diagnose and solve business problems with this breakthrough text, designed specifically for MBA learners like you.

Each speaker in the Bioethics & Public Policy Seminar Series was invited because of her or his expertise in a given area of bioethics. Each of the more successful participants was invited to contribute a manuscript for publication. The essays are bound together by the application of an ethical analysis to scientific questions, and by consideration of policy implications. At its inception, bioethics was virtually synonymous with medical ethics. As the field grew and attracted new practitioners, it became clear that other applications of this new subject required extension of its scope. For example, environmental ethics, propelled by such authors as Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson, quickly developed a vigorous literature of its own. More recently, developments in the analysis of the human genome, the enticing medical possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of stem cells, the complexities surrounding the cloning of animals and possibly humans and the development of transgenic agricultural crops have given new impetus to the expansion of traditional bioethical horizons. Bioethics must now adjust to these new realities, for it is clear that public interest in the field is growing as these new challenges appear.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qFBgL8b4_JgC&dq=Expanding+Horizons+(Penguin+Academics+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"(Photography) Cut With the Kitchen Knife: The Weimar Photomontages of Hannah Hoch","description":"The women of Weimar Germany had an uneasy alliance with modernity: while they experienced cultural liberation after World War I, these New Women still faced restrictions in their earning power, political participation, and reproductive freedom.

Numerous companies have already found that employees who are informed and aware of the company's financial situation are motivated to seek solutions to problems and assume a greater degree of responsibility for its performance. John Case begins by examining the current competitive climate and the history of established management techniques. He shows how the traditional treatment of workers as \\"hired hands\\" with little involvement or responsibility beyond their own area is no longer effective in today's ever more competitive global environment. Case clearly and carefully explains the principles of open-book management: timely sharing of crucial financial information with employees; educating the employees to understand and apply the information; empowering employees to apply the information to their own work; and offering employees a stake in the successful implementation of their ideas. Open-book management will take different forms at every company, Case notes, but he offers a wide range of suggestions and guidelines for implementing these principles. He concludes with a series of in-depth case studies, featuring companies of various sizes and financial situations that have successfully implemented open-book management. Open-Book Management is the indispensable guide to teaching employees how to think and act like owners.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EuVDeepb1roC&dq=Open-Book+Management:+Coming+Business+Revolution,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catherine of Aragon,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Landmarks in the Landscape: Historic Architecture in the National Parks of the West","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NepUkgEACAAJ&dq=Landmarks+in+the+Landscape:+Historic+Architecture+in+the+National+Parks+of+the+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rough Cut","description":"<p>In the movie industry, the rough cut is defined as the raw, first edition of a movie, which provides an idea of what the finished product will look like, giving indications of where it has problems and where it excels. </p> <p>Much like a rough cut movie, Rough Cut Men are not the  finished product .

And in the three years since that fateful day, he has come to a sobering realization: Our once-noble news media -- and network TV news in particular -- have abdicated their responsibility to the American people, and endangered us in the process. As Fenton points out, much of the United States still depends on the networks for most of its information about the world. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, the networks gutted their news-gathering operations -- just as the old Cold War status quo was shattering -- leaving behind an unstable and violent new world order. Once a public service, the network news was commandeered by its corporate parents as a cash cow. In-depth reporting on critical issues was replaced with saturation coverage of sensationalistic crime stories and simpleminded \\"news you can use.\\" Even as genocide spread through Africa -- and Islamic terror festered in the Middle East -- international reporting disappeared almost entirely from the airwaves. And Americans were left uninformed, unable to judge the accuracy of politically biased stories (on both sides of the spectrum), and utterly unprepared for the war on terror about to descend on their doorstep. In Bad News, Tom Fenton offers a fiery indictment of just how far \\"the news\\" has fallen. As a frequent voice in the wilderness himself -- who fought in vain to interest CBS in an Osama bin Laden interview in the 1990s -- Fenton reveals a news-gathering environment gutted by corporate bottom-lining bottom-feeders, staffed by dilatory producers and executives (who dismissed important stories as depressing or obscure), and dangerously dependent on images and information gathered by third-party sources. In hard-hitting interviews with Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, and Tom Brokaw, he exposes how even the anchors themselves believed they were outlandishly compensated -- while quality coverage was being slashed. And he charges that the news media must lose its entertainment-industry mindset and reestablish its role as a keeper of the public trust. \\"This is not just a book,\\" writes Fenton. \\"This is the beginning of a campaign to galvanize America. We need more and better news. Our lives depend on it.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tCr1wAEACAAJ&dq=Bad+News:+The+Decline+of+Reporting,+the+Business+of+News,+and+the+Danger+to+Us+All&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becoming the Dance: Flamenco Spirit","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zVm-AAAACAAJ&dq=Becoming+the+Dance:+Flamenco+Spirit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literacy and Young Children: Research-Based Practices","description":"One of two parents' guides based on the revised National Curriculum, this book is intended as an introduction to Key Stages 1 and 2.

He explained that this did not mean the end of the German people but did mean the total destruction of Nazism. Despite the overwhelming superiority of the Allied armed forces, Hitler's \\"Third Reich\\" fought on for more than two years, its towns and villages defended in the end partly by old men and young boys of the Volkssturm. With defeat imminent, efforts were even made to prolong resistance to the Allies by forming so-called Werwolf units to conduct guerilla warfare. This book charts the military defeat of Germany in 1944 and 1945, and goes on to explore how the Allies tried after the German surrender to destroy Nazism and all it stood for .It highlights the appalling conditions in Germany after the war, and details how the Allies abolished the Nazi Party and sought to punish its leaders at Nuremberg. It also examines the wider process of denazification the removal of former Nazis from public life, and the elimination of Nazi ideas and influences from education, the media, and the arts. Inevitably this caused much friction between wartime Allies and the now occupied German population, a situation made worse by cold, hunger, psychological trauma, and the desperate resistance of remaining Nazi fanatics. This book balances the viewpoints of occupiers and Germans in its analysis of how the Third Reich was defeated and its social system dismantled. This book presents the first major account of how Germany was dealt with at the end of World War II by the Allies. Policy lessons learned here have been applied by the Americans in Iraq.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l_ckAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+end+of+the+Third+Reich&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tangled Destinies","description":"Passion and danger collide in a breathless story from New York Times bestselling author Diana Palmer.

These are: the need to maintain energy security in an energy-hungry world, the desire to move towards zero-emission vehicles and power plants, and the mitigation of climate change by lowering of CO2 emissions. New fuel cell materials, enhanced stack performance and increased lifetimes are leading to the emergence of the first truly commercial systems in applications that range from fork-lift trucks to power sources for mobile phone towers. Leading vehicle manufacturers have embraced the use of electric drive-trains and now see hydrogen fuel cells complementing advanced battery technology in zero-emission vehicles. After many decades of laboratory development, a global but fragile fuel cell industry is bringing the first commercial products to market. This thoroughly revised edition includes several new sections devoted to, for example, fuel cell characterisation, improved materials for low-temperature hydrogen and liquid-fuelled systems, and real-world technology implementation. Assuming no prior knowledge of fuel cell technology, the third edition comprehensively brings together all of the key topics encompassed in this diverse field. Practitioners, researchers and students in electrical, power, chemical and automotive engineering will continue to benefit from this essential guide to the principles, design and implementation of fuel cell systems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CuhRDwAAQBAJ&dq=FUEL+CELL+SYSTEMS+EXPLAINED&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Civil Mind","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Amphetamine Manifesto","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G_DywAEACAAJ&dq=The+Amphetamine+Manifesto&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly (Psy) (Encyclopedia of Psychological Disorders)","description":"Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based communication style that has applicability to diverse professions ranging from mental and physical healthcare to criminal justice. Professionals use MI to help patients/clients harness their own internal motivations for change and become active partners in developing plans for change. Using MI, a professional can guide patients/clients to make positive changes in life areas such as substance abuse, criminal activity, anxiety and mood problems, poor cardiovascular health, and more. Fundamentals of Motivational Interviewing provides a straightforward, common-language, and user-friendly guide to key concepts in MI. The clinical challenges addressed are ubiquitous across helping professions, and this book is unique in its focus on providing practical guidance on what to do when confronted with each challenge. Based on the authors' years of experience providing training and supervision in MI, this book answers one of the questions most frequently asked by those they have trained: \\"How can I use MI to address [insert clinical challenge]?\\" Fundamentals of Motivational Interviewing is an accessible and easy-to-use resource organized and written with the busy provider in mind. It is appropriate for all skill levels ranging from the MI novice with no prior training, to the experienced MI provider seeking to gain new knowledge and skills. Throughout the book the authors use boxes and case examples to clearly illustrate and emphasize key points. The authors also provide clear examples of the sometimes subtle distinction between MI-consistent and MI-inconsistent use of the communication skills and strategies.

For, as he argues, no politician in America today is better aligned to become president in 2008 and none would bring more baggage to the White House than Mrs. Clinton. In Rewriting History, Morris draws on his own long working relationship with the Clintons, as well as his trademark deep research and candid, nonpartisan analysis, to create a rebuttal to Hillary's bestselling autobiography, Living History. Morris documents how Hillary hides her true self behind a \\"Hillary\\" brand that is chatty, charming, giggly, and warm but is far from her true personality. In Rewriting History, Morris pierces the mask to get at the truth behind the distortions and omissions of Hillary's memoir. Here we meet the real Hillary, both good and bad: the manager who makes the trains run on time, but also the paranoid who sees all those who disagree with her as personal enemies; the idealist, but also the \\"advice addict\\" easily misled by the guru of the moment. Morris describes Hillary's sense of entitlement, and warns that it may lead deep into financial scandal. And he demonstrates how Hillary dodges criticism by pretending that every attack is directed not just at her, but at every working woman in America. Ultimately, Morris argues, the Hillary Clinton of today is marketing a false front, obscuring both her wants and her assets behind the phony facade of a domestic Everywoman. But as she pursues higher office, she also faces a choice. Will she, like Bobby Kennedy, see the error of her ruthless ways, and embrace the sincere idealism she professes? Or, like Richard Nixon, will she allow the darker angels of her nature to overcome her, jeopardizing herself and the country in the process? As Rewriting History suggests, we can only hope that Hillary Clinton's past performance is no guarantee of future results.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=peYHWky9cWgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tumultuous Years - Presidency Of Harry S.

In between he lived through two world wars, and a depression that shook the foundations of American capitalism. Walter Lippmann (1889-1974) has been hailed as the greatest journalist of his age. For more than sixty years he exerted unprecedented influence on American public opinion through his writing, especially his famous newspaper column \\"Today and Tomorrow.\\" Beginning with The New Republic in the halcyon days prior to Woodrow Wilson and the First World War, millions of Americans gradually came to rely on Lippmann to comprehend the vital issues of the day. In this absorbing biography, Ronald Steel meticulously documents the philosophers and politics, the friendships and quarrels, the trials and triumphs of this man who for six decades stood at the center of American political life. Lippmann's experience spanned a period when the American empire was born, matured, and began to wane, a time some have called \\"the American Century.\\" No one better captured its possibilities and wrote about them so wisely and so well, no one was more the mind, the voice, and the conscience of that era than Walter Lippmann: journalist, moralist, public philosopher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xHn1mgEACAAJ&dq=Walter+Lippmann+and+the+American+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introducing Microsoft Windows Vista","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cIARkAEACAAJ&dq=Introducing+Microsoft+Windows+Vista&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poopsie Pomeranz, Pick Up Your Feet","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZSKjzgEACAAJ&dq=Poopsie+Pomeranz,+Pick+Up+Your+Feet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Delicious Grace of Moving One's Hand: Intelligence is the Ultimate Aphrodisiac","description":"Provides essays, anecdotes, interviews, and lectures on the link between sexuality and the mind and the author's view of the social and psychological attitudes about sex in the United States","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fmx2QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Delicious+Grace+of+Moving+One%27s+Hand:+Intelligence+is+the+Ultimate+Aphrodisiac&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Year to Live: How to Live This Year As If It Were Your Last (Thorndike Press Large Print Inspirational Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","description":"A guide to plastic and cosmetic surgery provides information on choosing a surgeon, what to expect at a consultation, fees, location of the surgery, and aftercare, and includes commentary by patients and before and after photographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n9tTHnRGZn4C&dq=Secrets+of+a+Beverly+Hills+Cosmetic+Surgeon:+The+Expert%27s+Guide+to+Safe,+Successful+Surgery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chanticleer and the Fox","description":"King of the barnyard, Chanticleer struts about all day.

Every company lives on it; no manager can control it. In the original edition of Living on the Fault Line, Geoffrey Moore presented a compelling argument for using shareholder value (or share price) as the key driver in management decisions. Moore now revisits his argument in the post-Internet bubble world, proving that the methods he espouses are more germane than ever and showing companies how to use them to survive and thrive in today's demanding economy. Extending the themes of Crossing the Chasm and Inside the Tornado, his first two books on the dynamics of the high-tech markets, Moore shows why sensitivity to stock price is the single most important lever for managing in the future, both as a leading indicator of shifts in competitive advantage and as an employee motivator for making necessary changes in organizations heretofore impervious to change. This revised and updated edition includes: A deeper emphasis on core versus context, which has emerged as the key distinction in allocating resources to improve shareholder value A new Competitive Advantage Grid that will aid managers in achieving and sustaining competitive advantage, the most important component in managing for shareholder value An expanded Value Discipline Model as it relates to the Competitive Advantage Grid Analysis of the powerful new trend toward core/context analysis and outsourcing production duties Updated models of organizational change for each stage of market development As disruptive forces continue to buffet the marketplace and rattle the staid practices of the past, Moore offers a brilliant set of navigational tools to help meet today's most compelling management challenges.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7oPEax4IKlQC&dq=Living+on+the+Fault+Line,+Revised+Edition+:+Managing+for+Shareholder+Value+in+Any+Economy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grimace of Macho Raton: Artisans, Identity, and Nation in Late-Twentieth-Century Western Nicaragua","description":"An ethnographic account of indigenous artisans in Nicaragua and the complex ways they have understood and constructed their own identity from the period of the Sandanistas to the present.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4LSEAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The English Revolution 1688-1689","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MTMJAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+English+Revolution+1688-1689&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JUGGLING : FROM START TO STAR","description":"A book on juggling that is comprehensive and clear, understandable for beginners yet challenging for experienced jugglers.

The Luftwaffe used many aircraft in the nightfighter role, primarily to combat RAF Bomber Command's nocturnal heavy bombing raids against German targets from 1940/1 onwards. Both sides engaged in a 'cat and mouse' development of aircraft enhancement, weapons, guidance systems and radar. In this volume, the later versions of the Ju88G, Fw 190 'Wild Sau', Do 217, Me 262, Ta 154 and others are examined in depth. The text is accompanied by a wide range of photographs, many of which are published here for the first time, together with color profiles and biographies of top nightfighter aces. This volume and its predecessor, published in July 2005, will provide the modeler and historian with a detailed examination of the Nachtjager forces deployed by the Luftwaffe during the war and will be required reading for all interested in the subject of the nightly battles over the skies of the Reich during the conflict.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OB-hAAAACAAJ&dq=Nachtjager,+Volume+Two:+Luftwaffe+Night+Fighter+Units+1943-1945+(Luftwaffe+Colours)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"KitchenAid Mixers and Attachments: Recipes and Instructions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A7_OzgEACAAJ&dq=KitchenAid+Mixers+and+Attachments:+Recipes+and+Instructions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ISLAND INTERLUDE","description":"When Sambrea Sinclair discovers that Craig Caldwell is after her late father's yachting company, she finds herself unable to fight him, and, tormented by painful memories, finds solace in his arms.

The implications of this argument are highly significant. If this is the case, methods are always political, and it raises the question of what kinds of social realities we want to create. Most current methods look for clarity and precision. It is usually said that only poor research produces messy findings, and the idea that things in the world might be fluid, elusive, or multiple is unthinkable. Law's startling argument is that this is wrong and it is time for a new approach. Many realities, he says, are vague and ephemeral. If methods want to know and help to shape the world, then they need to reinvent themselves and their politics to deal with mess. That is the challenge.

That assignment led to his selection as Forest Service chief during the early years of the Clinton administration. It is history?s good fortune that Thomas kept journals of his thoughts and daily experiences, and that he is a superb writer able to capture the moment with clarity and grace. The issues Thomas dealt with in office and noted in his journals lie at the heart of recent Forest Service policy and controversy, starting with President Clinton?s Timber Summit in Portland, Oregon, dealing with the spotted owl issue, and the 1994 loss of fourteen firefighters in the Storm King Mountain fire in Colorado. Against a constant backdrop of partisan politics in the White House and Congress, Thomas discusses issues ranging from grazing in the national forests, long-term pulp timber sales in Alaska, and the Forest Service Law Enforcement Division to the New World Mine near Yellowstone National Park. He considers the timber salvage rider and its linkage to forest health, the Department of Justice and Counsel on Environmental Quality influence on Forest Service policies, and interagency management for the Columbia River Basin. Woven throughout these excerpts from his diary is Thomas?s conviction that the effective, ethical management of wildlife depends on how the management effort is situated within the broader human context, with all its intransigence and unpredictability. Writing in 1995, Thomas says, \\"Things simply don?t work the way that students are taught in natural resources policy classes--not even close. . . .There is simply no way that scholars of the subject can understand the ad hoc processes that go on within only loosely defined boundaries.? Wildlife management, he says, is \\"90 percent about people and 10 percent about animals,\\" and when it comes to learning about people, wildlife managers are on their own. This book is the record of how one man met that challenge.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=idYHCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awake (New Poets of America)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XABbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Awake+(New+Poets+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Guide to Computers: 27th Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ER6B0I9ralMC&dq=The+Secret+Guide+to+Computers:+27th+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amazon: Including the Gran Sabana and the Pantanal (Cadogan Guides)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Student Study Guide Part 1 for Calculus","description":"Developed in response to the calculus reform movement, this problem-driven text features exceptional exercises directed toward students in the management, life and social sciences.

Human time-travelers from the sophisticated Galactic Milieu of the twenty-second century came to the Pliocene Epoch seeking a Garden of Eden. What they found was slavery under the knightly Tanu race, who had been exiled to Earth from a far galaxy. Freed by the usurper Aiken Drum, the humans enjoy a brief period of dominance. But now King Aiken's rule is threatened by the dwarfish Firvulag, who scheme to destroy both humans and Tanu in an ultimate Gotterdammerung. This menace becomes almost incidental when Aiken discovers that his realm is about to be invaded by another human who possesses psychic powers even greater than his own. Marc Remillard, the instigator of the Metapsychic Rebellion, nearly conquered the Galactic Milieu before escaping through the time-portal after his defeat. Marc and his followers are out to overthrow Aiken just as a new time-gate is about to be built one that will provide a two-way portal between the Many-Colored Land and the future world of the Milieu. The Adversary brings Julian May s Locus Award-winning series which also includes The Many-Colored Land, The Golden Tore, and The Nonborn King to a rousing climax.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WzySmtOS4-UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All-Night Party (Fear Street, No. 43)","description":"Planning an all-night birthday party for Cindy on Fear Island, Gretchen Davies anticipates dancing, love, and non-stop fun, until Cindy is murdered, and Gretchen realizes that one of her friends is the killer.

A celebration of beauty across the generations, this positive-outlook guide for women of all ages reflects, as Bobbi says, \\"What happens to us as we make our way through life, and how we can continue making ourselves better.\\" In Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution, Bobbi shares her candid views of her own beauty odyssey, as well as her formidable makeup expertise, to help women feel good about themselves at every age. Readers from their twenties to their seventies and beyond will experience a new appreciation of themselves through Bobbi's enriching book, and ultimately, even embrace -- yes, embrace -- the aging process. In the engaging, down-to-earth style that's pure Bobbi, she addresses the need-to-know issues we all face at one time or another -- from how to deal with changes in skin to what adjustments in makeup application are really necessary (and appropriate) as we age and everything in between. With more than 300 photographs specially commissioned for this book, Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution includes the personal, heartfelt thoughts of real women from all walks of life -- all ages (from 20 to 101!), shapes, sizes, and ethnicities -- reflecting on what beauty means to them.

In Abravanel, B. Netanyahu suggests, two long lines of tradition met and concluded: that of medieval Jewish statesmen and that of medieval Jewish philosophers. In what is both a biography and an exploration of Abravanel's thought and influence, Netanyahu describes how Abravanel illuminated the grave crisis and profound transformation experienced by the Jewish people after the Spanish expulsion.

One goal of modern computer science is to engineer computer programs that can act as autonomous, rational agents; software that can independently make good decisions about what actions to perform on our behalf and execute those actions. Applications range from small programs that intelligently search the Web buying and selling goods via electronic commerce, to autonomous space probes. This book focuses on the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model of rational agents, which recognizes the primacy of beliefs, desires, and intentions in rational action. The BDI model has three distinct strengths: an underlying philosophy based on practical reasoning in humans, a software architecture that is implementable in real systems, and a family of logics that support a formal theory of rational agency.The book introduces a BDI logic called LORA (Logic of Rational Agents). In addition to the BDI component, LORA contains a temporal component, which allows one to represent the dynamics of how agents and their environments change over time, and an action component, which allows one to represent the actions that agents perform and the effects of the actions. The book shows how LORA can be used to capture many components of a theory of rational agency, including such notions as communication and cooperation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jgvFwgzHjR8C&dq=Reasoning+about+Rational+Agents+(Intelligent+Robotics+and+Autonomous+Agents)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fat Cat on a Mat (Usborne Easy Words to Read)","description":"This is a story about Ted.

Tim Flannery s The Weather Makers contributed in bringing the topic of global warming to worldwide prominence. For the first time, a scientist provided an accessible and comprehensive account of the history, current status, and future impact of climate change, writing what has been acclaimed by reviewers everywhere as the definitive book on global warming. With one out of every five living things on this planet committed to extinction by the levels of greenhouse gases that will accumulate in the next few decades, we are reaching a global climatic tipping point. The Weather Makers is both an urgent warning and a call to arms, outlining the history of climate change, how it will unfold over the next century, and what we can do to prevent a cataclysmic future. Originally somewhat of a global warming skeptic, Tim Flannery spent several years researching the topic and offers a connect-the-dots approach for a reading public who has received patchy or misleading information on the subject. Pulling on his expertise as a scientist to discuss climate change from a historical perspective, Flannery also explains how climate change is interconnected across the planet.

It focuses on Chicago, and that city's affordable housing crisis, but it provides analytical frameworks that can be applied to developments in every American city. \\"Where Are Poor People to Live?\\" provides valuable new empirical information on public housing, framed by a critical perspective that shows how shifts in national policy have devolved the U.S. welfare state to local government, while promoting market-based action as the preferred mode of public policy execution. The editors and chapter authors share a concern that proponents of public housing restructuring give little attention to the social, political, and economic risks involved in the current campaign to remake public housing. At the same time, the book examines the public housing redevelopment process in Chicago, with an eye to identifying opportunities for redeveloping projects and building new communities across America that will be truly hospitable to those most in need of assisted housing. While the focus is on affordable housing, the issues addressed here cut across the broad policy areas of housing and community development, and will impact the entire field of urban politics and planning.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r2isBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The myth of Christian beginnings","description":"In this challenging and vividly written book Dr. Wilken shows that there never was a golden age in the Christian past. Christian hope did not come to fulfillment in the age of apostles, nor in the time of Constantine, nor in the Middle Ages, nor during the Reformation, nor in the revivals of the 19th century, nor in the movements of renewal in our own time. The history of Christianity is a story of imperfection and fragmentation, but also a history of hoping and striving for an end that cannot be seen yet bears on the present. With lively examples from the Christian past Wilken shows that change has been an abiding feature of Christian tradition. Often those who proposed new ways of thinking and acted in unexpected ways turned out to be more faithful than those who repeated the old formulas. As much as the past may give specificity and concreteness to renewal in the present Christian hope is set on things that are yet to be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jkL7DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+myth+of+Christian+beginnings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cruz / Ortiz","description":"Among the most prominent of a new generation of Spanish architects, this Seville-based team has transformed the practice of architecture with the theory that \\"a building should explain itself.\\" Through a language of industrial materials, Antonio Cruz and Antonio Ortiz demonstrate their technological prowess while at the same time creating simple geometries expressive of a spare modernism.

And tensions are likely to increase. That makes it all the more important to identify sources of such tension. The present book sees as one such source the claim to absoluteness made historically by Christianity and today particularly by 'fundamentalist' Christian movements and conservative Catholicism. After surveying the characteristics of Christian 'absolutism' and its psychological and sociological roots, the author begins by tracing its history: in reactions to Judaism and Hellenistic syncretism, evident already in the New Testament; in the rise of Christianity to become a state religion; and in the response to Islam represented by the Crusades. Next he looks at the important questions asked about the absoluteness of Christianity in the nineteenth century, and the development of greater openness, after which he investigates the way in which non-Christian faiths like Judaism and Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism view their relationship to other religions. His conclusion is that Christian faith not only allows but indeed requires an abandonment of claims to absoluteness, and dialogue with those of other beliefs.

A political titan for thirty-three years (1815-1848), Andrew Jackson possessed character, beliefs, and acts that dominated American politics. Although Jackson returned to his Tennessee plantation in March 1837 after serving eight years as president, he continued to overshadow American politics. Two of his proteges, Martin \\"the Magician\\" van Buren and James \\"Young Hickory\\" Polk, followed him to the White House and pursued his agenda. Jackson provoked firestorms of political passions throughout his era. Far more people loved than hated him, but the fervor was just as pitched either way. Although the passions have subsided, the debate lingers. Historians are split over Jackson's legacy. Some extol him as among America's greatest presidents, citing his championing of the common man, holding the country together during the nullification crisis, and eliminating the national debt. Others excoriate him as a mean-spirited despot who shredded the Constitution and damaged the nation's development by destroying the Second Bank of the United States, defying the Supreme Court, and grossly worsening political corruption through his spoils system. Still others condemn his forcibly expelling more than forty thousand Native Americans from their homes and along the Trail of Tears, which led far west of the Mississippi River, with thousands perishing along the way. In his clear-eyed assessment of one of the most divisive leaders in American history, Nester provides new insight into the age-old debate about the very nature of power itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AWquAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The films of Charlton Heston","description":"Career of Charlton Heston.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DP8uAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+films+of+Charlton+Heston&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kes","description":"Life is tough and cheerless for Billy Casper, a disillusioned teenager growing up in a small Yorkshire mining town.

Brilliantly conceived, passionately defiant, deeply felt, The Only Ones introduces in the form of central character Inez Fardo one of the most memorable and compelling first-person voices in recent American fiction.\\" Steve Erickson \\"A bracing, tough minded, farsighted novel about bravery and endurance, motherhood and the way life goes on even after the world ends. Every sentence pierces.\\" Kelly Link \\"This is an enthralling journey through a near future, plague filled landscape, presented with such gritty clarity and such a darkly humorous eye for detail that it feels completely real. Inez' deadpan account of her heroic struggle to keep her daughter alive in the ruins of Brooklyn and Queens - a devastated but curiously familiar world, filled with maddening school bureaucracies and public transport that never comes - becomes a fantastic portrait of what it is to raise a child.\\" Mary Harron \\"Dibbell tells this story with intensity and color, through a voice that is as shattered and alive as the world she has created, exploring universal themes of sacrifice, love, and the fragile yet persistent will to survive. At times,The Only Ones feels large, small, sweeping and intimate, scary and full of hope. Dense and vivid, smart and thought-provoking.\\" Charles Yu Inez wanders a post-pandemic world, strangely immune to disease, making her living by volunteering as a test subject. She is hired to provide genetic material to a grief-stricken, affluent mother, who lost all four of her daughters within four short weeks. This experimental genetic work is policed by a hazy network of governmental ethics committees, and threatened by the Knights of Life, religious zealots who raze the rural farms where much of this experimentation is done. When the mother backs out at the last minute, Inez is left responsible for the product, which in this case is a baby girl, Ani. Inez must protect Ani, who is a scientific breakthrough, keeping her alive, dodging authorities and religious fanatics, and trying to provide Ani with the childhood that Inez never had, which means a stable home and an education. With a stylish voice influenced by years of music writing, The Only Ones is a time-old story, tender and iconic, about how much we love our children, however they come, as well as a sly commentary on class, politics, and the complexities of reproductive technology. Carola Dibbell is a highly regarded rock critic whose fiction has appeared in theNew Yorker, the Paris Review, Fence, and Black Clock. Writing about books as well as music, Dibbell was aVillage Voice contributor for many years.

The term  home economics  may conjure traumatic memories of lopsided hand-sewn pillows or sunken muffins. But common conception obscures the story of the revolutionary science of better living. The field exploded opportunities for women in the twentieth century by reducing domestic work and providing jobs as professors, engineers, chemists, and businesspeople. And it has something to teach us today. In the surprising, often fiercely feminist and always fascinating The Secret History of Home Economics, Danielle Dreilinger traces the field s history from Black colleges to Eleanor Roosevelt to Okinawa, from a Betty Crocker brigade to DIY techies. These women and they were mostly women became chemists and marketers, studied nutrition, health, and exercise, tested parachutes, created astronaut food, and took bold steps in childhood development and education. Home economics followed the currents of American culture even as it shaped them. Dreilinger brings forward the racism within the movement along with the strides taken by women of color who were influential leaders and innovators. She also looks at the personal lives of home economics  women, as they chose to be single, share lives with other women, or try for egalitarian marriages. This groundbreaking and engaging history restores a denigrated subject to its rightful importance, as it reminds us that everyone should learn how to cook a meal, balance their account, and fight for a better world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vgYDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MOSFET MODELS FOR SPICE SIMULATION INCLUDING BSIM3V3 AND BSIM4","description":"An expert guide to understanding and making optimum use of BSIM Used by more chip designers worldwide than any other comparable model, the Berkeley Short-Channel IGFET Model (BSIM) has, over the past few years, established itself as the de facto standard MOSFET SPICE model for circuit simulation and CMOS technology development. Yet, until now, there have been no independent expert guides or tutorials to supplement the various BSIM manuals currently available. Written by a noted expert in the field, this book fills that gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive guide to understanding and making optimal use of BSIM3 and BSIM4. Drawing upon his extensive experience designing with BSIM, William Liu provides a brief history of the model, discusses the various advantages of BSIM over other models, and explores the reasons why BSIM3 has been adopted by the majority of circuit manufacturers. He then provides engineers with the detailed practical information and guidance they need to master all of BSIM's features. He: Summarizes key BSIM3 components Represents the BSIM3 model with equivalent circuits for various operating conditions Provides a comprehensive glossary of modeling terminology Lists alphabetically BSIM3 parameters along with their meanings and relevant equations Explores BSIM3's flaws and provides improvement suggestions Describes all of BSIM4's improvements and new features Provides useful SPICE files, which are available online at the Wiley ftp site","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rgRTAAAAMAAJ&dq=MOSFET+MODELS+FOR+SPICE+SIMULATION+INCLUDING+BSIM3V3+AND+BSIM4&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notes on the Book of Exodus","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ncVwNQEACAAJ&dq=Notes+on+the+Book+of+Exodus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tending to Virginia: A Novel","description":"This is the story of Virginia Turner Ballard, know to her North Carolina relatives as Ginny Sue. It's also the story of her mother, her grandmother, her great aunts, her closest cousin--three generations of women who gather around Virginia to help her at the end of a hard pregnancy, to tend to her, to help her prepare for the fourth generation. This kind of family attendance, this kind of tending to, is Southern to the core, offering, as it does, the occasion for reviving and trading entwined family stories. Tending to Virginia is a novel of one family's most important stories--how they happened, how they were perceived, how they were remembered, how their truth is revealed. In the end, an eruption of family confessions becomes revelation--revelation as legacy, passed down among a family's women; revelation as a family's gift in celebration of growing up, a process Jill McCorkle knows lasts into old age. In her characterizations of these vivid women playing out their generational roles in the contemporary South, McCorkle presents us with a powerful insight--that the strongest family bonds are, for better or worse, as often created by what is held back as by what is spoken.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZZj57HXFNywC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Green Witch","description":"The little green witch's three friends are too lazy to help her tend the pumpkin seeds she has planted, but when they all want to eat the pumpkin pie that she makes, the witch exacts her revenge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Smv-FAnoAUgC&dq=The+Little+Green+Witch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","description":"Annabelle Grayson has been given a second chance at life, but she can't claim it with the cloud of her past hanging over her in Willow Springs.

In The Robin Moss records a year of observing the robin both close to home and in the field to shed light on the hidden life of this apparently familiar bird. We follow its lifecycle from the time it enters the world as an egg, through its time as a nestling and juvenile, to the adult bird; via courtship, song, breeding, feeding, migration - and ultimately, death. At the same time, we trace the robin's relationship with us: how did this bird - one of more than 300 species in its huge and diverse family - find its way so deeply and permanently into our nation's heart and its social and cultural history? It's a story that tells us as much about ourselves as it does about the robin itself. No other bird is quite so ever-present and familiar, so embedded in our culture, as the robin.

Yet we are still led to believe that we are fortunate that retroviruses, only discovered in the 1970's, were uncovered just in time to label them the culprit in a killer AIDS epidemic; lucky that two \\"HIV's\\" were discovered in rapid succession and that the technology and theory to link AIDS to the HIV retrovirus was fully in place, for the first time in history, only a few years prior to the recognition of the AIDS epidemic. Lucky? As the 20th anniversary of the first reported AIDS cases passes us by, AIDS has infected nearly 60 million people of which almost 22, including nearly half-a-million Americans have died, yet the prospects for a cure or vaccine are as remote as they were 2 decades ago. And although it is currently difficult to find anyone who openly questions HIV as the cause of AIDS, a fast growing number express their doubts privately. By 1979, doctors in Manhattan began to notice a strange new disease killing what had been up to then healthy gay men. As reports mounted, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was forced to circulate similar notices of homosexual men in New York and Los Angeles with a weakened immune system dying from heretofore rare causes (MMWR, 1981). Unnoticed was an earlier raise in the New York infection rate for tuberculosis, which, from the onset, the new epidemic emulated. From its conception AIDS was a nightmare of anguished victims, washed with wave after wave of terrible disease, whose physicians, like so many medical priests, helplessly watched them die. U. S. Coastal hospitals in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles soon turned into war zones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rd1S1kWvzO0C&dq=AIDS:+What+the+Discoverers+of+HIV+Never+Admitted&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding God, Finding Each Other How Our Marriage Was Saved By The Power Of God","description":"Christain Library of Lancaster Collection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2hPkIyL1obUC&dq=Finding+God,+Finding+Each+Other+How+Our+Marriage+Was+Saved+By+The+Power+Of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mayor Of The Roses: Stories (Miami University Press Fiction Series)","description":"Fiction.

Over the years thousands of readers, starting this book, have been relieved to encounter its famously undemanding approach to the city - \\"Generally the first thing to do in Venice is to sit down and have some coffee: but by the time they get to the end of it, all the same, they will have learnt virtually everything that an educated stranger needs to know about the place, its art and its history, besides being subtly entertained throughout.\\" --From Jan Morris's introduction The simple object of this book, in the author's own words, is to guide the reader to places he might otherwise miss and, having reached them, to tell him what he might wish to know and then leave him, preferably at a caf , to admire, to enjoy, and perhaps be disappointed. The illustrations show the visitor, as he confronts a view, what his predecessors of 100, 200, or 500 years ago saw from the same point. Two sections of color plates have been added, showing how the beauty of Venice inspired the 18th-century view painters. The main part of the book describes four walks, each of which can be completed in one day. Maps, old and new, are provided for each walk. The introduction deals with the Piazza S. Marco and its neighborhood, and appendices are devoted to the public boat services, food, and drink, and books about Venice.

Necessarily diffidence will be one of the graces of the performance. Hitherto such forecasts have been presented almost invariably in the form of fiction, and commonly the provocation of the satirical opportunity has been too much for the writer; the narrative form becomes more and more of a nuisance as the speculative inductions become sincerer, and here it will be abandoned altogether in favour of a texture of frank inquiries and arranged considerations. Our utmost aim is a rough sketch of the coming time, a prospectus, as it were, of the joint undertaking of mankind in facing these impending years. The reader is a prospective shareholder-he and his heirs-though whether he will find this anticipatory balance-sheet to his belief or liking is another matter. For reasons that will develop themselves more clearly as these papers unfold, it is extremely convenient to begin with a speculation upon the probable developments and changes of the means of land locomotion during the coming decades.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OQRBAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wedding Crafts: 40 Charming Ideas for a Unique Personalized Wedding","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nODsAAAACAAJ&dq=Wedding+Crafts:+40+Charming+Ideas+for+a+Unique+Personalized+Wedding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amelia Earhart: Pioneer in the sky (A yearling book)","description":"\\"Women must try to do things as men have tried. \\" When she was eight years old, Amelia Earhart built a roller coaster and \\"flew\\" through the air.

Based on an exhaustive study of thousands of sales reps across multiple industries and geographies, The Challenger Sale argues that classic relationship building is a losing approach, especially when it comes to selling complex, large-scale business-to-business solutions. The authors' study found that every sales rep in the world falls into one of five distinct profiles, and while all of these types of reps can deliver average sales performance, only one-the Challenger- delivers consistently high performance. Instead of bludgeoning customers with endless facts and features about their company and products, Challengers approach customers with unique insights about how they can save or make money. They tailor their sales message to the customer's specific needs and objectives. Rather than acquiescing to the customer's every demand or objection, they are assertive, pushing back when necessary and taking control of the sale. The things that make Challengers unique are replicable and teachable to the average sales rep. Once you understand how to identify the Challengers in your organization, you can model their approach and embed it throughout your sales force. The authors explain how almost any average-performing rep, once equipped with the right tools, can successfully reframe customers' expectations and deliver a distinctive purchase experience that drives higher levels of customer loyalty and, ultimately, greater growth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pioPC9OiMdMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BizBreak: Weekly Reminders for the Workplace","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Effective unarmed combat: Secrets of self-defense","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Exit Club","description":"A novel about the men of the SAS: their selection and training; the wars they fight; the women they love; the dreams they share along the ways; and the dreams they lose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r6akAAAACAAJ&dq=Exit+Club&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","description":"The internationally renowned novel about the life and death of Jesus Christ. Hailed as a masterpiece by critics worldwide, The Last Temptation of Christ is a monumental reinterpretation of the Gospels that brilliantly fleshes out Christ s Passion. This literary rendering of the life of Jesus Christ has courted controversy since its publication by depicting a Christ far more human than the one seen in the Bible. He is a figure who is gloriously divine but earthy and human, a man like any other subject to fear, doubt, and pain. In elegant, thoughtful prose Nikos Kazantzakis, one of the greats of modern literature, follows this Jesus as he struggles to live out God s will for him, powerfully suggesting that it was Christ s ultimate triumph over his flawed humanity, when he gave up the temptation to run from the cross and willingly laid down his life for mankind, that truly made him the venerable redeemer of men.

V. Morton is more than a travel book: it is a sensitive interpretation of a country's people and their history. The success of his first book on England, established the popularity of something new and refreshing in this type of literature. Mr Morton's travels have gained him thousands of readers in all parts of the world. The author has frequently been requested to define the secret of writing a travel book. He always replies: 'There is no secret. You either enjoy yourself or you do not. If you do, say so; if you do not - say so!' This disarming sincerity is, perhaps, responsible for the charm and fascination of his books. The feel and smell of the countryside, also a sense of movement, find their way into these light-hearted wanderings, and, combined with humour, acute observation, sympathy and an engaging curiosity, have justly gained for them a wide and increasing popularity.

Whether or not America itself declines or thrives under President Trump's leadership, the post-war liberal international order underpinned by US military, economic and ideological primacy and supported by global institutions serving its power and purpose, is coming to an end. But what will take its place? A Chinese world order? A re-constituted form of American hegemony? A regionalized system of global cooperation, including major and emerging powers? In this updated and extended edition of his widely acclaimed book, Amitav Acharya offers an incisive answer to this fundamental question. While the US will remain a major force in world affairs, he argues that it has lost the ability to shape world order after its own interests and image. As a result, the US will be one of a number of anchors including emerging powers, regional forces, and a concert of the old and new powers shaping a new world order. Rejecting labels such as multipolar, apolar, or G-Zero, Acharya likens the emerging system to a multiplex theatre, offering a choice of plots (ideas), directors (power), and action (leadership) under one roof. Finally, he reflects on the policies that the US, emerging powers and regional actors must pursue to promote stability in this decentred but interdependent, multiplex world. Written by a leading scholar of the international relations of the non-Western world, and rising above partisan punditry, this book represents a major contribution to debates over the post-American era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nxJSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discworld Mapp","description":"They said it couldn't be done.

Richard West Jr. (Founding Director of the National Museum of the American Indian), The Washington Post A century ago, U.S. policy aimed to sever the tribal allegiances of Native Americans, limit their ancient liberties, and coercively prepare them for citizenship. At the same time, millions of new immigrants sought their freedom by means of that same citizenship. Alan Trachtenberg argues that the two developments were, inevitably, juxtaposed: Indians and immigrants together preoccupied the public imagination, and together changed the idea of what it meant to be American.

Whether it was an alien spacecraft manned by tiny humanlike beings or the US government's official explanation a scientific research balloon has long been a subject of passionate debate. Transcending the believer-versus-skeptic debate, anthropologists Benson Saler and Charles A. Ziegler contend that the Roswell story is best understood as a modern American myth. They show how the story and its continual retelling tap into modern fears about the power of technology, the duplicity of the government, and the power of the media. UFO Crash at Roswell also includes physicist Charles Moore's meticulous account of how 1947 experiments to launch balloon-borne radar reflectors may have led to the Roswell UFO myth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fBMgEAAAQBAJ&dq=UFO+Crash+at+Roswell:+The+Genesis+of+a+Modern+Myth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remembering Lives: Conversations With the Dying and the Bereaved (Death, Value and Meaning)","description":"Grief is frequently thought of as an ordeal we must simply survive.

Re-membering is about a comforting, life enhancing, and sustaining approach to death that does not dwell on the pain of loss and is much more than wistful reminiscing. It is about the deliberate construction of stories that continue to include the dead in the membership of our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7QdcvgAACAAJ&dq=Remembering+Lives:+Conversations+With+the+Dying+and+the+Bereaved+(Death,+Value+and+Meaning)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The lost pathfinder, Zebulon Montgomery Pike (The American exploration and travel series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The 250 Best Cookie Recipes","description":"Who doesn't remember the wonderful, warm aroma coming from the kitchen as Mom was baking cookies?

Hard-hitting and provocative, yet measured and clearly written, The End of the American Century demonstrates the phases of social, economic, and international decline that mark the end of a period of world dominance that began with World War II. The costs of the war on terror and the Iraq War have exacerbated the already daunting problems of debt, poverty, inequality, and political and social decay. David S. Mason convincingly argues that the United States, like other great powers in the past, is experiencing the dilemma of \\"imperial overstretch\\"-bankrupting the home front in pursuit of costly and fruitless foreign ventures. The author shows that elsewhere in the world, the United States is no longer admired as a model for democracy and economic development; indeed, it is often feared or resented. He compares the United States and its accomplishments with other industrialized democracies and potential rivals. The European Union is more stable in economic and social terms, and countries like India and China are more economically dynamic. These and other nations will soon eclipse the United States, signaling a fundamental transformation of the global scene. This transition will require huge adjustments for American citizens and political leaders alike. But in the end, Americans-and the world-will be better off with a less profligate, more interdependent United States.

Here Frank Fencepost, true to form as a fast-talking con artist, outwits the Alberta Supreme Court in a hilarious cattle-insemination case in \\"Bull.\\" In the title story he becomes an evangelizing Robin Hood, turning the government-sponsored K-U-G-H radio show into a scheme to use listeners' donations to fund listeners' wishes (and incidentally line his pockets), and in \\"Miracle on Manitoba Street\\" he visits a Montana reserve where he carves a picture of the Virgin Mary on a derelict Frigidaire and convinces the local medicine woman it's a miracle--one worthy of an admission charge. Not all the stories are humorous: \\"Dream Catcher\\" grapples with sexual violence when Silas's twelve-year-old sister is assaulted and Mad Etta, the community's four-hundred-pound medicine woman, provides a nightmare \\"cure\\" for the would-be rapist; \\"Ice Man\\" depicts gender discrimination, as Jason Twelve Trees fights to participate in a cooking competition despite his father's wish for him to become a mechanic; and \\"The Rain Birds\\" shows the consequences of the government's computer-driven corporate farms riding roughshod over the human and natural environment in western Canada.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UQNbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Brother+Frank%27s+Gospel+Hour:+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of the Occult","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7JazYgEACAAJ&dq=Tales+of+the+Occult&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sweater Book: Hundreds of People...One Common Thread","description":"Depicts A-list celebrities who have donned identical cardigan sweaters that represent their awareness and support for AIDS research, in a coffee-table photography book whose royalties will be donated to Broadway Cares and Cassidy's Place charities. 30,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lS41wM17suIC&dq=The+Sweater+Book:+Hundreds+of+People...One+Common+Thread&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Northern Magic: A Family Odyssey","description":"Ever dream of selling up and running away to sea? Diane Stuemer and her husband, Herbert, were once a typical suburban couple entering middle age, with a comfortable home and three boys under twelve. A year later they had sold their business, rented out their house, and were setting out to circumnavigate the globe in a 40-year-old yacht. Their entire sailing experience consisted of six afternoons on the Ottawa River. Over the next four years, squeezed into quarters no bigger than the Stuemers  old bedroom, the family of five would become seasoned mariners. They would battle deadly storms at sea and evade real-life pirates. Dodge waterspouts and lightning strikes and witness the bombing of the USS Cole. See the staggering beauty of Borneo s rainforest, and its destruction from logging. Be arrested at gunpoint and entertained like visiting royalty. In all, they would visit 34 countries and cover 35,000 nautical miles. Almost everywhere they went, the family made lasting friendships. They learned to trust each other and embrace opportunity, and in Kenya they learned the true meaning of humanity. As Northern Magic pushed onward, many thousands followed the family s progress in Diane s dispatches to the Ottawa Citizen, and thousands more turned out to cheer when the amazing Stuemers came home.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XUaFAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Survivor Volume 1","description":"In the aftermath of the Big Growl that destroyed his city, a Lone Dog named Lucky must find a way to work with other dogs in order to survive in this frightening new world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wWJszQEACAAJ&dq=The+Survivor+Volume+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nostradamus Cabala Code","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT","description":"This second edition of An Introduction to the Old Testament integrates and interacts with recent developments in Old Testament scholarship.

It continues the groundbreaking work of the first edition, emphasizing a life-span approach toward understanding the social interaction that occurs during later life. The edition provides a comprehensive update on the existing and emerging research within communication and aging studies and considers such topics as notions of successful aging, positive and negative stereotypes toward older adults, and health communication issues. It raises awareness of the barriers facing elderly people in conversation and the importance such conversations have in elderly people's lives. The impact of nonrelational processes, such as hearing loss, are considered as they impact relationships with others and affect the ability to age successfully. The book is organized into 14 chapters. Each chapter is written so that the reader is presented with an exhaustive review of the pertinent and recent literature from the social sciences. As in the first edition, when the literature is empirically based, the communicative ramifications are then discussed. Readers of this volume will gain greater understanding of the importance of their communicative relationships and how significant they remain across the life span. Developed for students in communication, psychology, nursing, social gerontology, sociology, and related areas, Communication and Aging provides important insights on communication to all who are affected by the aging process.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eCySQQPUIRMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Car","description":"Fourteen-year-old Terry Anders, left on his own, travels west in a kit car he built himself, and along the way picks up two Vietnam veterans, who take him on an eye-opening journey.

From its opening in December 1965 on Park Avenue South, Max s Kansas City, a hybrid restaurant, bar, nightclub, and art gallery, was the boisterous meeting spot for famous or soon-to-be-famous figures in New York s underground art, music, literary, film, and fashion scenes. Max s regulars included Andy Warhol (and his superstars such as Viva, Ultra Violet, Edie Sedgwick, Gerard Malanga, Holly Woodlawn, and Candy Darling), Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Bob Dylan, Jane Fonda, and dozens more. A hotbed of drugs, sex, and creative collaboration, Max s was the place to see and be seen among the city s cultural elite for nearly two decades. With reminiscences from the likes of Alice Cooper, Bebe Buell, Betsey Johnson, Leee Black Childers, Holly Woodlawn, and John Chamberlain, along with Max s owner Mickey Ruskin and several waitresses and bartenders, this vivid oral history evokes an unforgettable place where a spontaneous striptease, a brawl over the meaning of art, and an early performance by the Velvet Underground were all possibilities on any given night.

There's something troubling about Professor Caligari's Traveling Carnival. Perhaps it's that no one can recall the arrival of its hard-to-miss caravan of old-style wagons, countless performers, and horse-drawn carts. Maybe it's the creepy calliope music that tirelessly beckons visitors. Let's face it, an enigma that chooses Sunnydale nearly guarantees it's up to more than wholesome family entertainment. After a visit to the carnival's Hall of Mirrors, a once-shy pair of homely sophomore twins parades the halls of Sunnydale High like diva supermodels on a runway. Intuiting the twins' abrupt personality change as more than a self-confidence boost, Buffy -- joined by Angel, Giles, and the rest of the Scoobies -- decides to investigate the suspicious carnival firsthand. But soon it's apparent that the price of admission is higher than she imagined. Those who enter the carnival's attractions exit...changed. Each of the gang soon shows extreme displays of vice. Willow is wracked with envy. Cordelia's greed consumes her. Xander unleashes his gluttony. Angel reveals a lusty new persona. And a dark anger rises in Giles. But it's Buffy's now-blinding pride that threatens to overpower her, and in the process destroy those she loves....","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zGCb7xvlEP0C&dq=Night+Terrors+(Buffy+the+Vampire+Slayer+(Simon+Spotlight))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jackie Gleason: An Intimate Portrait","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","description":"Fitzgerald's second novel, a devastating portrait of the excesses of the Jazz Age, is a largely autobiographical depiction of a glamorous, reckless Manhattan couple and their spectacular spiral into tragedy.

The country faced a hotly contested presidential election, the largest terrorist attack in the nation's history, and the early stages of war. Through it all, President George W. Bush surrounded himself with a handful of close advisers. During this time the man beside the President was Ari Fleischer, his press secretary and one of his most trusted confidants. In this role, Fleisher was present for every decision and became an eyewitness to history. In this riveting account, Fleischer goes behind the scenes as he recalls his experiences in the West Wing. Through the ups and downs of this time, he took the heat, fielded the questions, and brought the President's message into living rooms around the world. In Taking Heat, Fleischer, for the first time, gives his perspective on: The 2000 election, from the recounts to the transition to power September 11, 2001, its aftermath, and the anthrax scare The pressure-filled buildup to the war in Iraq and the President's thoughts as the war began Life in the White House, from learning to adjust to the pace of the West Wing and his early briefings to his relationship with the press The White House press corps, who they are, and how they report the news The factors that led to his decision to leave Washington behind. This is the story of the men and women of the White House press corps and the cornerstones of democracy: freedom of speech and the freedom of the press. Fleischer presents an in-depth, insider's view on the Washington political arena from a perspective few have seen. Fleischer writes of his belief that the press has a bias in Washington. It's not a question of partisanship or press-driven ideology. Instead, it's a focus on conflict, particularly if it's a conflict they can attach to the President. It's the nature of the White House press corps, regardless of who's in power. The members of the White House press corps are masters at being devil's advocate, able to take with passion the opposite side of whatever issue the President supports. Fleischer's job was to calmly field their questions, no matter how pointed. Taking Heat is an introspective exploration of the top political events in the first half of the Bush administration, as well as the candid observations of a professional who stood in the bright lights of the world stage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rRgySNzhW2wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frank Schoonmaker's Encyclopedia of wine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G63GtAEACAAJ&dq=Frank+Schoonmaker%27s+Encyclopedia+of+wine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Look Inside Your Body","description":"Billedbog med mere end 100 flapper.

The Japan Foundation Newsletter Kumagai Naozane was a Japanese warrior famous for having taken the head of the young and handsome samurai Atsumori. This episode has become one of the best-known and best-loved stories in the Japanese historical classic, The Heik  Story (Heike Monogatari). This book is a fictionalized version of Kumagai s own attempt to come to terms with his past that real past which is his and that other past which he hears the monks inventing as they compose the text which will eventually become The Heik  Story. As the warrior remembers his past and compares it to its fictional parallel, he evokes the wonders of the city of Heiankyo (Kyoto); the wars which raised the Taira (Heike) clan to power and later reduced it to ruin at the hands of the Genji clan; the battles at the Uji River; life in the imperial court of the retired emperor Go-Shirakawa; and the celebrated final Taira battle the naval encounter at Dannoura, where the infant emperor Antoku was delivered to the depths of the sea. Among the many pleasures of this brilliantly colored chronicle is how the common humanity of this honest, hopeless man transcends his time and milieu to speak to us, here and now.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GwHRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greek Coffin Mystery","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","description":"When gruff and intimidating security consultant Max Stillman appears without warning in the San Francisco office of McClaren Life and Casualty and begins asking questions and scrutinizing files, the employees can't help wondering just which of them he's been hired to investigate. The first to find out is young data analyst John Walker when Stillman's mysterious investigation leads out of town, he announces he's taking Walker with him. Walker has been picked because a colleague with whom he once had a love affair has disappeared after paying a very large death benefit to an impostor. Since Walker knew her intimately, Stillman believes he's likely to be useful in finding and convicting her. But because he knows her so well, Walker is convinced that she is innocent, and that he must join the pursuit so that he can defend her. These conflicting purposes unite Walker and Stillman in an urgent search that propels them across the country and into unexpected dangers. The trail ends in a deceptively peaceful corner of the New Hampshire countryside, where they find themselves trapped by a deadly conspiracy that's much bigger, older, and more evil than they could ever have imagined.

To devout, vocal, and authoritative lay Catholics, religion is central to both the actor and his most famous character. Yet many viewers wonder,  Is Colbert a practicing Catholic in real life or is this part of his act?  America s Most Famous Catholic (According to Himself) examines the ways in which Colbert challenges perceptions of Catholicism and Catholic mores through his faith and comedy. Religion and the foibles of religious institutions have served as rich fodder for scores of comedians over the years. What set  Colbert  apart on his Comedy Central show, The Colbert Report, was that his critical observations were made more powerful and harder to ignore because he approached religious material not from the predictable stance of the irreverent secular comedian but from his position as one of the faithful. He is a Catholic celebrity who can bridge critical outsider and participating insider, neither fully reverent nor fully irreverent. Providing a digital media ethnography and rhetorical analysis of Stephen Colbert and his character from 2005 to 2014, author Stephanie N. Brehm examines the intersection between lived religion and mass media, moving from an exploration of how Catholicism shapes Colbert s life and world towards a conversation about how  Colbert  shapes Catholicism. Brehm provides historical context by discovering how  Colbert  compares to other Catholic figures, such Don Novello, George Carlin, Louis C.K., and Jim Gaffigan, who have each presented their views of Catholicism to Americans through radio, film, and television. The last chapter provides a current glimpse of Colbert on The Late Show, where he continues to be voice for Catholicism on late night, now to an even broader audience. America s Most Famous Catholic (According to Himself) also explores how Colbert carved space for Americans who currently define their religious lives through absence, ambivalence, and alternatives. Brehm reflects on the complexity of contemporary American Catholicism as it is lived today in the often-ignored form of Catholic multiplicity: thinking Catholics, cultural Catholics, cafeteria Catholics, and lukewarm Catholics, or what others have called Colbert Catholicism, an emphasis on the joy of religion in concert with the suffering. By examining the humor in religion, Brehm allows us to see clearly the religious elements in the work and life of comedian Stephen Colbert.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aZWfDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+American+Experience:+The+Radio+Priest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reflections From Afar","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cacbAAAACAAJ&dq=Reflections+From+Afar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Primer of Quantum Mechanics","description":"Introductory text examines classical quantum bead on a track: state and representations; operator eigenvalues; harmonic oscillator and bound bead in a symmetric force field; bead in spherical shell. 1992 edition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6Re0AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"S.A.S.

The book gives actors a step-by-step technique on how to audition for on-camera acting jobs and what to do on set after booking them. Many on-camera acting books are written by established movie stars and aren't geared toward actors in an undergraduate acting program or those who are just starting to audition for on-camera jobs for the first time. Stef Tovar teaches his proven on-camera acting technique, shows actors how to make the perfect self-tape, and prepares them for life on set detailing the differences between working in the theater vs. working in television and film. The author peppers the text with his own stories from set as examples, including auditioning for Lee Daniels and working with Matt Damon, Steven Soderbergh, and many others. The MAP is a funny and encouraging perspective from a seasoned actor who shares with aspiring actors things no one tells you before booking your first on-camera acting job.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Enk3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistical Abstract of the United States 2002: The National Data Book","description":"Provides a wide variety of statistics dealing with the political, social, and economic organization of the United States, in a work originally issued by the Bureau of the Census.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YXzmzgEACAAJ&dq=Statistical+Abstract+of+the+United+States+2002:+The+National+Data+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flight from Reality in the Human Sciences","description":"In this captivating yet troubling book, Ian Shapiro offers a searing indictment of many influential practices in the social sciences and humanities today. Perhaps best known for his critique of rational choice theory, Shapiro expands his purview here. In discipline after discipline, he argues, scholars have fallen prey to inward-looking myopia that results from--and perpetuates--a flight from reality. In the method-driven academic culture we inhabit, argues Shapiro, researchers too often make display and refinement of their techniques the principal scholarly activity. The result is that they lose sight of the objects of their study. Pet theories and methodological blinders lead unwelcome facts to be ignored, sometimes not even perceived. The targets of Shapiro's critique include the law and economics movement, overzealous formal and statistical modeling, various reductive theories of human behavior, misguided conceptual analysis in political theory, and the Cambridge school of intellectual history. As an alternative to all of these, Shapiro makes a compelling case for problem-driven social research, rooted in a realist philosophy of science and an antireductionist view of social explanation. In the lucid--if biting--prose for which Shapiro is renowned, he explains why this requires greater critical attention to how problems are specified than is usually undertaken. He illustrates what is at stake for the study of power, democracy, law, and ideology, as well as in normative debates over rights, justice, freedom, virtue, and community. Shapiro answers many critics of his views along the way, securing his position as one of the distinctive social and political theorists of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Pk7Hyqz9QsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AJE9AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Creeps in Room 112","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p323wAEACAAJ&dq=The+Creeps+in+Room+112&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ec Competition Law","description":"Monti explores the development of EC competition law through an interdisciplinary approach, focusing on the political and economic considerations that affect the way the rules are interpreted.

Written by literary experts who currently teach the subject, MAXnotes will enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the work. MAXnotes are designed to stimulate independent thought about the literary work by raising various issues and thought-provoking ideas and questions. MAXnotes cover the essentials of what one should know about each work, including an overall summary, character lists, an explanation and discussion of the plot, the work's historical context, illustrations to convey the mood of the work, and a biography of the author. Each chapter is individually summarized and analyzed, and has study questions and answers. Amazon.com Review Malcolm X's searing memoir belongs on the small shelf of great autobiographies. The reasons are many: the blistering honesty with which he recounts his transformation from a bitter, self-destructive petty criminal into an articulate political activist, the continued relevance of his militant analysis of white racism, and his emphasis on self-respect and self-help for African Americans. And there's the vividness with which he depicts black popular culture--try as he might to criticize those lindy hops at Boston's Roseland dance hall from the perspective of his Muslim faith, he can't help but make them sound pretty wonderful. These are but a few examples. The Autobiography of Malcolm X limns an archetypal journey from ignorance and despair to knowledge and spiritual awakening. When Malcolm tells coauthor Alex Haley, \\"People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by one book,\\" he voices the central belief underpinning every attempt to set down a personal story as an example for others. Although many believe his ethic was directly opposed to Martin Luther King Jr.'s during the civil rights struggle of the '60s, the two were not so different. Malcolm may have displayed a most un-Christian distaste for loving his enemies, but he understood with King that love of God and love of self are the necessary first steps on the road to freedom. --Wendy Smith Review Biography, published in 1965, of the American black militant religious leader and activist who was born Malcolm Little. Written by Alex Haley, who had conducted extensive audiotaped interviews with Malcolm X just before his assassination in 1965, the book gained renown as a classic work on black American experience. The Autobiography recounts the life of Malcolm X from his traumatic childhood plagued by racism to his years as a drug dealer and pimp, his conversion to the Black Muslim sect (Nation of Islam) while in prison for burglary, his subsequent years of militant activism, and the turn late in his life to more orthodox Islam. --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HTTPygAACAAJ&dq=Playboy+(JULY+1991+TALL+GIRLS+/SPIKE+LEE+INTERVIEW)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Painting Sunsets (Book No. 101)","description":"\\"Taking the first steps; Finding a focus; Expressing nature's beauty; Developing textures.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CT5ZIoXdbvUC&dq=Painting+Sunsets+(Book+No.+101)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Night","description":"'A RIVETING EMOTIONAL READ THAT KEPT ME ON THE EDGE!' -- Melissa Marr, author of the bestselling Wicked Lovely series, on The Darkest Minds The government-run 'rehabilitation camps' have been shut down, but kids with Psi powers are anything but free.

On the day of his third birthday, Oskar had \\"declared, resolved, and determined [to] stop right there, remain as I was, stay the same size, cling to the same attire\\" (striped pullover and patent-leather shoes). That same day Oskar receives his first tin drum, and from then on it is the means of his expression, allowing him to draw forth memories from the past as well as judgments about the horrors, injustices, and eccentricities he observes through the long nightmare of the Nazi era. As that era ebbs bloodily away, as drum succeeds drum, Oskar participates in the German postwar economic miracle -- working variously in the black market, as an artist's model, in a troupe of traveling musicians. With the onset of affluence and fame, Oskar decides to grow a few inches, only to develop a humpback. But despite his newfound status (and stature), Oskar remains haunted by the deaths of his parents, afflicted by his responsibility for past sins -- and so assumes guilt for a murder he did not commit as an act of atonement and an opportunity to find consolation.The rhythms of Oskar's drums are intricate and insistent, and they lead us, often by way of shocking fantasies, through the dark forest of German history. Through Oskar's piercing, outspoken voice and deformed little figure, through the imaginative distortion and exaggeration of historical experience, a pathetically hilarious yet startlingly true portrayal of the human situation comes into view.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VkPzAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Tin+Drum&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Falling in Love With Mystery: We Dont Have to Pretend Anymore","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l2oGAAAACAAJ&dq=Falling+in+Love+With+Mystery:+We+Dont+Have+to+Pretend+Anymore&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rounders","description":"The bawdy and moving story of two contemporary bronco busters,The Rounders, originally published in 1960, was Max Evans's first novel and is still his best known work, thanks largely to the success of the 1965 movie version starring Henry Fonda and Glenn Ford.

A tragic saga, but at the same time it often reads like a thriller filled with acts of extraordinary courage, descriptions of dangerous journeys and a series of secret identities.  Chicago Tribune  To this day, I don't even know what my mother's real name is.  Helen Fremont was raised as a Roman Catholic. It wasn't until she was an adult, practicing law in Boston, that she discovered her parents were Jewish Holocaust survivors living invented lives. Not even their names were their own. In this powerful memoir, Helen Fremont delves into the secrets that held her family in a bond of silence for more than four decades, recounting with heartbreaking clarity a remarkable tale of survival, as vivid as fiction but with the resonance of truth. Driven to uncover their roots, Fremont and her sister pieced together an astonishing story: of Siberian Gulags and Italian royalty, of concentration camps and buried lives. After Long Silence is about the devastating price of hiding the truth; about families; about the steps we take, foolish or wise, to protect ourselves and our loved ones.

His job entailed gathering evidence to prosecute animal and environmental activists involved in domestic terrorism, educating the public, and dealing with the media. Kendall refers to the role of the circus as ''Edutainment.'' The role he played for Ringling Bros. Circus (Feld Entertainment) was to offset the propaganda aimed at the circus industry by animal activists. He worked as a consultant to Feld Entertainment and wrote thousands of reports dealing with animal activists and environmental groups. Many of the reports Kendall wrote were used by the CIA. He organized counter demonstrations nationwide under the umbrella group ''Putting People First.'' Feld Entertainment was able to utilize this group to offset the animal activist protestors. Steven Kendall did numerous TV shows and news segments around the world. Everywhere the circus went so did Steven Kendall. The book deals with the life of a undercover private investigator who organized an operation with the financial backing of Feld Entertainment. Activist groups were shocked to learn they had been infiltrated by the circus industry. PeTA currently has a federal case in Virginia against Feld Entertainment. Any group opposed to PeTA and other animal activist groups poses a threat to them.

It includes an extensive discussion of the difficulties in developing agricultural systems that accommodate increasing human needs for agricultural products during the twenty-first century in a sustainable manner. The book features new sections on adaptation to global climate change including adapting to global warming, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and increased flooding and salinity through plant breeding and changes in crop management. Warming effects include stressful effects of heat on pollen development and reduced winter chilling effects on fruit and nut trees. The book examines principles, theories, mathematical models, and experimental observations concerning plant responses to environment that are relevant to the development of improved crop cultivars and management methods. It illustrates the importance of considering emergent plant properties as well as reductionist approaches to understanding plant function and adaptation. Plant physiological and developmental responses to light and temperature, and plant water relations are considered in detail. Dr. Hall also describes climatic zone definitions based on temperature, rainfall, and evaporative demand in relation to plant adaptation and the prediction of crop water use.

The chapters are arranged as follows: Chapter 1 is a broad introduction to the cosmos, with an emphasis on where we might find life. In Chapters 2 and 3 Professor Jones discusses life on Earth, the one place we know to be inhabited. Chapter 4 is a brief tour of the Solar system, leading us in Chapters 5 and 6 to two promising potential habitats, Mars and Europa. In Chapter 7 the author discusses the fate of life in the Solar system, which gives us extra reason to consider life further afield. Chapter 8 focuses on the types of stars that might host habitable planets, and where in the Galaxy these might be concentrated. Chapters 9 and 10 describe the instruments and techniques being employed to discover planets around other stars (exoplanetary systems), and those that will be employed in the near future. Chapter 11 summarizes the known exoplanetary systems, together with an outline of the systems we expect to discover soon, particularly habitable planets. Chapter 12 describes how we will attempt to find life on these planets, and the final chapter brings us to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the question as to whether we are alone.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hccGCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Only Like What I Like","description":"Things Only a Nurse Like Me Will Tell You offers an honest view of the Health-Care System today from the perspective of Cindy Altman, a highly skilled and respected Registered Nurse.

The image of the \\"Organization Man\\" as a cog in a corporate machine has become both dated and dangerous. Rather than try to force employees into a homogeneous corporate mold based on a company's strategy, structure, and system, world-renowned scholars and consultants Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher Bartlett argue that managers must embrace a philosophy based on purpose, process, and people that focuses on developing and leveraging the individual's unique talents and skills--a company's most important source of competitive advantage. Without proposing a universal solution or a quick-fix prescription, this important book provides an indispensable guide for those who must lead their companies into the next century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HrQsMn9dGOAC&dq=The+Individualized+Corporation:+A+Fundamentally+New+Approach+to+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Girl with a Secret","description":"Perfect for fans of Agatha Christie's mysteries, as well as Clare Mackintosh and Paula Hawkins, the ninth psychological thriller from Sophie Hannah is a literary mystery and a puzzle that's impossible to solve . . .

Collins takes the right seat beside Patrick E. Bradley to demonstrate effective ways to grasp and solve IFR problems and eliminate uncertainties that may plague even current IFR airmen. Bradley, a relatively new IFR pilot, discusses the concerns and errors he has shared with most instrument fliers who are new or rusty. Collins then applies his own experiences and methods, including some lessons learned the hard way, and carefully examines airline and general aviation accidents to point out how threatening situations can be avoided or safely confronted. IFR is a thinking game, and the authors emphasize ways of avoiding mental lapses that can turn simple difficulties into lethal crises: --Making sure you're fuel-safe when your destination is at minimums. --Recognizing and thinking through the dangers of nighttime and circling approaches. --Shifting strategies and tactics when the winds aloft misbehave. --Avoiding the traps of the missed approach: before, during, and after. --Choosing right when you're number one for takeoff and a thunderstorm is approaching the field. --Staying on top of equipment needs, quirks, and failures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ay0IAAAACAAJ&dq=Instrument+Flying+Refresher+(General+Aviation+Reading+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hindsights: The Wisdom and Breakthroughs of Remarkable People.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wildlife Biology","description":"What good are wild animals?; Wildlife values; Wildlife as a natural resource; The status of wildlife conservation; The ten-thousand year war; Everything tied together; Functioning of ecosystems; Ecosystem development; Change and degradation; Distribution of biotic communities; Ecologic niches; A place to live; Enough to eat; Cover; Water; Quantity versus interspresion; Limiting factors; Introducing wildlife populations; Density and biomass; Population structure; Natality; Mortality; Interaction of population; Characteristics; Turnover; Productivity; Territory and travels; Movements internal to the population area; Movements external to the population; Group size and spacing; Territory; Significance of spacing and movements; Too many mice, too few elephants; New populations in new habitats; Some real life problems; The annual cycle of populations; Shootable surplus; Stocking of game; Stability of populations; Evolutionary strategies; Levelling off; The many meanings of carrying capacity; Declining diversity; Species extinction and area size; Destruction of habitat; Nature reserves; Animal trade; International assistance; The controllers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k6i0AAAAIAAJ&dq=Wildlife+Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","description":"The wars against the Barbary pirates not only signaled the determination of the United States to throw off its tributary status, liberate its citizens from slavery in North Africa, and reassert its right to trade freely upon the seas: they enabled America to regain its sense of national dignity.

The numbers of compromised hosts are increasing in the era of modem medicine because of our expanded capabilities to deal with difficult diseases, especially neoplasms. As a consequence, microbiologic complications related to the intensive care administered to these patients are increasing as well. Under these circum stances, not only does the underlying illness create conditions favorable for the development of unusual infections, but often the therapy contributes to the acquisition of potential pathogens that turn into agents responsible for severe and frequently fatal disease. Granulocytopenia and immunosuppression have been the two key fac tors in predisposing patients with cancer and other serious diseases to severe bacterial infections. Colonization by hospital-acquired pathogens and breaks in the anatomic barriers-as a result of disease or medical intervention-have contributed to the high incidence of infectious diseases in these patients. Although there is some overlap between the types of infection in granulocytopenic and immunosuppressed hosts, each ofthese clinical entities has distinctive features thatjustify considering them separately, reserving the term immunocompromised hosts only when refer ring to patients who are predisposed to opportunistic infections. For about two decades, infections in granulocytopenic patients have attracted the atten tion of clinicians because they represent a model for the study of antimicrobial drugs in hosts deprived of an essential element of defense against bacterial infection, that is, an adequate number of normally functioning granulocytes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oc4FCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An O.G Like Me: Inner Thoughts from an Urban Mind","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"I Believe in Myself I Don't Have to Cry Anymore","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lUjSPAAACAAJ&dq=I+Believe+in+Myself+I+Don%27t+Have+to+Cry+Anymore&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peace (UNDERSTANDING BIBLICAL THEMES SERIES)","description":"In this volume Walter Brueggemann explores biblical texts from the story of the exodus to Jesus' teachings about peace and the reign of God.

Houses, barns, and outbuildings dating from the colonial and Federal periods, built with local stone predominantly in an English Cotswold vernacular style, represent a form that has become popular across the nation. Geoffrey Gross s stunning photographs document a remarkable collection of early buildings, including the John Chad House (circa 1720), Peter Wentz Farmstead (circa 1758), and Buckingham Friends Meeting House (1768), as well as more recent designs, in part inspired by such traditional homes, by architects R. Brognard Okie, G. Edwin Brumbaugh, and John D. Milner. Part of the original Pennsylvania Colony founded in March of 1681 by William Penn, the region encompassing Bucks County and the Brandywine Valley is important not only for its history as an early English settlement in the New World, but also for its role as a crucial site in the struggle for American independence. The evidence for this is obvious in the story of its houses. Some notable examples include the Thompson-Neely House at Washington Crossing, in which, it is said, Washington s officers were billeted during the famous night of his crossing of the Delaware, and Pennsbury Manor, the reconstructed home of William Penn. With its authoritative text and exquisite full-color photography, Stone Houses is a beautiful record of a historically rich regional building tradition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0tXYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Stone+Houses:+Traditional+Homes+of+Pennsylvania%27s+Bucks+County+and+Brandywine+Valley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sonnets of William Shakespeare","description":"The sonnets in this collection divide into two parts; the first 126 are addressed to a fair youth for whom the poet has an obsessive love and the second chronicles his love for the notorious \\"Dark Lady\\".

She is as determined as ever to cut through the veil that, for thousands of years now, has been so meticulously woven to shroud the truth. And when she lifts that veil and brushes it aside, the results are astonishing, as is amply demonstrated by her analyses of the works of Nietzsche, Picasso, Kollwitz, Keaton and others. With the key shunned by so many for so long - childhood - she opens rusty looks and offers her readers a wealth of unexpected perspectives.What did Picasso express in \\"Guernica\\"? Why did Buster Keaton never smile? Why did Nietzsche heap so much opprobrium on women and religion, and lose his mind for eleven years? Why did Hitler and Stalin become tyrannical mass murderers? Alice Miller investigates these and other questions thoroughly in this book. She draws from her discoveries the conclusion that human beings are not \\"innately\\" destructive, that they are made that way by ignorance, abuse, and neglect, particularly if no sympathetic witness comes to their aid. She also shows why some mistreated children do not become criminals but instead bear witness as artists to the truth about their childhoods, even though in purely intuitive and unconscious ways.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_PvoyyW5_DAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of David as reflected in his Psalms ([Baker co-operative reprint library])","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=orQhngEACAAJ&dq=The+life+of+David+as+reflected+in+his+Psalms+(%5BBaker+co-operative+reprint+library%5D)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plays Children Love: Volume II: A Treasury of Contemporary and Classic Plays for Children","description":"A collection of nineteen plays to be performed for young audiences or by child actors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cSI-O_mBm5UC&dq=Plays+Children+Love:+Volume+II:+A+Treasury+of+Contemporary+and+Classic+Plays+for+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Emily Montague (Centre for Editing Early Canadian Texts)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","description":"Observing a strange disappearance of doctrine within the church, Kevin Vanhoozer argues that there is no more urgent task for Christians today than to engage in living truthfully with others before God.

The sea is not made of water. Creatures are its genes. Look down as you crouch over the shallows and you will find a periwinkle or a prawn, a claw-displaying crab or a cluster of anemones ready to meet you. No need for binoculars or special stalking skills: go to the rocks and the living will say hello. Inside each rock pool tucked into one of the infinite crevices of the tidal coastline lies a rippling, silent, unknowable universe. Below the stillness of the surface course different currents of endless motion the ebb and flow of the tide, the steady forward propulsion of the passage of time, and the tiny lifetimes of the rock pool s creatures, all of which coalesce into the grand narrative of evolution. In Life Between the Tides, Adam Nicolson investigates one of the most revelatory habitats on earth. Under his microscope, we see a prawn s head become a medieval helmet and a group of  winkles  transform into a Dickensian social scene, with mollusks munching on Stilton and glancing at their pocket watches. Or, rather, is a winkle more like Achilles, an ancient hero, throwing himself toward death for the sake of glory? For Nicolson, who writes  with scientific rigor and a poet s sense of wonder  (The American Scholar), the world of the rock pools is infinite and as intricate as our own. As Nicolson journeys between the tides, both in the pools he builds along the coast of Scotland and through the timeline of scientific discovery, he is accompanied by great thinkers no one can escape the pull of the sea. We meet Virginia Woolf and her Waves; a young T. S. Eliot peering into his own rock pool in Massachusetts; even Nicolson s father-in-law, a classical scholar who would hunt for amethysts along the shoreline, his mind on Heraclitus and the other philosophers of ancient Greece. And, of course, scientists populate the pages; not only their discoveries, but also their doubts and errors, their moments of quiet observation and their thrilling realizations. Everything is within the rock pools, where you can look beyond your own reflection and find the miraculous an inch beneath your nose.  The soul wants to be wet,  Heraclitus said in Ephesus twenty-five hundred years ago. This marvelous book demonstrates why it is so.

As a result, so much of the life and history of Dallas has echoed through the life and history of White Rock Lake. In the early decades, the lake was home to many private summer homes and boat houses, as well as hunting and fishing clubs. Soon thereafter, a bathing beach, sailing clubs, public boathouses, and picnic facilities were added. The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration transformed the lake with more recreational and leisure amenities. World War II brought increased military uses that included a POW camp for German officers. Those early city leaders could hardly know that the lake they were creating 10 miles outside of Dallas would become an urban oasis enjoyed by over two million visitors a year.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=phWo8hwbnPUC&dq=White+Rock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vigilance (Alias)","description":"Sydney's conscience struggles with her job, which too often asks her to work with criminals she'd much rather put away. She understands the logic -- the small fish versus big fish pragmatism -- but that doesn't make acceptance easier. Someone else is less conflicted and is assassinating APO's shadier contacts. Only the calling card of a black star with the number 13 in its center hints at the culprit. When it becomes clear that a highly trained -- and lethal -- vigilante organization is interfering with APO's missions, Sydney must put aside her empathy and help shut down the mysterious \\"13 Stars.\\" But after Sydney herself is mistaken for a freelance terror agent, she worries that the mistake is not so far from the truth.

Rather, it is a way of reeducating a rider s mind and body to achieve greater balance in order to better communicate with the horse. Founder Sally Swift revolutionized riding by showing that good use of the human body makes a world of difference on horseback. Early in her work, she established what she calls the  Four Basics    centering, breathing, soft eyes, and building blocks which, together with grounding, are the main tenets of her method. When a rider learns and maintains these basics, then harmony between horse and human is possible. Sally Swift s first book, Centered Riding, made its revolutionary appearance in 1985 and continues as one of the best-selling horse books of all time. This second book doesn't replace the first one, it complements it. In the intervening years, Centered Riding continued to evolve, and Sally inevitably developed many new concepts and fresh imagery, all of which are presented here.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S5A8BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Friend 2 (Fear Street Series #50)","description":"At first Becka is merely intrigued when her new neighbor, Honey Perkins, claims that she and Becka were once best friends, but Becka soon becomes horrified as Honey begins to take over her life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PQLG5O3yM0UC&dq=Best+Friend+2+(Fear+Street+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding & Negotiating Turnkey Epc","description":"Mark Twain once derided the Book of Mormon as \\"chloroform in print.\\" Long and complicated, written in the language of the King James version of the Bible, it boggles the minds of many. Yet it is unquestionably one of the most influential books ever written. With over 140 million copies in print, it is a central text of one of the largest and fastest-growing faiths in the world. And, Grant Hardy shows, it's far from the coma-inducing doorstop caricatured by Twain. In Understanding the Book of Mormon, Hardy offers the first comprehensive analysis of the work's narrative structure in its 180 year history. Unlike virtually all other recent world scriptures, the Book of Mormon presents itself as an integrated narrative rather than a series of doctrinal expositions, moral injunctions, or devotional hymns. Hardy takes readers through its characters, events, and ideas, as he explores the story and its messages. He identifies the book's literary techniques, such as characterization, embedded documents, allusions, and parallel narratives. Whether Joseph Smith is regarded as author or translator, it's noteworthy that he never speaks in his own voice; rather, he mediates nearly everything through the narrators Nephi, Mormon, and Moroni. Hardy shows how each has a distinctive voice, and all are woven into an integral whole. As with any scripture, the contending views of the Book of Mormon can seem irreconcilable. For believers, it is an actual historical document, transmitted from ancient America. For nonbelievers, it is the work of a nineteenth-century farmer from upstate New York. Hardy transcends this intractable conflict by offering a literary approach, one appropriate to both history and fiction. Regardless of whether readers are interested in American history, literature, comparative religion, or even salvation, he writes, the book can best be read if we examine the text on its own terms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xa2NZBVldBEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decorating Glass & Ceramics : How to Embellish Glass, Ceramic, Terracotta and Tile Surfaces With Paint and Mosaic","description":"Clear, handsomely illustrated guide introduces the history, materials, tools, and techniques of glass engraving and other forms of glass decorating.

Despite his religious and artistic sophistication, Ryokan referred to himself as Great Fool and refused to place himself within the cultural elite of his age. In contrast to the typical Zen master of his time, who presided over a large monastery, trained students, and produced recondite religious treatises, Ryokan followed a life of mendicancy in the countryside. Instead of delivering sermons, he expressed himself through kanshi (poems composed in classical Chinese) and waka and could typically be found playing with the village children in the course of his daily rounds of begging. Great Fool is the first study in a Western language to offer a comprehensive picture of the legendary poet-monk and his oeuvre. It includes not only an extensive collection of the master's kanshi, topically arranged to facilitate an appreciation of Ryokan's colorful world, but selections of his waka, essays, and letters. The volume also presents for the first time in English the Ryokan zenji kiwa (Curious Accounts of the Zen Master Ryokan), a firsthand source composed by a former student less than sixteen years after Ryokan's death. Although it lacks chronological order, the Curious Account is invaluable for showing how Ryokan was understood and remembered by his contemporaries. It consists of colorful anecdotes and episodes, sketches from Ryokan's everyday life. To further assist the reader, three introductory essays approach Ryokan from the diverse perspectives of his personal history and literary work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7x_w5PuqmUsC&dq=Zen+Fool+Ryokan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Fur Trade of the Far West, Vol. 2","description":"Epic in sweep and reach, strongly written and superbly researched, The American Fur Trade of the Far West is a classic if there ever was one.

Researchers continue to pursue this question with vigor not only because Blacks currently lag behind Whites on a wide variety of educational indices but because the closing of the Black-White achievement gap has slowed and by some measures reversed during the last quarter of the 20th century. The social implications of the persistent educational 'gap' between Blacks and Whites are substantial. Black people's experience with poor school achievement and equally poor access to postsecondary education reduces their probability for achieving competitive economic and social rewards and are inconsistent with repeated evidence that Black people articulate high aspirations for their own educational and social mobility. Despite the social needs that press us towards making better sense of 'the gap, ' we are, nevertheless, limited in our understanding of how race operates to affect Black students' educational experiences and outcomes. In Beyond Acting White we contend with one of the most oft cited explanations for Black underachievement; the notion that Blacks are culturally opposed to 'acting White' and, therefore, culturally opposed to succeeding in school. Our book uses the 'acting White' hypothesis as the point of departure in order to explore and evaluate how and under what conditions Black culture and identity are implicated in our understanding of why Black students continue to lag behind their White peers in educational achievement and attainment. Beyond Acting White provides a response to the growing call that we more precisely situate how race, its representations, intersectionalities, and context specific contingencies help us make better sense of the Black-White achievement gap.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xTdGyAJbPtwC&dq=Beyond+Acting+White:+Reframing+the+Debate+on+Black+Student+Achievement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","description":"It is 2000 BC in Egypt and Imhotep the Ka-Priest brings home his beautiful young concubine Nofret.

It is also the quintessential example of postmodernist culture. This book studies how The Twilight Zone, The Prisoner, Twin Peaks, and The X-Files display many of the central characteristics that critics and theorists have associated with postmodernism, including fragmentation of narratives and characters, multiplicity in style and genre, and the collapse of traditional categorical boundaries of all kinds. While these inventive series also challenge many of the conventions of television programming itself, they do not, however, pose a subversive threat to the capitalist order. The book argues that instead, the very characteristics that identify these series as postmodern are also central characteristics of capitalism, especially in the late consumerist phase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0aQEDmwcoNgC&dq=Strange+TV:+Innovative+Television+Series+from+The+Twilight+Zone+to+The+X-Files&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colonial Habits: Convents and the Spiritual Economy of Cuzco, Peru","description":"A social and economic history of Peru that reflects the influence of the convents on colonial and post-colonial society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZOrYCyL3-ksC&dq=Colonial+Habits:+Convents+and+the+Spiritual+Economy+of+Cuzco,+Peru&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battle Pope","description":"If you missed out on Battle Pope the first time around, now is your chance to find out what everyone was talking about!

The stunning defeat of the controversial and secretive Multilateral Agreement on Investments, the massive worldwide WTO protests and the yearly meetings of the World Social Forum are testimony to its coming of age. From these significant victories, civil society continued to catch world attention with the Arab Spring, the grassroots movement that helped elect former US President Barack Obama and the significant gains of the anti-fracking campaign. With tens of millions of citizens and over a trillion dollars involved in advancing its agenda, civil society now joins the state and the market as the third key institution shaping globalization. However, it cannot fully mobilize its resources and power as it currently lacks clear understanding of its identity. Shaping Globalization argues that global civil society is a cultural institution wielding cultural power, and shows how  through the use of this distinct power  it can advance its agenda in the political and economic realms of society without compromising its identity. Nicanor Perlas outlines the strategic implications for civil society, both locally and globally, and explains that civil society s key task is to inaugurate  threefolding : the forging of strategic partnerships between civil society, government and business. Such authentic tri-sector partnerships are essential for advancing new ways for nations to develop, and for charting a different, sustainable type of globalization. Using the model of the Philippine Agenda 21, we are shown how civil society and progressive individuals and agencies in government and business are demonstrating the effectiveness of this new understanding to ensure that globalization benefits the environment, the poor and society as a whole.

The New York Times has even called his writing redemptive -- so satisfying as to \\"remind readers why they continue to cast their lines into the shrinking lake of contemporary fiction...his prose is not merely gorgeous, it's also terrifically funny; his humor is the ghastly variety embedded in everyday life.\\" Now, the critically acclaimed and bestselling author of Inspired Sleep delivers a collection of ten dazzling stories that not only show off Cohen's exhilarating prose and startling ironic humor but also provide a platform for his virtuoso range of tone and style and his ongoing investigation of the hazy, bedraggled American sensibility. In \\"Oscillations,\\" a man verbally paralyzed by his obsession with language retreats to a special institute, where he will relearn the art of communication. \\"Points of Interest\\" is an ingenious and timely exploration of the boundaries between life and art, as told through the revolving -- and dizzyingly revealing -- perspectives of its three self-absorbed protagonists. The title story features a hilariously out-of-touch psychology professor whose introductory lecture becomes an inadvertent confession of his own long, disastrous career of sexual mistakes. And in the more somber, moving \\"The Boys at Night,\\" a suburban teenager, on the fringes of a family crisis, makes his first tentative forays into maturity, discovering how accidents at once reveal, imperil, and sustain us. In each of these stories, the characters must wrestle with the slippery, invisible curtain between the world and their own fevered misapprehensions of it. What results is the urgently serious comedy we call Romanticism -- the yearning of the mind for contact with the actual, which is always receding from view. That these characters' desires and anxieties are familiar to us is the second thing we realize upon reading these stories. The first is how much we're laughing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nxiNAIdjZ8QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lord's oysters","description":"Nationally acclaimed when first published in 1957 by Atlantic/Little, Brown, The Lord's Oysters has never previously been available in a paperback edition.

Unlike traditional game theory models, which assume that all players are fully rational and have complete knowledge of details of the game, evolutionary models assume that people choose their strategies through a trial-and-error learning process in which they gradually discover that some strategies work better than others. In games that are repeated many times, low-payoff strategies tend to be weeded out, and an equilibrium may emerge.Larry Samuelson has been one of the main contributors to the evolutionary game theory literature. In Evolutionary Games and Equilibrium Selection, he examines the interplay between evolutionary game theory and the equilibrium selection problem in noncooperative games. After providing an overview of the basic issues of game theory and a presentation of the basic models, the book addresses evolutionary stability, the dynamics of sample paths, the ultimatum game, drift, noise, backward and forward induction, and strict Nash equilibria.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=88zpfLLE9G4C&dq=Evolutionary+Games+and+Equilibrium+Selection+(Economic+Learning+and+Social+Evolution)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business: The Key Concepts (Routledge Key Guides)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science (Concise Encyclopedia of Psychology)","description":"Edited by high caliber experts, and contributed to by quality researchers and practitioners in psychology and related fields.

Feasts that include a bounty of land and sea are the focal point of celebrations and ceremonies; for many, food is what connects them to family, community, and the afterlife. Where People Feast, one of the few indigenous cookbooks available, focuses on Canadian west coast Native cuisine, which takes advantage of the area's abundant seafood, game, fruits, and vegetables - with ingredients both exotic (oolichan, venison, grouse) and common (salmon, crab, berries). Dolly Watts and her daughter Annie are from the Gitk'san First Nation in British Columbia, and are the proprietors of the Liliget Feast House in Vancouver, the only First Nations fine dining establishment of its kind. For almost two decades, Dolly and (later) Annie have focused on serving Native cuisine that is both traditional and modern; while many recipes are steeped in history, others are contemporary takes that acknowledge other cuisines both near and far. The book includes 16 full-colour photographs, and 120 delectable dishes that can be easily replicated by chefs at home; the authors also offer plenty of handy suggestions and substitution ideas. For Dolly and Annie, Where People Feast is the culmination of a lifetime's work dedicated to introducing people to the extraordinary foods that are truly North American. Recipes include Smoked Salmon Mousse, Indian Tacos, Venison Meatballs, Alder-Grilled Breast of Pheasant, Blackberry-Glazed Beets, Wild Rice Pancakes, Seaweed and Salmon Roe Soup, and Wild Blueberry Cobbler.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3WqwKVBgYnEC&dq=The+Peoples%27+Cook+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dynamical Cognitive Science (Bradford Books)","description":"An introduction to the application of dynamical systems science to the cognitive sciences. Dynamical Cognitive Science makes available to the cognitive science community the analytical tools and techniques of dynamical systems science, adding the variables of change and time to the study of human cognition. The unifying theme is that human behavior is an \\"unfolding in time\\" whose study should be augmented by the application of time-sensitive tools from disciplines such as physics, mathematics, and economics, where change over time is of central importance. The book provides a fast-paced, comprehensive introduction to the application of dynamical systems science to the cognitive sciences. Topics include linear and nonlinear time series analysis, chaos theory, complexity theory, relaxation oscillators, and metatheoretical issues of modeling and theory building. Tools and techniques are discussed in the context of their application to basic cognitive science problems, including perception, memory, psychophysics, judgment and decision making, and consciousness. The final chapter summarizes the contemporary study of consciousness and suggests how dynamical approaches to cognitive science can help to advance our understanding of this central concept.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g1ZMAoWGYesC&dq=Dynamical+Cognitive+Science+(Bradford+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War Against the Mafia (Mack Bolan: the Executioner)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","description":"Beloved Food Network personality, restaurateur, and author Paula Deen loves a party, and in her latest book, Paula Deen Celebrates!, Paula shares with fans old and new how she celebrates a year's worth of holidays and special occasions.

However, this multiprocessor design technique is tough to implement, because it requires the engineer to write twice the code. Further, the designs resulting from such a marriage are limited because two processors cost more, take up more physical space, require more memory, and use up more power than just one would. And so a new kind of processor, the EMP (embedded media processor), was born! An embedded media processor combines the best aspects of a traditional microncontroller and a DSP for use in a multimedia product. As the demand grows for smaller, faster, multifunction, portable embedded products, such as video-enabled cellphones and pda's that play music or games, EMP's become more popular. As a result, an increasing number of engineers need to migrate from using multiprocessor methods to using EMP's in their designs. This book is the one-stop shop for the many engineers who need to understand what embedded media processors can do, and how to implement them. KEY FEATURES: comprehensive subject coverage with emphasis on practical application essential assembly language code included throughout many real-world examples using Analog's popular Blackfin Processor architecture This book provides information that engineers cannot get anywhere else. The discussion of EMP's is general enough to assure that engineers using any EMP, not just the Blackfin, will benefit from it. The book's in-depth analysis will allow engineers to decrease product development times and increase robust design for applications in multimedia. For about $50, the engineer is equipped by the experts and empowered to succeed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4auaDSdzLwsC&dq=Embedded+Media+Processing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sparkplug of the Hornets","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ANaAswEACAAJ&dq=Sparkplug+of+the+Hornets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Hope for People with Depression: Your Friendly, Authoritative Guide to the Latest in Traditional and Complementary Solutions","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Joshua's Way","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xZoCAAAACAAJ&dq=Joshua%27s+Way&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Numerology, Astrology & Dreams","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The origins of the world war,","description":"Discusses and examines the possible causes of World War I.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2EyJY8uE4WYC&dq=The+origins+of+the+world+war,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A handful of thieves","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BRXlkOFICRwC&dq=A+handful+of+thieves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foolproof Indian Cooking: Step by Step to Everyone's Favorite Indian Recipes","description":"In Foolproof Indian Cooking, Madhur Jaffrey reveals how easy it is to bring the flavors of India to your home.

Delilah, the most listened-to woman on American radio, has distinguished herself as the  Queen of Sappy Love Songs  and America s ultimate romance guru. But Delilah s life off-air is all the more extraordinary a life full of trials, forgiveness, faith, and adventure. In One Heart at a Time, Delilah s heartfelt account of her own story reveals what shaped the voice that 9 million listeners know and love. Today, Delilah is the founder of an NGO called Point Hope, the owner of a 55-acre working farm, and an inductee of the National Radio Hall of Fame. But to achieve this, she often had to pave her own way. Disowned by her father, divorced, and fired from a dozen jobs over the years, Delilah pushed forward through family addiction and devastating loss, through glass ceilings and red tape. Her consistent goal to help those in need took her everywhere from the streets of Philadelphia to refugee camps in Ghana. Along the way, Delilah was blessed by thirteen children ten of them adopted. Though many of them contend with special needs and the forever effects of a broken foster care system, her children have been able to transform their own remarkable lessons into guiding lights for other kids in need. Just as Delilah has done. One Heart at a Time exposes the real woman behind the microphone. In her easy-going style and characteristic, beloved voice, Delilah tells her deeply moving life story as the series of miracles it is.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5cVWDwAAQBAJ&dq=Delilah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus, Judaism, and Christian Anti-Judaism: Reading the New Testament after the Holocaust","description":"Current scholarship in the study of ancient Christianity is now available to nonspecialists through this collection of essays on anti-Judaism in the New Testament and in New Testament interpretation. While academic writing can be obscure and popular writing can be uncritical, this group of experts has striven to write as simply and clearly as possible on topics that have been hotly contested. The essays are arranged around the historical figures and canonical texts that matter most to Christian communities and whose interpretation has fed the negative characterizations of Jews and Judaism.

Political contestation is premised on people's capacity for offering competing visions of the future, but in a world that has run out of political ideas and no longer harbors any utopian visions, real political opposition is no longer possible. In particular, Jacoby traces the demise of liberal and leftist politics. Leftist intellectuals and critics no longer envision a different society, only a modified one. The left once dismissed the market as exploitative, but now honors it as rational and humane. The left used to disdain mass culture, but now celebrates it as rebellious. The left once rejected pluralism as superficial, but now resurrects pluralist ideas in the guise of multiculturalism.Ranging across a wide terrain of cultural and political phenomena the end of the Cold War, the rise of multiculturalism, the acceptance of mass culture, the eclipse of independent intellectuals Jacoby documents and laments a widespread retreat from the utopian spirit that has always been the engine for social and political change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0QfWtAEACAAJ&dq=The+End+Of+Utopia:+Politics+And+Culture+In+An+Age+Of+Apathy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"House & garden cookbook","description":"From the nationally beloved co-host of the #1 hit show Home Town comes the quintessential celebration of home.

His warm and imaginative portrayals and stories of people, animals, or such fantastic creatures as gnomes are loved by readers of all generations. His countless fans will be enchanted by this intriguing new book, Daily Life in Holland in the Year 1566, And the Story of My Ancestor's Treasure Chest. To create this latest gem, Poortvliet found inspiration in the rich legacy of Dutch landscape and genre painting traditions and in his own Dutch heritage as well. He became intrigued by a document dating from the year 1566 that revealed the existence of an armoire owned by his distant ancestor, Jacob Jansz Poortvliet. That armoire led Rien Poortvliet to come upon something valuable indeed - a treasure trove of insights into the world of his ancestor. Characteristically evocative, the words and images in Daily Life in Holland are rich in detail and delicate in coloration, and perhaps the most beautiful of any of Poortvliet's works to date. In this fascinating saga, he recreates the lives of his forebears as they toiled and celebrated their way through daily existence. He does not conjure up a romantic vision of the past - the Dutch countryside was not all tulips and windmills! There were adversity and hard work, and we learn that 1566 was an extraordinary year in Holland, marked by famine and plague, great freezes, floods and droughts, comets and earthquakes, and an invasion by the Spanish as well. Poortvliet's colorful account unfolds before us to reveal how ordinary men, women, and children lived: what kinds of clothes they wore, what their houses were like, what they are and how theycooked. How did they celebrate Christmas? What did the people do for a living and what kind of money did they have? What did a girl's engagement ring look like? How many different kinds of swords and firearms did they have? Exploring his own roots, Poortvliet captures the beauty of everyday life and livelihood in turbulent sixteenth-century Holland. Rien Poortvliet is recognized as the greatest living Dutch artist. He first won acclaim in this country when Abram's Gnomes and Secrets of the Gnomes (text by Wil Huygen) became best-sellers. His other Abrams books - Dutch Treat, The Living Forest, The Farm Book, Dogs, The Book of the Sandman, In My Grandfather's House, and Noah's Ark - have also won a devoted following. His works are popular as well in Australian, Canadian, Danish, German, Finnish, French, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish, and Yugoslavian editions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uvnFQgAACAAJ&dq=Daily+Life+in+Holland+in+the+Year+1566+And+the+Story+of+My+Ancestor%27s+Treasure+Chest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Cat: Feline Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","description":"This handsome little book is better for your cat and longer lasting than any canned treat.

Eventually he lands at the Hotel Portugal in Lisbon, where he anxiously awaits a visa to Angola.

Using recently declassified FBI files, Antonio Mu?oz Molina reconstructs Ray s final steps through the Portuguese capital, taking us inside his feverish mind, troubled past, and infamous crime. But Lisbon is also the city that inspired Mu?oz Molina s first novel, A Winter in Lisbon, and as he returns now, thirty years later, it becomes the stage for and witness to three alternating stories: Ray in 1968 at the center of an international manhunt; a thirty-year-old Mu?oz Molina in 1987 struggling to find his literary voice; and the author in the present, reflecting on his life and the form of the novel as an instrument for imagining the world through another person s eyes.

His ingenious and effective designs had a deep, lasting influence on the evolution of the motor car and on the wider history of industrial design, and he deserves to be ranked with the other giants of the field like Ferdinand Porsche in Germany and Dante Giacosa in Italy.

Jonathan Wood's meticulously researched, penetrating study of this flawed genius of automobile design offers a rounded portrait of his life and work, and places him squarely in the context of his times.

Marjorie Main is best remembered for her portrayal of the farm mother of 15 children and wife of shiftless Pa Kettle. The characters were introduced in the 1945 film The Egg and I, and were such a hit that eight films followed. At an age when most actresses  careers are waning, Main s star was just beginning to rise. In real life, Main was as down to earth as characters she played. Her attire on the set and around her house were the same: a simple cotton house dress or jeans. She preferred riding the bus because she enjoyed interacting with regular people the inspiration for her characters. This book chronicles Main s childhood on an Indiana farm and the inspirations that led her to the stage. After a distinguished theater career and minor film roles, at age 50 she was offered a long-term contract with premier studio MGM. Details of her acting career and personal life covered here include her marriage to a scholarly widower 26 years her senior, and her work with actor Percy Kilbride, who was the antithesis of his character, the slothful Pa Kettle. A detailed filmography includes cast and credit lists and trivia about each of Main s 85 films.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J-NXUr1_IDQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Easy-to-duplicate floral borders: 54 copyright-free designs (Dover quick copy art)","description":"Bold, high-contrast graphics feature a wide range of flower, leaf and vine combinations. 42 full-page and 12 half-page border designs depict tulips, dogwood, English ivy, roses, oak leaves and acorns, carnations, chrysanthemums, pine branches, holly and other floral motifs.

The truly fantastic pictures speak more than a thousand words as artist Scott Gustafson riffs in paint on themes present and imagined in each verse. Nursery rhymes are classic, and so are some of the artist's interpretations. But other paintings are surprises, like an anthropomorphic baking bear, a pelican sea captain, and Peter Piper as a pug on two legs. Welcome to a world where \\"There Was a Crooked Man\\" is not about a hunchbacked senior but rather a madcap, double-jointed dandy who might be \\"crooked\\" in more ways than one. Jack (Be Nimble) is a leaping cricket and Yankee Doodle a fun-loving chipmunk on a fullsize horse. Scott Gustafson's unique style, influenced by legendary book illustrators Arthur Rackham and N. C.

Rosenberg. \\"... The Last Jihad absolutely crackles with high energy and a chilling premise--what if the war on terror goes nuclear.\\" -- Rush Limbaugh Jon Bennett is a top Wall Street strategist turned senior White House advisor. But nothing has prepared him for the terror that he will face. Saddam Hussein dispatches his top hit men to assassinate the President of the United States. Iraqi terrorists spread carnage throughout London, Paris, and Riyadh . . . and the Butcher of Baghdad has a nuclear ace in his hand that he has not yet played. Only a solid Arab-Isreali coalition against Iraq can keep the U.S.--and other Western nations--from certain devastation. And only Bennett and his beautiful partner, Erin McCoy, can make that happen. Their secret project--a billion-dollar oil deal off the coast of Gaza--could be the basis for an historic peace treaty and enormous wealth for every Isreali and Palestinian. But just before a treaty can be signed, Isreali commandos foil an Iraqi Scud missile launch, recovering a nuclear warhead and evidence that the next attack will level Washington, New York and Tel Aviv. Now, the Isreali Prime Minister gives the American President an ultimatum: Melt down Baghdad within one hour . . . or Israel will do it herself. From Jerusalem, Bennett and McCoy must summon all their stealth and savvy to save themselves--and the world--from absolute destruction.

Located at the foot of a sacred mountain at the heart of a culture based on wet-rice cultivation, Chiang Mai was the capital of a kingdom called Lan Na that rivalled Ayutthaya, the Siamese precursor to Bangkok, for 200 years. However, with an inland location unable to take advantage of maritime trade, and with a cultivable land area too small to support the manpower required for large armies, Lan Na was to disappear in the struggle between Burma and Siam, and was ultimately eclipsed by the rise of Bangkok as the metropolitan heart of the Kingdom of Thailand. Chiang Mai, however, was to remain the center of Northern Thai culture. With the expertise of a resident, Oliver Hargreave first presents Chiang Mai as a historical city with traditions that have evolved into a thriving modern culture. Then he takes the city as a starting point for journeys into the picturesque landscape of the surrounding valley and mountains.

All three lived in the famed city of Shiraz, a provincial capital of south-central Iran, and all three drew support from arts-loving rulers during a time better known for its violence than its creative brilliance. Here Dick Davis, an award-winning poet widely considered  our finest translator of Persian poetry  (The Times Literary Supplement), presents a diverse selection of some of the best poems by these world-renowned authors and shows us the spiritual and secular aspects of love, in varieties embracing every aspect of the human heart.

The locomotive industry provides a valuable case study of business practices and dramatic shifts in innovation patterns, since two companies--General Motors and General Electric--that had no traditional ties to locomotive production demolished established steam locomotive manufacturers. Albert Churella uses many previously untapped sources to illustrate how producers responded to technological change, particularly between the 1920s and the 1960s. Companies discussed include the American Locomotive Company (ALCo), the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the Lima Locomotive Works, Fairbanks-Morse, the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors, and General Electric. A comparative work of business history and the history of technology, the book is not a complete history of any locomotive builder, nor does it explore the origins of the diesel engine in great detail. What it does, and does superbly, is to demonstrate how managers addressed radical shifts in technology and production methods. Churella reveals that managerial culture and corporate organizational routines, more than technological competency per se, allowed some companies to succeed, yet constrained the actions of others. He details the shift from small-batch custom manufacturing techniques in the steam locomotive industry to mass-production methods in the diesel locomotive industry. He also explains that chance events and fortuitous technological linkages helped to shape competitive patterns in the locomotive industry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wHGfrlQV4d0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All those folks from Saint Patrick's: The Irish community of rural Maple Grove, Wisconsin","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KlT-HAAACAAJ&dq=All+those+folks+from+Saint+Patrick%27s:+The+Irish+community+of+rural+Maple+Grove,+Wisconsin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cherokee Dance and Drama (The Civilization of the American Indian series)","description":"Traditionally, the Cherokees dance to ensure individual health and social welfare.

The summer dance (the Green Corn Ceremony and the Ballplayer s Dance) are associated with crops and vegetation.

Mexican people and their culture have been continuously present in the territory for the past four hundred years, and Mexican Americans were actors in United States history long before the national media began to focus on them even long before an international border existed between the United States and Mexico. North to Aztl n, an inclusive, readable, and affordable survey history, explores the Indian roots, culture, society, lifestyles, politics, and art of Mexican Americans and the contributions of the people to and their influence on American history and the mainstream culture. Though cognizant of changing interpretations that divide scholars, Drs. De Le n and Griswold del Castillo provide a holistic vision of the development of Mexican American society, one that attributes great importance to immigration (before and after 1900) and the ongoing influence of new arrivals on the evolving identity of Mexican Americans. Also showcased is the role of gender in shaping the cultural and political history of La Raza, as exemplified by the stories of outstanding Mexicana and Chicana leaders as well as those of largely unsung female heros, among them ranch and business owners and managers, labor leaders, community activists, and artists and writers. In short, readers will come away from this extensively revised and completely up-to-date second edition with a new understanding of the lives of a people who currently compose the largest minority in the nation. Completely revised, re-edited, and redesigned, featuring a great many new photographs and maps, North to Aztl n is certain to take its rightful place as the best college-level survey text of Americans of Mexican descent on the market today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NNvWDwAAQBAJ&dq=North+to+Aztlan+:+A+History+of+Mexican+Americans+in+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","description":"Agatha Christie's most daring crime mystery - an early and particularly brilliant outing of Hercule Poirot, 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd', with its legendary twist, changed the detective fiction genre for ever.Roger Ackroyd knew too much.

His youth could be characterized as sometimes mischievous, his older years as generally eccentric and his writing as always provocative. Twain left a literary canon of nearly 50 books, hundreds of short stories and essays, and a veritable treasury of quotable epigrams. While his words and his works have stood up to the test of time, knowing the man behind the persona, and understanding what inspired and influenced the writer, is crucial to fully appreciating the contributions Twain made to American literature. By skillfully weaving together strands of history with his personal story, this authoritative biography helps readers come to more fully understand the man and his enduring legacy. Starting with a chapter on Clemens' boyhood, readers are treated to a very personal view of Twain's early life. Twain's adult life is chronicled with five expertly developed chapters that explore his early professional years from printer to pilot, his travels westward and abroad, his gilded years with his beloved wife Livy, and his final years of widowhood and decline. This engaging biography also delves into the enduring impact of Twain's creative voice and his unique blend of humor with social commentary that not only entertained but also challenged thinking and changed the literary landscape forever. This biography draws from the best of established Twain resources and scholarship, and adds fresh new perspectives from personal letters, original manuscripts, and extended study visits to important places including Twain's study and Quarry Farm. This work is written in a lively style that Twain himself would appreciate and students will enjoy. Researchers hoping to dig deeper into the Twain legacy will benefit from the expertly compiled information and documentation of resources offered here. A chronology, a bibliography and five additional fact-filled appendices, including quotes from Twain, books by Twain, and a rendering of his family tree will help readers get a solid handle on the details as well as the big picture of Mark Twain's life and legacy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UDNpTISRmUQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Mexico (Portrait of America)","description":"This collection of elegantly composed black-and-white images by one of New Mexico s most accomplished photographers, celebrates the state s captivating physical variety and enduring allure.

In the past, however, the techniques used by scientists to interpret this data have not progressed as quickly. This is a book of modern statistical methods for analysis of practical problems in water quality and water resources. The last fifteen years have seen major advances in the fields of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and robust statistical methods. The 'real-life' characteristics of environmental data tend to drive analysis towards the use of these methods. These advances are presented in a practical and relevant format. Alternate methods are compared, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each as applied to environmental data. Techniques for trend analysis and dealing with water below the detection limit are topics covered, which are of great interest to consultants in water-quality and hydrology, scientists in state, provincial and federal water resources, and geological survey agencies. The practising water resources scientist will find the worked examples using actual field data from case studies of environmental problems, of real value. Exercises at the end of each chapter enable the mechanics of the methodological process to be fully understood, with data sets included on diskette for easy use. The result is a book that is both up-to-date and immediately relevant to ongoing work in the environmental and water sciences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cYb_Dv8U1QIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Twelve Days of Christmas (Correspondence)","description":"The classic Christmas carol is told with a very special twist.

A philosophy major with no formal culinary training, Christopher Kostow is not your typical Napa Valley chef. While there are many popular restaurants in Napa and cookbooks about its chefs, restaurants, and cooking styles, there is no chef who is more deeply rooted in and affected by the place in which he works. Beyond the Vineyard will follow Kostow's evolution from a line cook in a seaside town to a three-Michelin-starred chef at Meadowood, a Napa Valley mainstay that the Wall Street Journal recently labeled a \\"world class culinary splurge\\" and \\"temple of modern American cuisine.\\" Through artfully constructed recipes and stories--of discovering a bounty of wild ingredients in the woods near his St. Helena home, or spending afternoons firing pottery with local ceramists--Kostow introduces readers to a new Napa, one that's rich in local flavor and a strong sense of community\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zQhwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Napa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pasquala of Santa Ynez Mission","description":"This is a new release of the original 1948 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=otGgngEACAAJ&dq=Pasquala+of+Santa+Ynez+Mission&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Song of the Brook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qel_SwAACAAJ&dq=Song+of+the+Brook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Thousand Shall Fall","description":"Franz hasel, a 40-year-old pacifist, was drafted and assigned to Pioneer Company 699, Hitler's elite troops who built bridges at the front lines.

Norman Lockyer believed that ancient Egyptian monuments were constructed \\"in strict relation to the stars.\\" In this celebrated study, he explores the relationship between astronomy and architecture in the age of the pharaohs. Lockyer addresses one of the many points already extensively investigated by Egyptologists: the chronology of the kings of Egypt. All experts are in accord regarding the identity of the first monarch, but they cannot agree upon the dates of his reign within a thousand years. The author contends that by applying a knowledge of astronomy to the actual site orientation of the region's pyramids and temples, accurate dating can be achieved. In order to accomplish this, Lockyer had to determine the level of the ancient Egyptian ideas of astronomy. Some of his inferences have been invalidated by subsequent scholarship, but many of his other conclusions stand firm and continue to provide sensational leads into contemporary understanding of archaic astronomy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7ZaRDQAAQBAJ&dq=Dawn+of+Astronomy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snake Country","description":"In Snake country, a fictional work, a group of students learn about snakes first hand when one student is bitten by a snake on a field trip.

The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content, the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis. Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of \\"generalized instrumental variables\\" (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the \\"generalized estimating equation\\" literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain \\"obvious\\" procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yov6AQAAQBAJ&dq=Econometric+Analysis+of+Cross+Section+and+Panel+Data&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Five Pennies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Functional MRI","description":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the most popular method for imaging brain function.

New partnerships and alliances are constantly being forged, the lines between industries have blurred, and it has become difficult to tell one business from another, and who's competing with whom.

Using biological ecology as a metaphor, it reveals how today's business environment parallels the natural world, and how, just like organisms in nature, companies must coexist and coevolve within their own business ecosystems. Through numerous examples, he explains the radically new cooperative/competitive relationships like the one forged between IBM and Microsoft and provides a comprehensive framework businesses can use to enhance their own collaborations with their customers, suppliers, investors and communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5d8yDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Shakespeare\\" identified in Edward De Vere, the seventeenth earl of Oxford,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B004AAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Runway zero-eight,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t_7yAAAAMAAJ&dq=Runway+zero-eight,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Health careers today workbook","description":"Reinforce your understanding of health care skills and careers with practical exercises!

Dark Nights of the Soul presents these metaphoric dark nights not as the enemy, but as times of transition, occasions to restore yourself, and transforming rites of passage, revealing an uplifting and inspiring new outlook on such topics as: ? The healing power of melancholy ? The sexual dark night and the mysteries of matrimony ? Finding solace during illness and in aging ? Anxiety, anger, and temporary Insanities ?

This collection is perfect for some bed time reading, or anyone looking for a more kid friendly version of the  Brothers Grimm  fairy tales. Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) was an author, abolitionist and proud feminist.

Her writing became her outlet, forming her ideas and beliefs in the empowerment of women and people in to literature that reverberates to this day.

Awaiting news of his father s death and the substantial inheritance to follow, Sebastian barely has time for his studies as he chases women, avoids bill collectors, and tries to survive without having to descend into the bottomless pit of steady work. In the words of Sean O Reilly,  this man has granted himself the appalling right to say and think whatever the hell he likes.

For veteran pastor and preaching professor Edmund Clowney it will not do to preach a text from either the Old or New Testaments without fully preaching its ultimate and primary focus-the person and work of Jesus Christ. He writes, \\"To see the text in relation to Christ is to see it in its larger context, the context of God's purpose in revelation.\\" Clowney's rationale for emphasizing Christ's presence in the Old Testament rests on the purpose of the Hebrew Scripture. The Old Testament follows God's one great plan for human history and redemption, and the plan is not only from him but centers on him: his presence in his incarnate Son. The witness of the Scriptures to Christ is the reason they were written, so it is appropriate to emphasize this element in the Old Testament as well as in the New Testament. By offering numerous full-length examples of his own sermons that emphasize Christ as the principle theme of Scripture, Clowney illustrates for those who will never have the privilege of being his students how they can craft sermons which present Christ as the primary consideration of the text. He also offers specific instructions on preparing such a sermon. He discusses the personal habits of prayer and Bible study that prepare pastors to seek out Christ's presence. Clowney emphasizes the importance of including a specific application in every sermon so that Christ is presented both in what he says and does to reveal himself in the biblical text and in what he says and does to direct Christians' lives today. Students preparing for the pastorate, pastors desiring to increase their emphasis on Christ in their sermons, and those seeking Christ's presence in all of Scripture will find a help in Clowney's writings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Ff10pgicTUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CYRUS THE UNSINKABLE SEA SERPENT","description":"Cyrus, a shy and friendly serpent, finally realizes his ambition by heroically helping some voyagers through a storm and foiling some dastardly pirates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QyS-0g4BtHIC&dq=CYRUS+THE+UNSINKABLE+SEA+SERPENT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diatriba de amor contra un hombre sentado: Monologo en un acto (Teatro colombiano) (Spanish Edition)","description":"A selection of Garc a M rquez' journalism from the late 1940s to the mid-1980","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VMOSDwAAQBAJ&dq=Diatriba+de+amor+contra+un+hombre+sentado:+Monologo+en+un+acto+(Teatro+colombiano)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FileNet: A Consultant's Guide to Enterprise Content Management","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mediation Process: Practical Strategies for Resolving Conflict","description":"Provides mediators and other professionals who use mediationsuch as lawyers, therapists, and personnel managerswith comprehensive, step-by-step instruction in effective dispute resolution strategies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=owLvAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Mediation+Process:+Practical+Strategies+for+Resolving+Conflict&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Complementary Medicine Hb (Encyclopaedia of)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Practicing Physics for Conceptual Physics","description":"This book is filled with computational exercise, misconception-busting questions, analogies, and straightforward practice questions and problems that help students  tie it all together.

Shirer observed that they carried cameras and behaved as \\"na?ve tourists.\\" One of the first things Hitler did after his victory was to tour occupied Paris, where he was famously photographed in front of the Eiffel Tower. Focusing on tourism by German personnel, military and civil, and French civilians during the war, as well as war-related memory tourism since, War Tourism addresses the fundamental linkages between the two. As Bertram M. Gordon shows, Germans toured occupied France by the thousands in groups organized by their army and guided by suggestions in magazines such as Der Deutsche Wegleiter fr Paris [The German Guide for Paris]. Despite the hardships imposed by war and occupation, many French civilians continued to take holidays. Facilitated by the Popular Front legislation of 1936, this solidified the practice of workers' vacations, leading to a postwar surge in tourism. After the end of the war, the phenomenon of memory tourism transformed sites such as the Maginot Line fortresses. The influx of tourists with links either directly or indirectly to the war took hold and continues to play a significant economic role in Normandy and elsewhere. As France moved from wartime to a postwar era of reconciliation and European Union, memory tourism has held strong and exerts significant influence across the country.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4VBtDwAAQBAJ&dq=Michelin+Battle+of+Alsace+Map+No.+104&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jackie (Ariel Books)","description":"AMP's personality titles take a snapshot look at the lives of today's most popular entertainers, sports figures, and even a prince.

Investigating the causes of this fracture, Guobin Yang argues that Chinese youth engaged in an imaginary revolution from 1966 to 1968, enacting a political mythology that encouraged violence as a way to prove one's revolutionary credentials. This same competitive dynamic would later turn the Red Guard against the communist government. Throughout the 1970s, the majority of Red Guard youth were sent to work in rural villages, where they developed an appreciation for the values of ordinary life. From this experience, an underground cultural movement was born. Rejecting idolatry, these relocated revolutionaries developed a new form of resistance that signaled a new era of enlightenment, culminating in the Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970s and the Tiananmen protest of 1989. Yang's final chapter on the politics of history and memory argues that contemporary memories of the Cultural Revolution are factionalized along these lines of political division, formed fifty years before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FcV1CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","description":"One-volume edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g9OVAAAACAAJ&dq=Christian+Prayer:+The+Liturgy+of+the+Hours+(Prayer+and+Inspiration)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Power: Study Skills to Enhance Your Learning and Your Grades","description":"Easy-to-use self-teaching manual teaches students from elementary to medical school develope vital skills that help in every stage of learning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qU4kAQAAMAAJ&dq=Study+Power:+Study+Skills+to+Enhance+Your+Learning+and+Your+Grades&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Was Just Wondering","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Return of the Evil Twin (Sweet Valley High)","description":"The nightmare had seemed to be over for Jessica and Elizabeth when Margo, the twins' lookalike who tried to move in on their lives, died violently, but now Margo's twin Nora has come seeking revenge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZRewzgEACAAJ&dq=Return+of+the+Evil+Twin+(Sweet+Valley+High)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Augustus John - The New Biography","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Will and the Way: Paul R.

In this analysis Charles Dempsey examines the poetry written by Lorenzo and his literary clients in order to give definition to the cultural context in which the \\"Primavera\\" was created. A celebration of Love, the painting is shown to incorporate both public and private imaginative realms while embracing the ideal and the actual experiences of the present. The \\"Primavera,\\" depicting Venus as the spirit of Love and springtime, is simultaneously old-fashioned and modern, rooted in International-Style vernacular conventions and evincing a nascent classical vocabulary. After describing the profoundly humanist classical foundation of the invention of the \\"Primavera,\\" Dempsey identifies its genre with rustic song, then relates the painting to the conventions of vernacular love poetry. A close reading of the painting in relation to works by Lorenzo, Politian, Pulci, and other poets working to elevate vernacular expression by infusing native Tuscan with Latin forms suggests how the idea of Love portrayed by Botticelli in the form of Venus incorporates not only the ancient springtime \\"renovatio mundi\\" but also the actual cultural renovation--the Renaissance--imagined and sponsored by Lorenzo the Magnificent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J469GwAACAAJ&dq=The+Portrayal+of+Love:+Botticelli%27s+Primavera+and+Humanist+Culture+at+the+Time+of+Lorenzo+the+Magnificent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","description":"Powerful.

In their time they were the most westerly settlements in American territory, and they attracted a lively and varied population of mavericks from more civilized parts of the world-from what became New Mexico to the south and from as far east as England. The inhabitants of these little walled towns thrived on the rigor and freedom of frontier life. Many were ex-trappers full already of frontier expertise. Others were enthusiastic neophytes happy to escape problems back home. They sought Mexican wives in Taos or Santa Fe or allied themselves with the native Indian tribes, or both. The fur trade and the illegal liquor trade with the Indians were at first the mainstays of their economy. As time went on they extended their activities to farming illegally on the land owned by the Indians and trading their crops and other trade articles. They enjoyed themselves hunting, gambling, trading, and with their women, freely mixing Spanish, Indian, and Anglo-American cultures in a community without laws or bigotry. This idyll was brought to a close by the Mexican War and the lure of the California Gold Rush of 1849. The expectation of a railroad on the Arkansas brought many of the settlers back, only to be scared away again by the massacre of Pueblo by the Utes in 1854 of which Mrs. Lecompte has reconstructed a very complete record. When the gold seekers rushed to Pikes Peak in 1858 and stayed to establish farms and towns, some of the pioneers of the early days returned with them, and shared their skills and knowledge to make possible the permanent settlements that resulted. Mrs. Lecompte has documented the history of the region from diaries, letters, and the reports of such distinguished passers-by as J. C. Fremont and Francis Parkman. The result is a complete and compelling account of a neglected part of American frontier life. It is illustrated with more than fifty photographs and contemporary drawings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jgo6zit5b2sC&dq=Pueblo,+Hardscrabble,+Greenhorn:+Society+on+the+High+Plains,+1832-1856&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","description":"Today's workforce is quicker, sharper, more visually oriented, and more technology-savvy than ever.

Richard Longstreth is one of the few historians to focus on ordinary commercial buildings buildings usually associated with commercial builders and real estate developers rather than architects and thus generally overlooked by historians of \\"high\\" architecture. Here Longstreth explores the early development of two kinds of retail space that have become ubiquitous in the United States in the second half of the twentieth century. One, external, is devoted to the circulation and parking of automobiles on retail premises. Longstreth analyzes the origins of this development in the 1910s and 1920s, with the super service station and then the drive-in market. The other type of space, internal, was introduced soon thereafter with the single-story supermarket. The most innovative aspect of the supermarket was how its interior was designed for high-volume turnover of a large selection of goods with a minimum of staff assistance. Longstreth focuses on Los Angeles, the principal center for the development of both kinds of space, during the period from the mid-1910s to the early 1940s. This richly illustrated study integrates architectural, cultural, economic, and urban factors to describe the evolution of retailing and how it has affected the urban landscape.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3skDADOHE9UC&dq=The+Drive-In,+the+Supermarket,+and+the+Transformation+of+Commercial+Space+in+Los+Angeles,+1914-1941&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legbreakers and Heartbreakers (The Gunsmith #187)","description":"Clint Adams suddenly finds himself laid up in the one-horse town of Tucumcari, New Mexico.

By comparison, the coverage of digital hardware has been meagre: in particular, books on logic circuit interconnections have been scarce in number. When circuits operated at relatively low speeds this did not cause major problems to engineers and students, but the increasing use of fast, and very fast, logic circuits employed extensively in modern digital systems has brought the requirement for properly-designed transmission paths between printed circuit boards, on the boards, and even in the integrated circuit packages themselves. turn, has necessitated a physical understanding of line pulse This, in behaviour, and an ability to design practically appropriate interconnection systems, by a far wider audience of engineers, scientists and students than has been the case hitherto. For many years the study of transmission lines was, primarily, the province of the telecommunications engineer sending high-frequency radio signals to antennas for radiation into space, and the power engineer working at low frequencies (50/60 Hz) but with corresponding wavelengths comparable with the relatively large distances involved in the supply of power from generating stations to remote users. The textbook treatment of lines was well established, but based mainly on the assumption of sinusoidal signals. This 'frequency-domain' approach is not best suited to the understanding of the transmission of digital signals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=41LtBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modesty : A Fresh Look at a Biblical Principle","description":"Updated with a new introduction, this fifteenth anniversary edition of A Return to Modesty reignites Wendy Shalit s controversial claim that we have lost our respect for an essential virtue: modesty. When A Return to Modesty was first published in 1999, its argument launched a worldwide discussion about the possibility of innocence and romantic idealism. Wendy Shalit was the first to systematically critique the \\"hook-up\\" scene and outline the harms of making sexuality so public. Today, with social media increasingly blurring the line between public and private life, and with child exploitation on the rise, the concept of modesty is more relevant than ever. Updated with a new preface that addresses the unique problems facing society now, A Return to Modesty shows why \\"the lost virtue\\" of modesty is not a hang-up that we should set out to cure, but rather a wonderful instinct to be celebrated. A Return to Modesty is a deeply personal account as well as a fascinating intellectual exploration into everything from seventeenth-century manners to the 1948 tune \\"Baby, It s Cold Outside.\\" Beholden neither to social conservatives nor to feminists, Shalit reminds us that modesty is not prudery, but a natural instinct and one that may be able to save us from ourselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=idCDAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moonrise, Sunset (A Mask Noir Title)","description":"Siobhan Forrester, lead singer of Beneath the Blonde, has everything a girl could want - stunning body, great voice, brilliant career, loving boyfriend.

The mysterious deaths of an international expedition of ice climbers on the remote face of the Spitsbergen glacier triggers what may be the first pre-emptive U.S. nuclear strike against the Soviet Union.

Her experiences of danger, hardship, and excitement made ideal material for a book, one that she worked on for years in later life but ultimately never published. In this volume, Arlene Reynolds has produced a readable narrative of Libbie Custer's life during the war years by chronologically reconstructing Libbie's original, unpublished notes and diaries found in the archives of the Little Big Horn Battlefield National Monument. In these reminiscences, Libbie Custer adds striking, eloquent details to the Civil War story as she describes her life both in camp and in Washington. Her stories of incidents such as fording a swollen river sidesaddle on horseback, dancing at the Inaugural Ball near President Lincoln, and watching the massive review of the Army of the Potomac after the surrender have the engrossing quality of a well-written novel.

In 1957, the world looked on with both uncertainty and amazement as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first man-made orbiter. Sputnik 1 would spend three months circling Earth every 98 minutes and covering 71 million miles in the process. The world s space programs have traveled far (literally and figuratively) since then, and the spacecraft they have developed and deployed represent almost unthinkable advances for such a relatively short period. This ambitiously illustrated aerospace history profiles and depicts spacecraft fromSputnik 1 through the International Space Station, andeverything in between, including concepts that have yet to actually venture outside the Earth s atmosphere. Illustrator and aerospace professional Giuseppe De Chiara teams up with aerospace historian Michael Gorn to present a huge, profusely illustrated, and authoritatively written collection of profiles depicting and describing the design, development, and deployment of these manned and unmanned spacecraft. Satellites, capsules, spaceplanes, rockets, and space stations are illustrated in multiple-view, sometimes cross-section, and in many cases shown in archival period photography to provide further historical context. Dividing the book by era, De Chiara and Gorn feature spacecraft not only from the United States and Soviet Union/Russia, but also from the European Space Agency and China. The marvels examined in this volume include the rockets Energia, Falcon 9, and VEGA; the Hubble Space Telescope; the Cassini space probe; and the Mars rovers, Opportunity and Curiosity. Authoritatively written and profusely illustrated with more than 200 stunning artworks, Spacecraft: 100 Iconic Rockets, Shuttles, and Satellites That Put Us in Space is sure to become a definitive guide to the history of manned space exploration.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8qloDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warplanes of the Luftwaffe","description":"As Hitler unleashed his terrifying Blitzkrieg against the nations of Europe, the world was stunned by his air force -- the Luftwaffe -- with its vast array of latest-technology warplanes.And yet, six years earlier the German war machine hardly existed.

It shouldn't even exist but it does, and its astonishing, true adventures read like \\"a composite of The Lord of the Rings and The Maltese Falcon\\" (The New York Times). Illegal to own and coveted all the more, it has been sought with passion by men of wealth and with steely persistence by the United States government for more than a half century. In 1905, at the height of the exuberant Gilded Age, President Theodore Roosevelt commissioned America's greatest sculptor, Augustus Saint- Gaudens -- as he battled in vain for his life -- to create what became America's most beautiful coin. In 1933 the hopes of America dimmed in the darkness of the Great Depression, and gold -- the nation's lifeblood -- hemorrhaged from the financial system. As the economy teetered on the brink of total collapse, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in his first act as president, assumed wartime powers while the nation was at peace and in a \\"swift, staccato action\\" unprecedented in United States history recalled all gold and banned its private ownership. But the United States Mint continued, quite legally, to strike nearly a half million 1933 double eagles that were never issued and were deemed illegal to own. In 1937, along with countless millions of other gold coins, they were melted down into faceless gold bars and sent to Fort Knox. The government thought they had destroyed them all -- but they were wrong. A few escaped, purloined in a crime -- an inside job -- that wasn't discovered until 1944. Then, the fugitive 1933 double eagles became the focus of a relentless Secret Service investigation spearheaded by the man who had put away Al Capone. All the coins that could be found were seized and destroyed. But one was beyond their reach, in a king's collection in Egypt, where it survived a world war, a revolution, and a coup, only to be lost again. In 1996, more than forty years later, in a dramatic sting operation set up by a Secret Service informant at the Waldorf-Astoria, an English and an American coin dealer were arrested with a 1933 double eagle which, after years of litigation, was sold in July 2002 to an anonymous buyer for more than $7.5 million in a record-shattering auction. But was it the only one? The lost one? Illegal Tender, revealing information available for the first time, tells a riveting tale of American history, liberally spiced with greed, intrigue, deception, and controversy as it follows the once secret odyssey of this fabulous golden object through the decades. With its cast of kings, presidents, government agents, shadowy dealers, and crooks, Illegal Tender will keep readers guessing about this incomparable disk of gold -- the coin that shouldn't be and almost wasn't -- until the very end.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MdV4THSPzRMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Planet of Peril","description":"Derring-do on a world of primitive monsters!

She has agoraphobia, a debilitating anxiety disorder that entraps its sufferers in the fear of leaving safe havens such as home. Paradoxically, while at this safe haven, agoraphobics spend much of their time ruminating over past panic experiences and imagining similar hypothetical situations. In doing so, they create a narrative that both describes their experience and locks them into it. Constructing Panic offers an unprecedented analysis of one patient's experience of agoraphobia. In this novel interdisciplinary collaboration between a clinical psychologist and a linguist, the authors probe Meg's stories for constructions of emotions, actions, and events. They illustrate how Meg uses grammar and narrative structure to create and recreate emotional experiences that maintain her agoraphobic identity. In this work Capps and Ochs propose a startling new view of agoraphobia as a communicative disorder. Constructing Panic opens up the largely overlooked potential for linguistic and narrative analysis by revealing the roots of panic and by offering a unique framework for therapeutic intervention. Readers will find in these pages hope for managing panic through careful attention to how we tell the story of our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QBvjPqsqSmgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Equine Reproductive Physiology, Breeding and Stud Management","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seven Great Religions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A9dhwQEACAAJ&dq=Seven+Great+Religions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Later Life: Realities of Ageing","description":"An interdisciplinary introduction to the aging process which uses symbolic interactionism as the main theoretical perspective.

He is versatile. He is prolific. And he doesn't exist. From 1969 until 1999, Allen Smithee was the pseudonym adopted by Hollywood directors when they wished not to be associated with films ostensibly of their making . Encompassing over fifty films of various stripes -- B movies, sequels, music videos, made-for-TV movies -- Smithee's three decades of work affords the authors of this volume a unique opportunity to reassess the claims of auteurism, both in its traditional guise and in the more commodified form it currently assumes. Sometimes treating Smithee as an auteur in much the same way critics and scholars have treated directors as diverse as Douglas Sirk, Abbas Kiarostami, and Quentin Tarantino, the contributors reclaim new possibilities for auteurist filmmaking and film studies, even as they show what an empty display it has recently become. In accounting for this change, the essays in this volume employ innovative theories of authorship to recapture the subversive effect that auteurism once enjoyed. Thus the Smithee name becomes part of a larger discussion of the economics and history of pseudonyms in filmmaking -- notably in the blacklist of the 1950s -- as well as an opportunity to employ Jacques Derrida's theory of the signature to recover obscured economic and historic contexts within Smithee's films. Unique in its focus, innovative in its approach, Directed by Allen Smithee argues that it is precisely through throwaway films such as Smithee's that recent Hollywood cinema can best be studied.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QhF7v4qa9gsC&dq=Directed+by+Allen+Smithee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Friends ; and other Favourite Tales (Penguin)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wOARPwAACAAJ&dq=Mrs.+Tiggy-Winkle+and+Friends+%3B+and+other+Favourite+Tales+(Penguin)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Principal Challenge: Leading and Managing Schools in an Era of Accountability (Jossey Bass Education Series)","description":"A Blueprint for Developing Tomorrow's School Leaders Based on two years of research supported by Carnegie Corporation of New York, The Broad Foundation, and the New Schools Venture Fund, The Principal Challenge focuses directly on the causes and cures of the crisis in school leadership. Marc Tucker, Judy Codding, and a stellar list of experts from the United States and abroad paint a revealing portrait of what it means to be a principal now, how and why most graduate schools of education have failed to provide the training principals need, what the military and business sectors do to create and support their leaders and managers, what the state of the art in professional training looks like, what other nations are doing to address this problem, and how to apply the very best practices in the world to solve the crisis in school leadership. This book is honest and hard-hitting. And it offers realistic solutions. Based on the thorough analysis provided by the chapter authors, the editors of The Principal Challenge offer an imaginative proposal for a new kind of institution that will train school principals to be turn-around artists. Drawing on the new forms of executive development programs in our business schools, they propose a similar program for school principals. The approach involves a close collaboration between the new institution and entire school districts, combining face-to-face instruction with web-based delivery. The innovative curriculum they describe, like the best approaches in business and industry, uses carefully developed cases, simulations, games, action projects, seminars and journaling, The editors offer a clear conception of what it might mean to be an instructional leader, a way of thinking about what it takes for a principal to be a strategic thinker, an approach that principals can use to take advantage of the best current thinking on knowledge management and professional development, a conception of the principal as school designer, an emphasis on the use of data to drive planning, and a host of tested ideas that principals can use to lead their schools to better results.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l_f7lySIum8C&dq=The+Principal+Challenge:+Leading+and+Managing+Schools+in+an+Era+of+Accountability+(Jossey+Bass+Education+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering & Using Microsoft Access 97","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Synopsis of the books of the Bible","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PuF0nQEACAAJ&dq=Synopsis+of+the+books+of+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Feathers: The Reverend Peter Jones (Kahkewaquonaby) and the Mississauga Indians (Kahkewaquonaby & the Mississauga Indians)","description":"Much of the ground on which Canada's largest metropolitan centre now stands was purchased by the British from the Mississauga Indians for a payment that in the end amounted to ten shillings.

A groundbreaking book, Sacred Feathers was one of the first biographies of a Canadian Aboriginal to be based on his own writings - drawing on Jones's letters, diaries, sermons, and his history of the Ojibwas - and the first modern account of the Mississauga Indians.

In 1893 the composer Anton n Dvor k prophesied a  great and noble school  of American classical music based on the  negro melodies  he had excitedly discovered since arriving in the United States a year before. But while Black music would foster popular genres known the world over, it never gained a foothold in the concert hall. Black composers found few opportunities to have their works performed, and white composers mainly rejected Dvor k s lead. Joseph Horowitz ranges throughout American cultural history, from Frederick Douglass and Huckleberry Finn to George Gershwin s Porgy and Bess and the work of Ralph Ellison, searching for explanations. Challenging the standard narrative for American classical music fashioned by Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein, he looks back to literary figures Emerson, Melville, and Twain to ponder how American music can connect with a  usable past.  The result is a new paradigm that makes room for Black composers, including Harry Burleigh, Nathaniel Dett, William Levi Dawson, and Florence Price, while giving increased prominence to Charles Ives and George Gershwin. Dvor k s Prophecy arrives in the midst of an important conversation about race in America a conversation that is taking place in music schools and concert halls as well as capitols and boardrooms. As George Shirley writes in his foreword to the book,  We have been left unprepared for the current cultural moment. [Joseph Horowitz] explains how we got there [and] proposes a bigger world of American classical music than what we have known before. It is more diverse and more equitable. And it is more truthful.

The book s three essays, by Adam T. Erby, J. Dean Norton, and Esther C. White, chronicle Washington s transformation of the estate in the years between the American Revolution and the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the stewardship of its gardens by the Mount Vernon Ladies  Association since 1860, and the archaeology that led to the recent restoration of Washington s showplace upper garden. Mount Vernon assistant curator Adam Erby examines Washington s critical role in developing Mount Vernon s landscape, arguing that the general drew on British design sources and gardening manuals but adapted them to his own circumstances, creating a truly American garden. J. Dean Norton, Mount Vernon s director of horticulture, traces the evolution of the estate s landscape and recreated gardens across the two centuries since Washington s death. And Esther White, Mount Vernon s director of historic preservation and research, shows how groundbreaking archaeological methods facilitated the discovery of Washington-era garden beds and borders of flowers, shrubs, and vegetables in his upper garden a remarkable find that yielded one of the most significant eighteenth-century garden recreations of our time.

Moving from sensitive descriptions of \\"the Surprising work of God\\" in conversion to a consuming quest for the essence of true religion, and threading his way through mounting controversies over \\"errors in doctrine and disorders in practice,\\" Edwards sought to locate an authentic core of evangelical experience, to define it in terms of biblical faith and psychological insight, and to defend it against both overheated zealous and rationalistic critics. The tracts that unfold his thoughts, presented here (with related correspondence ) for the first time in accurate critical texts, document a movement so significant for the American character that it has been called \\"our national conversion.\\" In a carefully researched introduction, C.C. Goen identifies the \\"Arminian threat\\" to which the Northampton pastor responded at the onset of the Awakening, and traces Edwards  understanding of vital religion as it developed in the ambiguous context of revivalism. Mr. Goen s study also illuminates little-known aspects of A Faithful Narrative and describes the haphazard way in which that important work reached its eager audience. C.C. Goen, author of Revivalism and Separatism in New England, 1740-1800 (1962), is professor of church history at the Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wR5VPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Great+Awakening+in+New+England&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cocaine & its derivatives","description":"Teens are at higher risk for cocaine addiction than are those who first use cocaine as adults because their brains are not as fully developed.

It was in Smoke From This Altar that L'Amour first gave public voice to his now-celebrated spirit of wanderlust. Like the short stories in his classic, million-copy-selling Yondering, and his best-selling memoir Education of a Wandering Man, the poems in this book are inspired by his experiences and memories of his journeys across oceans and continents. It is vintage L'Amour storytelling--in verse--about nature, the land, and the people who loved and braved it. Smoke From This Altar begins with a newly written introduction by his wife Kathy in which she discusses the special place this work has held in the L'Amours' lives. In concludes with twenty previously uncollected L'Amour poems selected by his family.

Among the topics covered in this volume are such basic concepts as the Jewish and Kabbalistic view of immortality, resurrection of the dead, the age of the universe, and astrology. All are published for the first time. The book also includes a translation of Rabbi Israel Lipschitz' 1845 article on resurrection, which deals in part with the paleontological discoveries of the first half of the nineteenth century.

New Revelations: Featuring 15 explosive new chapters, this expanded edition of Perkins's classic bestseller brings the story of economic hit men (EHMs) up to date and, chillingly, home to the US. Over 40 percent of the book is new, including chapters identifying today's EHMs and a detailed chronology extensively documenting EHM activity since the first edition was published in 2004. Former economic hit man John Perkins shares new details about the ways he and others cheated countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. Then he reveals how the deadly EHM cancer he helped create has spread far more widely and deeply than ever in the US and everywhere else to become the dominant system of business, government, and society today. Finally, he gives an insider view of what we each can do to change it. Economic hit men are the shock troops of what Perkins calls the corporatocracy, a vast network of corporations, banks, colluding governments, and the rich and powerful people tied to them. If the EHMs can't maintain the corrupt status quo through nonviolent coercion, the jackal assassins swoop in. The heart of this book is a completely new section, over 100 pages long, that exposes the fact that all the EHM and jackal tools false economics, false promises, threats, bribes, extortion, debt, deception, coups, assassinations, unbridled military power are used around the world today exponentially more than during the era Perkins exposed over a decade ago. The material in this new section ranges from the Seychelles, Honduras, Ecuador, and Libya to Turkey, Western Europe, Vietnam, China, and, in perhaps the most unexpected and sinister development, the United States, where the new EHMs bankers, lobbyists, corporate executives, and others  con governments and the public into submitting to policies that make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  But as dark as the story gets, this reformed EHM also provides hope. Perkins offers a detailed list of specific actions each of us can take to transform what he calls a failing Death Economy into a Life Economy that provides sustainable abundance for all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p2vgCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steel Rails to the Sunrise: The Long Island Rail Road","description":"The Long Island Rail Road is the oldest railroad in the country still operating under its original name.

It's about a Lutheran witness for the whole church and for all sinners with ears to hear. It's a slender book about the big theological ideas the evangelical reformers of the 16th century used as a lens for understanding God's work in Christ. Starting with Philip Melanchthon's 1530 Augsburg Confession, which was drafted to defend the preaching and teaching of Luther and his colleagues, Ken Sundet Jones sees its primary themes as a set of tools that God uses to build faith in us. He takes the reader beyond scholarly analysis and historical explanations and uses his own experience as a college professor, parish pastor, and sinner looking for mercy, to discover God's handiwork in our lives. Each chapter takes as its starting point one of the foundational ideas presented to the Holy Roman Emperor and representatives of the church, including Sin, God hidden and revealed, justification, ministry, the Christian life, the church, sacraments, and vocation. These are not simply theological categories for scholars to debate or historians to recount. They're the lived experience of the faithful from the first believers, to big thinkers like Augustine and Luther, to people in the pews, at the supper table, in their careers, and at their deathbeds throughout the ages. The tools in this kit continually point to Jesus as the one who promises mercy and abundant life - and who has the power to deliver them. This is a word for those who've not yet heard it and for those who desperately need to hear it again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vruxzQEACAAJ&dq=Grand+View&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nasa: The Complete Illustrated History","description":"Surveys the history of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, describing the major space craft and missions launched.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jz0qAQAAIAAJ&dq=Nasa:+The+Complete+Illustrated+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who Owns Information?: From Privacy To Public Access","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eHLCswEACAAJ&dq=Who+Owns+Information%3F:+From+Privacy+To+Public+Access&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets D'Amour: Erotic Memoirs of Paris in the 1920'S","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pi-wGwAACAAJ&dq=Secrets+D%27Amour:+Erotic+Memoirs+of+Paris+in+the+1920%27S&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bichon frise","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bad Seed /2nd Edition","description":"A New York Times bestseller!

It earned over one billion dollars in the worldwide box office and won two Academy Awards. Amid popular and critical acclaim, some have questioned the representation of women in the film. From an aging M to the limited role of the Bond Girl and the characterization of Miss Moneypenny as a defunct field agent, Skyfall develops the legacy of Bond at the expense of women. Since Casino Royale (2006) and its sequels Quantum of Solace (2008) and Skyfall constitute a reboot of the franchise, it is time to question whether there is a place for women in the new world of James Bond and what role they will play in the future of series. This volume answers these questions by examining the role that women have historically played in the franchise, which greatly contributed to the international success of the films. This academic study constitutes the first book-length anthology on femininity and feminism in the Bond series. It covers all twenty-three Eon productions as well as the spoof Casino Royale (1967), considering a range of factors that have shaped the depiction of women in the franchise, including female characterization in Ian Fleming's novels; the vision of producer Albert R. Broccoli and other creative personnel; the influence of feminism; and broader trends in British and American film and television. The volume provides a timely look at women in the Bond franchise and offers new scholarly perspectives on the subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=auaECgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City of Darkness","description":"A photographic record of Kowloon Walled City - a city within a city, now demolished and its 35,000 inhabitants rehoused.

The theory of contracts grew out of the failure of the general equilibrium model to account for the strategic interactions among agents that arise from informational asymmetries. This popular text, revised and updated throughout for the second edition, serves as a concise and rigorous introduction to the theory of contracts for graduate students and professional economists. The book presents the main models of the theory of contracts, particularly the basic models of adverse selection, signaling, and moral hazard. It emphasizes the methods used to analyze the models, but also includes brief introductions to many of the applications in different fields of economics. The goal is to give readers the tools to understand the basic models and create their own. For the second edition, major changes have been made to chapter 3, on examples and extensions for the adverse selection model, which now includes more thorough discussions of multiprincipals, collusion, and multidimensional adverse selection, and to chapter 5, on moral hazard, with the limited liability model, career concerns, and common agency added to its topics. Two chapters have been completely rewritten: chapter 7, on the theory of incomplete contracts, and chapter 8, on the empirical literature in the theory of contracts. An appendix presents concepts of noncooperative game theory to supplement chapters 4 and 6. Exercises follow chapters 2 through 5. Praise for the previous edition:  The Economics of Contracts offers an excellent introduction to agency models. Written by one of the leading young researchers in contact theory, it is rigorous, clear, concise, and up-to-date. Researchers and students who want to learn about the economics of incentives will want to read this primer.  Jean Tirole, Institut D' conomie Industrielle, Universite des Sciences Sociales, France  Students will find this a very useful introduction to the ideas of contract theory. Salani  has managed to summarize a large amount of material in a relatively short number of pages in a highly accessible and readable manner.

The Mathematics of Sex explores why males are overrepresented in mathematically intensive professions such as physics, computer science, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Bringing together for the first time important research from such diverse fields as endocrinology, economics, sociology, education, genetics, and psychology, the authors show that two factors - the parenting choices women (but not men) have to make, and the tendency of bright women to choose people-oriented fields like medicine - largely account for the under-representation of women in the hard sciences. Further, research shows that biology itself - differences in hormones or brain organization - does not fully account for the problem. Compressing an enormous amount of information - over 400 studies - into a readable, engaging accountsuitable for parents, educators, and policymakers, this book advances the debate about women in science unlike any other book before it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=960RDAAAQBAJ&dq=Mathematics+and+Sex&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Dinosaur Atlas","description":"A guide to the prehistoric world of dinosaurs with maps, artwork, text, and pictorial spreads.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jlsOAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Great+Dinosaur+Atlas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diversity of Creatures, A","description":"Includes stories on the occult.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7l_ZAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biography - Andriote, John-Manuel (1959-): An article from: Contemporary Authors","description":"Controversial AIDS reporter Celia Farber collects twenty years of investigative work on AIDS. Building on her much discussed cover story in Harper s Magazine  Out of Control: AIDS and the Corruption of Medical Science  Celia Farber s Serious Adverse Events: An Uncensored History of AIDS asks important questions about the costs and results of the two-decade long  war on AIDS.  Here Farber conducts new interviews with controversial AIDS dissidents, including UC Berkeley s Peter Duesberg, UNAM s Harvey Bialy, and Nobelist Kary Mullis. Their views on HIV and cancer rarely discussed in the mainstream press are considered at length. Also included are accounts of some of the most dramatic and controversial questions caught up in the fight against AIDS. Farber investigates AIDS co-factors, unexplained causes of immunodeficiency (HIV-negative AIDS), estimates of the AIDS epidemic in Africa, and, perhaps most importantly, drug treatment plans. In 1989, Farber was the first magazine journalist to call attention to the dangers of high-dose AZT monotherapy. In 2000, she took aim at David Ho s  hit hard, hit early  treatment plan. In both cases, Farber s suspicions turned out to be correct. AIDS drugs, when improperly prescribed or promoted, can be much more deadly than AIDS itself. Farber s candor and extensive research sheds new light on the AIDS epidemic and its important effects on our current state of medical research.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9JUjNgAACAAJ&dq=Biography+-+Andriote,+John-Manuel+(1959-):+An+article+from:+Contemporary+Authors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dear Children Of The Earth","description":"Mother Earth writes a letter telling people about herself and asking them to take care of her for themselves and for all living creatures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OxjYNAAACAAJ&dq=Dear+Children+Of+The+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","description":"From Nicholson Baker, best-selling author ofVoxand the most original writer of his generation, his most controversial novel yet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O2KJ8VcssMIC&dq=Checkpoint:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A reader's guide to T.S.
