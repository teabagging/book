My dad, Jess N Evans, Jr. was on this ship probably from Jan. 1942 until the return to Bremmerton, Washington on March, 1943. Since he died an early death at age 47, my brother & I have always been curious about his time in WWII. We connected with his shipmates in Sept, 2008 by phone with one, then attended their yearly reunion in Mobile, AL in 4-09 and will attend their final one in Austin, TX 4-2010. These men, who are still living, have answered questions, told their stories & are new cherished friends for me. I will finish reading this book before seeing them again soon. I only wish the author were still living to be there as well. I understand that he passed on about 6 yrs ago.

The city of New Orleans, damaged from Katrinka, can recover, if it will follow the example set, and the courage exhibited by its own, the Heavy cruiser, the USS New Orleans. to re-build."},{"Title":"Hell at Tassafaronga","review":"Hell at Tassafaronga was an excellent account of the war in the Pacific during WWII. The author articulates his personal experience with sincerity and brings the stories to life as you turned the pages that describe battles at Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea and Midway. Having grown-up in Hawaii, the story of Pearl Harbor was especially interesting... especially the sections that described the island, the people and the culture. Especially now (post 9/11/01), it is important to remember where our freedom comes from. And the ultimate sacrifices made by members of our armed services in conflicts such as those described in Hell at Tassafaronga. This is an excellent book and a great reminder of what makes our country great... and the sacrifices we must make to keep it that way."},{"Title":"Hell at Tassafaronga","review":"I purchased this book as a way to connect with my father who was a member of the crew on that long ago night in hell. He never spoke in front of me about what happened, but I always knew that his life was changed forever by his war experience and I wanted to have some idea what that experience was for him. This book gave me the answer. It made me cry.If you want to know about ship life before and after war, this book is one you should read."},{"Title":"Hell at Tassafaronga","review":"At less than 200 pages Hell at Tassafaronga is one of those books that although is a bit economical in its words is still compelling and interesting. The book is not really a typical memoir in the sense that the story revolves solely around the author but instead he frequently blends in the history of his ship, the USS New Orleans, with his own personal experiences more than most memoir writers do. Joining the peacetime Navy the author is assigned to the \\"No-Boat\\" and experiences the Pearl Harbor attack while deep within the ship at his station. The New Orleans is soon sent out to sea where she ultimately becomes involved in the naval battles around Guadalcanal. At the battle of Tassafaronga while turning in formation the New Orleans has 125 feet of her bow blown off by a Japanese torpedo. The author, like many of the crew aft of the destroyed areas realize they are hit but cannot imagine the destruction until they are allowed topside and view the unbelievable site that almost a third of their ship, and almost 150 sailors, are forever gone. The crews reaction to the devastation and how they repair the ship and sail it to an island in which they shore up the exposed bulkheads with trees and other materials is the most compelling part of the book. After receiving further repairs at Pearl Harbor the cruiser eventually makes it back to the United States in which she is fitted with a new bow. The author stays on the ship for the wars duration however the rest of the memoir deals with a summarization of the actions the ship is involved in for the remainder of the WWII and ends with her eventual decommissioning. Its an unusual naval story and I would recommend Hell at Tassafaronga to anyone who enjoys a good Navy book. There are several b&w photos in the book, quality is not that great."},{"Title":"Los Pazos De Ulloa","review":"I am a non-traditional student who has to read over 100 books for the comprehensive exams in the spanish literature area of study. This was an easy and entertaining novel to read. Having a woman author, gives the reader a better understanding of the period in which the book was written. Women in the XIX century were not at an advantage and this book illustrates this in a very profound way. The characters are controversial and typical of the times. It gives us a great insight into the provincial life in any given city of Spain while demonstrating traits of a naturalistic period very different from same genre by french authors like Zola or Flaubert.

In this volume, edited by the expert on memory and belief Daniel Schacter of Harvard, we have an innovative interdisciplinary examination into the question of memory, why it fails, and what happens when it does.The volume is divided into the following sections by discpline: 1) Cognitive Perspectives, 2) Psychiatric and Psychopathological Perspectives, 3) Neurophyschological Perspectives, 4) Neurobiological Perspectives, 5) Sociocultural Perspectives, 6)Concluding Reflections.The articles, each by a different contributor, are not the easiest to jump into, especially for those without a scientific background. In fact, the overall emphasis is very much on science with the social sciences rather underrepresented (in my opinion). This is the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. However, those with a scientific inclination, yet also philosophical or social science inclinations towards questions of identity, autobiography, belief and fantasy will find this book of great interest. I would advise you to also look at the much more recent volume (2000) by Schacter entitled 'Memory, the Brain and Belief', which may in fact be more up to date."},{"Title":"Faith Facts II: Answers to Catholic Questions","review":"Emmaus Road delivers another great resource on the Catholic faith.

She chooses to share that, and I feel that it shows that she's being honest about what happened and not just giving herself credit for her healing from cancer. She shared her story from a personal point of view, not as a major author, but someone who wanted to share her story, and explained clearly how she beat cancer. She even went on to eatablish an alternative treatment center that takes care of not just the disease, but the whole person, and doesn't tell you to take drugs and other medications that may kill you before the cancer does!! She's showing us that there are options. She also explains that a vegetarian diet (more precisely a VEGAN diet) is best for a cancer free life. You can go through with chemotherapy and cut out parts of your body, and hardly live at all, or you can switch to a vegan diet (no animal products) and see your whole life change for the better. Sometimes the cancer is so far gone that surgery may be required, but why go back to your old habits after that ?? Yes some of the recipes do contain meat substitutes, and those are not as great as eating whole grains, fresh fruit, vegetables and beans, BUT she's just trying to help people switch from a meat centered diet to something that's a little more bearable (meat substitutes) before going all the way to whole foods - if that's what you choose to do.

Voter thinking 11/03/09 focused on jobs and the economy, and sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with economic progress to-date. Smith's recommendations have had a large role in creating that dissatisfaction. Private sector employment has dropped since 2000, home ownership and median family income are down since 1998 and the proportion living in poverty has risen. The topic's importance was re-emphasized 11/06/2009 with the release of data showing the unemployment rate continuing to climb - now 10.2% (not counting those who have given up looking, or are working only part-time). Adam Smith and Free Enterprise are not working; meanwhile, China's GDP is growing 8.5%.Reinvigorating Main Street America's employment picture, however, will not be easy. Problems have been building for years, long before the sub-prime crisis. Some believe automation is the major source of recent job losses. However, it is difficult to look at the constant parade of long trains carrying shipping containers inland, or the millions of illegals turning up all across America, and conclude that this is the case. Substantial improvement on Main Street will primarily require drastically limiting Smith's 'Free Trade.' Free Trade supporters repeatedly cite the imposition of Smoot-Hawley tariffs as substantially deepening and prolonging the Great Depression, and conclude that we must not turn protectionist. Reality, however, is that prior to Smoot-Hawley, the 1929 Trade Surplus was an insignificant 0.38% of our GDP, and could not possibly have had significant impact even if lost entirely. True, international trade plays a much bigger role than in 1930 - however, the fact that we've run large and increasing trade deficits for decades is prima-facie evidence that eg. no trade whatsoever would at least stop the bleeding.As for Adam Smith's famous Free Trade support, that occurred 200+ years ago - before across-the-board very large and low-cost competitors like China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, the Internet, jet planes, and massive cargo ships made a much large proportion of economies vulnerable to offshoring than ever before. We need to also remember that protectionism is what allowed the U.S. and its new Asian competitors to achieve their original economic strength. (Smith himself warned against taking Free Trade too far - such that a nation's security was endangered.)Free Trade defenders might assert that manufacturing and IT have borne the brunt of offshoring to date, and their future offshoring is not likely to increase. Recent trends and data, however, suggest service jobs will increasingly also become affected. American firms are already establishing R&D; facilities in China; Asian competitors not only have a cost advantage competing for engineering work, they also have the advantage of greater experience in production gained through producing our manufactures. Unfortunately, this also provides them with a natural lead-in to new areas - eg. offshored CRT-tube manufacturing experience helped Asians in new areas of plasma, LCD, photovoltaic, solar, and LED screen development and manufacturing, and this trend probably will extend into nanotubes as well. Data reported in Business Week's 11/09/2009 issue confirms the shift - over the past year, U.S. employment of scientists and engineers has fallen by 6.3%, while overall employment has fallen only 4.1%.Proposed U.S. economic remedies frequently suggest increasing the proportion of Americans receiving college degrees as a defense against offshoring. Alan Blinder, former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman and current economics professor at Princeton, warns that the key distinction in whether a job is likely to be offshored or not will be in whether a particular service is delivered in person (haircuts, brain surgery) or not (computer programing) - not whether it is education intensive. (Elective brain surgery can also be offshored.) Thus, a college degree may no longer be a panacea. Blinder also believes it is quite likely that offshoring (unless changed) will depress the real wages of many U.S. workers who do not lose their jobs, the offshoring transition will continue for 2 - 3 decades and bring gross potential job losses in the range of 30- 40 million, and that American standards of living will decline. Proposals by still others to deal with offshoring job losses via more jobs in high-tech areas (eg. biotechnology) become ludicrous when viewed in the light of these numbers. Professor Blinder's suggestion makes much more sense - increased vocational education.Additionally, some Free Trade defenders contend that Chinese labor costs will soon become non-competitive. There are two problems with relying on this 'defense:' 1)Chinese productivity has also increased considerably. Economist Steven Roach (author of \\"The Next Asia\\") lives and works in China and reports that productivity in China's industrial sector surged nearly 20%/year from 2000-2004. Further, even after six years of double-digit increases, average hourly compensation for Chinese manufacturing workers was only 3% that of the U.S. average in 2004. (It's difficult to get reliable up-to-date information on China.) 2)By 2020 it is estimated that there will be 553 million non-agricultural workers in China - 100 million more than in all the developed world, according to Martin Jacques in \\"When China Rules the World.\\"Others contend that China cannot continue its rapid economic growth without Democracy, something it shows few signs of doing. Jacques, on the other hand, provides data showing that most Chinese believe the political climate has improved since 1989 (Tienanmen Square), and 72% of its population are satisfied with the condition of the country vs. only 39% in the U.S. (As for the widely reported large number of civil disturbances within China reported each year, Jacques contends most have nothing to do with the central government - eg. local land issues.)Finally, there is the large and growing problem of illegal immigrants taking jobs from American citizens. The U.S. already has enough problems finding work for its own citizens, and the problems are going to become much more severe via currently unfettered offshoring. It is numerically impossible for the U.S. to also provide jobs for the current number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central, and South America - we must sharply reduce the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.Bottom Line: Main Street America cannot withstand continually losing jobs to Free Trade, illegal workers, and automation. Wall Street, on the other hand, has benefited immensely from these job losses and shows no signs of changing direction. The recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated that financial markets are not self-correcting, and that Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' is not infallible. Immediate government redirection is required."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I bought this book because it seems like a must read for anyone interested in business and economics.

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist.

It is a fairly aggressive book based on its size with almost 1,000 pages of fairly fine print of which half of it is dedicated to the supply and demand of corn. But it is surprisingly readable and even interesting. And it is the basic textbook of all economics.Wealth is defined as production capability or what we might call GDP.I figure with a changing economy, it never hurts to brush up on the basics. We are in a period of sharp changes in supply and demand. It is important for business leaders to try to understand what impact this will have on them and their companies.One principle that Adam espouses is the division of labour.He also talks about principals, those are the people that supply the capital that is put to use by the agents (people who apply the capital). His view is that people should not do both, they should do one or the other. It is an interesting thought.He is very harsh on protectionism (as am I).I am not going to recommend reading it because the size is too daunting for many people.

It gives a clear, proper - though sometimes a bit long - explanation of the laws of the market and exposes the logical workings of the &quot;invisible hand&quot;. However, as it was written for its own time, it refers tocontemporary events, people and nation-states, and that makes it hard for anyone but a history buff to understand many of Smith's points. Outdated and mutated words appear on almost every page and adds to this complicating It seems as if Smith's text was left completely intact. The book is also very long - almost 600 pages - and at times it relatively dull. For these flaws I felt it necessary to remove one star.

Less than a century later, Karl Marx was able to demonstrate, in his book, THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY, how vacuous the ideas of good and bad, as they are usually applied in political economy, turn out to be in practice. Americans have largely accepted the notion of a consumer society totally dependent on copyright and trade laws to protect the value of the entertainment and related therapeutic products which it produces. What might be most upsetting to readers of this book, that someone like myself could use it to reflect on the events of 9/11/2001 as a challenge to such modern assumptions, as if the policing powers which maintain the world financial situation of today have more to fear from an examination of how this book treats consumption than from the usual lessons based on the growth of wealth, might make this an unacceptable view of what this book actually says.When this book was written, Adam Smith was able to combine economic ideas about the distribution and production (which he considered the highest good) of articles of commerce, in contrast to \\"the bad effects of the monopoly,\\" in a way that caused thinking people in Britain to believe that the world would be materially better off if the American colonies were free of rules which required those who produced all the tobacco from Maryland and Virginia to sell it in or through Great Britain. Adam Smith was worried that capital maintained to store this product in London was depriving England of the opportunity to produce goods that would generate more wealth. \\"At the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the time only that goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough.\\" The American revolution was greeted by economic free traders as an event likely to cause a great increase in the wealth of nations, and the normally victorious political element maintains a strong belief in this fiscal ideology.The current situation might be closer to \\"the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse.\\" Near the end of Book IV, \\"Of Systems of Political Economy,\\" Chapter VII, \\"Of Colonies,\\" there was a frightening example of how bad things might get to be. \\"In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects of the colony trade.\\" Plenty of things went wrong, causing a large portion of the population to feel that they were victims of circumstances, \\" . . . but above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\\" Certainly, a great deal of money is in circulation today, and a tremendous amount is considered working capital, capable of producing many things that people might want, but the routine search for contraband includes cash in an amount exceeding $10,000, the amount which might be capable of buying a large amount of illegal substances. Police are actually so unfamiliar with cash transactions that large amounts might be held as evidence, until the police have been convinced that they have no reason to suspect the person who had the money of being involved in any sort of laundering activity. When Adam Smith was writing, his work was as shocking to those controlling the monopolies of his day as radical protests of today rile the police on the beat today, whose confiscation of vehicles, which are sometimes temporary, to see if they were used to transport illegal substances, is not considered in any way similar to hijacking airplanes in order to crash them into buildings which symbolize a violation of the right of the people to personal pleasure in a manner which averts the collapse of society as we know it. This hardly makes more sense than those who expected seizure of everybody's major assets to solve society's problems."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"If you're wondering which Wealth of Nations to purchase, get the Bantam paperback.

As a result each individual is incapable of sustaining his basic needs and thus must purchase these using his labour which Smith views as the source of all value. As a result demand and supply is created for such labour.He makes the natural assumption that each individual pursues their best interests.He foreshadows the concepts of marginal utility and scarcity in determining the shapes of demand curves for commodities. ( He never actually mentions curves ).Similarly, he describes the three factors determining supply prices for commodities ( rent of land, wages and capital costs ) and the various factors which influence them ( the equivalent of modern supply/demand curves for each factor ).He puts these together under ideal circumstances to show how supply and demand meet to clear markets ( equilibrium in modern language ).He then turns to macroeconomics laying the foundations for GDP and shows how capital can be distributed to \\"unproductive labour\\" ( that labour used to maintain productive labour ) such as doctors lawyer entertainers etc and \\"productive labour\\" ( that labour used in the manufacture and distribution of raw and finished products ). He explores the consequences of various distribution of each from both the micro and macroeconomic perspective.He concludes by emphasizing the importance of government in providing international and domestic security as well as providing public works and institutions especially education.Naturally this requires state revenue and he devotes almost one entire \\"book\\" to taxes.He delves briefly into political economy especially merchantilism and it's detrimental effects to society at large.A great introduction to modern economics that is often missed in didactic lectures. This book gives the motivation for many modern economic concepts that is often lost in mathematical formalism."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations brilliantly analyzes how a nation's living standards can be raised. In large part his wisdom still applies today. To briefly summarize Smith's thinking:1. Standards of living are determined by the productivity of workers.2. Productivity of workers is greatly enhanced by specialization (see the famous example of the pin factory in the first chapter!).3. Greater specialization is possible only if the market size grows. Thus, government laws that prohibit growth of the market hurt specialization, and thereby keep living standards from rising. This is why Smith opposed laws that restricted trade or created monopolies. Smith actively worked to keep Britain from going to war against its American colonies over trade issues. The Wealth of Nations is a political tract designed to sway the British parliament (obviously it failed in that regard).4. Productivity of workers is enhanced by raising their wages.5. Productivity of workers is enhanced by publicly funded education.6. The role of markets is exquisitely analyzed by Smith. Self-interest leads people to carry out private activities that lead to social betterment, as if by an &quot;invisible hand.&quot;7. It is a serious misinterpretation of Smith to assert that greed or selfishness is the same as self-interest. Smith labored hard to avoid any such confusion. Please see his other book which addresses this specific issue: The Theory of Moral Sentiments.8. Clearly Smith favored limited government. But Smith was NOT a strict advocate of laissez-faire. He ended his illustrious career as commissioner of customs, a job he took seriously, and which he would not have taken had he not thought this level of intervention in the economy warranted.Read the first three chapters of WN: they contain the essence of the arguments above.

(To my knowledge, neither of these editionsis abridged.) In 1904, Cannan, a professor at theLondon School of Economics, did two things that greatlyadd to the value of Smith's book.First, Cannan prepared a detailed index. For example,\\"invisible hand\\" appears in it. Just try to find theone (and only one) appearance of that phrase withoutan index. Most of the non-Cannan editions I've lookedat lack an index.Second, Cannan wrote and added brief marginalia. Hiswords facilitate skimming, something most readers ofthis thousand page book are apt to do. His words andphrases are also easily ignored. They don't get in yourway once you've found the pages you want to read.(Reviewer T. Grimes comments on the marginalia aswell.)Finally, reading The Wealth of Nations shows Smith tobe different from his usual portrayal. He can bewickedly satirical. Anyone who has been to college willrecognize much that is familiar in his thoughts (inBook V) on \\"Education of Youth\\". And he also franklyaddresses the downsides of capitalism. The book beginswith the division of labor as a powerful means ofadding productivity. But later (pp. 839-41 in my ModernLibrary edition), he recognizes the destructive effectsof division of labor and, in response, recommendsgovernment investment in public education.

This model serves as the foundation of the arguments in the entire book; and an excellent guide to analyze our modern market economies. Smith touches on various topics, ranging from market economics, history of colony establishments, state of opulence (briefly describing China in the 18th century), and of human nature and behavior in general.Much of Adam Smith's ideas have been distorted by subsequent scholars, some of whom contorted his ideas to suit their own purposes, while others might have simply misunderstood. For example, in coining the word 'the Invisible Hand', Smith recommended free market competition as the foundation for progressive opulance. However, his implicit assumption was that people seeking their own benefits also embraced compassion and sympathy in their moral values. This 'moral value' part is often missing in contemporary economic analysis. As such, to gain an understanding of his complete doctrine, you should read this economics book together with his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\", which explores definitions of moral values and virtues.Another issue worth mentioning is that lots of people thought that Capitalism was derived from Adam Smith's doctrine, and the current market economies in the USA is a descendent of this ideology. However, if we used his definitions and analysis to compare the current USA market system, you will find that parts of the US system seemed to match closer to the Merchantile System that Smith lambasted as inefficient and short-sighted.A lot has been said about Smith's keen observations and eloquent quotes, however, most failed to mention his uncanny sense of humor. For example, in discussing about labor compensation, Smith remarked that \\"The public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities, makes always a part of their rewards; a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward in the profession of physics; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.\\"; when taken into contexts that Smith is a Scholar in Philosophy, and hence should expect \`public admiration' as his total compensation package, this sentence is almost hilarious.This book is an insightful read, albeit one that requires much pondering. It took Adam Smith ten years to complete the first edition of Wealth of Nations, hence I would strongly recommend taking a slow pace in this exploration of his wisdom.You might ask whether there is an easier way to read this book, perhaps through some summary others wrote.My opinion is really not to do that, because the gist of this book is on the thinking process and good learning does not come easy. Spend the time to reflect on his reasonings and you will gain significantly from his wisdom. Not to forget that you should get a copy of his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" to fully appreciate the Wealth of Nations."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I didn't read this exact edition, and I did read an abridged version. I'd also like to add that I'm not a student of economics. That said, I'd now like to unreservedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a handle on economics. I thought going back two hundred years might be a dicey move, but Mr. Smith's voice remains perfectly lucid, compelling, and marvelously informative. I cannot praise this book highly enough."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations is an overview of economics by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith around the time of the American Revolution. At the time of the writing, the popular ideology of economics was mercantilism - that is, countries should export as much products and import as much gold as possible. Hence, the somewhat strange title of the book. (The fact that \\"capitalism\\" and \\"economics\\" were not common phrases at the times doesn't help either)Much of what the book says confirms what any Economics 101 course would tell you - when you try to modify a free market, there are ripple effects. Take mercantilism again, as an example. Countries at the time tried to have \\"positive balances of trade\\", through methods such as prohibiting the exportation of gold, and encouraging exportation of everything else. This supposedly makes a country richer. In reality, all it does is make gold worth *less* in that country, because there are less products to buy per unit of gold available. This also leads to smuggling, where gold is sold to other countries where it is worth more.Smith understands that some government and taxation is necessary - there are some services that the free market cannot effectively provide. Conservatives seem to over-emphasize the famous \\"invisible hand of the free market\\" endorsed by Smith, while ignoring the fact that he endorses the idea of taxing the rich at a higher rate than the poor. (Source: page 1065 of the Bantam paperback edition)What would Smith think about the 21st century? I think he would be disappointed in our politics, both Democrat and Republican. Both Bush and Obama have overseen increases in the size of the federal government. Smith would likely be a conservative, but not a Republican or a \\"Tea Party\\" protester. He probably would've voted for Ron Paul in the 2008 primaries and Bob Barr in the general elections, despite flaws in both candidates. He would be against the War on Drugs, the bailouts, and probably the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He would be just as worried about corporate monopolies as he would government monopolies. I'm not so sure what he would think about healthcare - there are definitely problems with American healthcare, but don't think he'd want a public option or insurance mandate as a reform.Adam Smith is a very clear writer. Despite the book's length, it's not a boring read. I only skipped about 100 pages, mostly numerical data and obsolete information. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain.

Their topics are present in the political agenda of our governments right today, and after all other reviewers have written, better than I would do so, i should add four key points:- With no proper political institutions there is no possibility of creating wealth (it reminds me sad examples from today...Argentina?). Smith thinks it is very important having economic liberties, besides independent magistrates, and a national state committed to enforce the contracts privates sign up to make transactions when some party doesn't want to comply them.- Under the right framework of political institutions is posible to have private interests and public interest converging on the same \\"bargain zone\\". Under Smith's point of view is the mercantilism, as a policy of state, policy that picks up the winners since the desk of politicians instead of from the shops of every-day industry and parsimony of workers and entrepreuners what creates the conflict (even though he makes some exceptions, like the Navigation Act, but he regards the need of this monopoly of english navy by national security reasons only).- After the short-run adjustments, the income distribution matters, that are so important for politicians, should be resolved by the market and the entrepreuners whom, by searching opportunities to make more profits, will make converging the prices of land, labour and goods.- The accumulation of capital is the process that lowers interest rates, expands the supply of loans and suports higher degrees of division of labour in the economy. This process should let people have cheaper goods along the time and improve the wages of workers. The tax system should not stop this process, by \\"punishing\\" profits and the letting the remaining sources of rent free (wages, and rent of land).Under Smith's point of view scarcity and poverty are historical and social problems, and their solutions are in history and in social interaction too.There are not worlds beyond every-day reality, as socialists made us to believe some time ago...just trade and division of labour and accumulation of capital, and so on. Let history and people surprise us. They will make the wealth, not the governments. The Smith system is open to history and change, and learnship, and only requires good foundations to secure an historical outcome of wealth.The world of today has institutions that were not in XVIIIth century: global financial institutions and spread trade agreements, that create barriers at some places and open gates at anothers. And now we have new constraints (the environment,..) and new key players (global corporations, ..). But this new scene only makes smaller the room of economic policy choices for latin american governments. At the core of the room which is remaining for them, the Smith's suggestions still have urgent and actual importance.Sad thing to recognize that in XXIst century latin america, we need to read a great book from XVIIIst century to find out solutions."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's WONs should be required reading / course work in high school.Long winded, yes, but also relevant.

The book use a lot of illustrations to show how the division of labour could increase the production and it is on our self-interest to make exchange that give rise to division of labour, the theme that has mentioned by other reviewers and books.You should have read a lot of quotations from the book but you could not understand fully the central theme of the book by just few sentences.

As the Industrial Revolution was in its infancy, Smith keenly perceived the theoretical framework for its future development: property rights, markets, free trade, and government non-intervention.

It is not from benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love and never talk to them of our own necessities, but to their advantages. The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the trouble and toil of acquiring it. Smith contends that there are only 2 ways countries can become wealthy: (1). Their citizens being good savers and then invest these savings toward productive ends; and (2). By way of trade. National wealth grows when things and money are circulated and exchanged to the most remote corners of the globe. Finally, Adam Smith believes that nations will become rich only if natural liberty is promulgated for, society has a natural tendency to allocate resources in the best way. This is now widely known as the \\"invisible hand\\" theory."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is huge!!!

In a nutshell, it details the mechanisms by which personal liberty -- accompanied by personal responsibility and a just system of government -- make nations, and the individuals who live in them, wealthy. I had a Marxist professor who did not like Adam Smith because Marxist theory prefers to emphasize class warfare, while Smith is saying that everyone is capable of providing for themselves and the less the government interferes, the better off we all are. Many conservatives, meanwhile, like Adam Smith because they seem to perceive a \\"survival of the fittest\\" philosophy in his works.

This is List's core argument and not to be confused with the &quot;infant industry&quot; characterization. Smith's work is of course a classic.

Vital reading for those who promote or oppose the free-market. Read about capitalism from a temperate, intellectual proponent, rather than a right-wing extremist or left-wing radical.

It's a 200+ year old book that predates the words capitalism and economics. I lack the economics and financial understanding to really absorb the book and able to regurgitate something meaningful.

Weighing in 700+ pages for a typical printing, this work is not a quick and easy read by any stretch of the imagination. Many of Smith's great metaphors are found in the first quarter of the book, and I felt bored reading the latter parts. It is not that Smith was wrong, by any means, but rather that many of his arguments are now well-accepted and can be demonstrated in much more succinct manners. I feel that Smith's multitudes of examples are not particularly important to the average man.With that said, I reiterate that this is an important work that should be understood by everyone - but this does not necessarily mean reading all of it.

A little background in 17th-18th century British history also helps. I recommend making plenty of notes in your Kindle as you go.Smith compares/contrasts the economies of hunter-gatherer, nomadic and warrior civilizations, as well as feudal and mercantilist economies, and outlines a free-trade system which he would like to see, which we call \\"capitalism\\". Unfortunately, it seems to me that the mercantile system has prevailed in the long run, at least as far as international trade is concerned. He makes considerable use of historical examples as well as contemporary (to him) events, and he seems ambivalent about the prospects for the American colonies which were then in revolt.Wordy?

If you are starting a study on economics START HERE! Adam Smith ties very abstract concepts to real-life examples that are understandable even today.I read somewhere that this book changed the world.

I can see the imprint of Adam Smith everywhere in modern economics-even in Karl Marx cites him! If you read my other reviews, you will see that I have never said this before-so understand, I do NOT say this lightly: This book has truly enriched my understanding of the world around me-and opened my eyes to things that I did not previously understand. Yes-this book changed my outlook on life!You know you are reading a work of timeless genius when you can apply directly what a man wrote in 1776 to the year 2010.If you are considering buying this book be aware of a few things:1) This book was published in 1776-and uses 1776 english. It's a little tough to follow at first, but you get used to it. If you've read America's founding fathers it really constitutes NO difficulty2) Despite the language, this book is VERY readable. His examples are understandable and the structure of the book makes it easy to follow him from point to point.3) This book is HUGE. This version (Bantam Classics) has 1208 pages.4) I wish Bantam would have given more room for notes in the margin.A few other observations about this book-* I was AMAZED by how different banking and financing were in the 1770s.* This book illustrates in SO many ways that people haven't changed AT ALL-very interesting - and amusing to see that illustrated over and over again.* Be prepared for an unrelating (and very convincing) argument for completely free trade.* Some of his digressions (especially the one on corn) were a little tough to get through.* He is SO honest in this book. In a day when pro-business talking heads will excuse any excess-Adam Smith has NO problem taking certain business practices to task. This book taught me, an Unrepentant Capitalist Pig that it is not only OK, but desirable to denounce bad business practices.* I feel a lot of the material in this book shows that a \\"gold standard\\" currency is not the magic bullet that many people today pretend it to be. (not that it's bad-but gold standard has it's own problems)* I feel the material in this book (specifically book 5) could be used to make a strong argument FOR the Fair tax (National Sales Tax)* The arguments he makes about the colonies in North America (us) are VERY surprising. I don't want to spoil it-but I had to re-read it a few times to make sure I understood what he said. - His argument makes sense, but I didn't see it coming.* Being a proud Pennsylvania resident, I was excited to see all the Pennsylvania references.* This book should be REQUIRED reading for any politician who will be assuming elected office.

A lesser problem is that the paragraphs in the text do not begin with indents; thus, the only way to tell when a new paragraph starts is if you come to a line that extends only halfway across the screen.On the plus side, this edition does include the explanatory call-outs of the original (in italics at the end of each section they pertain to) and the lengthy 1906 explanatory introduction by Edwin Cannan (though for some reason not the introduction by Robert Rubin to the recent Modern Library paperback).But it's a shame that Modern Library didn't do a better job with the formatting, especially since other Kindle publishers have made TWON available at a fraction of what Modern Library charges."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor.

This book is a true masterpiece and laid the foundations for modern economic analysis. Though later criticised by many, Smith remains one of the most lucid thinkers on capitalism, despite the fact that he is permanently underestimated in the face of people like Marx. 222 years after its original publication, it maintains its powerful insights. A must read for anyone who refuses to be misled anti-market propaganda, whose results we so dreadfully witnessed throughout the 20th century."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations, put simply, is the foundation of modern economics.

As a double major in Business and International Relations, I naturally never read this book until after I graduated. Similar to Clauswitz's \\"On War\\" for the military strategist, or Plato's \\"Republic\\" for the political philosopher, this is a must read for anyone who lives in a free-market economy.Adam Smith goes through a completely exhausting and methodical explanation about the nature of money. The multitude of examples and depth of discussion could stop a Mack truck, but the lessons are critical. It teaches you about the true nature of money; where it comes from, what it means. That, in turn, as you reflect on your own life, will illustrate much about how you prioritize your own life.Along with Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" this book will indisputably change your perception of the nature of money and a how person chooses to earn their living.The only drawback to the book is that it is brutally boring--but get a large cup of Java, sit back, and dig in.

And slavery like it or not is a part of economics. It's a way to get labor for very cheap (like food, water and shelter only). On page 744 he does however call it the unfortunate law of slavery. Slavery is abhorrent and prevents the whole from reaching their great potential for the benefit of a few (the wealthy who have slaves and the consumers who get products much cheaper because of it).On page 110-111 This really stands out \\"No Society can surely be flourishing and happy of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable\\"Adam Smith does however place too much emphasis on Corn being the commodity that everything is measured against. It's just as easy to switch to a different food source like Rice for instance. That if enough people switched to would cause the price of corn to drop or stop being planted.On page 986 He says there is no public institution for the education of women and he talks about not educating the women like the men. He says they are taught only what their parents or guardian judge it necessary or useful for them to learn and nothing else. This clealy isn't good either but I know he was just stating a fact of life at the time.I cry BRAVO!!! for Adam Smith's take on Religion. He got the true religion right! On page 998 it says \\"because in every religion except the true it is highly pernicious and it has a natural tendency to pervert the true, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly and delusion. Each ghostly practitioner in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers will inspire them with the most violent abhorrences of all other sects. No regard will be paid to Truth, Morals or Decency.\\" The true religion extols Truth, Morals and Decency as Jesus taught us to keep the commandments. This is the whole duty of man. To speak the truth and walk uprightly. To not steal, Not Lie, Not commit adultery, etc. But today's organized religions are more interested in building bigger buildings to get more money collected for the most part than to do good works.On page 1067 Adam Smith says \\"the ground rents of uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax\\". I wholeheartedly disagree with thisstatement. This would allow the very wealthy to own so much land that the poorer people could never own their own piece of property. That's what property taxes are for to prevent this from happening. If the poor abandon all these houses that the very wealthy own then eventually the very wealthy will be unable to pay property tax and the government will take control of their property and put it back into circulation providing their workers places to live. That's why the proper way is the way the government of the the U.S. (or maybe Idaho) has implemented it. You get a tax break for your primary residence for your place to live but none from additional properties. Not to mention another country with a lot of cash could buy up all the property in your country and control too much without doing the labor needed to keep a country functioning properly.But overall it's a very good book.Sincerely,Jon Beckmon"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is truly one of the most influential books in world history. Published in 1776, it discussed many of the economic ideas of the thought system we refer to today as classical or nineteenth-century liberalism.First and foremost, it enumerated the capitalist doctrines that led to the awesome increase in living standards over the past two centuries--doctrines such as free trade, the importance of economic growth for a society, and the idea that the entire society benefits when the individual is encouraged to pursue his economic self-interest.Smith also examined the topics of paper money and commodity standards and provided examples from the past of when currencies were debased during hard times. Perhaps the most sobering part of the book from the point of view of today is the section that discussed how governments, when they have spent far too much and can no longer service their debt, must either repudiate the debt or incinerate it via severe inflation--we can only hope that the gross overspending in recent years on the part of both parties in Washington will not bring us to that point in the coming years.Some of the other topics on which Smith held forth include apprenticeships, colonies, agriculture, defense, taxes, the differences between public and private sector employment, and fascinating comparisons of wage rates between England and the then-colonies and between parts of Britain.The book is very readable despite the fact it was written in eighteenth-century English, and is definitely worth tackling if you have a serious interest in economics."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Probably the most important book ever written has as much to say to us today as it did in 1766 . Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nation\\" establishes the theoretical framework for Capitalism covering every aspect of an economic system that has created the highest standard of living known to man. Adam Smith shows how the interplay between labor, stock and land serve to generate the wealth of a nation. The keys to wealth are freedom, productive men, productive stock, and productive land. Smith says that the role of government is threefold - to protect the land from foreign invasion, enforce contracts and maintain a physical and legal infrastructure that promotes commerce and investment. Government produces nothing and therefore the expense of government reduces the wealth of a nation. Taxes are akin to a proportional reduction in the productivity of labor, stock and land and so should be kept at a minimum in order to increase the wealth of a nation. Any government role beyond the promotion and protection of investment reduces the wealth of a nation and of its people Adam Smith would oppose the many government programs that litter the landscape of the Federal Government today. Welfare, Social Security, education spending by the government, and other non-defense or infrastructure related expenditures diminish the productivity of the people and consequently their wealth. The majority of the people in the United States would have been much wealthier had it not been for these programs.Adam Smith was also a proponent of free trade. He understood that countries varied in the productivity of the land and the people and that only through free trade could the advantages inherent in different lands and peoples be harnessed to increase the wealth of nations. He opposed guilds and unions which only protected the few at the expense of the many and consequently reduced the wealth of a nation by reducing the productivity of its people.Adam Smith was truly a man for all season and for all time. It's unfortunate that our politicians and educators are more familiar and enamored by the idiot Karl Marx than they are with Adam Smith.

It is for people who have an interest in classical political economy and its relation to the marginalist tradition. What I have attempted to do is take a critical approach toward contemporary mainstream economics based on what is written in the Wealth of Nations. I hope you enjoy it, and I look forward to constructive criticism and debate.Adam Smith has had by far the greatest general impact on the formation of economic theory of all economic thinkers since - it was he who cast the mold within which the future of economic thought would take place. What I believe has been neglected in most accounts of Smith's contributions to economic theory, however, is that in his attempt at establishing a unified theory of political economy he was instead responsible for developing the framework from which two conflicting theoretical approaches towards economic analysis would later be derived - one with focus on market relations and the other with focus on the relations of production. This marks the beginnings of what has been, in my opinion, a major inconsistency in the development of economic thought - the incompatibility of the former tradition of economic analysis, when taken in isolation from the latter, with the main pivot of Smith's theoretical justification for capitalist development in the \`Wealth of Nations'. The separation of these two areas, it will be argued, has been the result of the further development of certain aspects of Smiths core theoretical insights to the exclusion of deeper inquiry into an understanding of his attempted explanation of their origin and nature. Its product has been a superficial understanding of economic phenomena under capitalist relations responsible for the endless stream of conclusions that manage to both be incompatible with one another and claim immutability. Its practical impact has been to legitimize a system of ideas, culminating in the \`discovery' of universal economic laws detached from and functioning independent of social relations, that has fettered the further cultural and political progression of humanity through the intellectual impoverishment of human life.----------The \`Wealth of Nations', though it was overwhelmingly concerned with practical application and the specific policies of its time, has not cast such a long shadow on the progression of economic thought simply by merit of its attacks on the effects of Mercantilist economic policy. There were political economists before and after Smith who had carried out similar attacks, as is shown by the fact that Smith derived his argument against Mercantilist protectionist policy from Hume. Instead, the major impact of the \`Wealth of Nations' on economic thought has been its attempted establishment of a theoretical framework in which individual self interest was the driving force of an economic system that was propelled by its own momentum and functioned according to its own laws. In Schumpeter's words, it put forth the major assertion that \\"the free interaction of individuals produces not chaos but an orderly pattern that is logically determined\\". This orderly pattern was, for Smith, the tendential movement of the market prices of commodities toward their natural values. The major theoretical task of the \`Wealth of Nations' was an unveiling of the mechanisms that function to ensure this continuous movement of all nominal values toward their natural values within the framework of the free interaction of individuals. In this sense, Smith's argument against the Mercantilist system of political economy was, for all intensive purposes, an application ofhis general theory of natural value; there existed a \`natural' level to which any artificial adjustment in the quantity of money would adjust. The thrust of Smith's critiques on the effects of the Mercantilist doctrine are to be interpreted in the context of this distinction between natural and artificial value, within which its effects are extended beyond simple redundancy.Smith began his theory of value and price determination with a distinction between what he called the natural value of commodities and their market price, or their nominal and real price. The market price of a commodity is the price at any given moment of time in which commodities are exchanging for one another. Market prices fluctuate as a reaction to myriad natural and manmade phenomena and are in turn regulated by the interplay of supply and demand. If a drought adversely affects the yield of corn for a given period it would be the cause of a reduction in the supply of corn in relation to the level of effectual demand and a subsequent increase in market price; if it for some reason becomes fashionable to wear pink overcoats, assuming of course that individuals in a given society desire to be fashionable, then the effectual demand for pink overcoats will increase in relation to available supply and consequently so will the market price of pink overcoats. Value, on the other hand, is the point around which these movements, or vibrations, of price gravitate. Smith believed that individual commodities will rarely, if ever, exchange at their value due to constant changes and/or disruptions in the conditions of any given market. The hypothetical; point at which value and price meet may be understood as the more familiar concept of equilibrium; the point that competition would yield in the long run through the interplay of supply and demand on the market.The importance of these two concepts for Smith's theoretical framework was the effect that competition had on individual producers to cause the prices of commodities to always be in tendential movement toward their value. Essentially competition, which was restricted under the auspices of the \`Commercial System', was the force acting on individual producers which would ensure, in the long run, that commodities would be bought and sold at precisely the amount required to produce them - their value. There are two main justifications for the desirable nature of this process. On the one hand Smith believed that when prices were at their value the entire economic system was in turn at the highest point of efficiency and equality it could possibly be. On the other hand, Smith believed that this movement would ultimately benefit the mass of people with lower prices, which would continue to decrease in proportion to the advances in the conditions of production of commodities. Competition would in turn pressure individual producers to apply these cost lowering technical advances to the production process because of the need to reduce the value of their commodities in order to command a larger share of their respective markets, hence allowing for a higher rate of profit and the ability to continually reinvest their capital to repeat the same process indefinitely. Thus, it was on this tendency of competition to move the prices of commodities toward their values, and in time to reduce their values, that Smith's entire justification for the elimination of Mercantilist protection and privilege in favor of a system based on the free interaction of individuals ultimately rested. Not only was the Mercantilist doctrine of money manipulation redundant, but the means by which it attempted to achieve this ultimate redundancy prevented the functioning of extremely powerful mechanisms that Smith believed ensured the long run reduction in values of commodities - the betterment of the masses of people through the further development of the productive forces of society. As Schumpeter described: \\"It is the cheap cloth, the cheap cotton and rayon fabric, boots, motorcars and so on that are the typical achievements of capitalist production, and not as a rule improvements that would mean much to the rich man. Queen Elizabeth owned silk stockings. The capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within the reach of the factory girls in return for steadily decreasing amounts of effort\\"Contemporary mainstream economics, a position held by the neoclassical tradition, though seemingly rejecting value as an \`economic' concept, has in fact incorporated selective parts of what has been its derivative into their theory of prices in market economies. This has been accomplished by simply supplanting the tension between value and price with what is their emergent concept of equilibrium, within which the whole of their analysis of price formation takes place. Within their framework, though for all intense and purposes similar, the nature of equilibrium, being for Smith a hypothetical position of the meeting of value and price, thus takes on an entirely different meaning. They essentially adopted a view of equilibrium as being determined by the equalization of the supply of commodities with their respective demand, the signals to which occur in exchange relations on the market. There is no contrast on which Smith placed prime importance between the 'natural' value determined in production to which all \`artificial' prices determined in exchange are constantly tending, but simply \`equilibrium' prices as given by the aggregation of subjective judgments of individuals - thus making the interaction of market mechanisms with man, which Smith attributed solely to the measuring rod of \`market' price, the explanation of value a. In this regard, 'value' is transformed into a function of the influence of demand upon costs of s well production - more specifically on the last fragment of want not satisfied - and ultimately purported to be a subjective calculation of individuals. Prices are now the reflection of the interaction between these marginal rates of substitution of individual consumers and marginal costs of production of producers - Marginal substitution as the demand schedule of individuals which, operating under the \`law' of diminishing marginal utility, decreases for every increase in the price of a commodity and increases for every decrease in the price of a commodity; Marginal cost as the supply schedule of producers which, under conditions of diminishing returns, decreases as more units are produced.The effect of this change, curiously enough, was largely on the classical theories of distribution. By shifting the focus of an inquiry into the forces acting on price away from the realm of production to the realm of exchange, essentially making the regulating force of price the subjective valuations of commodities and their impact on the costs of producing those commodities, it rendered meaningless what was of prime importance for Ricardo, and Marx thereafter - distribution between economic classes and its deterministic effects on the outcome of exchange. Theories of distribution had formerly attempted to explain the division of value between different social classes in a given society. Smith himself identified the \`three great classes' of society to \\"which the price of every commodity ultimately resolved\\" as being landowners, laborers, and manufactures - it was Ricardo, and more extensively Marx afterward, that showed the conditions in which this division of value between them took place was located in the realm of production before exchange took place. Gracious as they were in escaping them, these questions of class and the division of value between them became for economists not so much irrelevant in a greater sense, but \`outside' of what economic analysis set out to answer as they were now \`outside' of the theoretical determination of price. There was no longer a separation between exchange value and use value, but the derivation of exchange value from use value (utility). Distribution therefore became determined not from conditions of production but from exchange relations.This subtle maneuver of redefining equilibrium, or we should say using it for different purposes, served to retain positive aspects of Smith's analysis to the exclusion of what the logical extension of his system by further inquiry unveiled: It ultimately served the exact same purpose of having competition operate to tend prices to a point of efficiency and equality, where things are sold at precisely what they are worth (now subjectively determined by some feat of aggregating what occurs on the individual level of optimizing preferences), thus allowing for the maintenance of the virtuous development that Smith associated with the free interaction of individuals and the discarding of the negative features that became associated with Marx's later \`socially necessary labor time'. Not only were the later logical extensions of Ricardo and Marx that spoiled the virtuous cycle done away with in a single stroke, but extremely important aspects of Smith - from the identification and examination of the interaction between social classes to the objective nature of value existing in production - were all safely brushed aside.The vicious circle, however, eventually caught up with utopia: the attempted formalization of this interplay between market mechanisms and man as both the measuring rod of and the explanation for value brought an inconsistency: initial distribution continued to claim overarching priority in the formation of price. The expression of utility that was the interaction of man with the market could not possibly be based on subjective measurements of value, but on the actual purchasing power which translated into market pull. Thus, the independent postulation of some pre-existing income level or distribution was necessary for the internal consistency of any formal demonstration of price determination based on marginal utility. Essentially, This is the root of what will later be shown to be the major contradiction in the superficial extension of Adam Smith; it essentially revolves around the assumption most fundamental to all conceptual frameworks, that question supposedly \`outside' of the economists' domain - value.--------As Smith believes that the market price of commodities, regulated by their value, is established by the forces of supply and demand, he in turn identifies the natural price of commodities, the actual substance of value, as being equal to the labor necessary to produce them. He holds the latter to be the case because he believes that a commodity is essentially worth the amount of labor it is able to command on the market - if the producer of X enters into exchange relations with the producer of Y, and the production of X requires 10 hours or labor whereas the production of Y requires 5 hours of labor, then, in the hypothetical instance of commodities exchanging at their value, the producer of X will exchange one unit of X for two units of Y. Already within the beginning of his inquiry is the major problem, and what in the end removes all unity from his whole conceptual framework, to be found. It arises from the fact that Smith ultimately merges his explanation of the substance of value into what he before held as distinct, market relations - for what Smith is now basing his explanation of value upon is here the extent to which labor can be commanded in exchange, and not the \\"so much less labour than before\\" that makes up the substance of exchange value, or the labor embodied within commodities in the process of production.Let us examine this issue further. Smith, in holding the labor commanded by commodities as the explanation of their value, is essentially making what amounts to the same claim that it is the labor necessary to produce commodities that is the determinant of their value ONLY under conditions in which the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer. Under these conditions Smith sees no contradiction because there is none; it is only after the fact that this separation comes to play a destructive role. We can easily see why Smith thought this to be the case - when a producer of a product exchanges this product, in which only his labor was used to produce, with an individual who has done the same, the labor which each of these commodities command on the market is equivalent to the labor embodied within them. There is X amount of labor embodied in the commodity, and the laborer, appropriating the whole product, thus exchanges it and receives X amount of materialized labor in return for it. Confusion sets in on Smith when he attempts to extend the labor commanded theory of value to instances in which labor is not the sole 'factor' ofproduction, but land and capital as well. He runs head on into what is seemingly a major problem - if labor does not appropriate the whole of its produce, but a portion is divided between either rent to a landlord or profit to a capitalist (manufacturer, in his words), then labor commanded is no longer equal to the price of the commodity it produces. The price of commodities on the market will in general be higher than the exchange value of labor. As Smith is well aware that he must have an explanation of value consistent with \\"the three great classes of society\\" for the functionality of his entire schemata, if only because the appropriation of the full product of labor by the laborer was \\"at end...long before the most considerable improvements were made in the productive powers of labour\\", he is now seemingly forced to discard the applicability of the labor necessary to produce commodities as an explanation of value to a society in which labor is not the sole \`factor of production' of commodities.Instead of further unraveling this contradiction, the task of which was left to Ricardo, and, more extensively Marx, Smith adopts what is now called a \`cost of production' theory of value - essentially, as Smith sees the necessity of the incorporation of \\"the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land\\" into his conceptual apparatus, he simply makes the \\"natural value\\" to which all \\"market prices are constantly gravitating\\" equivalent to the \`returns' to land, labor, and capital based on the observation that it is into these \\"three parts\\" which \\"the price of every commodity finally resolves itself\\". Of course, \`value' is in this sense superfluous - simply identifying that rentiers, capitalists, and laborers all receive a portion of the value of commodities does not serve as an explanation of where the value of these commodities derives; but, then again, this is our problem, is it not? We can now see the starting point of superficial extensions - of profit simply being another form of wages for inspection and direction, risk or abstinence, which becomes plucked out of its proper context as being linked to the value of the stock employed. From whence does this value come - the sky? Thus, we are yet again gifted with another gem in the \`production possibility frontier' of neoclassical economics - in which there can be no mistaking the superficiality of \`switching between capital and labor'. Neither can the perspective required for the exposition of such insight be mistaken.It is in the evasion of one contradiction which Smith naturally becomes entangled in another, his recognition of this being doubtful. The contradiction materializes when Smith moves on to his analysis of the \`Wages of Labour', where he correctly maintains that returns to land and capital are derivative from labor and labor alone. Smith thus becomes his own greatest enemy, for he has now, quite explicitly, singlehandedly refuted both his own labor commanded theory of value and his cost of production theory of value. The only unifying force, and luckily for Smith what remains implicit throughout his whole analysis of the division of labor, is a labor embodied theory of value - that \`returns' to land and capital are not returns at all, but appropriation from the labor which they employ. Thus we have come to one major critique levied against Smith by Ricardo - the division of value between classes in no way refutes the principle that value is derived from labor.There are two rreasons why I believe that Smith did not realize his self contradictions: first, this contradiction was spelled out quite plainly, whereas the former was not. It thus makes little sense for Smith to have not made any attempt to remedy it as he did the former from which it came; second, and more importantly, the so called cost of production theory of value was, for all intents and purposes, consistent with his notion of tendential movements of price toward \`value', much in the same way as neoclassical equilibrium theory is functional solely by merit of the identification of a given supply. What it was not consistent with, which will be shown later, was his theory of the division of labor and the increases in productivity that it allowed as a function of decreasing value. It is from the combination of what Smith, in arguing with himself, found to be dead ends with his concept of the division of labor, on which the development of the former aspect of his inquiry relied, that is at the core my claims.---The Division of Labor---In sweeping away the Mercantilist doctrine, Smith put forth a new answer to the question of how to increase the wealth of nations; that it was be found in the realm of production, more specifically in finding a mechanism the influence of which caused improvements in the conditions of production. These improvements were the development of the productive forces which, by reducing the amount of labor required to produce them, caused a reduction in the value of commodities. Smith identified this mechanism as the division of labor.The division of labor, however, did not serve only to reduce the value of material output - it both fostered the growth and application of specialized knowledge to further innovate the production process. Innovations which were responsible for the introduction of new products and the increased efficiency of the production of existing products were the result of the division of labor. This is because a specialized producer would be more far more likely to posses, or have a much greater possibility of obtaining, the requisite knowledge to improve a product and themethod by which that product was produced than a person who was forced to spread his or her time across the production of many different products. The mechanism of the division of labor, in turn, was identified by Smith as being a function of the volume of exchange between individuals. He believed that when people regularly engaged in exchange relations they would become inclined to specialize in production - i.e. spontaneously form a division of labor. This is because with every increase in specialization there is in turn an increase in the volume of exchange due to a subsequent decrease in the self sufficiency of individuals. If an individual who formerly produced the whole of his or her necessary product specializes in the production of one of these products, he or she must then engage in exchange relations to obtain the rest. The growth in the volume of exchange then served to expand the division of labor, which itself served to expand the volume of exchange as it allowed for the individual the ability \\"to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor\\" and therefore \\"encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation\\".Thus, as exchange gave rise to the division of labor, and the volume of exchange was in turn directly influenced through the division of labor, the result was an increasing hold of the division of labor on society. The division of labor, then, functioned as a positive feedback mechanism. There was, however, a natural limit to the internal expansion of the division of labor. Smith identified this limit as the extent of the market, or the area in which exchange relations were able to occur. The essential notion behind this concept was that the extent of specialization between producers depended on the mass of producers available to specialize. Smith describes this phenomena with an identification of the further integration of the division of labor in areas that contain a large mass of people, such as \` great towns', as opposed to a small population, such as the countryside.IIAs Smith held that exchange was the driving force behind the expanse of the division of labor, and that this exchange was limited only by the extent of the market, he identified the elimination of spatial and temporal barriers - modern day \`transaction costs' - as the means by which exchange was able to be carried out in a widened area, and hence the means throughwhich the division of labor was able to more deeply integrate itself. This is because these eliminations served to open up further avenues of exchange between individuals and, flirting with their propensities to \\"truck, barter, and exchange\\", led to further expanse of the division of labor. Thus, Smith identified the emergence of commercial civilizations, or, as he says, the first \\"civilized\\" nations, in regions that had fewer barriers to exchange than others. As far as how this reduction of temporal and spatial barriers was accomplished, Smith was rather ambiguous. However, it seems fairly evident that he viewed the division of labor itself as the force that would accomplish this task in the long run. This is because Smith identified the division of labor as not only the instigator of increased material productivity but as the force through which innovation was fostered.But had a division of labor not already existed? And if so, why did the division of labor neither perpetuate itself as Smith had envisioned nor serve to harness the application of the creative potential of individuals to widen the market? Smith's answer to this was that the division of labor that existed, because it was not a system of free enterprise but a manifestation of Mercantilist doctrine, created an atmosphere of monopoly and special privilege that restricted or distorted the forces that signaled the spontaneous ordering of production. In a system of free enterprise, competition between individual producers would both incentivize the actual applications of innovations that the granting of special privileges and subsidies deinsentivized and would eliminate monopoly control because any sector with an above average profit rate would attract production that was formerly involved in a sector with a lower rate of profit, and therefore also ensuring the important movement of price toward value. The regulating force of competition was the main ingredient necessary to bring to life the positive feedback mechanism of the division of labor. Protection was preventing the functioning of the division of labor which, per contra to the conscience construction of Mercantilist policy, functioned by merit of a mechanism which was independent of the conscience design of man.It is in this context of Mercantilist protection policies that Smith's remarks on the interests of manufactures being at odds with that of society as a whole should be interpreted 12. For Smith, the secret of the wealth of nations was to be found in the positive feedback mechanism embedded in the link between the division of labor and the extent of the market: an increase in the division of labor lowers costs, raises real income, and extends the market, thus leading back to an increase in the division of labor and an increase in the extent of the market. Smith held that exchange between individual producers regulated by competition would cause the materialization and expansion of this virtuous cycle. It is in this sense that exchange is considered the driver of growth: it enlarges the pool in which the division of labor exists. The entirety of modern exchange based growth theory is thus derived from Adam Smith. Any argument put forth that identifies \`barriers' or \`limitations' on the ability to exchange being the immediate cause of poverty is thus derived from Adam Smith. Not only that, but Smith also implies that technological innovation is a factor endogenous to production based on a spontaneous division of labor. As technological progress is the long run mechanism through which temporal and spatial barriers are eliminated, not only does short run poverty due to the inability to exchange in this way derive from Smith, but the long run increase in the standard of living of the masses as well. The whole of contemporary mainstream economics has been an attempted formalization of the requirements needed for Smith's division of labor to function. This is the power that lies within the first twenty pages of the \`Wealth of Nations'.IIIBut it is precisely in this moment of glory where the disconnect occurs. For the role attributed to the division of labor is inexorably tied to the notion that labor is the \\"real measure of exchangeable value of all commodities\\". Redefining value as being determined in exchange contradicts the whole foundation of the Smith's division of labor: if the functioning of the division of labor is to reduce the value of commodities through paradigm shifts in how they are produced in the long run, in their conditions of production, then it is within the production process alone that an explanation of value must rest. Smith himself, in putting forth the labor commanded theory of value, maintained consistency with his theory of the division of labor to the extent that individual producers appropriated their own product. As this was incapable of being extended to capitalist production, Smith then switched to a cost of production theory of value in order to escape the trap he had laid for himself. However, as we have shown, this theory of value was not a theory of value at all and thus was incapable of explaining anything other than showing a hypothetical point at which value and price would be equal - it was therefore incompatible with the dynamic nature of the division of labor. It is from the latter which contemporary equilibrium analysis has its origins, and, quite naturally, why equilibrium analysis in neoclassical economics had also been doomed to a static existence: dynamics could only be incorporated as an element disturbing equilibrium, whereas within the whole of the operation of the division of labor equilibrium is only a fleeting moment of a vibration which is in ceaseless fluctuation. Smith, despite his fumbling, maintained conceptual unity because the whole of his division of labor was based around an environment wherein labor commanded was for all intents and purposes equivalent to labor embodied - or a world where the laborer appropriated the whole of his or her produce. His inclusion of the pin factory example, while highlighting the increase of productivity it allowed, served to hide the fact that this productivity was a function of a specific explanation of value. This dualistic nature, or perhaps the high degree of ambiguity, in which Smith conducted his analysis of the division of labor therefore turned out to be both his weakest and strongest point.This dualism carried on to his heirs, however it now took different form. In adopting the marginalist approach to value, it manifested itself in an attempt to explain the functioning of an economic system according to individual self interest as a function of profit on the basis, or perspective, of individuals who have left the production process, or left the process in which material objects are produced as a prerequisite for profit. Exchange, without production, yields no profit; no growth. I may trade you nine apples for one of your apples, a deal in which you have convinced me beyond doubt is best for both of us, and in the end we still have between us ten apples. This attempted escape, however, was not an escape at all but instead served to shift the search of error and inconsistency to the confines of marginalism, and, as we have shown that it was a purely exchange driven explanation of value, financial speculative excess naturally became the issue. For where there is no production process, or when value is explained in the ct the value of which is rooted in exchange becomes more a function of the degree to which people are holding it - hoarding it - as concerns scarcity than the aggregation of marginal propensities. The recent popularity of 'behavioral' economics corresponds to this identification."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"ALWAYS GO TO THE SOURCE!!!

You'd be amazed to discover how many of the MBA-Ph.D Economist drones quoting Adam Smith in support of so-called \\"free trade\\" policies have never read it (almost none). Although Mr. Smith supports open trade, what is being called \\"free trade\\" by modern politicians and multinational corporations who quote Adam Smith in support of their rape/pillage/burn of America bears no relation whatsoever to the policies Adam Smith wrote in support of. Adam Smith DESPISED big business and wrote his great economic tome in support of SMALL to MID-SIZED businesses ... the kind controlled by a real person and not an over-payed CEO and unaccountable board of directors. Pay special attention to Smith's comments about the herring subsidies (Monsanto, big oil), taxes (a necessary evil), and corporate monopolies (Walmart/big banks - whenever they get together the common man is worse off).Talking about this book at cocktail parties where MBA-drones congregate is great fun ... kind of like taking the Bible and completing the out-of-context biblical quotes spewed out by radical right-wing Christians (they say \\"woman obey your husband\\" and you finish the biblical passages in context and say something like \\"put your wife above all others ... and husbands don't be vexatious to your wife.\\"). Makes the person mis-quoting the great work look like a donkey and you look like Stephen Hawkings.Caveat ... although this book is understandable because Smith ties abstract economic pricipals to ordinary commodities such as herring and corn, it is best read in small, digestible chunks due to the archaic 18th-century English.

It is very clear from the context in both books that Smith is referring to the enlightened self interest of moral decision makers who have had specific religious instruction,as well as a general education.Smith spends nearly 50 pages(Smith,pp.716-766) advocating the necessity of such instruction,if necessary funded by the public .Both of Smith's books must be read together in order to understand his overall philosophy.The Libertarian approach,which considers only a small portion of Smith's second book, is a caricature of Smith .Smith advocated a progressive system of taxation.Smith advocated usury laws(interest rate controls).The First Bank of the United States,set up by Alexander Hamilton,was modeled after the central bank control concepts of Adam Smith,as opposed to the free banking advocated by libertarians.Most importantly,Smith's theory of comparative advantage opposed any offshoring of either employment and/or industrial/financial capital if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market.Such foreign investment can only be made to supply the foreign market.Smith was one of the first opponents of globalization,since globalization directly conflicted with the theory of comparative advantage.Globalization advocates base their arguments on absolute advantage.Finally,Smith fully supported the use of counter tariffs if there was any probability that such a counter tariff would succeed in getting the offending nation to remove its initial tariff.Only if there was no probability of success would Smith forgo retaliation.A reader of both of Smith's books will discover quickly that he would have no sympathy for the atheistic materialism of any variety of anarchistic libertarianism. Smith would thus have been an ardent advocate of the conservative Federalist position of Washington,Hamilton,Madison,Franklin,Jay,etc.,while opposing the libertarian views of Paine,Mason,and Henry."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This was absolutely a brutal read; however, it was more or less a paradox described as painfully interesting.

With a little discipline, I think that the erudite reader will take away many enriching (yes, pun intended) lessons from Smith's ground breaking treatise. For me, as a business professional and business student (I have an MBA), the Wealth of Nations was a Damascus Road experience.I think there are several myths about economics that are exploded by a first hand reading of Wealth of Nations. Many supply side economists eagerly tout Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor in advocating deregulated markets, but in my view, Smith took a balanced and integrated approach in analyzing the supply and demand sides of national economy. In the first chapter Smith notes that national wealth is the production of labor. This has dual implications in that production is the creation of supply, but the labor force consumes that supply by trading the resulting wealth. These are two sides to the same coin, &amp; therefore indivisible. Also in the first chapter, Smith notes that increasingly sophisticated economies will employ a division of labor to increase production efficiency, which is another concept that necessarily integrates supply and demand, production and consumption.Smith devotes quite a bit of time lamenting governmental intrusion into economics by way of regulation. However, he does not condemn government regulation per se, but make very specific criticisms against those state regulatory polices that tend to create monopolies. None of his comments are strictly political in nature. Smith's analysis is purely based on economics &amp; the efficient allocation of capital. He views the enemy not as the King's ministers, but rather the monopolies that were so prevalent during the 18th century mercantile system.On a related note, I think it is clear that Smith would be horrified by the military centric nature of many post-industrial economies today. He notes that a standing army is a drain on national wealth. Essentially the state is paying workers not to work, but rather to stand ready to fight. I suspect that Smith would view large state defense budgets as being most closely akin to a transfer payment made by a welfare state. For those who will scream invective at me for saying this, please remember that the largest item on any defense budget by far, is payroll.Finally, as an amateur historian, I enjoyed the brief glimpse into what life was like in the 18th century Empire from an economist's perspective. Various parts of his book review social welfare systems of his day, as well as international banking, political economy, agrarian systems, and life in general."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Its a bit difficult to make a comment on the writtings for validity of Adam Smith.

This is a review of the Modern Library hardcover edition, which I ordered here at Amazon.com.Let it be said right off the bat that the big thing Marx gets trashed for has roots right here in the 'W of N:' namely, the Labor Theory of Value. Both Volume One of 'Capital' and 'W of N' spend the first 100 pages or so going over it. Both refer back to it constantly in later pasages. And both must be taken off the table without it. The LTV boils down to this: all value is created by people working and producing goods and services that other people need and/or want. Furthermore, they must produce these goods and services at at least the average level of productivity and at the appropriate level of demand. Otherwise you're working either harder or more easily for your cut of the national pie than you otherwise would. The LTV is so straightforward and intuitive you'd think there wouldn't be much of an argument.The one thing Smith stresses throughout the book is the need for what he calls 'perfect liberty,' where everyone is allowed to buy and sell what they want from where ever they'd like. With this, resources would be diverted to where they needed to be as quickly as possible so people would stop wasting their time WORKING (see how the LTV operates here?) on things that should be made elsewhere.It's important to understand that neither the words 'capital' nor 'capitalist' ever occur in this work. This is very important because both words carry baggage Smith would break no bread with. In fact, the main bad guys in this work are the very people we would call 'capitalist' today. They subvert Parliament through bribery and intimidation, protect their own interests at the expense of everybody else in society, and raise unholy hell when workers try to form unions. All the while, of course, they form unions amongst themselves with the express purpose of stabbing the rest of us in the back.Sound familiar?Let me give you a modern example of how desperately we need American economists to actually pick up and read this book, as opposed to just talking about what a good boy Adam Smith was. Contrary to the propaganda we're getting out of our media, alternative sources of energy are now ready for prime time. There's nothing the internal combustion engine can do that hydrogen fuel cells can't do better. The price of solar cells has been dropping like a rock for years. And wind power is now the second cheapest source of energy after dirty coal. All we need to do is divert all that money we use to protect our oil resources into building up the economy of scale for these products (i.e. reducing the amount of WORK necessary to build each unit; this is the LTV lurking around again), and turn all these into cheap bulk commodities. We'll also need to use this money to build up the infrastructure necessary to safely deliver and store hydrogen. Then, after these (admittedly) high entry costs (i.e. expenditures of LABOR), we'll have access to unlimited, clean, and cheap sources of energy. The nonsense we have instead, which came to serious crises in 2001 in California with the impeachable collusion of the Bush administration, has nothing to do with Adam Smith's great work. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of socializing the risk while privatizing the profits for this industry. Our current urge to go to war with Iraq precisely reflects the urge of 18th century statesmen to protect the interest of the mercantilist (capitalist!!) masters. This was a tragedy Smith covers quite extensively.As an added bonus he's a great read. After working so hard on Marx I was very happily surprised.Karl Marx brought the LTV to a fine polish, going beyond Adam Smith and showing how it translates into the average rate of profit, interest rates, standard of living, etc. He picked up where Smith left off. Also, using the weapon of dialectical materialism (i.e. the logic of motion and change -- the true heart of Marxism), Marx was able to show how capitalism, in fact, negates private property.

Adam Smith was a masterful writer of prose and communicates some of the most important economic and philosophical ideas in the history of western civilization. Economic theory never read so beautifully.An interesting choice for an introduction is Robert Reich. He is one of the few intellectuals from the left, and while I disagree with him more often than not, I respect his thought process. He offers his interpretation of Smith and how the ideas found in TWoN fit neatly with his positions. Selective reasoning or not, Reich does offer a nice summary line: \\"In these times, as when Adam Smith wrote, it is important to remind ourselves of the revolutionary notion at the heart of Smith's opus-that the wealth of a nation is measured not by its accumulated riches, but by the productivity and living standards of all its people.\\" Nicely said and I agree. I just disagree with Reich and his ilk on how the \\"wealth\\" of the modern nation is achieved.

II., C. 32\\"), rather than the kind that really help you understand antiquated terms and convoluted wordings. In other words, you'll get no help from the editors here.2. Then there is the barrenWealth of Nations (Great Minds Series). There is a 2-page introduction at the beginning and an index, but beyond that it's nothing more than the original text, complete with the original punctuation and spellings (neither of which has been made more merciful for the modern reader).3. The Penguin Classics edition, in two volumes:The Wealth of Nations: Books 1-3 (Penguin Classics)andThe Wealth of Nations, Books IV-V (Penguin Classics). This is probably the least worst edition I have seen, with a superb introduction (nearly 100 pages long), and a glossary, all done by Glasgow's Andrew Skinner. But the only footnotes in the text itself are apparently Smith's own. They appear directly on the bottom of the page in question.So good luck, whichever one you choose.In case you need to know, Smith's original consists of five long chapters, or \\"books.\\"If anybody has a more respectable edition at hand, please comment and I'll incorporate it into this review."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"To be an economist without having read \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is like being a priest without having read the Bible. As is often the case with second hand accounts, textbooks have distorted and watered down Adam Smith. Going back to the original text is both refreshing and enlightening.The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" remains the most truthful defense of the economic science. But remember that Adam Smith also wrote \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\"; for Smith, economics was a search to better people's life rather than simply a quest to optimize mathematical functions or estimate variables using econometric models.To simply associate Smith with expressions such as the \\"invisible hand,\\" does not do him justice. Take, for example, the opening chapter on the division of labor: first, Smith defends the division of labor as being efficient; then, he defends it as an essential component of the freedom to allocate one's labor to one's talents; finally, he links the division of labor to trade: without the freedom to exchange the fruits of one's labor, the division of labor is meaningless. The point is that Adam Smith defends the rationale for the market, rather than just explain its mechanics.Anyone studying economics in school would think that economics is all about efficiency; this preoccupation, inevitably, breeds economists who support the market simply because it works. But to read Adam Smith is to enter the realm of an economic science where the ultimate benchmark is not efficiency but human freedom and welfare. That is, probably, what Smith would remark if he were to sit in an economics class today, and why the \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is as revolutionary today as it was two centuries ago."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover). In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14! Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece). Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work. Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work. Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.AMMENDMENT:Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once). I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is one those great Classics that almost everyone should read. But if you intend buying a copy, be very careful which version you buy. Why, you ask?It's out in the public domain and a plethora of reprints are available, a great many from Print on Demand Publishers and there are some truely awful reprints available. Amazon associates reviews of a book with many different versions of the same book from different publishers. Unfortunately for us customers, Amazon is seeing a growing plague of low-quality Print-On-Demand Publishers who are specialise in reprinting copyright-expired books. Such as \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" Some of these publishers produce quite good quality books, some do not. What you do need to do is check the publisher carefully for all these older \\"copyright expired\\" books.An outstanding example of \\"not good quality\\" is the version of \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" published by General Books LLC. This version is scanned in using OCR technology (and using pretty poor quality OCR scanning equipment and software from the look of their books), is overall of very poor print quality, uses automated reproduction with no index, no illustrations and an excessive number of typos.Lest you doubt, here's some word for word quotes from the publisher's own web site:\\"We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....\\"\\"After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents no longer work. Therefore, we usually remove them. Since many of our books only sell a couple of copies, manually creating a new index and table of contents could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price....\\"\\"Our OCR software can't distinguish between an illustration and a smudge or library stamp so it ignores everything except type. We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies....\\"\\"We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book. We would really like to manually scan each page and buy multiple copies of each original. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies.....\\"For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision as General Books LLC are all poor quality, tiny (almost unreadable) fonts and they don't bother to reproduce little things like Table of Contents or Indexes.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another version of the book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first)."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Indeed this is true, [200 year old economics books are still relevant], but we miss half the value of the Wealth of Nations, if we do not also struggle through the turgid prose of the book he wrote 10 years before, The Theory of Moral Sentiments -- both of which of course are available for the Kindle for $.89 each.

Cannan treats us to a lengthy (63 page) introduction which includes a feisty justification of why this edition is put together precisely the way it is, including an authoritative history of those first five editions, with comparisons and contrasts. Once the book itself starts, Canaan's input is non-invasive; I felt that he was sitting silently and attentively in the wings, like a stage director overseeing a play.* The original wording is preserved, augmented by explanatory conventional bottom-of-the-page footnotes. Cannan's edits (mostly to correct typos and make clarifications) are most welcome, and even the typographical errors are preserved verbatim in footnotes. An example of a clarification: the author's mention of a \\"fire-engine\\" had me thinking of a horse-drawn vehicle for putting out fires. Cannan's footnote: \\"I.e., steam engine.\\"* The English usage of two centuries ago is a novelty, and much easier to follow than I had expected.* The author's original footnotes are exactly where he placed them: in little insets around the page.As for the content itself, the prevalence of Smith's ideas in modern treatises such asBasic Economicsis startling! (I recommendBasic Economicsas a first book on Economics, by the way.) I got MANY insights into the beginnings of America and what was going on in the world at the time this was published. I now understand why towns formed along sea coasts and waterways: it was much more efficient to transport goods via water than by land. Forget Economics for a second: any general historian would be remiss without reading this."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Alfred North Whitehead famously stated that all of Western philosophy was merely a footnote to Plato. It seems to me one could say the same thing about economics in regard to Adam Smith. There were certainly economists before Adam Smith (just as there were philosophers before Plato); and there are some, I am sure, who will claim that some of the economists writing before Adam Smith were actually superior to Adam Smith in some ways (just as there are philosophers who prefer the pre-Socratics to Plato).But Adam Smith, like Plato, was able in his work to define a relevant set of problems which to a large degree are the same problems that are still being dealt with, and debated, within economics today; and, like Plato, the work of Adam Smith has been the source for various strands, or schools of economic thought, each of which finds its ground in a different aspect of Adam Smith's work. Adam Smith's analysis of the division of labor (the productive forces of society), his adherence to a labor theory of value (at least in part) and his distinction between productive and unproductive labor have been sources for the tradition of economic thought following Ricardo and Marx; while Adam Smith's analysis of the benefits of laissez-faire economic policies, his analysis of exchange, and determination of price through supply and demand, have been sources for the Neo-classical, marginalist, and free-market strands of economic thought.Adam Smith sees the wealth of a nation as consisting in its annual produce (what we today would call GDP). This is the central idea behind the whole book and is Adam Smith's major innovation in regard to previous economic thought (as I understand it). Adam Smith will evaluate the harm or the benefit of various economic policies by attempting to determine the over-all effect each policy will have on the annual produce of society as a whole. If a policy increases this annual produce then it is beneficial to society as a whole. If a policy decreases this annual produce then it is harmful to society as a whole. This is still, to a large degree, the measure we use when evaluating the effects of a given economic policy, though we are perhaps beginning to see that the benefit or harm of a given policy cannot be reduced to its effect on annual produce or GDP (environmental effects, for instance, effect society as a whole and have to be measured against effects on GDP in determining the costs and benefits of any economic policy).With few exceptions Adam Smith believes that laissez-faire policies are the best policies for increasing the over-all wealth of a nation and he bases his argument on his notion of the \`invisible hand'. This is another one of Smith's important theoretical innovations; the notion that each individual, by pursuing their own interest, without any thought or conscious plan for society as a whole, does not lead to chaos but tends, as if guided by an invisible hand, towards a maximization of the yearly annual produce of a nation. It is not necessary for society to \`plan' for this outcome in a conscious way; in fact, no amount of conscious planning could improve on the outcome produced by simply allowing individuals to pursue their own interests unfettered by government. This has been one of the most influential ideas ever put forward by anyone since the beginning of human history, whether for good or ill.So there are a number of reasons why anyone who is interested in economics should study The Wealth of Nations. First, Adam Smith defines a common set of problems which to a large degree are problems that economists are still trying to solve to this day (in the same way that Plato determined a common set of problems that still occupy philosophers to this day). Second, some of Adam Smith's ideas have been extremely influential on all subsequent debate and are still used in policy debates to this day. People still use the notion of the invisible hand to argue for the benefits of free-trade for instance. It is important, therefore, to understand how the invisible hand is supposed to work and what the benefits of allowing it to work are supposed to be. And third, Adam Smith is one of the most accessible and readable economists who ever wrote. You do not have to be a trained economist (I am not) to benefit from reading this work.So I fully recommend this work to anyone interested in economics or social and political philosophy."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a big book of economics, history, philosophy, and social criticism. It is much more than Adam Smith neckties at GOP conventions. It is much more than a reverential nod or two in modern econ textbooks. Econ students need to read it to see where their discipline came from and what it could be again.Dickey's abridgment reproduces enough of the text (about 25 percent) to convey the depth of Smith's erudition and the diversity of his interests. Unfortunately, the editorial apparatus is weak. The Comments are few in number and incredibly brief, and the short Preface fails to put the book into historical and intellectual context. Dickey does offer four appendices but these deal with specialized topics rather than the big picture.Bottom line: this edition is inexpensive but is probably not the best one for students."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Scottish Adam Smith is certainly the most important economists of all times and is the founder of modern economic thought, being &quot;The Wealth of the Nations&quot; his major work, where he introduces to the general public of his time - the book was first published in 1776 - new concepts and ideas as &quot;competitive advantage&quot;, &quot;divison of labour&quot;, &quot;the power of the invisible hand&quot;, and many others still powerfull today, even accounting for the changes happened in the world economy and politics. From this starting point, a crucial juncture in the world economy, that is, the beginning of the industrialisation in England, many renowed economists and social scientists construed their theories. To name a few? Karl Marx, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and many others acknowledge the importance of Adam Smith's work to their theories. Besides this opus, he did a lot in the field of philosophy, but was to become known as the father of the Classic school of economics. One of not so many Economics excelent Classic books to read. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Hello,I made the mistake of buying a differnt kindle version of this book.

Thank You.Joe"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations is one of the most important books ever written. In some respects the Wealth of Nations was a tract for the times. Smith penned a crippling critique of the mercantilist \`Policy of Europe'. Smith, along with David Hume and David Ricardo, refuted the mercantilist case for protectionism. Much of what we read in this book is still taught in modern economics classes. Modern day protectionists still have no answer to the principles of absolute and comparative advantage, and for the basic logic of Hume's specie flow mechanism.Smith was more than an ordinary economist. He was a visionary who saw some of the potential for progress through Globalization. Perhaps the most important concept of this book is the dynamics between division of labor, labor productivity, and the extent of markets. Smith conceived of Globalization as a process that would raise productivity as local markets expanded to national and then international scope. His example of division of labor in a pin factory is simple, but illustrative.The most widely known part of this book is that part of the \`invisible hand of markets'. Invisible hand reasoning still pervades modern economic theory, though there are some variations in how economists interpret this concept. Smith does differ from Modern economists on certain issues. Smith thought of competition as a process and of monopoly as a government grant of privilege. In these areas Smith was ahead of many modern economists. Smith also explained market prices in terms of labor content. Here is Smith's great error. Labor value theory set economics on the wrong course. Labor value theory served as the basis for Marxism. This, of course, indicates the great influence of The Wealth of Nations on world history. Without labor value theory the Marxist idea of exploitation falls apart. Smith therefore played a posthumous role in twentieth century history, especially from 1918 to 1991. Of course, we cannot blame Smith for the misuse of his ideas. Smith would have surely opposed Marxism, had he been alive to do so.What we have in this book is a tremendous effort at discovering the proper limits between private and public institutions. Better still, Smith thought about society and institutions in evolutionary terms. This is another reason why the Wealth of Nations is preferable to modern economics texts. Smith understood the dynamics of capitalism better than many modern economists- who focus on static math models. Smith also influenced Charles Darwin with his ideas of social evolution. There is much evidence indicating that Darwin got the idea for the evolution of species by reading The Wealth of Nations. Smith therefore had great influence on the biological sciences.Modern economists reject Smith labor value theory (ever since Menger refuted it in 1870). However, there is no denying the influence of The Wealth of Nations. All members of the educated public should read at least part of this book. The question then in which edition should you buy? The Liberty Classics edition is unabridged. The Modern Library Classics edition has margin notes that could be helpful. Given the affordability of these editions, you might consider have both on your bookshelf (I do). I would avoid the Great Mind Series altogether. The Wealth of Nations should be read because it is both a book of great historical importance and a good source for understanding modern Globalization. The labor value theory part precludes a five star rating, but anything less than four stars would be absurd."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I have read WoN in three different editions and undoubtedly the best was the definitive version in the Glasgow edition of his Collected Works.

Read it - all of it - and you will find a rather different argument and conclusions from that bestowed upon this classic by partisans of untrammeled free markets who trumpet some sound-bites from the book but reject Smith's underlying argument."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"An Inquiry Into The Nature And Causes Of The Wealth Of Nations\\" (often called simply \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\") is one of two great works from the Scottish economist and philosopher, the other being the lesser known \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\". \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\" was published on March 9th, of 1776, but there were additional editions in 1778, 1784, 1786, and 1789. I read the free Kindle version of \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\", and while I do not recommend that version I do recommend the overall work.The issues with the Kindle version are that it is poorly formatted, and it is painful to attempt to read the numbers in the tables at the of Book I. You are much better off getting a hard copy so that you can more easily flip to the section of interest, and to read the information in a better format. As for the rest, the content is all there, once you get past the poor formatting.The work contains five books within. The first is \\"Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour\\". In this book he discusses the benefits of the division of labor, the origin and benefits of using money, a section on the \\"real\\" price of commodities (i.e. how much toil it takes to produce them), a discussion of the natural and market prices of commodities (the forces of supply and demand), the effect of controlling a commodity can have on the price, the wages of labor (again a case of supply and demand with the commodity of labor), the profits of stock, a discussion of the ill effects of groups who use their influence to manipulate the government (this would include banking conglomerations, trade unions, etc.), and closes with a section on rent.The second book is \\"Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock\\" which deals with accumulating wealth which lasts a longer period of time. This book starts with how one divides their stock into what they need for personal use, and what they can dispose of in exchange for others available stock. He then moves into a discussion of money as a type of stock, and then how to use their excess money/stock to gain interest.The third book is \\"Of the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations\\", where he talks about the balance between the inhabitants of towns and those of the country areas and goes into how agriculture is discouraged over time, while cities and towns prosper.The fourth book is \\"Of Systems of political Economy\\" in which Smith discusses the commercial system, along with importation which contains a detailed look at the effects of restraints on importation/exportation. Smith also discusses commerce treaties, and the role of colonies. This book also has a brief section on the agricultural system, but here he is referring to a specific system where the produce of land is the sole source of the revenue of a nationThe fifth book is \\"Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth\\" in which Smith deals with taxation. This is an important area to read and understand, as it is the one which many ignore when using Smith to try to support other areas. There are hints here of the progressive tax, as well as a discussion of the expenses of the nation, an important acknowledgement that the poor spend the greater part of their income on the fundamentals, such as food, and so he suggests luxury taxes as not unreasonable. Smith then closes the final book with a discussion of the costs of war, both for the actual fighting, and in terms of the loss of trade."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Don't be taken in by the gushing praise of the 4-star and 5-star reviews. Adam Smith did not found economics, and The Wealth of Nations is not a must-read. It is not the first or best case for economic liberalism, or even the best case of its time.While Adam Smith's work was a much-needed rebuke to mercantilism, it was in many ways a step back from what had already been written on economics by the School of Salamanca in the 16th Century,Richard Cantillonin 1730, andAnne Robert Jacques Turgotin 1766. It was even a step back from his own previous work, including theLectures on JurisprudenceandThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith's analysis contains many serious errors that would lay the foundation for Marxism, notably his crude labour theory of value (as opposed to marginal utility), his exaggeration of the importance of the division of labour (putting in the shade such critical factors as capital accumulation and the growth of technological knowledge), his identification of some innate \\"propensity to truck, barter and exchange\\" as the cause of the division of labour (rather than differences in ability), and his adoption of the dubious Physiocratic concept of \\"unproductive labour.\\"An economist won't benefit from reading Adam Smith any more than a physicist would benefit from reading Aristotle. If you have recently taken an interest in the economic case for a free market, read The Wealth of Nations only with a cold and critical mind; there are parts that are right and parts that are wrong, and you shouldn't accept something questionable just because free market advocates inappropriately regard Adam Smith as their god."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I really wonder how many people have ever read this book--especially those who deal with economic issues (say Congress or the President).

He also wroteThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. This book was first published in 1776, interestingly enough.Smith noted in the \\"Plan of Work\\" that prefaces the book that among the \\"savage nations of hunters,\\" the people are often \\"miserably poor\\"; while among civilized and thriving nations, \\"a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order... may enjoy a greater share of the necessities and conveniences of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.\\" The First Book addresses the \\"causes of this improvement, in the productive powers of labour,\\" while the Second Book treats \\"of the nature of capital stock, or the manner in which it is gradually accumulated\\"; the Third Book deals with the circumstances regarding the establishment of towns, rather than of the country; and the Fourth Book deals with various theories of political economy.He begins the book with the observation that \\"The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour... seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.\\" He cites the example of pin manufacturing, in which a single man could perhaps make one pin a day, \\"and certainly could not make twenty.\\" But by ten persons dividing the labor, they are able to make 48,000 pins in a single day. (Pg. 3-5)He frankly acknowledges that \\"masters\\" (i.e., employers) are \\"always and every where\\" in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate. \\"To violate this combination is every where a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbors and equals.\\" (Pg. 66-67) Yet he also notes that the inhabitants of a town \\"can easily combine together,\\" so that by voluntary associations and agreements they prevent that free competition \\"which they cannot prohibit by bye-laws.\\" (Pg. 126) He observes that \\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\\" (Pg. 128)Of course, the most lastingly influential idea in the book is his concept of the \\"invisible hand,\\" by which an individual who \\"intends only his own gain... (is) led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention... By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\\" He adds ironically, \\"I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.\\" (Pg. 423)Ultimately, the private interests and passions of individuals naturally dispose them toward tasks which are most advantageous to society. \\"Without any intervention of law, therefore, the private interests and passions of men naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock of every society ... as nearly as possible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the whole society.\\" (Pg. 594-595)One cannot adequately summarize a masterwork such as Smith's within the confines of an Amazon review, of course. But anyone even remotely interested in economics and politics should seriously study this compelling and influential work."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I am going to refer to the original text version written by Adam Smith: This was absolutely a brutal read; however, it was more or less a paradox described as painfully interesting.

A.Smith says the welfare of a nation brings the happiness of its individuals, and it does NOT."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The greek tradition found virtue in the pursuit of rational self interest. That tradition later found expression in Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" in which is posited a \\"rational self-interest\\" operating as an \\"invisible hand\\" upon \\"free markets\\". Recent accounting crimes and corporate scandals, however, amount to enormous empirical evidence that \\"laissez faire\\" capitalism is a myth and the \\"invisible hand\\" is mere \\"wishful thinking\\".It is obvious that there is no \\"invisible hand\\" which militates against crooks, charlatans, and fast buck artists now seen to have firmly ensconced themselves as much in the board rooms as among sleazy fly-by-nighters.Markets left to their own devices trend toward oligopoly in which oligarchs effect political plutocracy through the exercise of sheer political muscle, intimidation, fraud, and outright bribery.If there is an \\"invisible hand\\", it has never moderated the rich and powerful. If a ruling cabal is to be moderated it must be done by political action.This is less a criticism of Smith himself than of modern economic conservatives and/or 'supply-siders' who find in Smith --ex post facto --a rationalization for rapacious and monopolistic behavior. Smith is no more to be faulted for this than Darwin should be faulted for the excesses of \\"Social Darwinism\\" --neither Social nor Darwin. \\"Social Darwinists\\" are most often associated with the age of the Robber Barons, providing them an ideological bias that justifies all manner of corporate crookedness and sleazy practices.To his credit, Smith himself feared the rise of monopoly power --a fear which modern conservative commentary either does not understand or omits entirely.The picture is complicated, however by Immanuel Kant who assailed the pursuit of self interest in favor of \\"good in and of itself\\" --a \\"categorical imperative\\". It is a moral standard that no one, of course, can live up to. Nevertheless, Kant became the other great influence upon American conservative thought --though I cannot give most contemporary conservatives credit for having actually read Kant or, for that matter, understanding him.Yet --Kant may be found lurking beneath the ideological surface of the extreme right-wing and the religious right which seeks to impose upon us a \\"transcendental\\" reality and morality whether we like it or not.It is unfortunate that Kant himself defined this \\"transcendent reality\\" --which he calls the noumena --as being unknowable. If follows, by definition, that one cannot make meaningful statements about it, but that has not kept righteous ideologues from deducing from this \\"unknowable\\" value judgments and imposing those values judgments on others. By definition, nothing meaningful can be said about whatever is \\"unknowable\\"!We are given a choice of two mutually exclusive alternatives: \\"selfishness\\" or \\"selfless transcendentalism\\". Neither position, however, is entirely true and neither is completely understood even by the conservative mentality that espouses them. Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" is no more valid than Laffer's \\"trickle down\\" theory and it is highly doubtful that even Kant lived up to his own moral dictum --though I credit Kant with sincerity but doubt it among his followers. I rather think that \\"mankind\\" is neither entirely selfish or entirely selfless.The truth is most likely found in the middle. The work of mathematician John Nash, celebrated of late in the motion picture \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", wrote a brilliant paper on \\"binding agreements\\" that casts grave doubts upon many \\"conservative\\" fables, shibboleths, and fairy tales --including those whose origins lie in \\"mutually exclusive\\" intellectual traditions.

I would recommend Wealth of Nations to anyone who has a mild interest in Economics. Brian Oley"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book has two massive and core problems, each one of them large enough to make this book incredibly, even dangerously, misleading.The first problem of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is not to be found in identifying all those familiar, and illogical anomalies that have been proven through experience false, and are well known (the \\"invisible hand\\" and others); nor the fact that Smith completely hides the history of his own country (how after the English civil war the English pursued an incredibly protectionist series of policies); but that all these complaints can be seen as stemming from one underlying problem in Smith's analysis: which was almost exclusively that of a micro-economist. This is highly contrary to how this book is interpreted, yet, if understood, explains many of Wealth of Nation's failings.The second major failing of this book is that through its clever wording and euphemisms it completely changed the language of economics. No longer would the British come out in direct language of their intentions in the House of Lords of the hostility and economic warfare that they were perpetually waging (and continue to wage to this day, albeit in a much different form) in open, brutal and naked language; they would do it through euphemistic and sophistical language. When we observe other methods of modern economic imperialism, the IMF for example, we see that the tools of the language that Smith pioneered have been perfected to a science - just Google the latest IMF policy papers or interviews to see what I'm talking about.To illustrate this fact in summation, rather than in a case-by-case, chapter-by-chapter disassembly that nobody would read nor would fit in this format, I'll turn to Friedrich List who illustrated these problems of Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" brilliantly in his 1841 book \\"The National System of Political Economy\\". For the sake of brevity, I'll only include List shining a light to the later of these two problems, that is, the total obfuscation of the language of economics post-Wealth of Nations.\\"...The ministers of George I in 1721 openly declared, on the occasion of the prohibition of the importation of the manufactures of India, that it was clear that a nation could only become wealthy and powerful if she imported raw materials and exported manufactured goods. Even in the times of Lords Chatham and North, they did not hesitate to declare in open Parliament that it ought not to be permitted that even a single horse-shoe nail should be manufactured in North America. In Adam's Smith's time, a new maxim was for the first time added to those which we have above stated, namely, to conceal the true policy of England under the cosmopolitical expressions and arguments which Adam Smith had discovered, in order to induce foreign nations to imitate that policy.It is very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. In this lies the secret of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical tendencies of his great contemporary William Pitt, and of all his successors in the British Government administrations.Any nation which by means of protective duties and restrictions on navigation has raised her manufacturing power and her navigation to such a degree of development that no other nation can sustain free competition with her, can do nothing wiser that throw away these ladders of her greatness, to preach to other nations the benefits of free trade, and to declare in penitent tones that she has hitherto wandered in the paths of error, and has now for the first time succeeded in discovering the truth.William Pitt was the first English statesmen who clearly perceived in what way the cosmopolitcal theory of Adam Smith could be properly made use of, and not in vain did he himself carry about a copy of the work on the Wealth of Nations. His speech in 1786, which was addressed neither to Parliament nor to the nation, but clearly to the ears of the statesmen of France, who were destitute of all experience and favour of the Eden Treaty, is an excellent specimen of Smith's style of reasoning. By nature he said France was adapted for agriculture and the production of wine, as England was thus adapted to manufacturing production. These nations ought to act towards one another just as two great merchants would do who carry on different branches of trade and who reciprocally enrich one another by the exchange of goods. Not a word here of the old maxim of England, that a nation can only attain to the highest degree of wealth and power in her foreign trade by the exchange of manufactured products against agricultural products and raw materials. This maxim was then, and has remained since, and English State secret; it was never again openly professed, but was all the more persistently followed.\\"-Friedrich List, 1841 Political EconomyWe can all agree that certain areas are more suitable to certain types of farming, but what does it mean that \\"England was thus adapted to manufacturing production\\"? As if, while grapes to make wine sprung from the earth in France, fully formed factories were springing from the earth in England and that each nation should therefore simply take what was provided to them. This sheer nonsense was later refined and perfected by such degenerates as J.B. Say and, of course, David Ricardo.As a book that professes to explain macro-economics \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is a catastrophic failure. And this explains a lot of why the modern schools of economics that build their edifice upon this \\"foundation\\" are so worthless at creating prosperity, progress, predicting anything of any merit, etc. This book originated, insofar as I am aware, the idea of looking at The Market and The State as a dichotomy rather than as using an observational and scientific approach, which concludes that looking at Macro-economics with anything other than the role of modern Nation-State at its primary focus is pure folly. Friedrich List defines Smith's work brilliantly when identifies \\"Wealth of Nations\\" as the \\"economics of a shop-keeper\\" - that is, a focus on the exchange of value rather than the creation of value. What a different world we would live in if List was widely read and understood; for List's work is infinitely more adept at explaining how productive forces come into being and how macro-economies function than Smith. Adam Smith's work, the State is giving the far back-seat in favor of The Market that Smith mythologized and the legendary Individual (Man, as such) that Smith makes so popular. There are many books that dispel this nonsensical view from simply observing the historical record, read \\"Debt\\" by David Graeber or Friedrich List's \\"Political Economy\\" (I recommend both, but the latter book much more so). If you accept the major tenants of this book as they have been popularized then you will be yet another anti-historical fool, but don't worry, you'll have plenty of company.However, for many things, Smith's micro-approach is very good and yields usable information and therefore shouldn't be completely disregarded. But drawing the line of what is useful and what is fantasy in this book is no easy task for those that don't read an incredible amount of economics books or who's minds haven't already been turned to mush from an \\"education\\" (indoctrination) in modern economics. It is this very reason that I, reluctantly in spite of this books merits, give it 1 star.If you are going to read this book then you should read the other side of the argument and give it fair consideration. The \\"other side\\" (that is, the objective, factually based one that is derived from historical observation) from what Smith professes can be found with the following authors: Daniel Raymond, John Barnard Byle, Willard Phillips, Friedrich List, Webster G. Tarpley, Ha-Joon Chang, Steve Keen, Michael Hudson, Herman Finer, Heikki Patomaki, John Quiggin, Les Leopold, and of course Alexander Hamilton."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I ordered this book for my son.

He explained that all work had to behighly organized in order to be productive. In addition, herecognized that machinery facilitated work. This notion servesas an important foundation for more modern patent practice.He praised the ingenuity of inventors and makers of newmachinery. The author spoke of increased production as acondition precedent to enhancing the power of labor. From thisprecept, he explained that the size of a market would dictatethe division of its constituent labor. For instance, a smallcommunity in the suburbs might be serviced by a local&quot;General Store&quot;; whereas, a county in a large city would beserviced by a retail chain store with hundreds of employeesand a highly sophisticated management structure.In Adam Smith'stime, metals were popular in the manufacture of commodities.Problems were encountered in weighing the metals and arrivingat a uniform system of metrics. The theory of pricing wasa function of the toil needed to purchase a good. For instance,the price of an auto was a function of the many hours of labornecessary to earn the money to buy the car. In addition, the price of an item was related to its constituent parts.For instance, the price of linen was a function of the laborof the flaxdresser, spinner, weaver, bleacher and overallemployer. The natural price varied with the price of componentparts. For instance, if the semiconductor was reduced significantly in price- then the overall price of an electronicappliance would go down. Adam Smith saw labour as a functionof national wealth. He recognized that laborers had to earnmore than a mere subsistence in order to live dignified lives.He told a story of a mother in the Highlands of Scotland whohad to raise 20 children so that 2 would survive. Presumably,18 children would die from various diseases and poverty.The interest rates at the time were low. In England, rateshovered at 5%. In France, the rates were 3-5% . The governmentcould borrow at 2% in Holland.Adam Smith defined a wage as a function of the following:o the ease or hardship to do workConsider the case of a diamond cutter. The art of cutting adiamond is a precise process which requires extensive trainingand expert worksmanship. The demand for precious stones was afunction of their inherent beauty, scarcity and workmanshipinvolved in polishing them and preparing them for commercial use.o the difficulty and expense of learning a tradeA skilled surgeon required years of medical training and along apprenticeship in anatomy and surgery.o the constancy of employmento the trust reposed in the workpeopleConsider the case of a landowner who took a year-long vacationto the Orient. He/she would leave behind a manager to run theentire business on a 24/7 basis. This high degree of trustreposed in the workperson required a commensurate compensation.o probability of success or failure of the ventureConsider the effort required to cross the Atlantic. The tripwas lengthy, dangerous and prone to failure due to the vagariesof nature, pirating on the high seas and disease. Naturally,a worker had to receive a greater compensation to take thesefactors into consideration.o the danger inherent in doing the workConsider the danger inherent in entering a diamond mine.The possibility of collapse was a constant threat. Accordingly,workers were compensated commensurate with the threat level.Adam Smith explained that fear of misfortune dampened the takingof risks. He knew (intuitively) that investors were risk averse.In addition, there was a restriction on training new labor.In Sheffield, no master cutter could train more than a singlecutter . Apprenticeships were lengthy. i.e. 7 years in lengthAdam Smith explained that food was a source of rent to thelandowners. The pricing of metals was a function of the pricein the most fertile mine in the world. Whatever increased thefertility of the land increased its value by implication.Markets in foodstuffs were restricted because refrigerationdid not exist until motors and condensers were perfected.Essentially, there were no operable refrigerators until thefamous Clausius statement was perfected in the engineeringsciences.Accordingly, the market for butcher's meat was confined to thecountry of origin. Wool and raw hide could be transported;however, meat was consumed locally as its shelf-life was limited.The value of money was a function of the value of annual produce.Accordingly, increased quantities of commodities raised thevalue of money. Low fixed rates of interest promoted businessand discouraged usury. Riches were a function of the annualproduce which created the wealth and supported the tax base.High duties were enforced to protect the local markets. Treatiesbetween countries helped local merchants to craft meaningfultrade sequences. Exports were encouraged . The expense oferecting public works was a function of the taxes raised on theland and the proportion of yield from the crops.Governments granted bounties to merchants who wanted to selloverseas in order to assist them in making a profit anddefraying costs/risks.

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself.

Truly, &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is to economics what Newton's Principia is to physics. It is not perfect, but considering the time in which it was written it was an amazing accomplishment.The reader will find discussions on a great many topics, but what is especially fascinating is the insight into 1700's Britain that is provided. Remember, this book was published in 1776. Smith even discusses the &quot;recent troubles with the colonies&quot;--America.It is emminently readable, though it becomes less so in certain sections--the digression on silver, for example. However, if one takes it slowly, then one can easily digest this feast of intellectual achievement in a relatively short time. Afterwards, the works of Ricardo, Marx, Keynes--to name a few--should be tackled.Again, highly recommended."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"If you have any interest at all in Economics, you'll want to go to the source. This is the source. Adam Smith lays the groundwork for the study of Economics in this very readable treatise.Though he is discussing 18th century Britain, the topics he discusses have direct analogs in the modern American economy. Taxes, trade, money, monopoly, tarrifs, and international trade balance are all tackled with aplomb.He really lays into Mercantilism and blasts the protectionism it engenders. Never anything less than a champion of the common man, Smith decrys monopolies and other taxes on those most unable to afford them. Though he seems to be a total free marketeer, he takes great pains to examine the types of taxes which would be useful and prudent for a government to levy.Once or twice may be fine, but Smith uses this construction for almost every sentence in the book. It is just a stylistic gripe, but the length and complexity of each sentence make digesting the information quite a bit more difficult than it otherwise could have been. I would not be at all disappointed to see this book translated to a more modern style.Again, if you're interested in Economics at all, this book is the place to start. There is so much good information here to be absorbed and pondered. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Nobody seriously involved in economics can do without this exhaustive work, originally published in five volumes as An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. This classic is a pragmatic and accessible milestone in the history of economics. Its author, Adam Smith, is woven into every economics textbook. However, Smith's theories, which today often are recounted mostly in fragments, frequently incorrectly, reveal their entire social and economic innovative power only in context. Smith burst onto the scene at a time when absolutist national states monopolized the world's precious metal reserves and tried to increase their own wealth through stringent export policies. These states were motivated by an entirely new concept about national wealth: that it stemmed from the work of the country's people, not from gold. Based on that idea, economic markets should balance themselves as if guided by an \\"invisible hand,\\" impelled by each individual's self-interest. The state has to provide only an orderly framework and specific public goods and services. Even though Smith's image of idealized economic and social harmony may have developed a few cracks over the course of time, his ideas have inspired many well-known economists during the past 250 years, including David Ricardo, Vilfredo Pareto, Friedrich August von Hayek and Milton Friedman. We highly recommend this seminal work."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Note that the complete edition of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is usually published in two volumes. The only exception I'm aware of is the University of Chicago Press' edition, which specifically states that it is \\"two volumes in one;\\" note that this means double-numbering, as the page numbers restart for the second \\"volume\\". The reason that it usually comes in two volumes is that it is a very, very long work, totaling over 1000 pages, and abridgement is apparently so common that it isn't stated directly by publishers. So, if the edition you're considering buying has less than 1000 pages, it is either only one of the two volumes, or it is abridged. It doesn't help that Amazon often provides the \\"inside pages\\" of a different edition from the one you're viewing, so if you want to check the table of contents to see just what's in a particular edition, you may be misled. If what you want is the complete work look for something that indicates that it is \\"unabridged\\"."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"After hearing about socialism from too many people who do not know and admit to not knowing what the word means, it makes sense to return to the sources and read. Start with Adam Smith. To be clear, Adam Smith is writing about capitalism, but how many of us know what that word means? Adam Smith is a good place to start learning before you start opining.This is not a simple read. The style is not as dense as was typical in 1776 but it can be just as elliptical.Interesting, although tangential is that the book mentions the American Revolution but only as an incidental backdrop to the more import issue of how and why money is created and moves. How well Mr Smith understood the then nascent industrial revolution is a hypotheses for a more learned reviewer than myself.Over all there is a great deal of repetition, and repetition with slight variation , punctuated by a scattering of tables, none of which printed as readable in my e version. This being said, Mr. Smith writes with a power granted to those who first encode a new world view. His is the more powerful because most of this work consists of a logical argument laid out in simple words.While many of us were exposed to the basics, capital, land labor, lowest cost, investment seeking the highest return, taxes bad (although not always) and so forth, I was struck by some of the lessor taught observations.Written in a time when there was no functioning concept of labor union, Mr. Smith warns that labor will loose against owners. The law (then) tended prevent labor from organizing and owners frequently socialized together, had common interests and therefor could be expected to overpower the labor virtually at will.Perhaps the single most telling comment, and the one most significant to today is his comment that when business interests attempt to make or influence public policy it is best to assume that they are lying or seeking action at the expense of public interest. Mr. Smith gives no third possibility.This is a great classic in western thought. I am tempted to say it should be mandatory. E editions certainly make it affordable. But For all you Wall Street occupiers and big wigs, Greek protesters, and Tea Party literalists, Obama haters, and anyone with a loud opinion on economics, this is a good place to start educating yourself. It might be nice to hear the shouting from some one who has done some homework."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"For anyone coming to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations the first surprise is how readable it is. Famous classic of economic theory though it may be, this is no dry academic tome to be read only by people with a scholarly interest in economic history. There are no detailed tables of statistics of the sort one might expect to find in a modern book on the subject, and no mathematical analysis, indeed not very much quantitative information at all. Instead there is a long series of examples to explain such ideas as why it is more efficient to divide work among several specialists rather than have a complete task fulfilled by one person, or why slave labour is ultimately more expensive than paying free workers, even workers in cities like Boston or New York, where wages were far higher in Smith's time than those in his native Scotland.To illustrate the principle of the division of labour Smith discusses the manufacture of nails. Even a blacksmith -- skilled in working with a hammer but with no special training in nail making -- could not make more than a few hundred nails in a day, and those of poor quality. A specialist nail maker could make more than two thousand, but much greater improvements, both in quality and quantity, come from recognizing that even a task as apparently simple as manufacturing a nail can be broken up into smaller tasks: maintaining the fire at the right temperature, hammering the nail into the right shape, using a different tool to form the head, and so on.A popular edition of Wealth of Nations is inevitably abridged, as one can hardly expect to buy a complete scholarly edition for a price not much more than that of a novel. Complete editions are available as well, but they are much more expensive. With sensible editing, however, an abridged version can include as much of Smith's writing as the ordinary reader is likely to want, together with notes to explain points that will be obscure to the modern reader. In the Oxford World's Classics edition Kathryn Sutherland has made an excellent job of this, with notes that fill around a fifth of the length of the book."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This is one of the truly great books produced by the Western world. Although much has been written on economics since, it considerably broadened my perspective to read it in the original.I can't help feeling that those who pan Wealth of Nations as an apology for exploitation simply haven't read it. That&#65533;s simply not what the book is about. For if you really do care about the underpriveleged masses -- and it's imminently clear that he really does -- then you better consciously organize your state in such a manner that money will flow naturally where it's most needed.I'd been told before I read it by several people that AS was, for example, apologizing for the East India Trading Company? Does his apology for EIT include the lengthy chapter which discuss in full detail how and why the East India Trading Company was responsible for an wide array of abuses in the Far East, and why no similar company would be legal if a society were fully moral and knew its own best interest?Nor is it a blind apology for laissez faire economics, though it does recommend non-intervention by the government insofar as that is possible. Still he fully recognizes the need for social services, rightly understood and rightly executed.In fact, I can't see how anyone who reads it could view it as an apology at all -- it's simply a statement of fact. Adam Smith is not the one carrying an ideology around on his shoulder. You may not like it that the world works this way -- that's another matter. But that IS the way it works... you are made to see that for yourself. It is not imposed on you as dogma.And after reading AS, I'm left feeling very happy that that's the way the world works.I think the most fundamental idea I am left with after reading all those pages, is that wealth is a verb, not a noun. Land and labor (i.e. food and farming) are the bottom line of economics. Treat your farmers well. Unjust practices in trading will ultimately backfire.The dynamo which runs the machine that creates wealth lies within each individual - it is the individual&#65533;s will to better his or her condition. To the degree that this aspect of human nature is given the power to express itself , the nation will be vitalized internally."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats.

It is worth reading, but for those with less time, I recommend \\"The Essential Adam Smith\\"The Essential Adam SmithContent Summary: The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" contains Adam Smith's classic defense of free trade, and his simultaneous attack on the mercantilist system of his day. Mercantilism was a policy favoring exports and discouraging imports, while trying to maximize the silver and gold coins brought into the nation. Smith points out that this policy was self-defeating, that trade barriers invite retaliatory trade barriers. Mercantilism actually discouraged greater economic growth. Smith further argues that free trade, with a focus upon producing commodities and commanding more productive labor, is actually the more prosperous alternative. Besides many other things he says, he was in favor of an inheritance tax for the wealthy, opposed to taxes on wages, for generally minimizing all taxes as much as feasible, and repeats the idea that the wealthy have some greater responsibility to give back to their country in proportion to their wealth. In fact, it is in their self-interest to do so, to assure a prosperous and secure nation that protects their own wealth. The \\"invisible hand\\", which people are so fond of quoting - appears only once in this book (and thrice in all Smith's writings). It does suggest that it is through pursuing their own free, self-interest, that men render a greater prosperity to society.Analytical Review: Smith's argument, that free trade renders a more prosperous economy, is probably a good one. Capitalism has been a vehicle for generating greater wealth, but not always generating greater equality. It must be pointed out of course, that there rarely if ever has been a completely free market. I believe Marx's Communist radical alternative has not and will not supplant capitalism. What Marx understood, however, was a greater sense of social justice. Marx's writing is loaded with justified sentiment for the oppression of the working poor, and his labor theory of value in \\"Capital\\" goes a long way to augment and correct (but not entirely substitute) Smith's omissions. Smith had absorbed the very hierarchical, class-based values of his time. In several passages on slavery, for example, Smith's strongest condemnation is to call it an \\"unfortunate\\" institution. What Smith understood better was that humans are self-interested and will prosper more generally through a free market. But Smith also opposed the power of monopolies, and believed some provision should be made for the poor, and that plays into Marx's thought. Marx had greater insight into the abusive dominance of monopoly capitalism, and its often cold-shouldered indifference to the inequities it produced. In a nutshell, Smith gave us the wisdom that the free market is better, but Marx has given us the corrective that a fair and just use of capital is a better (and yes - you might add even democratic of Christian) ideal. A free-market economy, with some corrective for social justice and common welfare, is my view of a compromise between them. My advice - we have much to learn from both Smith and Marx, if only critics would often read them before speaking too brashly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Out of necessity, whenever an original work is \\"abridged,\\" the abridger must make a value judgment regarding what in the original work is worthwhile (and will be preserved), and what is not of relevance, and will thus be discarded and placed beyond your view.

First, it is truly \\"complete and unabridged.\\" So, you get the real deal, all thousand pages of it. Second, it includes Edwin Cannan's summaries in the margin that assist in reading this thick tome. Cannan also provides an enlarged index that serves as a quick reference. And third, the Introduction by Robert Reich and the Commentary at the end by R.H. Campbell and A.S. Skinner are very helpful in better understanding this work. You may get more out of those two sections than Smith's thousand pages of writing.This book was written before the field of economics theory existed. As a result, Smith's writings do not include such common words as: economics, recession, expansion, contraction, inflation, GDP, common stocks, and securities. Thus, his writings has no resemblance to modern economics commentary. Given that, it is challenging interpreting what he is saying in modern context.Smith could not be an economist since the latter profession did not exist he had to be something else: a moral philosopher. In the 18th century if you studied hard sciences you were a natural philosopher. And, if you studied anything else you were a moral philosopher. Such a broad base binomial taxonomy of all intellectual scientific fields had great advantages. This is because moral philosophy included all the fields that today are pretty separate such as: logic, rhetoric, psychology, sociology. On a more granular level moral philosophy as advanced by Smith included microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, behavioral finance, international economics, etc... Nowadays, all those fields are fairly demarcated.In view of the above, Smith's intellectual legacy is in part timeless. This is because he was concerned about the speculations that went inside individuals' minds just as he was concerned about the productivity of labor, small businesses, and the economy at large. His cogitations covered the entire fields of behavioral finance, macro and macroeconomics.Smith's thinking was far more complex and nuanced than the ones of his libertarian followers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Alan Greenspan. They all missed more than half of Smith's message. That included Smith support for labor unions (at a time when labor abuse was rampant), government regulations including very tight regulation of banking. Smith also was opposed to the might of large corporation as he was suspicious of their collaborating to depress wages and their colluding on prices before laws banned such practices. Thus, Smith was far more the precursor of Keynes than Milton Friedman. Yet, this is not what the economic profession conveys to the outside world.Smith's posterity and prescience are second to none. Unfortunately, his writing in a contemporary setting is unreadable. For my part, I got a lot more about Smith's thoughts from reading digested modern interpretations from others than from reading Smith's own writing. In this regard, I recommend three books. James BuchanThe Authentic Adam Smith: His Life and Ideas (Enterprise)is excellent and solely focused on Adam Smith and his writings. Arthur HermanHow the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in Itcovers the entire Scottish Enlightenment. And, John CassidyHow Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamitiescriticizes the entire field of economics. Yet, he describes Adam Smith as a far more balanced and complex thinker than his modern followers."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"In his day monarchies, emerging democracies, business people and government employees were profoundly inept in the affairs of economics, trade and taxation. We have come a long way. Now governments are simply inept including the USA government. When you compare the errors in governmental affairs that he reviewed more than two hundred years ago to the mistakes and wrong governmental policies of today there is considerable reason for optimism.What a damning review of governmental affairs he wrote. This is the predominant reason for reading this book. Secondarily, to trace the development of economic thought. Adam Smith was one of the greatest pioneers in the science of economics. There are areas where we now know he was in error. Science content of modern economics is more profound than most observers are willing to admit. If you just want to learn about economics you would be well served to first read more current economists. In modern times, Milton Friedman has played a similar role. Again there is that radical urgency to place Friedman in the conservative pile before they decide the correctness of his thought. The legacy of critically reviewing the errors of democratic governments as well as repressive governments will hopefully be kept alive and well. Much is left to be done-- even in the USA. A very exciting question remains what happens when the repressive leaders of China realize that good economic policy and political freedom are so deeply intertwined that there repression is truly doomed. Will the end be destructive or positive. It is surely coming.Similarly in the USA and other developed nations, as more people learn economics on the path to greater involvement in business, investing and entrepreneurship one would expect increasing rebellion against the reckless of policies by politicians and the uninformed contentions of the media. There are many helpful books some I have recently reviewed that can broaden ones understanding of governmental failings in economic policy.While everybody would benefit from more knowledge about economics, the basic shortcomings of the media and politicians is of critical concern. It is no surprise that reviewers of economics related books have to rush to place any book either in the conservative pile or the liberal pile. Why or how one decides to place Adam Smith in the conservative pile, is surely the sickness of political views over logic. While it is unfortunate that the Great Minds Series does not disclose that this is an abridged edition, most readers will find this is more than enough to read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is surprisingly easy to understand, and Smith's insights apply to current issues of taxation, globalization, and the striving of special interests. Reading the observations of someone who was a contemporary of America's founding fathers, but not one of them, gave me a new perspective on the 1700s. Passing references to the vast, but stagnant wealth of China, as well as to colonial enterprises from South America to Asia, add historical flavor to what could have been a dry summary of economic theory, but is instead a rich and colorful exposition of the world as it was.Having just spent some time in Manila earlier this year visiting historical sites and museums, I was intrigued to read about Spain's \\"Acapulco ships\\" that carried silver and other commodities from Mexico across the vast Pacific to the Philippines. Indeed, over and over I found myself putting my finger between the pages so I could daydream for a few minutes, imagining Spanish galleons loaded with treasure, or European merchants bartering and haggling. I suppose a vivid imagination helps to make any book more interesting, but this book in particular lends itself to such flights of fancy.The English of the mid- to late 1700s is not exactly the same as ours today, but it's close enough that few people will have any difficulty with the book. There are a lot of references to weights and measures of gold, silver, corn and other commodities, and their relative value to one another. Frankly, after the first few such references, I simply began skipping over them. Readers who enjoy playing with numbers in their heads may prefer to read those items carefully and playfully -- but I suspect most folks will skip across them as quickly as possible just as I did. It's not the specific values and figures that make this book so important (or enjoyable), but it's ideas about how capital flows, accumulates, is put to productive use and so on.Read this book and gain a new appreciation for the wisdom of the past, and you may also find yourself noting how ideas apply so directly to issues in today's headlines.

In addition, this edition makes the book too large and thus very uncomfortable for the reader to hold while reading.I highly suggest reading the Wealth of Nations, but I also strongly suggest to avoid this edition. Prefer the Bantam Classics edition."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the book is really fat, so when trying to read near the crack you have to sort of pry the book open, and it feels the binding might break.

It is difficult to understand if you don't have a good understanding of history and economics. It was written a couple of hundred years ago, and other books would be best read first."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This is in my top 5 best books of all time. I give it an A+. It is a very long read that covers a broad range of information involving economics, but well worth the time spent. There are a lot of references to issues that were occurring during Smith's time that may not seem to be pertinent to the reader, but can still be applied to modern times. I most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts. His 4 maxims of taxes are that they should be- equal, certain, convenient, and beneficial. He viewed inflation as \\"extremely pernicious\\". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is filled with great information you will find useful as well as having to find new things you never knew about. I will recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"pretty much the base for most modern thought on capitalism, while still being surprisingly relevant though it was written over 200 years ago."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I was not impressed to find that this is an abridgement, especially considering that I found it by reading the reviews and could not discern it from the book cover at all. For this reason I have marked it down to three stars. Smith is necessary reading for anyone interested in the history of Western thought, the Enlightenment or economics, but it must be said that it is dry, if admirably clear, reading and difficult to chew and swallow. For that reason, it is disappointing to get so far in and then find that one is not getting the complete work.There can be few books that have had such lasting influence on the cultural milieu. Unlike Marx, Smith's ideas seem to have stood up to the tide of history without being washed away, although I write at a time when the finance system appears to have just collapsed, so who knows how a little more history will judge it. At any rate, the correctness of Smith's ideas is perhaps of less import for the student of Western thought than its place in the emergence of a rationalist, secular culture. For Smith was part of the conscious project of the Enlightenment to introduce naturalistic models of our world in place of the magical thinking, in the form of divine providence, which preceded it. Smith was building a model of economy which did not rely on an external, disembodied agency but which emerged deterministically and reached equilibrium through the rule-based interactions of its component parts. His \\"invisible hand\\" replaced another.At the same time, he was making a case for personal autonomy and the right of economic self-determination. As such, Smith combines the two most salient threads of the Enlightenment project - liberation from authority and liberation from magic. More than perhaps any other Enlightenment figure, Smith has shaped the way we think as a political culture today. As such, one must read this book to understand the legacy of the Enlightenment. It is hard going, as he was a very thorough worker and this is economics, the most dismal of sciences, but indispensable.There is one misconception that this reading corrected for me which I ought to share, and that concerns Smith's alleged scepticism about \\"corporations\\". For Smith, and presumably for his contemporaries, this did not, as I thought, indicate opposition to public companies and multinationals in the way we would currently understand it. Rather, he referred to, and condemned, the system of closed trades and apprenticeships by which the market for certain trades was until recently widely protected from competition. I demur from taking sides in this, but it is important to mention the misunderstanding which arises out of the word \\"corporation\\", incautiously read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Buy the Liberty Fund Glasgow edition instead of this. This, the Modern Library edition, contains an introduction and footnotes that essentially amount to Adam Smith as interpreted by 20th century socialists -- placing Smith and Karl Marx at the same level in the pantheon of social thinkers. (One can imagine that the Modern Library may continue the trend and subsequently publish an edition of the Federalist Papers in which Madison is compared with Pol Pot.)If you wish to understand Smith, avoid this edition.

Smith has written much better in 1776 than nearly all economists do today.The marginal notes are good too. This book is a great book because it argues for some iron-hard economic rules in a way that Centre-left people, such as myself, will listen seriously to. Smith is not a neo-con by any stretch of the imagination. He speaks of employer combinations openly, whereas most economist writers won't talk about them, and he notes that combinations of employees (unions) are, in 1776, banned by the entire world. He also approves of regulations when they improve the safety of working people, something management still has a problem with.So Smith is more even handed than the right wing voices who cite his economic principles constantly, and deserves reading and citing by Centre-Left people."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Reading this reminded me of my Latin classes many years ago, trying to decipher the likes of Cicero. However, it is a refreshing read for anyone interested in economics. This book was written centuries before that word ever came into existence, but it clearly defines the natural laws of economics and can easily be compared/contrasted with Keynesian, Marxist, and Schaumpeter's views on economics.

So I had to resort to the usual CDs. This revealed an immediate shortcoming with Tantor's version. Although the announcements as to the current book, volume, and section on LibriVox are tiresome, you know where you are. Tantor's edition contains absolutely no index or printed table of contents for a 29 CD set. The current location is neither announced at the beginning of each CD, nor printed anywhere on the CD. So if you were reading the book and want to listen to the rest on audiobook, you have to listen to the whole thing from the beginning. :(The reader has a nice accent though. He delivers Smith's sarcasm and indignation very well. Contrary to popular belief, Adam Smith was a bit of a radical. He adamantly reiterates that of the workers, the landowners, and the merchants (read business people), the latter are the only group who should not lead a nation because their priorites will always lead it into ruin. Based upon his theory, which is still valid, the only reason the United States' economic system has not tanked is the petrodollar.As the book progresses his radicalism becomes increasingly apparent as he expresses his low opinion of the efforts to block free trade and posh schools like Oxford University, as well as his list of alternatives of what should be done with the new American colonies. He even declares that the missionary campaigns by the Catholic church during colonialism were only a pretense to get more gold--and this was in 1776!There are also miscellaneous digressions on the history of liberal education, banking, currencies, and organized western religion. All in all an excellent way to absorb a classic while your body is occupied, but your brain would not have been doing anything productive. It definitely contributes to a better understanding of our modern society."},{"Title":"100 Tips for Drums (100 Tips S.)","review":"I really enjoy this book and use it as a constant reference.Great funk grooves and world music too.

While acknowledging that there are genetic and environmental factors, Janov focuses on the negative biological factors that are imprinted upon the fetus. The absence of love adversely affects the nervous and hormonal systems, leaving a &quot;toxic brain environment&quot; that is less able to effect repression (those familiar with Janov's earlier writings may be surprised at this late praise for the biology of repression). Not surprisingly, The Biology of Love is also about primal therapy.Janov continues to praise Freud's hydraulic model and to denigrate dreams and, with less emphasis on curing neurosis, concedes that &quot;reliving normalizes.&quot; One surprise, though, is the absolute omission of &quot;brain maps,&quot; the celebrated centerpiece of his last book (Janov, 1996). In these dreary times of corporate managed care and polypharmacology, it's certainly heartening to see a new work by Janov, the bold and innovative thinker and psychotherapist. The Biology of Love is a showcase of earlier insights, assertions, andaccomplishments. In addition, there are some new ideas and assertions about love and therapy, as well as thirteen original case presentations on primal therapy. And one must acknowledge Janov's growing microhumility. In the current volume, for example, he acknowledges that he sits at the feet of Dr. Paul MacLean, and that he is indebted to Drs. Leboyer and Odent for their important contributions. Moreover (and uncharacteristically), he shares a bit more personal information--including a cameo of his own traumatic birth anoxia and subsequent birth feelings. But clearly, Janov's &quot;credibility problems&quot; (Mithers, 1994) continue. The Biology of Love reduces human love to hormones and dendrites. Perhaps we should ask whether Janov's biological reductions enrich, or perhaps trivialize, our understanding of love and the mystery of life.

People must be aware that there are a small contingent of his patients who strongly disagree with some of his conclusions, as they come across as somewhat impulsive to me, too. He is a brilliant man, but I always keep in mind that he is speaking from his own universe... To prove my point, here's a fun exercise you can do when reading his books. Use every sentence he says, especially some of the wider-sweeping, polemic claims he makes about humanity and apply it DIRECTLY to HIM in the first person, as if he was talking about himself instead of the world at large. For instance, he writes that, &quot;Although the brain is a very complicated organ, it is not mystical.&quot; Dr. Janov is an atheist, so I believe that he should have written, &quot;Although MY brain is a very complicated organ, it is not mystical.&quot; This is called &quot;projection&quot; in psychiatric circles. I'm sure there are plenty of other things he has written in the third person that the reader can easily transfer into the first person (applying to Dr. Janov himself).

There is danger of false memories, or just a general blackening of real memories - a negative re-evaluation of neutral memories that can cause relationship problems with one's family. Avoid primal-therapy writings and this therapy as if it were a cult."},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"Speaking from someone who's done plenty of Primal Therapy, once again, Janov lays out, in glorious grandiosity, a beautiful and coherent theory of life, love, and neurosis. Janov's strength is in his ability to articulate with poetic brilliance the reasons, as he sees it, for all manner of psychological illnesses, and guess what? I think he's right. Everything he describes in his book I have either witnessed or experienced first hand during my own stint in Primal Therapy. There is one downfall, however, as I see it. Although this latest book definitely reflects a change with respect to how long it takes to really get down to those core feelings - I'm talking about the ones that really do change brain chemistry, and moves the biological system back toward &quot;normalcy&quot; - he doesn't go far enough in explaining how difficult and lengthy the process truly is. Let me tell you, it takes a very long time. It is not as easy as it reads in Janov's books, and I must add, that I am yet to see a Primal therapist that is still not, to some degree, a victim of his/her own repression. But the theory holds, and perhaps this is the most important thing to remember. Do just one month of Primal therapy, and I challenge you to ever go back into psychoanalysis again. It will seem like a complete waist of time, which in the end, as Janov explains in his book, it is. Even if Janov is 50% correct in his theory, he is still miles and miles ahead of the rest of the psychological community, which, as Janov explains, does nothing more than perpetuates the neurosis in its patients. Janov is nothing short of a revolutionary, no less important that Freud. That may be a dramatic statement, but this is a dramatic book. The only discrepancy I have found between Janov's theory in \\"The Biology Of Love\\" and the application of that theory is the time frame in which all those important childhood and birth feelings emerge. There also seems to be a change in the nature of repression itself, as Janov now describes it. Where once repression's existence was described as solely the result of an overload of pain from childhood, it is now described as a natural state which can be overwhelmed by too much pain, and which continues to exist even after that overload is &quot;emptied,&quot; or re-lived. This book not only reflects the change in the climate of psychotherapy as a whole, but also reflects the change in Primal Therapy itself since its conception. As usual, it's a must read."},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"I think so. First, because I could not put it down. Dr. Janov has written a sophisticated and scientific book about the human psyche, how the brain can change as the result of lack of love.Sophisticated and yet accessible to the lay person of which I am.I was fascinated to read the latest available research in neurology; and how we treat our children affects their brain and who they are forever. So much of it makes total sense. It is brilliant to be able to understand how it all works. Of course, a child treated with respect and love through gestation, birth and childhood.Dr. Janov says loving a child is making sure it doesn't suffer anoxia at birth (a common occurence in the way our children are born these days), making sure mothers treat themselves - their future baby - with respect, that they don't smoke, that they take care of themselves...while creating a new human being in this world.Dr. Janov's book is all about love and how to love our children.I read with amazement a professional review accusing THE BIOLOGY OF LOVE of laying guilt on poor mothers. What a pathetic way to read this book. But to deprive future children of the incredible data this book provides is doing great harm. Dr. Janov has put together in a powerful framework the first unifying theory that at last makes sense of the human sciences, neurology, biology and psychology.Isn't it crucial to know how to become a fully integrated human being that won't be plagued by psychosomatic illness, will have no need to drink and take drugs? And of course the right definition of love for a child is to give them what they need, physiologically, as well as psychologically so that they don't suffer traumas at all stages of their development.Dr. Janov is giving us the formidable tool to understand through research what we can do to make sure our children have all the chances for a life free of neurosis later on.Witness research like:&quot;A MOTHER'S LOOK AT A CHILD CAN REGULATE BLOOD FLOW TO HIS BRAIN (CORTEX) AND IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT BRAIN.&quot;&quot;TOUCHING A CHILD ALLOWS FOR GREATER DENSITY OF SYNAPSES IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN: THE MORE DENSE THE SYNAPSES THE MORE INFORMATION THE BRAIN CAN HANDLE.&quot;&quot;EARLY TOUCH AND A MOTHER'S LOVE PRODUCE ENDOGENOUS PAIN KILLERS THAT STAY FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES AND HELP KEEP US COMFORTABLE AND FREE OF ANXIETY.&quot;&quot;STRESS AND ABUSE ALTER THE STRUCTURE OF A CHILD'S BRAIN (IMPAIRS CELLS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS WHICH REGISTERS EMOTIONAL FACTS).&quot;&quot;A FETUS REGISTERS PAIN AND MAKES CRYING MOTIONS IN THE WOMB.&quot;&quot;STRESS IN A CARRYING MOTHER CAN ALTER THE SEXUAL HORMONES OF THE OFFSPRING AND THEREBY ALTER LATER SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"&quot;A hug or a kiss raises dopamine levels,&quot; says Dr. Janov, and on he goes blending psychology and neuro-science. Whether or not you &quot;believe&quot; in primal scream, so much of what he writes about just rings true to common sense. One reason what he writes is hard to take, I think, is that some things about birthing are so beyond our control, even if we're a caring parent, e.g., if you have to have a baby by c-section, you have to. But there's still all the time of infancy and onward -- &quot;Touching a child allows for greater density of synapses in the developing brain,&quot; he writes, &quot;the more dense the synapses the more information the brain can handle.&quot; Whether you agree with what he says, or you don't, he makes his point (and it's extremely well annotated) and you won't walk away untouched. Read the chapter called &quot;The Gate-Control Theory.&quot; Wow!"},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"In this book,Dr.Janov shows what love and -contrarily- lack of love means in the different phases (womblife,birth,infancy) of our early lives.The experiences of our early lives affect our brains in a multi-ple manner,and if these experiences are traumatic they will remain,with all their original power,in the subcortical networksof our brains and determine the quality of our adult lives.Janov offers a therapy enabling suffering people to return to the beginnings of their lives and resolve those early and deeply hidden pain which is responsible for a wide spectrum of symptomsand will finally shorten life.It is not easy to get there.So it is important to be put on the right track.And it is not easy to go through these traumata.So it is important to have somebody standing by us during the difficult phases of this process.When the levels of consciousness (page 106 in this book) can com-municate with each other without interference (see page 231 &quot;TheGate-Control Theory&quot;) we come to be feeling creatures again.After all it is a completely natural process.We help the brain (which will find its own rhythm)get rid of something having in-vaded like an alien force and keeping hidden.It is an ancient,evolutionary phenomenon (see THE NEW PRIMAL SCREAM by Dr.Janov,page 25,&quot;The Nature of Emotional memory&quot;)THE BIOLOGY OF LOVE comprises a fullness of technical informa-tion.Janov presents a lot of material from scientific researchwhich substantiates his theory.The weight of evidence is over-whelming.The paradigm of primal theory,the concept of the earlyimprint and its lasting effects,stands as firmly as a rock.Janov\`s antagonists in the field of psychology having so far pre-vented primal theory from being on offer in the curricula of mostuniversities will have increasing difficulties in ignoring ordiscrediting this new paradigm.HOW TO DISCREDIT A PHENOMENON THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED AND INFLU-ENCED HUMAN EVOLUTION FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS ??? A scientist whohas lost the connection to his personal (ontogenetic) history ,can no longer recognize the inner truths of our conditio humana.Having understood the message of this book, we are able to sparethe following generations a tremendous lot of pain.As hard as it may be,we must understand now that womblife,birth and infancy arethe most crucial phases of our lives.In these phases,we are mostvulnerable and may be damaged worst of all.It is not all the sameif a pregnant woman is smoking and drinking or if she is not.Itis not all the same whether birth happens on conditions of anesthesia or not.Janov says that heavy lack of oxygen (anoxia) is a central element of most birth traumata he has observed in his therapeuticpractice.On page 253 in his book he provides an exellent descrip-tion and explanation of what happens to the mother and the babyin the drugged birth.In the western world,the great majority of all birth processes goes under such circumstances.The conse-quences for the psychophysical state of health of the adult pop-ulation are anything but positive.THE WAY WE GIVE BIRTH TO OUR CHILDREN IS THE WAY WE PERPETUATENEUROSIS TO THE END OF TIME !I wonder whether the structures and institutions of neuroticsocieties may be changed in the foreseeable future.However,I knowfor sure that we can create microcosms making life a precious good.The smallest and yet most unsheakable of these microcosmsis our own deeply feeling self.I have experienced the symptom-reducing,life-saving benefits ofprimal therapy.A long,long journey along the chain of pain intothe deepest deposits of my history is coming to an end.I\`m look-ing forward to an entirely new consciousness and quality of life.Janov\`s book is well written like all of his former books. As alay person,I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"In just the first section of the book, Dr. Janov says so much of what needs to be said. As a Primal patient, I wish the world would heed what is in this book. He is the only professional to effectively unite the disciplines of psychology with the neurological sciences. If one is divorced from the other, the theory will be incomplete and any treatment will fail. Dr. Janov explains more about the nervous system than in his previous books. He also empahsizes how pre-natal experience affects a person's state of being, including his or her state of feeling, thought and behavior.He says what we as patients need the world to hear:&quot;Feelings are not businesses to be 'managed.' They are meant to be felt.&quot;&quot;We need access to our feelings to lead an intelligent life.&quot;&quot;Feeling is what makes us human.&quot;Dr. Janov again assures us that to delve into the deepest levels of conciousness is not at all scary, but that it is necessary to connect to, release and resolve old imprinted pain. As a Primal person, I have enjoyed the benefits of doing this and look forward to delving ever deeper."},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"Whatever one may accept about the Primal Hypotheses (I've been adhering to the &quot;Primal Reality&quot; for 30 years) the important fact that emerges is that we are all historical beings, and once imprinted, experience stays with us. Most recently actress Sally Field talked about an aspect of herself where she (still) feels &quot;little&quot; (in relationships with men). She hopes one day to &quot;overcome&quot; this, but as Dr. Janov overwhelmingly demonstrates, to fully resolve established patterns of behavior, reliving early experiences --accessing the &quot;early brain&quot; is the necessity.All I (mostly) learn from Janov is more &quot;pieces&quot; of the WHOLE. Little truly surprises me, but how significant womb experiences can be is a new revelation."},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"Sometimes the truth can be very painful, for some of us because it comes up against our own unreality. Still often the depth of our reaction can be an indicator that something has been touched inside us.There is a world out there that finds it inconvient for us to love our children, for us to take time to listen to their feelings, and nurture their needs. It easily gives us enough reasons to be selfish.This world would rather hasten our crushing of that beautiful spark of life that we have been given. In the name of being well adjusted. For those with the courage to love, then this book, is more than reason enough. For the feelings themselves speak louder than all the reasons to the contrary.Love after all is a rebellion against fear, a great book for those who aren't afraid of truth."},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"Janov's discovery and development of Primal Therapy could transform the world. He should have been awarded the Nobel Prize in several categories long ago. It is the greatest discovery our world has ever seen, and over the years, with much research, Janov has honed his therapy into a precise and predictable science. It is too bad that self interest has caused his peers (as if he really has any) to ignore or deny the work Janov has done. I'm afraid that it still may be many years before Arthur Janov receives the recognition he deserves. In the meantime, only an elite few will discover the benefits of this wonderful, life saving tool.Frank Dale Robinette"},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"First he writes the awesome The Primal Scream. How is progress possible after he's achieved this high a level? Maybe the following books are not &quot;better,&quot; but 'only' &quot;different.&quot; They don't have to reach the level The Primal Scream reached, because The Primal Scream already reached it. What he writes now is &quot;more.&quot; Having learned the new, having longer to have studied the old, Janov is able to make his lines maybe more direct, and more imaginative. I don't know, my memory isn't good enough to remember all i need to remember to be objective. Janov's been accused of being repetitive. I think its inevitable and even necessary when dealing with feelings. When have we felt a feeling enough? When do we no longer need to look at a place? When have we memorized the lessons of reality, and don't need to be reminded again? Reading Janov, you become part of a community of the caring. Yes, its possible to care without reading him, but its quite probable that one's sophistication of sensuality will be goodly improved by exploring the world Janov has both discovered and helped create. Its a question of style. Shall your life include the primal style?"},{"Title":"The Biology of Love","review":"I saw some great reviews of this book on Amazon. A few more words need to be said. I discovered Janov in 87, reading the Primal Scream, 1970. I was amazed and hooked. I read about 5 of his early books, his complete collection of Newletters. I am a big fan of his theories and experience. I have never had Primal Therapy but absolutely believe in it. Why it has not swept the psychological field away and revolutionized it after so long is a marvel to wonder. I have my own suspicious theories on that.The Primal Scream 1970, is still a book to read. But the best since then is this one, The Biology of Love. Janov created his own terminology in 1970 which he used for years. But in this book, he dumps the lingo and attempts neutral clinical medical psychological terms. Although I think it is a good move for Primal Therapy and Theory, it took some getting used to after years of the original Janov lingo, which was kind of fun in its own way.Janov get into the nuts and bolt science of brain chemicals and brain processes and function as well as clinical experience with his patients. He wants to prove this is real physiological science, which it definitely is by my measure. Janov makes it easy reading, despite its very scientific nature, which is a commendable accomplishment. Then again, you're reading from a fan.This is not vague theory. It is pure science, that like so much science today, is suffering from a lack of credibility as evidence pours in to make one wonder how modern practice could lag so far behind as it has in fields of psychology, medical practice, nutrition, geology, archaeology, physics/astronomy as compared to plasma physics,and more.Psychology is obsolete. This is the real current paradigm/truth for those looking for it. Now I grant that Janov might do better to make it clear just how long and difficult this process can be as some have mentioned. But even so, this is the only solution that seems to work and produce true and profound changes in people and personalities, as well as even health.And if you are a Christian, I believe if you really want to understand the human being that God created, then you might find the scales fall out of your eyes by reading this book. When the Bible says God is Love, you will know what that really means after this book. I have not yet read Primal Healing 2006, which I have bought but have yet to read due to other books being in line first, but this book might also be on a par with the one in review here as Healing looked very promising."},{"Title":"Sands Of Silence: On Safari In Namibia","review":"Having read four Chapstick books and loving them (his other tiltes left me excited and wide-eyed) I wasn't overly impressed with Sands of Silence. Although the book is well written, includes quality photos, and some interesting infomation about Africa; I thought it lacked the excitement of Peters other excellent hunting tales. You could do worse than buy this book, but I would encouage you to pick another of Peter's titles."},{"Title":"Sands Of Silence: On Safari In Namibia","review":"This book is a recounting of an elephant hunt that PHC took in the late 1980s. This edition is a nice hardback with lots of color photos. The DVD entitled Hunting the African Elephant with Peter Capstick could be considered a companion to this book (the safari described in this book was filmed - man of the scenes in the book are duplicated on film). The story covers PHCs tracking of various elephants, some of the daily ups and downs of camp life on safari, and a dramatic showdown at the end. There is a wealth of information in this book about a wide variety of topics beyond just hunting elephants. Capstick discusses the Bushmen of Southern Africa and how contact with modern society is dramatically changing thier culture, the poison used by the Bushmen on their arrows (it comes from grubs!), the dangers of the puff adder (what a nasty snake), the synergy between hunting and conservation, the effect that a .470 Nitro Express round has on a termite hill (!), and a bit about the anatomy of elephants. One of the less favorable reviews of this books states that it is less \`exciting' than some of his earlier works. I would generally agree with this in the sense that this book is not filled with harrowing stories about hunting and safari that verge on tall-tales (although the first chapter about the leopard hunt is about as close as anyone is going to get and survive). It is a more measured, realistic recounting of a relatively modern safari. If you are looking for stories about dangerous encounters with big game, PHCs earlier works are probably more your cup of tea. If you want to know what it would be like to go on a modern safari without all the hyperbole associated with hunting dangerous game, this may be exactly what you are looking for. This is a good, if not uniquely outstanding, story of safari hunting."},{"Title":"Sands Of Silence: On Safari In Namibia","review":"Once again, Peter Capstick has brought an African safari adventure into my home. This books is brillantly written as well as full of great color photos of the people of Nambia and some of the many animals of the wild.

After reading four of his books previous, I do believe that this one is just as good if not better. Although I prefer Death in the long grass, and death in a lonely land, this book is very well written. Your hands sweat until the problem is taken care of. So finally to sum it all up it's another great read, from a great writer."},{"Title":"Sands Of Silence: On Safari In Namibia","review":"This is one of my favorite Capstick books! Written so interestingly and captivatingly that you can't put it down.

Gun sport against a historical backdrop."},{"Title":"Sands Of Silence: On Safari In Namibia","review":"Peter H. Capstick and Peter Allison write about the same animals in the same countries. But their stories are very different. In Allison's world the charging elephant stops at the last moment, in Capstick's world it doesn't. It's good to know both. You learn something from both.I have nothing but contempt for shooters who come to Africa and are driven to a spot from which they can safely shoot animals while surrounded by armed guides. The whole &#34;hunt&#34; may take just a few hours. I've seen Americans &#34;hunting&#34; this way in South Africa. I greatly respect people like Capstick who risk their lives.

Ruark was also an early departure: hard to figure when big game hunting is such a physically demanding pursuit.

This probably proves a genetic link."},{"Title":"The Clown in the Agora","review":"Eugene Ionesco, playwright, author of Rhinoceros and The Bald Soprano, is profiled by two authors. Kluback and Finkenthal wrote alternating chapters, primarily discussing the philosophy of Ionesco. Conversations they are not, but the authors alternate chapters partly in descriptions of various facets of Ionesco's philosophy, or differing takes on a certain view of Ionesco, i.e. chapters entitled \\"The Black Sun of Melancholy\\" and \\"Counternotes to the Black Sun of Melancholy.\\"To a lesser extent this book would serve as a good companion to Ionesco's _Notes and Counter-Notes_ or _Fragments of a Journal_. The authors only briefly touch on the plays which made Ionesco famous. Ionesco is limned as an iconoclast who rejected all -isms. His life is only fleetingly described; _The Clown in the Agora_ is not a biography, nor is it a critical exegesis of his plays. In fact, this book is perhaps best described as essays by two Ionesco enthusiast/scholars, exploring the philosophy of the late French/Rumanian writer.This volume is a modest contribution to literature. Still, it is a worthwhile read for a person involved in Ionesco study. In Finkenthal and Kluback's labor of love the reader can come to better understand Ionesco, one of the 20th century's most important playwrights and writers. The reader may find it worthwhile to keep _Clown in the Agora_ alongside books of Ionesco's plays and writings for the purpose of cross-reference._The Two Faces of Ionesco_ is another helpful volume. Both this and _Clown in the Agora_ are easily obtained via Interlibrary Loan from your public or university library.Ken Miller"},{"Title":"The Clown in the Agora","review":"We can enjoy to wonder in a philosophical and poetical labyrinth.

He demonstrates this through excellent case examples which compare and contrast strong fathers with weak mothers, strong mothers with weak fathers, weak mothers and fathers, as well as strong mothers and fathers.Using only the tools of his psychiatric training, he thoroughly outlines the effects of weak family structures on the demise of American culture. He explains how weak family structures influence career choices, money managment, social skills, work ethics and gender affinities into next generations.Anyone working in a mentoring role of any type should read this book. It is thorough, constructive, comprehensive and professional while clearly coming from a person who has modeled the excellent family values he promotes in the book.The fruits of reading this book will be personal understanding and growth in your own psyche while gaining a thorough understanding of why others as well are fraught with self-defeating behaviors, perversions of conscience, and pathological choices which personally and socially corrupt our lives.Be ready to have your eyes opened, your will challenged and your emotions refreshed by a very practical and sober read that cuts to the heart of insanity and maturity in the human psyche.May you profit as I did by my success in reading this book."},{"Title":"The Banner Book (Craft Kaleidoscope)","review":"I did find this book informative but it is not for the beginner.

Diagrams were also not clear."},{"Title":"The Banner Book (Craft Kaleidoscope)","review":"I was fortunate enough to learn banner making techniques directly from Ruth Ann Lowery. She was the first in the country to publish a book, A Banner Year, teaching the reverse applique technique. I then read The Banner Book, and she expands greatly on the beginning technique into more challenging and interesting projects for both indoors and outdoors. As difficult as the projects seem, she uses simple wording and clear helpful illustrations to explain these techniques even to the beginner sewer. I enjoyed the ideas that Ruth Ann gives and the sample scaled patterns included in the book. The colorful illustrations and allowances for your own creativity encourage you to dive right into your next project. I encourage you to buy the book and begin sewing today.

After much debating with booksellers who denied its existence, I finally had in my hands, after all these years...Six poems.Text with facing-page translation of six poems. Don't be misled by the title. Volume One is out of print, and while, in 1997, Volumes 3 and 4 were said to be \\"well underway,\\" all trace of them seems to have fallen from the face of the earth.I should chastise Clarendon Press, and so should you.Despite this, I have never seen so much information about the individual poems collected in one place. Dronke gives overviews of the poems, historical and mythological background, comparisons with other mediaeval literature (Germanic and otherwise), the works! In addition, she gives a detailed commentary on the text itself, analysing many words and phrases on an individual basis, and often giving equally detailed explanations of her translation of certain words. She even goes so far as to inform the reader of all of the variant manuscript readings (including omissions) and tackles several textual problems with thoroughness.I do not fully agree with all of the author's interpretations--some of her statements almost made me fall out of my chair- but there is enough lore in this book to make the price WELL worth it. This book really deserves only four and an half stars because I was disappointed by the title (hey, it's my right after all these years!); but that aside, the erudition in this book is vast and impressive. You'll be glad you bought it."},{"Title":"The Poetic Edda: Volume II: Mythological Poems","review":"Of all of the English translations of the Poetic Edda, Dronke's translations are the most thorough and extensive. The footnotes are immense, the manuscript doting impressive, and the sheer level of detail presented here easily puts all of the other editions to printed (to date) to shame.However, this edition is incomplete and is but one of a few volumes yet released; although it has now been decades, Dronke has yet to finish her undertaking of the Poetic Edda. I hope she realizes how many people are waiting for it. Further, it would be very wise of someone collect all of these volumes into a single mass-market edition so that it gets the attention it deserves. Dronke's edition will then become the current Poetic Edda English translation standard and we will all be the better off for it."},{"Title":"The Poetic Edda: Volume II: Mythological Poems","review":"This volume of Ursala Dronke's presentation of the older \\"Poetic Edda\\" isn't just another translation of the Voluspa, Rigsthula, Volundarkvida, Lokasenna and Skirnismal Eddas, but is a badly needed critical edition that brings together all the source material, provides a translation in modern English, and offers commentary that discusses the meaning of difficult terms, provides historical context,and discusses relevant social and religious influences. In this text Ursala Dronke pulls together an enormous amount of historical background, philological detail, and comparative literature, and summarizes it for the reader. It would take a lifetime to read all the sources and pull this amount of data together, and unfortunately Ursala Dronke passed on before publishing the fourth (final) volume.The translations show the original old Norse and English translation in adjacent columns for easy comparison, and are a pleasure to read. Some scholastic translations can appear stilted and uninspired, but Dronke's translations capture the poetry of the original, and are clear and easy to follow. If you're not interested in a scholastic study of the Eddas, the translations alone make the book worth reading.I was appalled to read the comments of the only reader giving this volume a single star. The reader calls the translations \\"peculiar\\", accuses Dronke of poor scholarship, and wonders why Oxford even published it. Dronke's Bachelor of Literature thesis on the Sturlunga Saga was passed by none other than J.R.R. Tolkien, and she taught at Cambridge, the Universityof Berlin (where she was the head ofOld Norse Studies), and Oxford. He casually dismisses the text for not having a glossary; if he'd actually read the text, he's know that these features (including an index) were planned for the fourth volume, which I hope the Clarendon Press will still publish.But the worst comment is a nasty bit of slander where he accuses Dronke of racist ideology, which is completely false. He claims this occurs in the \\"Hair\\" chapter; it is actually the Rigsthula Edda, which is the \\"Genealogical\\" Edda. She doesn't engage in any of the foul rhetoric she is accused of, but simply recounts the story, where the god Rigr visits 3 homes, after which the couples have children. The first dwelling has elders with white hair, who have dark skinned thralls; the second have a healthy robust boy with red hair, and the third a happy mother and father who have blonde children. The Edda describes/rationalizes Nordic society at the time; the dark skinned children become laborers, the red haired become craftsmen and farmers, and the blond became warriors, nobles, and readers of runes. This isn't Dronke's construction, but is explicitly stated in the original text. Dronke offers only a few historical observations, and nowhere proposes the racist agenda the commenter accuses her of."},{"Title":"The Poetic Edda: Volume II: Mythological Poems","review":"Dronke's peculiar book includes five mythological poems: Voluspa, Rigsthula, Volundarkvida, Lokasenna, Skirnismal. And it has many more problems, some of which I will list here:1. It offers \\"editions\\" of the poems, with facing translations, but the translations are not very good, which perhaps would be less important if the book had a glossary.2. But it doesn't have a glossary. Thus it is useless as an edition of any kind.3. The commentary is rambling and the scholarship uneven. Further, all the best material, which is merely summarized in disorganized fashion, can be found in other publications. The author's contribution to the field is minimal.4. The \\"Hair\\" Chapter: in her explanation of the Rigsthula, Dronke seems delighted to join the modern radical Nordicists, who frequent some of the worst webforums known to man, in accepting the unlanded courtier's, meaning the poet's, vision of humanity as divided by hair colour - if you can believe it. So, we are treated to dirty autochthonous thralls with black hair, big-boned farmers with red hair, and glorious Viking nobles with blond hair. And to support her medieval soulmate in his devious social climbing, our author picks a few random examples from other Indo-European traditions (which she holds this colour scheme to be classic of), in an amateur attempt to show that, indeed, it really was this way from the very beginning. But none of her examples appear to show what she wants to believe, for example the substitution of clothing for hair and of white for blond; and furthermore there are many more examples of colour preference (hair, clothing, etc.) for this rank or that, throughout the ancient Indo-European world, which give quite different pictures of its societies, and these Dronke completely ignores, including the rest from the Old Norse tradition!It's really a wonder that Oxford published this volume, but it was so long awaited that I guess they were obligated somehow. Don't waste your money like Oxford did."},{"Title":"Cautious Crusade: Franklin D. Roosevelt, American Public Opinion, and the War against Nazi Germany","review":"For those who want an eminently readable, but highly valuable scholarly publication on Franklin Roosevelt and WWII, look no further. Casey traces how FDR attempted to lead American public opinion to pursue his favoured course of assisting the British in opposing Nazism. After his problems in overcoming isolationism were solved for him by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor FDR's struggles with public opinion were not over, however. The administration had to walk a delicate line between encouraging support for the war without creating massive hatred for Germany that could hinder the creation of a better post-war era. Casey's book is admirable in that it presents a nuanced picture of FDR. While it is well known what a champion manipulator he was, what is less known is the ways in which he was constrained by public opinion. This book is an essential resource for anybody seeking to understand the 20th century's greatest president, and it's greatest conflict."},{"Title":"Cautious Crusade: Franklin D. Roosevelt, American Public Opinion, and the War against Nazi Germany","review":"Love him or hate him, there's no denying FDR was a master at what he did. After vowing to keep the U.S. out of European conflicts, FDR realized America had to be involved. Through subtle (and not so subtle) means, Roosevelt quietly manipulated the public while being constrained by popular isolationist opinion and his own campaign promises. What a position for FDR...watching Hitler's rise, the world's political and economic climate...and having to make each move deftly, like pieces on a chessboard, to do what he believed was necessary . Not just for the immediate causes of our European allies, but for America AFTER the war as well.Through a propaganda campaign that would shame even the most extreme politicians of the 21st century, FDR, well... 'cautiously crusades' his cause.If you enjoy politics or are a history buff, this book is an interesting study of the presidency, politics, public opinion and WWII. \\"Cautious Crusade\\" covers it all, and does so without making FDR a hero nor a villain."},{"Title":"Cautious Crusade: Franklin D.

By the time I read the alarming phrase \\"pedal his views\\" on an early page, I was already doubtful that this clumsily written tome was going to add very much to our understanding of FDR's attitudes and policies toward Nazi Germany. Mr. Casey essentially retells the well-known story of American isolationism, the growing appreciation of the Nazi threat, and Roosevelt's efforts to support Britain and prepare for war without flouting neutrality laws and popular resistance to American involvement. But as for the day-to-day effect of the surveys and opinion polls, I don't think he makes his case. I'm afraid I lost patience and stopped reading after a hundred pages or so.I was especially disheartened by the mystifying (and total) absence from Mr. Casey's narrative of Joseph P. Kennedy, Roosevelt's anti-British ambassador to Britain. No one tried harder than Joseph P. to persuade Roosevelt that England was moribund in 1940 and to declare Hitler the winner. No other book on this period manages to ignore Kennedy so completely.

Nothing wrong with that. But I don't think it's complete. So to me, the problems he posted are overly complicated yet incomplete.Then He over-simplified the answer by creating a \\"God above God\\", in the last few pages of the book. The concept could potentially take away the anxiety related to death and guilt, but not meaninglessness. God is all powerful and almighty. He does not need to create me for His purpose.

I found this book a very boring, difficult read with tons of repetition, not just in concepts but even within sentences and paragraphs. It was written several decades ago and perhaps for those who are interested in the history of existentialism there are pluses to the book. The best chapter, in my opinion, was the last chapter (6) where Tillich explores \\"Courage and Transcendence\\". More specifically, I liked the last subchapter on \\"Theism Transcended\\". This section contained timeless concepts of what theism means and doesn't mean, and an astute observation that one definition of theism is an empty one used by politicians who throw out the word \\"God\\" in speeches to impress their audiences with their moral trustworthiness. In that respect, the book was \\"current\\" and certainly applicable to the recently concluded Republican presidential candidate primary race.

His analysis of the questions of &quot;despair and meaninglessness&quot; is quite intense and certainly very thorough, and for this he deserves recognition. However, one cannot help but ask if Tillich is allowing the questions of culture to control his theology, rather than the Christian message. Is Christianity really the answer to whatever questions we happen to present it? Or does Christianity challenge us to ask the right questions?"},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"This is a book of the mind. An intellectual foray into philosophy.

One is this book particular title. I have heard of the author because RC Sproul has often argued his thoughts as a mischaracterization of Christianity and the relationship possible between God and man. Paul Tillich's philosophy is clearly contradictory to Christianity. The author clearly states his thoughts are not biblical; he plainly does not believe in a greater being nor does he like the Being described in the Bible. This book is about man's relationship to the universe absent God. It is an argument that one needs to have courage absent the security of traditional religion; there is no God in his philosophy describing right and wrong; there is no higher Being protecting you. His perspective is part pantheism. Man does not die to be part of a conscience state, but pure dust and part of the whole of creation. One may have a social conscience but there are no arbiters to determine what one think is correct. This book is about the implications of this Worldview and the implications of grasping this \`truth\\".I believe the author could have made a more organized and clearer argument.

Fear is different from anxiety in that fear is directed at a specific object whereas anxiety is not. Anxiety is not directed at a specific object because it comes from the thereat of nonbeing. Our nonbeing exists at three levels the ontic, spiritual and moral. Ontic anxiety is experienced as anxiety of fate and ultimately of death. Spiritual anxiety is experienced as emptiness and ultimately as meaninglessness. Moral anxiety is experienced as rejection and ultimately as condemnation. He makes a distinction between normal anxiety and pathological anxiety. The neurotic may be more aware of his own non being and more creative. Normal anxiety is sometimes replaced by fear of a specific object which can be handled better by the individual.He next examines Existentialisms. Existentialisms as a point of view started with Plato and the distinction between the essential forms and actual existence. Classical Christianity continued in the Existential point of view with man being created good in essence but due to sin and the fall became estranged from this essence. The Existentialisms of the 20th century was driven by the anxiety of meaninglessness. The main event that caused this sift in the 20th century was the loss of God."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"Technically, this book is difficult to read and often hard to understand.

The arguments are well made and are very fun to wrestle with.

Tillich attempts to give an existential turn to Christian Theology in order to make sense out of the modern (and possibly post-modern) experience of the existential crisis that disturbs the mind of the 20th century. Tillich's central thesis is that life consists in the ontological tension between Being and Non-Being within a person who struggles to find meaning in the infinite abyss of meaninglessness and acceptance in the incorrigible guilt. To find that kind of reconciliation is impossible by man alone (and here is the Lutheran element to Tillich's Theology) but found only through the Power of Being or Being-Itself which provides the Courage To Be, that is the Courage to exist and live meaningfully in spite of meaninglessness and despair; There is this sense of romanticism in which the existential man strives to live meaningfully in spite of the possibility of meaninglessness, and Tillich has expressed it beautifully.Tillich's criticism on supernatural theism or the anthropomorphic conception of theism, in favor of his conception of God as \\"Ground of Being\\", has been one of the most significant experiences in my reading. This very bold move, that is almost prohibited and forbidden in theological circles, is violated by Tillich who is driven with the desire to present another understanding of God. While Tillich has shown that the classical theistic God is no longer a tolerable being, and merely a byproduct of our Anthropomorphic Bias, his new conception of God has left people wanting. Even though I admit that Tillich's conception of God as Ground of Being is as profound as it can get, one cannot help but ask what exactly this being is. Tillich refuses to answer this directly since he sincerely believes that to do so is to only misunderstand Ground of Being. Perhaps it is not meant to be understood anymore, but despite this theological issue I really appreciated this work."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"Paul Tillich (1886-1965) was a German-American theologian and Christian existentialist philosopher. He wrote many books, such asSystematic Theology, vol. 1,A History of Christian Thought (Touchstone Books),The Shaking Of The Foundations,The New Being,Eternal Now (scm classics).He wrote in the first chapter of this 1962 book, \\"The title of this book... unites both meanings of the concept of courage, the ethical and the ontological. Courage as a human act, as a matter of valuation, is an ethical concept. Courage as the universal and essential self-affirmation of one's being is an ontological concept. The courage to be is the ethical act in which man affirms his own being in spite of those elements of his existence which conflict with his essential self-affirmation.\\" (Pg. 3)He defines \\"anxiety\\" as the state in which being is aware of its possible nonbeing, or the existential awareness of nonbeing. (Pg. 35) Anxiety turns us toward courage, because the other alternative is despair. \\"Courage resists despair by taking anxiety into itself.\\" (Pg. 66) He later states that the courage to be is \\"the self-affirmation of being in spite of nonbeing.\\" (Pg. 172)He summarizes, \\"One could say that the courage to be is the courage to accept oneself in spite of being unacceptable.\\" He suggests that this is the \\"genuine meaning\\" of the doctrine of justification by faith. (Pg. 164) The courage to be is \\"the key to being-itself.\\" (Pg. 181)He states that the courage to be which is rooted in the experience of the God above the God of theism \\"unites and transcends the courage to be as a part and the courage to be as oneself.\\" (Pg. 187)This is one of Tillich's most \\"popular\\" books (even outside of \\"theological\\" circles); it still can make inspiring reading today."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"Paul Tillich was a Protestant German-American philosopher-theologian whose thought exemplifies Christian existentialism. In his book,The Courage to Be, Tillich discusses the origin of anxiety as coming from the loss of meaning in life. Here he is referring to the underlying but nagging realization most of us suffer briefly, or for a lifetime, that existence has no purpose. We come into being at birth then learn through daily life experience that death, nothingness, non-being awaits us.Arguments for the immortality of the soul are futile when we visit a funeral home. In spite of all logic, biological extinction causes anxiety. The corpse reminds us that it is our fate too, to be thrown out of existence at any moment. Is it any wonder then that it takes courage to accept this unacceptable fact?Most people push aside this anxiety of non-being by adopting a religion and following its precepts sometimes to the point of fanaticism. They find comfort in accepting what their church insists is the true meaning of life and an afterlife. But there are also the religious fanatics who insist their beliefs must be imposed on others. Mankind is well aware of the horrors these extremists cause today and have caused in the righteous past.Then there are those who push the anxiety of non-being into an unconscious mental recess and lose themselves in a work ethic. They identify with their job, their position, their status in life. Quite often, they fail to examine their own existence until faced with loss of it through disease or a life threatening illness.Sadly, there are those so overwhelmed by the anxiety of non-being that, in despair, they turn to alcohol, drugs, or suicide.What does Tillich mean by courage? InThe Courage to Be, he states that courage is the strength to continue to live on in a meaningful way in spite of the fact that our existence appears to have no purpose. We do not wallow in doubt, self-derision or despair. We have come into being in this time, in this place, in spite of the ever-present threat of non-being.This courage comes from a fundamental person-to-person acceptance of God, a belief in a being that infinitely transcends one's self. We do not believe because religious dogma demands it. We believe because as limited human beings we simply accept a loving, intelligent, understanding and forgiving God.Theologian Tillich readily admits there are no valid arguments for God's existence. What does exist is the courage to believe in spite of all doubt. Our life's purpose lies within a personal encounter with God.The Courage to Becannot be read without much reflection. But it is worth the effort. I would highly recommend Tillich's book to all practicing psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and any person interested in a more meaningful existence devoid of organized religion.Other meaningful books:Dynamics of Faith (Perennial Classic.)Love, Power, and Justice: Ontological Analyses and Ethical Applications (Galaxy Books)The Kusum&iexcl;njali, Or, Hindu Proof of the Existence of a Supreme Being"},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"I bought the Kindle edition, which formatted well and comes with active table of contents for easy navigation.

Tillich is a well known mid-twentieth century German-American liberal theologian. The following comments pertain to the 2000 re-release by Yale University PressThe lectures discuss the issue of courage and, are largely a response to some of the bleak existentialist philosophy prevalent at the time. I found the aspects of the text discussing existentialism to be the most interesting. To the appropriate liberal academic audience in the early 1950's these lectures might have sounded majestic. Tillich weaves a broad story touching on a range of philosophical, political, historic and scientific themes. Fifty years later it feels dated and superficial; some of the themes e.g. existentialism, Freudism and Marxism are now somewhat pass&eacute; and may be of limited interest to many modern readers.This is not to say that the work is without value, I find that Tillich is always effective at conveying the majesty of God. Tillich was by all accounts a capable intellect, however, his ability as a communicator is limited; his use of language while occasionally poetic is often wordy and vacuous, while his argumentation can be sublime, it is frequently speculative and specious.The Courage to Be is probably only of interest to Tillich fans."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"My husband has wanted this book and mentioned it.

This book is a literary Prozac that depends on the slowly released drug of honest, clear and non-pretentious writing about the history of high thought."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"Tillich believes that modern man's predominant anxiety is a sense of meaninglessness leading to despair. This is the Existentialist's plight. Tillich states that meaninglessness has not always been the predominant concern. In prior ages it had been death and later guilt.In order to resolve the angst of modern man, Tillich imposes upon himself that \\"The answer must accept, as its precondition, the state of meaninglessness.\\" This precondition creates the cul-de-sac for his rational argument.Tillich himself, offers the nave solution of \\"The faith which creates the courage to take [meaninglessness/anxiety] into itself has no special content. It is simply faith, undirected, absolute. It is undefinable, since everything defined is dissolved by doubt and meaninglessness.\\"In other words, Tillich suggests that to resolve meaninglessness and despair one should resort to having faith without subject matter.Tillich further explains himself by stating the requisite courage/faith is not without subject matter but rather is in \\"pure being\\" or \\"the God above God\\". This is nonsense. The God of the Bible is the great \\"I AM\\", pure being. There is no God above God.By giving the proposition \\"God above God\\" Tillich is either:a) making a substitution identical to that which is being substituted, making the proposition gibberishb) removing God from the equation, replacing Him with the power of being within ourselves as the basis for our courage (what an ersatz this exchange would be, a finite force within ourselves, leading to certain death, rather than a personal God who could be implored that held the power to gift eternity).orc) replacing the definition of God handed down through the ages and substituting it for one, more amenable to his existentialist philosophy. In so doing he is falling into the trap of creating god in his own image. One also would have to ask the question why he feels he should be trusted with elucidating to mankind who God is, using his reason alone? The credentials of Jesus and Moses are likely more qualified for this which is likely why their assertions are believed more than those of Tillich.If you were not certain before reading this book that Existentialist philosophy has no real legitimate answers for meaning in life this book should provide another nail in the coffin towards that conclusion."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"....of faith, fortitude, and integrity. Tillich's gift for combining the theological and the philosophical works in full force here, where he demonstrates the ontology of what other thinkers have called being-toward-oneself."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"Tillich's book makes a number of points very clearly, but theprincipal point of the book is obscured by round-about language.In the last chaper Tillich speaks of the &quot;God above God&quot;. He writes concerning the God who is not above God: &quot;He deprives me of my subjectivity . . . God appears as an invincible tyrant, the being in contrast with whom all other beings are without freedom and subjectivity. . . . This is the god Nietzsche said had to be killed because nobody can tolerate being made into the mere object of absolute power. This is the deepest root of atheism.&quot; The God not above God is the Jewish image of God divorced from anthropomorphic aspects. He does not state this, but it is clear it is what he means. He speaks of Bergson's fight against the tyranny of spacial relationships. He states elsewhere in the chapter that: &quot; The God above God is present, although hidden, in every devine-human encounter. Biblical religion, as well as Protestant theology are aware of the paradoxical character of this encounter.&quot; If one removes the anthropomorphic elements from the Old Testament God the result is how Albert Einstein describes the Jewish God: &quot;The Jewish God is nothing more than the negation of superstition.&quot; This would of course be the combination of natural law and spacial relationships. Einstein goes on to say that the rest of God is imagination. Therefore, the God Tillich rejects is the physical laws and spacial relationships before which subjectivity is absurd in that it is simply a form of self-deception to be unaware of the laws which will, aware or un-aware, be obeyed. Therefore the individual as a subjectivity-having being is of necessity based upon ignorance. Keat's line &quot;A thing of beauty is a joy forever&quot; would be impossible were the God as natural law and spacial relationships embraced in a pure form. The &quot;thing&quot; would simply be a mass of some specific gravity, ofa particular set of dimensions, a given distance from the observer and so forth. Much of current Jewish theological argument is about this same point, rationalism (man is a part of a giant machine and everything else is self-deception) as opposed to the combination of the rationalst view with one of the universe of possible self-deceptions the view personified by Abraham's argument with God concerning the destruction of Sodom and the selecter of the Jewish people as chosen. The implication of Tillich's argument is also that visualization of God such as the One who argues with Abraham or selects a people is simply a form of self deception, one of the universe of forms of self deception which needs be employed or some other form substituted. Abraham argues with God, and it seems to make sense in the Bible. It would make no sense if anyone argued with gravity or that gravity selected one group over another. The Jews would be, as implied by the quote from Einstein, be more vulnerable to this need for self deception simply because persons of other groups would be more removed from the God of natural law and spacial relationships. It is part of the human condition, not at all unique to Judaism, but it would be subject to amplification among Jews because Judaism is a more mechanistic and therefore more efficient view of the universe. Being more efficient and therefore potentially more powerful, there would be greater opportunity for Jews to engage in behaviors which might create ill-feeling among others than would groups with less effieient mentalities. Tillich does not in any way say or imply that this is the only cause of self deception of course. Obviously, a realization of the true nature of the universe is necessary if great vulnerability is to be avoided. The acquiring of this realization without the need to find harmful self-deception is perhaps the greatest challange the world faces. Judaism has much to teach the world; it is time the world listened. Tillich points at least in the general direction of where the world needs to go, but he himself says that the correct balance between the subjective and the mechanistic is &quot;Under the Cross.&quot;Therefore, he, himself, points to the need for realization of combining a mechanistic core with a modifying but useful as opposed to harmful form of self deception, but does not embrace it. Tillish says that the purpose of the Christian clergy is to keep people from realizing the true, without self deception, relationship between man and the universe. He points to the road, but he will go no further."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"TILLICH'S BASIC IDEAS OF GOD AND THE GOD-ABOVE-GOD ARE NOT CLEAR IN THE COURAGE TO BE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HE STATES AS THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF CHRISTIAN CLERGY KEEPING PEOPLE FROM REALIZING THE NATURE OF \\"GOD\\" FOR WHICH PURPOSE HE IDENTIFIES THE \\"GOD-ABOVE-GOD\\" THE NATURE OF \\"GOD\\" ISTHE GREAT MACHINE WHICH IN ALBERT EINSTEIN'S VIEW FOR EXAMPLE OBVIATES HUMAN FREEDOM.

Paul Tillich should not be considered to have been a theologian.I know that some will object to my position by saying something along the lines of: &quot;How can someone who has written a systematic theology not be a theologian?&quot; Go ahead and ask. I know of no sane person who has read his systematic all the way through without having been compelled by someone higher up in the power structure of academia.This leads me to the thesis of my review. Tillich was not a theologian or as some would no doubt suggest, a philosopher. I cannot put my finger on exactly what he was. The most honest and least vitriolic (though this book simply begs for vitriol) description I can provide of this book is that it is vague. Tillich seems to want to make some universalist and yet subjective statement about courage and anxiety, but he never pulls the trigger on it. He dances round and round the subject, leaving the reader both tired and queasy.This leads me back to the question of Tillich. Is this book the work of Tillich the theologian, Tillich the existentialist philosopher, or an undefined, wholly other Tillich? I don't know. However I do believe I know who Tillich was writing for; and I believe this is the key to our question about Tillich, meaningful as part of understanding the book, and of the utmost importance to you as you consider whether or not to buy and read this book. It is my sincere belief that this book was written for that all too common half-breed that is found in our universities: the Liberal Academic (those who are too lacking in honesty to be true scholars and yet still fearful enough to admit their own atheism).Tillich is still widely read by captive audiences under the tutelage of these academics. This ensures why this book is still read and discussed. This notwithstanding I urge you to take my honest and heartfelt advice: don't read this book unless one of them forces you to."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"This book has more good ideas in it than clam chowder has calories. It's packed into every page, every line. Tillich is concerned with how the question of finding the courage to face up to existential doubts about death, meaninglessness, and guilt are tied to the ontological questions of being versus nonbeing. How can we affirm our existence when it seems so temporary, meaningless and full of moral failure? Tillich explores with incredible freshness and insight age old strategies, from Spinoza to the Stoics (his discussion of the Stoics alone is worth the price of the book). He gives a brilliant account of how people find the courage to overcome existential anxiety through particpation in groups and through individual strategies like existentialism. Finally, he explores the theological implications in a way that may challenge anyone who has stereotyped Tillich as a mouthpiece for Christianity. The book is excellently written, never dumbed down but always graspable. He also litters the book with brilliant asides on subjects like the history of existential angst and its relations to social relations and a great exploration of existential art. Don't pass this one up."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"Tillich's ultimate concern is what determines our being or non-being. The &quot;shock of nonbeing&quot; and the ensuing anxiety allows Tillich to categorize three types of anxiety (fate and death, emptiness, and guilt). I thought his history of anxiety, starting with the Stoics (&quot;the only real alternative to Christianity in the Western world&quot;) was remarkable (though at times a rough read). Influenced by Heidegger and Kierkegaard(&quot;to confront his existence alone&quot;) he drives on to the inevitable search for God. For Tillich, the &quot;Courage to Be\\" is partly the courage to despair, and avoid the &quot;Neurosis is a away of avoiding non-being by avoiding being&quot;. He is also influenced by Freud and psychoanalysis (called &quot;depth psychology&quot; in the book), which in our day of Prozac and behavioral psychology is refreshing.The nature of the discussions, being, nonbeing, subjectivity, objectivity make for difficult reading with double negatives (eg. &quot;Nonbeing is no threat because finite being is, in the last analysis, nonbeing&quot;). If one can wade through the language, there a lot of insight."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"I checked this book out of the library becuase I like to read books on psychology, philosophy, religion and existentialism. But all-in-all, this book was too deep for me. It's a challenge to read; very thick; very esoteric; not light reading. You need a degree in philosophy or theology to get through it. I did however like Tillich's theory of existential anxiety. I'll give this book three stars for that; but much of it went over my head. Perhaps, if you are smarter than me, you might be able to grasp it better and enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"&quot;It takes tremendous courage to resist the lure of appearances. The power of being which is manifest in such courage is so great that the gods tremble in fear of it.&quot; Paul Tillich, The Courage to Be.Paul Tillich's ideas are a response to existentialism, German philosphy, modern physics &amp; the success of totalitarian movements in Germany, Russia &amp; Italy. He is a bridge between the 19th Century &amp; the growth of new theological thought in latter part of the Twentieth.Tillich is not all that difficult to understand in The Courage to Be. However, it's unfortunate that his three wonderful collections of sermons (The Shaking of the Foundations; The New Being; The Eternal Now) are out-of-print, as these are his best introductions.Readers coming to Tillich will have to grapple with the common metaphors of Christian faith. For Tillich, the concepts of Heaven &amp; even an afterlife are not terribly important, as they imply a continuation of life in time that he is not able to accept scientifically or on faith. So one meets those lovely semi-metaphors of &quot;being itself,&quot; &quot;non-being&quot; &amp; &quot;ground of being&quot; that, for me at least, were a more clear explanation of how I experience the world than God the &quot;Father&quot; or Holy Ghost.This makes Tillich a crucial step into Feminist &amp; Language theology, although he couldn't quite make the big leap himself.Basically, Tillich says we're stuck in an undefinable present that moves creatively into an unknown future in which nothing is a given but the fact that we are alive right now, so what do we intend to do about it? This is &quot;being&quot; &amp; being, above all else, requires courage; the courage of early Christians facing the axe or the fire. As for Tillich's &quot;Ground of Being,&quot; one might compare it - inadequately - to a tree as a reflection of its roots - a metaphor I copped from another Paul ...artist Paul Klee. Tillich says that we cannot speak unsymbolically about being.In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Paul Tillich's theology gains even greater relevance. He witnessed in Germany the acquiescence of the established churches to National Socialism &amp; the failure of Democratic Christian Socialism. I do not believe he would have many kind words for contemporary Islam, a religious system so bound to orthodoxy as to make it incapable of relevant reform. On the other hand, Tillich would have immediately recognized those manifestations of the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; which began appearing even before the Twin Towers had collapsed. Our estrangement from God in the Eternal Now (which invites demonic energy as a tall tree invites lightning) is overcome only in the present moment. Evil may be defeated with violent retaliation, but it is conquered with love.Paul Tillich is especially liberating for artists. Stopping just short of Buddhism, Tillich makes the world look shimmeringly alive &amp; filled with possibilities, yet so transient - a world of appearances.&quot;The courage to be is rooted in the God who appears when God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.&quot; Paul Tillich, The Courage to BeBob RixonAlso recommended&quot; Henri Bergson, An Introduction to Metaphysics"},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"I first read this book in high school, then in seminary, in graduate psychology classes, and several times since then. Each time I read it I gain insight and growth. Tillich will challenge your intellect and force you to think. He defines courage in a way that will change you if you take it to heart. This is a book that you will need to read several times to apperciate it's depth, but it is well worth it. I often feel I obtain a higher leval of consciousness and often I feel in an altered state after reading and pondering Tillich's writting. Tillich outlines fundemental concepts for existentialist and modern theology. Starting with Tillich's books of sermon is a good work up to this book."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"Tillich is one of the most creative and influential theologians and philosophers of the twentieth century. He is particuluarly influential here in America. When this book was first issue it was recognized as one of the great books of popular philosophy/theology yet written. In it, Tillich takes the reader through the different ways a person can be (essentially different ways of living). The reader will find this book not only useful in terms of their own self evaluation and helping others, but they will find it a book that, when properly understood, changes peoples lives. A word to the wise: Many people have complained that this book is a little difficult to read at first. This is because Tillich uses terminology which he has invented. He is not always good about telling the reader know what he means. However, after you read more and more of the book you get a good grasp of what he means. Stick with it. You wont be sorry."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"Professor Tillich has written a marvelous book that provokes insight, incites thought, and instigates courage.\\"The courage to be\\" makes a great and stimulating reading for theintellect, and will teach the reader about the history of the concept and the process of courage.The courage to be is the greatest achievement that any human can ever reach. As we tackle our daily lives, and wrestle with our socialization and acculturation processes and familial demands, we lose our courage and ourselves in the process; Then we go on for the rest of our lives looking for that piece of the puzzle which we might never find. Losing your courage is losing your heart and becoming dead while you're alive. Reading this book might get you back in touch with your pulsating heart and might awaken your courage that was once decimated by the clamorous world of socialization and survival. Finding the courage to be who we were meant to be at birth is the essence of our spirituality!"},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"It seemed at the beginning that it would be too abstract. Too involved in a history of philosophy in its discussion of the Stoics. That Tillich was asserting too much, as if \\"ex cathedra\\". But even in the early chapters, I sensed something special and by the time I reached Chapter 4 (\\"Courage and Participation: The Courage to Be as a Part\\"), I began to feel the my current situation was being directly and wisely addressed. That feeling only grew stronger from that point on.There's so much value in this book that I feel somehow unworthy of reviewing it. It doesn't seem that any amount of time I spent preparing a review could do justice to \\"The Courage to Be\\". I had heard so much of Tillich but this is the first time I have read him. I have missed a lot and I am grateful I finally turned to him. I had been concerned about religious myths and whether Christianity retained any value for me. Gnostic Christian myths seems fascinating and they made me wonder if Christianity might offer more to me than I had suspected. That concern with myths and Christianity led me to read several books by the progressive Christian Bishop John Shelby Spong (e.g.Jesus for the Non-Religious)). Spong mentioned in at least one of his books that he had been a student of Tillich's. Tillich had challenged Spong with the concept of nontheism, a position that Spong has moved to. That has been my own understanding since my teens but I had turned to nontheistic Eastern religions and to unorthodox, nondogmatic Western religions. Only recently had I been open to reconsidering liberal Christianity. To some extent I had already done that with such postmodern thinkers as Thomas Altizer (The Gospel of Christian AtheismandLiving the Death of God: A Theological Memoir) and recently Spong. Following up with Tillich and this book has been literally a godsend.In much of \\"The Courage to Be\\", Tillich applies his knowledge of Western Existentialism. This meant all the more to me as in my teens I had devoured such existentialists as Sartre, Camus and to a lesser extent even Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. But it was difficult to apply it to my situation. Altizer had helped by tracing developments from Christianity into postmodern movements including atheism but he was difficult to follow.Here now is Tillich who ties together Western Existentialist topics such as anxiety and meaninglessness and a postmodern concern to rediscover the relevance of the Christian tradition. Is one's self in danger today of being a thing, or as he writes \\"a matter of calculation and management\\"? As Tillich points out, the Existentialist Revolt strongly opposed such objectification. But by transcending the theistic way of understanding the sacred ,by turning to \\"the God above God\\", Tillich shares a hope ( at least in finding courage) that speak to those Existentialism addressed but recovers something from Christian roots. It is a project that seems to take better advantage of Western history and Christianity's role in it as it was than Spong's dependence on speculations to salvage an acceptable image of Jesus.This is not a book for a single reading. I've started already on my second reading and I am also reading more of Tillich, alreadyThe socialist decisionand am planning to read soonA HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN THOUGHT Edited By Carl E. Braaten. I somehow overlooked Tillich all these years and I am eager to make up for lost time. The timing is good because, as Spong has described, I seem to be \\"a believer in exile\\", raised a Christian and, although having questioned much about it, still influenced by my Protestant upbringing and by the many writings such as those of the Existentialists, that proceeded directly from or in reaction to Christianity.Finding \\"A Courage to Be\\" and Tillich may be a way for me to accept my background without rejecting what I have learned and felt since."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"Tillich gathers strands from stoicism, theistic existentialism, dialectical thought and fideism in an attempt to weave a unifying belief-system. I don't think he completely succeeds in doing that. However, he does manage to express some spiritual insights. And it is in the mining these spiritual gems that makes the book a worthwhile read.Many reviewers have voiced the opinion that Tillich's writing style is very difficult to read. I do not necessarily agree with this assessment. Tillich employs paradoxical language in an attempt to explain that which is beyond all words. At times, his writing is dry. But it is not terribly difficult to follow.Here are some of the insights that I have gathered from the reading of this book:- The human predicament is the estrangement of one's existence from one's essential being. This estrangement is sin.- God is understood as \\"being\\" itself. And \\"being\\" is a \\"creative process.\\"- There's a dialectical tension between being and nonbeing. And \\"the courage to be\\" is the power of being to will itself, to overcome the threat of nonbeing.- \\"Courage needs the power of being, a power transcending the nonbeing\\" pg. 155- Existential angst takes on three distinct forms: 1) the anxiety of fate and death, 2) the anxiety of emptiness and meaninglessness and 3) the anxiety of guilt and condemnation.Tillich discusses at length the sociological implications of these three forms of \\"anxieties\\" as they played out in history.At the heart of Tillich's discussion is the dialectical tension that exists between the individual and the group of which the individual is a part. Both the individual and the group are affirmed and denied. By affirming the self, the individual denies the group; by affirming the group, the individual denies himself. How does one overcome this conflict? By \\"the courage to be,\\" and the \\"courage to be\\" is none other than faith itself.\\"The 'courage to be' is the courage to accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable.\\" pg. 164 This is Tillich's interpretation of the doctrine of \\"justification by faith.\\"I found Tillich's discussion of death to be very interesting:\\"The courage to die is also the test of the courage to be. A self-affirmation which omits taking the affirmation of one's death into itself tries to escape the test of courage, the facing of nonbeing in the most radical way.\\" pg. 169We must learn to embrace death by taking death into ourselves. And it is with this acceptance that we affirm the \\"courage to be.\\" It is only by dying, by dying to the self, that we are reborn to eternal life. Faith defined as the \\"courage to be\\" is where we derive the power of God, who is being itself.Here are some examples of Tillich's paradoxical statements or aphorisms:- \\"He who participates in God participates in eternity. But in order to participate in him you must be accepted by him and you must have accepted his acceptance of you.\\" pg. 170- \\"The courage to be is an expression of faith and what \\"faith\\" means must be understood through the courage to be.\\" pg. 172- \\"Faith is not an opinion but a state. It is the state of being grasped by the power of being, which transcends everything that is, and in which everything that is, participates.\\" pg. 173The major criticism that I have of Tillich's thought as represented in this book is that he failed to link the \\"courage to be\\" or faith with love. Ultimately love is the power of being. And God is not only being itself but also love. They are inseparable."},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","review":"One of the greatest contemporary accounts of existentialism from the theological perspective. Tillich writes with extreme precision and emphasizes the need for faith in an age when meaninglessness animates the quest for self-understanding. Existentialism has been dominated by secular sentiment, and Tillich brings it back into its theological context by offering an ontological account of faith which is disguised as &quot;courage.&quot; Important points include: the God beyond god, and the three categories of the fear-anxiety correlation in respect to both their historical and philosophical manifestations.

All efforts however resulted in enormous gain for science and mankind.There is some fascinating information here like the scientist who withstood temperatures of 200 degrees. Incredibly some of the scientists featured in the stories lived to a hearty old age. Even I didn't know that polonium, discovered by Marie Curie, was named after her birth country of Poland.The authors do a good job making complicated scientific topics understandable and gripping. A few illustrative graphics here and there expounding and clarifying some arcane concepts would have been welcome by this Potato Head.In the closing comments the authors mention that some in the scientific community frown on self -experimentation, but it's a near necessity for astronauts, hampered by their numbers and their cramped quarters.I had noticed a lack of diversity in the book's subjects. An author's note explains that self-experimentation had mostly been the province of male Europeans and that not many women experimenters could be found.

Fletcher Pratt was determined to remind you that the Civil War was a WAR, long and bloody and dramatic, with the issue in doubt from the begining till very near the end. And he emphasized that the Civil War was about slavery and seccession, two political questions that it answered forever. He wrote this history with the skills of a novelist and the passion of a participant (Pratt's on the Union side, and no bones about it). I first read this book in the sixties, and after reading a variety of other works, including James McPherson's one volume and Shelby Foote's three volume masterpieces, I've never seen anyone that captures the essence of what happened and why like Pratt. I know of no better introduction to Civil War History, and very few books in its league. My highest recomendation."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire","review":"What can I say about this book? Well, how about in a lifetime of reading many books on the Civil War, both good and great, this one stands head and shoulders above them all. While more ink than the blood that was spilled has been used by many others to explain this terrible war, Pratt managed to capture the essence of the conflict in a short, brilliant book.Pratt was a military historian of the first rank, but was also known for clever and exciting high fantasy stories. Perhaps it was this versatility that honed his storytelling ability to the sharp edge that we see here. While not missing a single important detail of politics, causes, battles, and personalities, he weaves an engrossing tale from start to finish, and creates a solidly researched history that is also a page-turner. This book is a joy to the student of the Civil War, but also appeals to those with no particular interest in that conflict, solely on the merit of Pratt's tight storytelling.This book was written in 1935, and much new material on the Civil War has surfaced since then. Others, such as Shelby Foote, Bruce Catton and James McPherson have written much longer and more comprehensive works on the war that are excellent in their own right. Yet this little book still shines out as a gem among them. With its solid scholarship, sharp storytelling, and precise choice of details, it is the first rate Cliff Notes to the Civil War.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire","review":"I have the new edition of this book, I bought it soon as I saw it sitting on a store shelf, despite already having 5 or 6 copies of the old pocketbook sized editions.

If you are going to spend the rest of your life reading histories of the civil war, start with this one.It would take thousands of words to express the reasons I love this book. But somehow that wouldn't be appropriate. What I will say is this:Bruce Canton could spend two pages discribing a muddy campaign, and you will come away knowing it was muddy and what a loggistical problem that was. Shelby Foote could spend a chapter on a muddy campaingn and you will come away knowing it was muddy and how much the troops complaigned about it and maybe a funny incident or two. Fletcher Pratt could spend a paragraph or two on that campaign, and when done you'll notice your leg's hurt. Why? Because you didn't want to get mud on your couch."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire","review":"I first read this book when I was about nine years old, having fished it out of my parents' bookcase to while away some idle hours. Eventually, I wore out its fragile binding and was left with a heap of pages until one day, on a visit to Washington DC, I was delighted to find a fresh copy in a second-hand bookstore. To this day, if I crave entertainment and inspiration, I take this book down from the shelf and open it at random. Whatever chapter - paragraph! - I choose is bound to shine.Just how accurate or balanced Pratt's account of the Civil War is, I do not know. I have not read any other books about it. But he has made Grant, Lee, Lincoln, Stanton, Davis, McLellan, Hooker, Sherman, Sheridan, Bragg, Jackson, Stuart and dozens of others come alive for me.Aged nine, I did not understand all the long words by any means. (What on earth was the \\"Dithyramb of Shiva\\", and what was an \\"Experiment in Tauromachy\\"?) But I loved them, and almost always figured out the meaning by the context.In a way, Pratt made it possible for me to study history at university many years later. He inoculated me against the idea that history has to be boring, because I had such a stunning counter-example at the back of my mind. There are very few books of fiction that I have read that come anywhere near being so entertaining.Anyone who hasn't read this book really ought to, if they have the slightest interest in military matters and delight in fine writing. Just one tip: if you can get hold of a hardback, it will last longer. The paperback gets fragile after a few readings, and the pages are apt to fall out unless you hold it very carefully."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire","review":"This is, hands down, one of the best books on any topic I've ever read. Fletcher Pratt had a way with words that few equalled. But more important, he had a keen insight into the problem of getting us to understand the complexities of the events he discusses. After the fact, we often think that certain events were &quot;inevitable&quot; but Pratt does a wonderful job of showing us how contingent the Union victory was, even as late as Fall, 1864.My favorite chapters are the early ones, where Pratt lays out the big picture of the war and discusses the lightning moves of diplomacy that kept Kentucky and Missouri in the Union and thereby gave the Union the strategic advantage. The Civil War was *the* time of decision for the USA--had things gone differently, our history and world history would have been very different. Pratt does a masterful job of bringing that to light."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire","review":"In addition to the established canon of &quot;great books&quot; that we are all taught in our education, each of us has a personal canon of titles which have profoundly influence the direction which our reading has taken.Fletcher Pratt's &quot;A Short History of the Civil War&quot; is at the top of my idio-canon. I purchased it as a child from the bookrack of a drugstore in Pittsburgh in the '50's, and must have reread it at least a dozen times before it fell apart from old age. I am delighted to discover that it has been reissued by Dover, complete with its excellent set of battle and campaign maps.Although by no means a young people's writer, Pratt narrates the history of the Civil War with an emotional urgency and liveliness that imprints the Civil War forever in one's consciousness, attaching each major event in the reader's mind with some intriguing turn of phrase.Pratt's account, written in 1948, has given place to _Battle Cry of Freedom_ by James McPherson as the authoritative one-volume history of the Civil War; a comparison of these two books is instructive. McPherson is writing for an audience which has experienced the civil rights movement and is aware of the gaping wounds caused by racism. His narrative shows us how fundamentally the values of the Southern society differed from those of the North. Pratt, on the other hand, was writing for an audience for whom all of these conflicts were still mainly imminent. His narration takes the form of rapid fire anecdote and savvy but sketchy military explanation. The character of each figure in the Civil War is hastily drafted by pungent, witty stories.Taken all together, Pratt's book is a thrilling read for adults, and not at all a bad book to be left out strategically for your young teenage son to &quot;discover&quot; on his/her own."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire","review":"Catton's, Foote's, Hansen's, and McPherson's books all have their virtues, and certainly should be read and admired, but this little gem by Pratt remains the yardstick against which all histories (one- or multi-volume) must be measured.

I barely understood at the time what a heretical book it was; but I'll say this, it taught me how to think.More than being a \\"Unionist', Pratt is a humanist, he views the war as a tragedy, filled with genius, grandeur and misery, and brought to a place of potential transcendence by an adherence to republican principles by a man who was almost without ideology, Abraham Lincoln.He revisits the basic why? Because the South thought the North would not fight, or if it did, it would be a joke. The North was shocked not that so many states seceded, but that any of them did.He allows the story to unfold; the currents take you on the terrifying ride that time was. His 'takes' on the different personalities are years ahead of their time. His only miss is the nasty Sheridan, who, gutsy commander that he could be, padded his portfolio shamelessly, and I'm sure Pratt was working from his memoirs. Stone's River does stand as written.He was the first author to apply 20th Century critical mind to these 'holy' figures. I remember my father shaking his head after I'd regaled him with a few choice bits. \\"It's just that when I was a kid, we were taught to look at those men on a pedestal, figures to hold up as models that were above us.\\" I then and there decided to attain those places in my own quiet way.Pratt shows you what attitudes and philosophies worked, and why. It's for us to apply those lessons to our own time.Unionist? His praise of the Southern soldier is all the more powerful for beingtersely put. For the leaders who propelled them into conflict he doesn't have much use. But Northern politicians often fare no better.He enters detail that it would take historians decades to emphasize, the genius of Adams, the US Ambassador to England, The Knights of the Golden Circle....It hurts him that the old \\"infinite numbers and material\\" reason for Northern victory is substituted for so many examples of genius, spirit and gutsy fighting that produced victories that crowded the South away from its granaries, Kentucky and Tennessee and the machinations of the English and French Empires. Fire won the day, not some amoebic mass that smothered the REAL men.He corrects the false population tables that are still used.Lincoln's progressive handing over of power as the war aims were met is given it's proper attention.If you like this book, you MUST read his history of the Consular period of Napoleonic France, \\"The Empire and the Glory.\\" Prepare to view the English reaction to a revolutionary France stabilized in a not-so-flattering light."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire","review":"This is a very readable, engaging, and concise look at the U.S. Civil war by Fletcher Pratt (1897-1956). This book first arrived in 1935, but don't worry about its antiquity. This is an excellent account of that tragic conflict, and you should enjoy it whether you are a Civil War buff or one with only a casual interest. Pratt concentrates heavily on the major battles and events, and tells the story of this bloody conflict in concise and readable detail. As one who has read superb in-depth accounts of specific campaigns or occurences by James McPherson and Bruce Catton, I'd recommend these two excellent authors for indepth reading. For a solid, concise, general history, Pratt has the ticket."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire","review":"Pratt fills in the holes left by other historians, mixing history with story telling. Although written in the 1930's it has all the feel of the 1860's. His unique style is clever, flamboyant and free flowing, at times to the point of being demanding to follow, especially with the many players. The pages are also replete with maps, and intermissions that break from the carnage. If you are searching for a quick look into the key battles and the thinking of the day this compact book is an excellent place to start.The author is mainly focused on the battlefield movements, and the occasional navy conflict; descriptive observations of the topography and the fighting men, and a very brief outline of the causes and early uprisings are also touched upon. The disorder on both sides is made clear: the leadership and men in disarray, the costly blunders and mistakes, the individualistic confederate troops.......There developed a stand-off and it looked bleak for the union army starting out. Support declined but President Lincoln kept his focus. And it wasn't until Sherman and Grant, and the industrial union might were turned loose that the confederacy finally began its collapse.Note: \\"Strictly speaking, there never was an American Civil War. A civil war is a conflict in which two or more factions fight for control of a nation's government. The English Civil War of the 1640's and the Spanish Civil War of the 1930's are two classic examples; in both cases, two factions sought to control the government. That was not the case in the United States between 1861 and 1865. The seceding Southern states were not trying to take over the United States government; they wanted to declare themselves independent.\\"---Thomas WoodsGod blessScott"},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire","review":"This is the book for you!

The early technologists had to get along with the energy that could be provided by harnessing human or animal power.The great power sources of the Middle ages were the water wheel and the wind mill. .The earliest mills were used to grind but about a century after about A.D. 1300, it was being employed to drain the marshes and to pump accumulating water.The invention of steam engine brought industrial revolution. Coal and iron were the symbols of new machine age and steam engine was its prime mover. It made possible railways. Steam was applied to navigate for moving shipsSecond it shows the changes brought in man's environment by an advent of new technology.Industrial revolution brought two major developments in transport and communication. Train, motorcar, airplane not only have speeded up transportation but also have added important new dimensions to trade and commerce.Revolution in human communication , largly based on various applications of electricity . The telegraph, telephone , radio, television found ways to put these devices into almost universal service.Communication with other human beings changes the personnel environment in profound ways.The cities grew out of man's need for communication.Lewis Mumford wrote in \` the city in History'The city is a special receptacle for storing and transmitting messages . the development of symbolic methods of storage immensely increased the capacity of the city as a container; it not merely held together a larger body of people and institutions than any other kind of community, but it maintained and transmitted a larger portion of their lives than individual human memories could transmit by word of mouth.Lastly, it examines the interactions between milieu and man.According to Jacques Ellul in the \` the technological society', the technique, means technological order has supplanted nature as the milieu of modern man . this milieu is then said to be artificial. Autonomous, self-determining, growing according to a causal process, which sets means over ends, so that all parts are mutually implicated to such a degree that no technical problem can be isolated any longer from the technological order as such.According to Marshall McLuhan \`the electronic is distinct from any other age in having extended the human nervous system itself in a group of external technologies ........................ the immediate extensions of our nervous system by telegraph and telephone and radio and television not only usher as in to a period when the codifying and moving of information supersede all other tasks in scope and in creation of wealth, but they involve us totally in one another's lives'."},{"Title":"The Foolishness of Preaching : Proclaiming the Gospel Against the Wisdom of the World","review":"This is an uplifting book. Capon is particularly adept at unveiling our shallow &quot;theologies of the Cross.&quot; This stuff is Calvin with a flair. Those who preach will appreciate his lively Buechner-esque style. I enjoy the way he anticipates various protests from his reader, then answers him/her with earthy honesty. For example, to those who insist on topical over lectionary preaching, he quips: &quot;Like topical anesthetics (topical sermons) don't go deep!&quot; The price of the book is worth the first part. The second part, on the mechanics of the sermon, is not as fun to read, but will be helpful for those just starting out in the pulpit. --Phil Jones, pastor Ayden Christian Church, Ayden NC."},{"Title":"The Foolishness of Preaching : Proclaiming the Gospel Against the Wisdom of the World","review":"Capon urges those of us who preach to keep our focus on what is most important, namely Jesus Christ. It's not about keeping the rules nor about holding the right doctrine. It's about being held in love by the God who made us and wants to save us by grace through Christ. If you only read one book on preaching this year, it needs to be this one."},{"Title":"The Foolishness of Preaching : Proclaiming the Gospel Against the Wisdom of the World","review":"It is odd that men are called to preach sermons, isn't it? Fallible preaching by fallible men is a dangerous affair. As Christians we hold the Bible to be infallible, our final authority for faith and life. God has used men to preach the perfect Word of God, to put into words what Scripture means. The foolishness of preaching is almost comical when viewed that way.Capon is a writer who I love to read, partly because I disagree with him so much. His theology is wacky, his methods are unconventional, and his wit is too sharp at times. On the other hand, he is challenging in many ways and he is an amazing writer. I always come away from reading Capon having learned much more than when I read an author I already know I agree with.If you are in the position where you have to preach a sermon in a couple of months, you could do a lot worse than this book. In the second section Capon specifically addresses preachers and gives some great advice for those who want to learn the real work of preaching sermons. His timetable and schedule is realistic, spiritually challenging, and thoughtful.As good as the second section is for preachers, the first section (The Bedrock of Preaching) is more applicable for all believers. Capon's first chapter is his take on gospel presentation. This is something that I have reflected on many times since the first read, and will probably do so for years. This first chapter alone is worth the price of the book and will certainly provoke a lot of thought.One of the many quotes I really like from the book, \\"Topical sermons are like topical anesthetics: they don't go deep.\\" (63)Capon also offers some great writing advice on page 131. It's a small addition to the book, but some of the best advice on writing that I have read.This is not Capon's best, but there is plenty to glean from this work whether you are a preacher or not. Get this book after you have read, and liked, some of his other works likeThe Romance of the Word."},{"Title":"The Foolishness of Preaching : Proclaiming the Gospel Against the Wisdom of the World","review":"As the title might suggest, this is not a book for everyone. It is, more specifically, a book for preachers, and I would add, writers too. Though even then, the preacher or writer in question should have thick skin and a strong handle on his or her doctrine. I disagree with Capon about much: his politics, his ethics, often his theology, and sometimes even his preaching. Yet I could not put this book down.Capon (b. 1925) is an American Episcopal priest and author who has been actively writing and publishing books for over 40 years, beginning with Bed and Board in 1965. He writes about family, money, sexuality, health, food, children, theology, and cigars with unparalleled wit.In The Foolishness of Preaching, Capon tackles the tension between the divine force and human impotence of the act of delivering a sermon week-in and week-out. He reminds his readers, mostly pastors, of the necessity for \\"a passion for the Passion.\\" He warns against the cult, creed, and conduct of religion that have lulled our congregations to sleep as we (preachers) use those \\"grim pills\\" as replacements for the jaw-dropping shocker of GRACE.He writes, \\"I think good preachers should be like bad kids. They ought to be naughty enough to tiptoe up on dozing congregations, steal their bottles of religion pills, spirituality pills, and morality pills, and flush them all down the drain. The church, by and large, has drugged itself into thinking that proper human behavior is the key to its relationship with God. What preachers need to do is force it to go cold turkey with nothing but the word of the cross--and then be brave enough to stick around while it goes through inevitable withdrawal symptoms\\" (Capon, 14).Capon divides his book in half. Part 1 (\\"The Bedrock of Preaching\\") deals with foundational issues of Gospel-proclamation. While part 2 (\\"The Practice of Preaching\\") deals with practical issues of weekly preaching. He offers valuable helps for those who use only notes as well as for those who preach from a detailed manuscript.Though I cannot follow Capon at each turn (at many turns!), I am deeply thankful for this book. The Foolishness of Preaching has made its way on to the (very) short list of books I recommend on the subject of preaching. Experience Capon and enjoy. You'll likely thank me later. Though you be mad as heck at him!"},{"Title":"The Foolishness of Preaching : Proclaiming the Gospel Against the Wisdom of the World","review":"Capon is very sound, and you will see he is very, very different.He will paint a picture to your ear that will last.After reading several of his books, I had to talk to him. I called his church and asked him what helps you come up with great ideas to deeply communicate such difficult concepts? A gracious and warm man said, I read the Bible and it flows out."},{"Title":"The Foolishness of Preaching : Proclaiming the Gospel Against the Wisdom of the World","review":"I greatly enjoy Capon's writing & agree with much that he says. I find missing-the biblical connection that \\"Faith-Pisteu\\", (Lean on- trust in -depend on) is a living faith-a love response to the the one who loves us.. Capon's light clarification of faith is a bit casual ie believe what God has done),In my view the focus sidetracts the truth that one is to lean on -trust in-& depend on th one wh has done it.He is alive-faith is alive-I love him because he first loves me-Not cheap-but costly John 3:16 \\"God SO LOVES the world-that he Gave...\\" Essentialy faith is to be a love response, to God's love for me ie a Living faith-James clarifies this somewhat......The 500 lb elephant Capon describes-is now lopsided on the other end-Me thinks love is reciprocal-God desires me -that i might desire him...Not require-but yes desire"},{"Title":"The Foolishness of Preaching : Proclaiming the Gospel Against the Wisdom of the World","review":"Although the author has some great insight into the need to look at Christ alone he really dismisses any use of the Law as legalism.The law used wrongly, to make people keep trying to keep it as a means to measure their relationship to God, should be abandoned.But the law used correctly, as a guide to point us to our need for the sacrifice of Christ, is very much still valid in preaching. All use of the law is not \\"relgion\\". The OT laws were meant to be a part of faith just as NT communion and baptism are today. If you dismiss the OT laws as legalism you must also dismiss the NT sacraments as such also. And I don't think he really means to do that.Also to make some points he travels into speculative areas instead of those that are more scripturally clear. For instance he makes the point that God creates out of nothing. Then he makes the point that He can recreate out of nothing. And he then basically said that there was a point when you were nonexitent so whose to say that after you die you may be nonexistent again so that God may raise you up from \\"nothing\\" just as he created the world from nothing in the first place.He equates \\"nothing\\" with nonexistence. I have a problem with that. When Jesus says. \\"apart from me you can do nothing\\" is He saying that what you do apart from Him never happened? No, of course not. He's saying it is \\"zero, of no account to yourself, adds nothing to you (i.e. the Work of Christ is all you really have)\\".So be aware of such things if you read this book."},{"Title":"The Foolishness of Preaching : Proclaiming the Gospel Against the Wisdom of the World","review":"This is a pretty good help in preparing sermons and the techniques that go into it. The author encourages the reader to use his own style when preaching. I was put off by the author's advice to have a smoke and drink a beer when the sermon preparation is complete. If you can get past that, this will be a good addition to your library."},{"Title":"Refiguring Anthropology: First Principles of Probability & Statistics","review":"This is one of a few books that I either read in whole or parts, as I self-studied statistics and other quant methods as grad student of anthropology. The anth prof that taught the only required stats course for my program barely understood what he was teaching, and in many cases didn't understand what SPSS was actually doing with our data. This is a grievous sin for those who'd like to incorporate quant methods into their research, because as David Thomas points out in this book, you should never use any statistical method that you don't understand. This is something that I didn't start to understand until I took a linear regression course in the psy edu dept, and truly believe now that I'm working towards a grad certification in applied stats. Go grad your copy of Russ Bernard's, Methods in Anthropological Research, and take a look at the quant section. It's one of the easiest to read and best written introductions around, and this book not only expands upon what Prof. Bernard writes, but perhaps makes the process easier and more fun.If you're an anthro or a student, and you want to get a real sense of whether this book is worth your time, I'd suggest reading the last chapter first. In it, the author tells a story about the tribes of social science and how our particular tribe (my memory is off on the details, it's been a couple of years since I read the book) came to use stats in a limited way, and needed a guide which was in the form of the 10 Commandments of statistical inference for anthropologists. Things like stats aren't magic, so garbage data in equals garbage results out. Thou shalt not worship the p&lt;.05 coefficient value, etc... These basic truths are common sense to any statistician, but are unknown to most cultural anthros. The vast majority of detractors to quantifying anth in any way, argue against doing these very things that no statistician would ever do, or would think to do. Basically, they are pointing at other social scientists that have either reduced multivariate phenomena to simple bivariate cause-effect relationships, or have done things they shouldn't have done in the first place (because they didn't know any better themselves). The remedy isn't to avoid stats and other quant methods, it's to better understand them, and to use them when applicable. It would move the discipline forward decades if we just learned how to do the basic stuff right, rather than trying to get fancy and do complicated data analysis badly. That's what this book is for. You will understand exactly what the p-value is, and why it's not as important as one would think. I think if more anths understood just how much personal and educated judgement went into doing statistics, and how it is not a simplistic, mechanistic, mindless process, we could get on with life and start joining the rest of the academic and professional world. This book is the first step in developing that understanding in a uniquely anthropological voice."},{"Title":"Refiguring Anthropology: First Principles of Probability & Statistics","review":"This book is essential for understanding how statistics can help the fields of anthropology (as well as how it can hurt).

But this, while interesting, is not as well organized, and is a bit bloated. I think he was learning on this one, to suceed better with THE ARAB MIND. Nonetheless, an interesting and informative book."},{"Title":"The Jewish Mind","review":"I had to add my ideas on Patai's works as I am of both Jewish and Middle Eastern heritage. I can tell you there is a difference between how typical Jewish minds are different from typical Arab minds. The difference is in part ethnocentric. Middle Eastern Jews of American descent, actually emphasize their Middle Eastern heritage above all else. This is not about bad or good but just about differences. We are very happy and proud to be American but adding Syrian American to the mix really seems to build up our ego. That is, only when it comes to the biases of other Syrians. The Jewish mind tends to emphasize dialogue and rigorous debate. Between Arab and Arab, excitation typically permeates the conversation. One is deep the other, lively. No, not better, but yes, different. The primary reason I appreciate Patai's, 'The Jewish Mind', is the very fact that it is so different in terms of length, breadth, detail, and the sheer number of references he uses. Not all Jewish minds are alike as no two minds are alike. Mother and daughter, sister and brother are different as are artists, teachers, musicians and yes, even politicians are unique in the way they think. But, as Patai emphasized, he is referring to types of minds. As doctors must make inferences from the various healthy and sick bodies that they study, so too, can a scholar of the Middle East make inferences we can draw upon. The goal is enlightenment. As long as we can refer to legitimate sources of information, we can do what Kekes calls, 'balanced ' reflection. This type of reflection is not utilitarian but rather imaginative. One can simply review the chapters in this remarkable book in order to sense the scope of Patai's scholarly reach. From the beginning of the heritage we call Judaism, scholars have puzzled over the sheer number of Jewish names in every walk of life. Business, music, art, literature, law, medicine, science and philanthropy are permeated by names of individuals who have referred to themselves as Jewish. Don't just take my word for it. Read the statistics and then ask, 'Can the Jewish and Arab minds really be compared? My answer is 'yes'. Bradd Shore, in his enlightening book, states that culture is intrinsic to meaning formation. Published in 1998, Shore writes, 'Culture must be an intrinsic component of the human mind to a degree that most psychologists and even many anthropologists have not recognized' ( 'Culture in Mind:Cognition, Culture and the problem of Meaning', Shore, Introduction, 1998)."},{"Title":"The Jewish Mind","review":"This work has much interesting information but I do not think it truly defines the 'Jewish Mind'. I have the sense that the Jewish Mind if we consider its creations from Biblical Time to now is simply too vast and varied for easy definition. I would too say that as Jews value the idea of Creation , their own Mind is in a constant process of Development and creation. Any summary then seems to be a simple reduction, and not true to the Reality."},{"Title":"The Jewish Mind","review":"This book contrasts sharply with his Arab Mind. Reading the two together, one can see clearly Mr. Patai's bigotry and hate of Arabs. For a professor who is said to have held high positions at prestigious US universities, I found his stereotypical writings quite scandalous. However, when I balanced this with the fact that his is the son of a well known Hungarian Zionist, I came to realize that his agenda could easily be understood (the vast majority of people hostile to Arabs are Jews). Added to this, his work is highly descriptive and speculative - reinforces the view that Anthropology is not really a science."},{"Title":"Diagnosis and Correction in Reading Instruction","review":"This book is an excellent resource to add to a teacher's educational library.

When the Starretts establish themselves somewhere new and start a family, by taking in and helping out someone they didn't know, and Joe Starrett not giving up on the stump. In the year of 1889 the move that was happening across Northern America had relatively come to a holt and the Starretts were one of the last to settle down and start a family on the new plains. They stopped at a small place in Wyoming and set up their family. To do this would be a strong effort as the pain and pressure that people went though in the cross of Northern America was quite large. There is a poem about the great movement across Northern America that applies to what the Starretts would have gone through. &quot; The cowards never started and the week died on the road and all across the continent the endless camp fires glowed.&quot; This captures the essence of the movement across Northern America and the feelings that the Starretts would have had. In the story the Starrett family take on a new member to their family, a man titled Shane. When the Starretts did this it showed that they had compassion for others that had traveled the same journey as them and that they were willing to help someone that they didn't know. When the Starretts were moving across Northern America, they would have been tired and happy to see a warm and friendly face, so they gave water and food to Shane to show that they would help him. When Joe and Shane started working on the stump in the property of the Starretts, the pioneering sprit was shown again by both Shane and Joe. They were both very determined to remove the stump out of the ground and get it out of their lives. Joe and Shane never gave up on the stump, they kept at it till it gave way and did what the Starretts wanted it to.

This story takes place in the West during the 1800's.Shane, a man of a mysterious unknown past, rides into the Starrett's farm while farmers turn to examine him intently. He is a man of medium build, dark skin, and a thin, tight face with a body as hard as steel. But the thing that catches the eye the most is his clothes. He has a nice shirt, jeans, a handkerchief around his neck, and a big, black hat. Definitely, his nice clothes are uncommon in such a plain farm community as this. He is a gunslinger, but something in his past keeps him from wearing a gun.The whole town wonders about him, and even more so when he ends up working as a farmhand for the Starretts. However, they do not know how deeply involved he would become when Fletcher, a cattle rancher who lived across the river from the farmers, tries to take the farmer's land for his cattle to graze. When Fletcher hires an expert gunslinger to \\"convince\\" the farmers to back down, only Shane can stop him, but will he?Shane is a wonderfully written story that depicts the conflict that farmers and ranchers faced in fighting for land in the West. This Western novel will not disappoint you with its interesting characters and nail-biting plot. I recommend this book to any one 10 or older that likes Westerns and classic novels."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The book 'Shane' is very exciting. Good interpretation of symbols and an open mind is required to thoroughly enjoy this masterpiece. It is not simply about a boy and his family and a stump. Several themes are found in this novel: Attitudes to Power and Authority being the most prominent. Authority is seen in Joe Starrett. He is not chosen as leader nor were the homesteaders forced to comply with his decision to be leader but it was just accepted that he was their representative. On the contrary, Fletcher acquires his power because he already owns most of the land in that area and could be considered the wealthiest man. He abuses this power by forcing his ranch hands to bully the homesteaders into moving off the land. Fletcher becomes a despised character because of this abuse of power and it is noticed that when Fletcher was away the ranch hands were actually friendly with the homesteaders. Another theme is Love and Family Relationships: All through the book, the strong bond of the Starrett family is displayed. One instance is when the narrator (Bob- the son)remarks that he and his father would paint the house in rainbow colours just to please Marian (the mother). Another example is when Shane decided to face Wilson (a gun fighter hired by Fletcher) and Fletcher alone. Starrett was the one requested to face Wilson but Shane, knowing that Joe could easily be injured, knocked him out and went to the saloon. Other themes like: Heroism, Attitudes to the Past, Women In Society, among others are found in this novel. This is truly a work of art!!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The film version of Jack Schaefer's 1949 novel \\"Shane\\" is one of those touchstone movies of childhood, along the lines of the unforgettable tearjerker \\"Old Yeller.\\" The last scenes of the film are sure to bring a lump to the throat of the most stalwart among us. With memories of the film firmly etched in my mind, I decided to read Schaefer's novel, to go to the source itself and see whether the book is better than the movie. I have to say Shane as a novel is a must read, even more important than watching the film version.The plot should be familiar to many people. The Starrett family is working some land in Wyoming, trying to cut a living out of the rugged landscape. Several other families are staking claims in the area even though Fletcher, the big rancher in the region, hates their presence and is working behind the scenes to drive them out. The homesteaders look to Joe Starrett to protect their interests in the face of this intimidation, a battle Joe is slowly losing until the arrival of Shane.When Shane arrives, he quickly takes up residence with the Starrett family, working as a hand around the place. Within a short period of time Shane finds himself sucked into the feud between Fletcher and the homesteaders. Ranch hands goad Shane into several violent fistfights, although Shane goes out of his way to avoid trouble. As the level of conflict escalates and the dangerous qualities of Shane emerge, Fletcher brings in a hired gun from the outside to deal with the troublesome homesteaders for the last time. The final scenes of the novel balance gripping action with the heartrending departure of Shane back into the wilderness from which he came.Schaefer pulls off a triumph of epic proportions with this short novel. Not only is the story told in a sparse, no nonsense style, Schaefer makes Joe Starrett's son Bob the narrator of the story. Through this touchingly innocent narration, Bob manages to convey the mysterious qualities of Shane while still revealing adult themes. For example, a rather platonic love emerges between Shane and Marion, Bob's mother. Joe knows about the love springing up between the two but chooses to keep it in perspective. The beauty of this incident is how Bob relates it; he discusses it just as a child would, without really understanding the implications of the situation while the reader understands perfectly what is happening. Brilliant, just brilliant!Shane is the main character of the novel even though we do not learn much about him. Shane is an enigma clad in dark clothing, riding in off the land like some mysterious omen of doom. Schaefer tells us nothing about Shane's past, although it is obvious he is a master with a pistol and that he has a checkered past involving trouble of some sort. Whatever trouble Shane is in, he is what we would call \\"good people.\\" Shane wants to avoid conflict, but he will never back down from a fight or fail to help people who treat him as a friend. His past haunts his actions, making him reluctant to rely on his seemingly vast reservoirs of strength. When pushed to the wall, Shane lashes out with a terrible violence usually kept in check because he knows what he is capable of doing to a man.There are several themes arcing their way through this book. One deals with fate and how it is impossible to escape your past. Another involves violence; not reckless violence of the type employed by Fletcher and his goons, but a measured violence used to solve a seemingly insolvable situation. Schaefer shows us that no matter what our intentions in this life, there are going to be times when violence in the name of a cause is the only answer to those who are incapable of relying on any method other than intimidation to get what they want out of life.This is an excellent read for any type of reader both young and old, although that does not make it a necessarily easy book. The bare bones writing style makes it very easy to gloss over important themes and symbolisms. In other words, \\"Shane\\" is a book to think about both when reading it and after finishing the story. Reading the story more than once may not be a bad idea, as more themes are sure to emerge from this fascinating character study. Schaefer dedicated \\"Shane,\\" his first book, to his first son. What a beautiful and wondrous tribute."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I'm a 7th grader who just finished writing this review for my class and my teacher accused me of cheating. She said it was too good for a 7th grader to write. My mother suggested that I send my review in and consider it a vote of confidence. This action-filled western fiction, set in the late 1880's has an unpredictable ending. When a restless gunman rides into a hard working, god-fearing family, they provide him with honest work and stability. The untouchable gunman changes his negative actions into positive actions by fighting for justice of the commom man in a Wyoming valley of corrupted cattlemen. The setting provided a historic look into the past of the taming of the west and its enduring bloodshed of the ending of open ranges and the beginning of grazing wars between the farming homesteaders and the established ranchers. The main character's defenses of isolation and destitute unravel into a caring, justice-seeking, loyal man whose attributes contribrute to the small homesteading community. Finding his acceptance among man, the main character, unpredictably returns to his engraved dynamics of aloneness and shatters the lives of the people who grew so close to him. This novel impressed upon my mind the cliche'&quot;The road to heaven is paved with good intentions&quot;, showing me that he couldn't distance his past and feel comfortable in his own skin where ever he roamed. SHANE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE A NEGATIVE TO A POSITIVE-BUT I SURE CAN! JESSE MILLER"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Unlike the reviewer &quot;Barb from Oregon,&quot; I believe everything she found detestable in Shane is what makes it a great western. Her firts complaint was to the shallow development of the Shane character. I believe the author intentionally left his past dim, his motivations unkown, as part of the &quot;hero&quot; motif. As to violence--it's a western story depicting a range war, not a court proceeding. The author shows Joe's muscles ripping his shirt in the bar fight for a reason. From the perspective of his son, it was vitally important that he see his father as strong, otherwise his admiration of Shane may have overshadowed his father.Wild Bill recommends this book for any reader interested in a portrayal of the wild west in its legendary form."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"He was clean-shaven and his face was lean and hard and burned from high forehead to firm,tapering chin. His eyes seemed hooded in the shadow of the hat's brim. He came closer, and Icould see that this was because the brows were drawn in a frown of fixed and habitual alertness.Beneath them the eyes were endlessly searching from side to side and forward, checking off everyitem in view, missing nothing. As I noticed this, a sudden chill, I could not have told why, struckthrough me there in the warm and open sun.Well, we all know why that chill ran through little Bob as Shane rode up to the Starrett homestead in the Wyoming Territory in the summer of 1889, because Shane was a lethal, albeit reluctant, gunslinger. This slender American classic tells the story, familiar to every cultured American from the great George Stevens' movie (1953), of how Shane, fleeing a mysterious but obviously violent past, was befriended by the Starretts and stayed on to help them fight off the predatory intentions of the valley's big rancher and his evil henchmen. It is a story that is central to the American mythos.The great Westerns penetrate deep within the American psyche; they strike a chord that lies somewhere within our national character, just waiting to be plucked. I believe that their unique power derives from a truly elemental facet of democracy--that in order for men to enjoy the freedom that a democracy allows, they must be able to depend on the fundamental goodness of their fellow men. An unyielding, self enforcing morality is a prerequisite for a political system based on liberty; men are unwilling to limit the coercive power of government when they live in fear of one another.Certainly the Western and the code of the West represent a sanitized and romanticized view of the Frontier and the men who tamed it, but it is a romance that serves the democratic purpose. These morality tales are instructive and aspirational. Of course men like Shane are archetypes in a kind of a national myth making:There were sharp hidden hardnesses in him. But these were not for us. He was dangerous asmother had said. But not to us as father too had said. And he was no longer a stranger. He was aman like a father in whom a boy could believe in the simple knowing that what was beyondcomprehension was still clean and solid and right.This is a little boy's impossible view of a hero, but here we see that the character of Joe Starrett is equally important. Joe Starrett is a simple sod farmer, but he is kind and decent and honest and courageous, the equal of Shane in every respect except for speed on the draw. Joe is the true yeoman hero of this tale and one of the duties that Shane performs is to demonstrate this fact to young Bob (and to us).Stories like Shane are a product of a time when Americans genuinely believed in democratic ideals and in the American Dream. They express our native confidence that we can produce men who will measure up these standards. It is no coincidence that the Western died in the mid-60's along with the sense of confidence in our national purpose. It is also unsurprising that it was Ronald Reagan, that hero of myriad Westerns, who stanched the bleeding and made people believe again, however briefly.Here is just one other example of the instructive nature of these stories. This is Shane, teaching Bob to shoot:&quot;Listen, Bob. A gun is just a tool. No better and no worse than any other tool, a shovel--or an axeor a saddle or a stove or anything. Think of it always that way. A gun is as good--and as bad--asthe man who carries it. Remember that.&quot;Think of the level of personal responsibility that this attitude assumes. Contrast it with the near fascist drive to abolish gun rights today. The underlying argument of the forces of gun control is that guns are evil in and of themselves, regardless of the men who wield them. This is part and parcel of the Democrat myth of the '90s. Which do you think is more likely to foster good citizenship, holding guns responsible for violence or holding men responsible?As for me, I choose the classic Westerns and the democratic ideals that they convey, over the moral relativism that permeates our current culture.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Three reasons this Critical Edition is superior to the usual trade paperback edition. First, there are dozen of good essays written by book and film critics included within the pages. Second, this edition is true to the original, in the sense that it wasn't edited, and was printed in the original layout format. And finally, the artwork on the front book cover is supreme, it's a very good portrait of Shane; a rugged and mysterious man, not one of those cheesy cowboys as presented on the other editions."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Folks, I'm James Drury, who you might remember as television's THE VIRGINIAN, and once in a while I read a book that just has to be read over and over and over. Shane was such a book. The fact that there could be any rating in this section other than a 5 simply astounds me. People keep talking about this stump in the book like the book was about the stump. If you think the book was &quot;about a stump&quot; you are too young to be reading beyond grade school level. Jack Schaefer had a hugely powerful grasp of the West and of Western characters, and he left us a legacy with this book that can never be topped. That's coming from a man who reads Kirby Jonas's novels on audio tape. I enjoy Kirby Jonas's books to no end, and I know of no better author, but Jack Schaefer's &quot;SHANE&quot; is a book for anyone to strive to match. It is an all-time classic that I would put hand in hand with Kirby Jonas's DEATH OF AN EAGLE. It's a shame anyone ever has to feel like they're &quot;forced&quot; to read such a tremendous book as Shane."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I really like this book. I just finished reading it in my 7th grade English class. It has a lot of symbols and quotes that are often difficult to decipher, so I would recommend reading and then discussing it with an adult or in a book club or something. It really gave me an appreciation for great writing with all the symbols and literary devices. I usually hate all assigned school reading, but not SHANE! It's a great book but I wouldn't read it unless you are very good with reading comprehension or are over the age of 14."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This remains my favorite book, and I've read thousands, literally, over the years, including some pretty sophisticated stuff (I have an M.A. in American History from Columbia). I saw the movie when it first came out. I was a New York City area kid then, and I fell in love with the Tetons where it was filmed. I then bought the book and loved it. I was captured very early by the scene involving Shane and Joe Starrett and Ledyard, the phony salesman. When Ledyard asks Starrett how he can take the word of a stranger, Shane, Starrett responds: &quot;I can figure men for myself. I'll take his word on anything he wants to say any day of God's whole year.&quot; I still get chills re-reading those words; I still strive to live so others might say that of me. Can there be any higher praise? So... read it, and give it to your kids. If you have brought them up right, Shane will become one of their heroes and perhaps they will &quot;grow strong and straight&quot; as Shane wishes for young Joey Starrett in the book."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Jack Schaefer has set his story at the time of Wyoming's Johnson County \\"wars\\" between cattlemen and anyone, like rustlers and homesteaders, who cut into their profits. First published in 1949, the novel also reflects something of the war that had just ended for Americans who fought in Europe and the Pacific. We have a young family struggling to put down roots on the frontier, wanting little more than an ordered life and the opportunity to make a living among a gathering of neighbors who want the same for their own families.But they are prevented by men who want the open range for themselves and their own economic interests, and they'll stop at nothing to get their way. While the father of the family attempts bravely to hold his own, his neighbors are intimidated, feeling threatened and outnumbered. Shane, a man with a shadowy past, arrives in the middle of this conflict, and while he assumes for a time the life of a hired hand, his gunslinger services are eventually needed to defend the lives and property of the family that has given him a home. We see what we have suspected, that he is a killer, and there's no place for him in their sunny, settled world. He must go back on the trail and disappear.Given the time in which it was written, \\"Shane\\" is a commentary on the role of violence in a world where law and order, on an international level, had been in short supply. Americans - and especially returning soldiers - had seen this for themselves. The novel carries this disturbing awareness right into the daily life of home and hometown. The mystery of Shane's identity suggests that what he represents in the story is a darker side of ourselves that does not integrate well with the more honorable aspects of self we prefer to acknowledge.The simplicity of Schaefer's tale, and his choice of a boy as narrator, allow readers to fill in a lot of details and emotions that tap into their own deeper fears and desires. The two men joining forces to uproot the tree stump is like a scene from a dream that wants to be understood - it's not just about a tree stump. But what? While the film for all its widescreen glory is not without merit, it's dated in a way the book may never be. In its 250+ pages, it speaks of elemental forces and how we go about living in a world where we are threatened by circumstances beyond our control.Thanks to the University of Nebraska Press for assembling this critical edition which includes several fine essays providing historical background, analysis of the text, commentary and reviews on the film adaptation."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This tale of the mysterious stranger who rides in from the distant hills and rides off again, in the end, is mythic archetype of the first order. Shane, unknown and brooding, finds a place for himself at a little farmstead where he is befriended by the farmer's young son, trying desperately to shed his past and make a new and simpler life for himself among the good homesteaders who surround him. But the scheming cattle barons in the area, who control the town and seek to drive the homesteaders out make this impossible. The farmer and his wife who have befriended Shane are already being sucked into a confrontation, not of their own making, in which they must give up everything they have and flee their valley, along with their kind, or stand and fight and be destroyed by the cattlemen who want to keep the range free, at whatever the cost. Shane, the mystery man, tries to help the farmers stand up to the cowboy bullies sent by the ranchers but matters get out of hand when the head rancher, frustrated by Shane's presence and backbone, calls in a ruthless gunman from nearby Cheyenne to bring matters to a head. But Shane is more than what he seems as our little boy narrator and the cattle barons and the farmer and his wife soon find out and the tale culminates in a final confrontation which is emotionally powerful as strong men face one another in a battle for justice and right. A great, if rather short, tale, the epitome of the Old West. I loved this book and the movie that came after it. By the way, Clint Eastwood's film, Pale Rider, is another re-make, albeit with some variations, of this very wonderful novel.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"great book I have read it three times.

Shane is a drifter reluctant to discuss and eager to escape from his gunfighting past. He rides into a Wyoming settlement one day in 1889, where he meets the family of Joe and Marion Starrett, plus their young son Bob. The Starretts take him on as a valuable hired hand, and Shane soon learns of the struggled of Starrett and the other farmers against cattle baron Luke Fletcher. The disagreement involves rights to land and water. Such matters are generally decided by the courts, but the law is three days ride away. Thus matters may end up being decided by pluck, shrewdness, and the six-shooter. Complicating matters, Fletcher has brought in a hired gun named Wilson, who soon guns down one of the other farmers. All builds to the obvious climax certain to involve the two gunman and possibly several other characters.The book makes an excellent story, although most readers probably have already seen the 1952 movie starring Alan Ladd in the title role. Clearly worth a look - the book and the film."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is a western about a family in Wyoming and about a drifter who rides into their lives.

It really makes no sense to me. I do not recommend this book to ANY high-school student if you need to read a book for school."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Given the status of this book as an icon of Westerns, I was a little disappointed with the execution of this simple story.The book starts with a situation that has become a staple, if not a stereotype, of Western drama. Big rancher Fletcher is expanding his herd, and that means that he needs to drive out a handful of homesteaders who are encroaching on his water source. The homesteaders are led in their resistance by Joe Starrett, the young narrator's strong-bodied and strong-willed father.The disagreement has been stewing for a long time, but things come to a head after two important events occur: first, Fletcher gains a government contract that will allow him to move far more beef, making his situation a desperate one. Second, Starrett hires on Shane, a well-dressed man with a mysterious past who carries a sense of danger and sadness around him like a cloak.Any Western fan will be able to see what's coming next. From the moment Bob (the young narrator) see him riding in from the horizon, Shane is obviously an ass-kicker and a sharpshooter. We therefore know that he will kick some ass and shoot sharply by the end of the book, and we are not disappointed.I actually like the plot, which is a classic confrontation between the honest and strong citizen, and the greedy and well-resourced bigwig. My problem lays more in the writing itself, which telegraphs every move long before it comes. What's worse, there is a lot of \\"telling, not showing,\\" and also a lot of time is spent dwelling on the obvious, and treating the special relationship between Starrett and Shane as though it needed constant explaining. The action was also unrealistic in parts, including a fight scene in which Starrett literally picks a struggling, hefty grown man up above his head and hurls him across the room.The main attraction in this slim novel is the character of Shane, who can do everything twice as well as the next man. He is a man trying his best to escape his violent past by tilling the earth and spending time with good country people. But his plans are laid to waste when violence erupts around him, and we get the feeling that this has happened to him before.This is a quick, easy read, so I wouldn't discourage anyone from picking it up and passing an afternoon with these characters. But I would keep my expectations in check, and be prepared to move on to some Louis LaMour, which is a step up."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I think that the book Shane was a good book, but I only like the ending aand a few other parts about the story.

This is the &quot;classic western novel&quot; that everyone has been raving about? &quot;Shane&quot; lacks the elements of a good story almost completely. There is frighteningly little character development, and I find it a little strange that the reader knows next to nothing about the title character. Since other reviwers have already mentioned that pretty much nothing happens in this book, I will focus on the lack of information about Shane. The only concrete fact about Shane is that he has a mysterious past. Anything else that might be said about him is inferred,(as are most traits attributed to members of the Starrett family). Also, I believe that Schaefer pushed the whole &quot;Shane's past haunts him&quot; thing a little too far. The reader is constantly reminded of how &quot;poor Shane had something bad happen to him&quot;. This started to get old about 30 pgs in, and to add insult to injury, we are never told exactly what this &quot;bad thing&quot; was. Within literature it is sometimes for the best to leave things ambiguous, but usually, the piece of information that is never going to be told to the reader is not hinted at and/or alluded to every other page. It seemed to me that Shane's past was a vital part... scratch that, one of the only parts of his overall character. Ultimately, reading this book felt like watching the sequal to a movie I'd never seen, mostly because of the huge gaps in information about the characters. Without interesting characters, even a story with excellent prose and plot can fall flat. Shane, which had neither of these to begin with, was utterly dissapointing."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I find most Westerns boring. I've lost track of the times I've read this book.Short, beautifully written, and absolutely dead on in every respect, this is THE classic treatment of one of the great themes of American literature -- the reluctant warrior, trying to outrun his violent past, but in the end forced to fight once more. Told through the eyes of a young boy many years later, it's just about perfect.Just go read it."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is the classic tale of the Old West fading away through the eyes of Bobby, a young boy, whose family is trying to homestead range land in (presumably) Wyoming. Based loosely on the Johnson County Wars of the early 1890s, the tale centers on the heroic gunfighter Shane, a man who is trying to escape his past by settling down with the homesteaders, and working alongside Bobby's parents.Unfortunately, the Ranch barons, seeing their ranges fenced in and their way of life coming to a close, refuse to compromise and seek violence against the families. One of them is coldly shot down by the notorious gunfighter Jack Wilson, and Shane is forced, very much against his will, to return to a way of life that he sought so desperately to leave.In the end, Shane, wounded, and knowing he could never settle down, rides off - the metaphor being the Old West is dying, and so is Shane, though no one ever knows for sure, as his figure portrayed in the classic book and through the eyes of the late Alan Ladd remains immortal - to the Starrets and to us readers. The last scenes of the movie remain very sad -and very timeless. This was a movie - unlike the pablum and nonsense churned out by Hollyweird these days.I echo the comments of James Drury, this is a book that young readers should want to read, as it is solid literature. And finally a personal note: Even though he was the \\"bad\\" guy Wilson in the movie, I want to pay my respects to a nice man and fellow Pennsylvanian who I had the honor of meeting before his passing, Jack Palance. RIP, Mr. Palance, and God Bless."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"While I am sure that many people will point to Shane as the classic young adult novel of the American west, there is no reason it should be limited to young adults. This is a simple story, beautifully told, with characters of depth and subtlety and classic themes of good vs. evil, might vs. right, and living with the consequences of your actions. The narrative has an amazing, quiet grace, with scenes that will stand out in your mind well after you have finished the book. And the point of view gives the events that transpire a depth and clarity that could easily have been lost from a different perspective. Highly recommended to all. Donald J.

Schaefer took the simple, direct prose style of Twain and Hemingway and used it perfectly, carefully weighing every word for emotional effect.The book is usually kept in the children's section of bookstores, because the vocabulary is basic. It was the first I ever read, when I was seven or eight. But it is a great book for anyone, crackling with tension.

The symbols are strong, the message simple, the plot complex. Through it all, the truth prevails.Campbell would approve of this version or episode of the hero's journey to tests and searching."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"What impresses me most about this novel is its seeming simplicity. When I saw the film version, I suspected I was missing something. There seemed to be more going on between Shane and Starret, and much more between Shane and the mother. The film only hints at the layers of love and duty that are manifest by Shane's selfless, heroic actions. Most heroic of all is his great gesture, his great sacrifice. He chooses not to love his soulmate, Mrs. Starret, because of the impact it would have on her son and her husband, both of whom he has also come to love."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Everything is going normal on the Starrett farm when a mysterious man pulls up on his horse. His name is Shane. Shane wishes to settle down and leave his dark past behind him. Luckily for him, Joe Starrett is looking for a farm hand. Bob Starrett, Joe's son, befriends the stranger. All is going well when Shane gets into a fight with the henchmen of Luke Fletcher. Fletcher, a cattle driver, wants to drive the homesteaders off their land so he can have more room for the cattle to roam. Fletcher knows can't accomplish his goal with Shane there, he hires a gunman who kills one of the homesteaders. Knowing that it is his fault the homesteader died, Shane is forced to give up the easy life he wanted and goes into town to not only face the gunman, but also his past.Shane is a classic, enjoyable, western tale of bravery. Schaefer catches the conflict that is going on in Shane's world and in his mind. The bright text helps you visualize the world through the young Bob's point of view. While reading this book, I felt like I was young Bob. Schaefer creates the action scenes as if the pages where his film.Shane is great for those who like to see the world through a child's point of view. I recommend it to anyone who loves to feel as if they have been swept away into a classic movie and who loves those classic western dramas.(...)"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Great, well written squeaky clean book for my 7th grade daughter. They boys in her class read it to. Plenty of cowboy action, plenty of hard work and good character winning the day. Presents several men of different integrity/character. Only one female lead, but she is a spectacular role model. Book also tackles difficult issues with grace. Like what to do when you are married and attracted to someone else. My daughter and I had an amazing conversation about that one day. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I've loved this book since I was a kid. I recently ordered the book to give to my grandson. I've reread it and found it just as exciting as I've always found it. Delivery of the book was on time and the book arrived in the new condition stated. I couldn't be happier."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Absolutely beautiful. I have read it twice and will reread. I have seen the movie several times. There is absolutely no one that could play the part but Alan Ladd. If you know Alan Ladd, and as you read the book, you will realize that Shane was written for this great actor. This book just has everything meant for a good western. However, as much as I like westerns and realize how proud these Western men are, I did not like the ending. I wanted Joe Starrett to go after Shane and make sure his wound was tended to. But, in the great scheme of things I realize that it really doesn't matter. Shane did what he was intended to do and then he sailed off into the sunset. God Bless Shane and Jack Schaefer. You can find out what type of a man wrote this book and it is too bad we never got to know him any better. We all missed out on this great man's life, but, he left us Shane and this was important."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"i read this in 1949 at the age of 7. i have never gotten over the simple moving hard reality of this book. \\"it's not you i want shane, it's starrett\\" ... \\"what you want and what you'll get are two different things, wilson.\\"and earlier, when chris went up against shane with a partner who backed out, \\"what's wrong, do you know him?\\", \\"no one can say that, I'm leaving, that's all.\\"so a man can grow up straight inside as a man should. ... this language has made an indelible impression on me my whole life. and i am, as my friend says, \\" a bed wetting liberal democrat\\"!i just recommend you read the book first rather than watch the movie. but afterwards the movie is pretty special too, particularly the role of the child.the thing i noticed as a kid was that in the book the lead character shane was a martial arts specialist who just dismantled the cowboys he fought, while the movie character was just a slug it out hollywood amateur of the standard species, i knew even then a man alone could not win a fight against odds without training. i confirmed that in my high school basketball days against teenaged thugs.this is a simplistic, pre- clint eastwood type movie and book (compare it to pale rider to see where clint borrowed from this one), but it is hard to resist. and of course it features one of the most memorable performances of jack palance's career. In pale rider it takes stockburn and a half dozen deputies to approach the menace of palance alone.(The disappointed reviews from some teen agers here who found the book too complex, detailed, boring, or otherwise difficult are really sobering. Apparently even the comic books we read in the 1940's [count of monte cristo, les miserables, ...] would have been over these kids' heads. But to be fair, the only required reading i ever enjoyed was by dostoevsky and dickens. And four stars is not criticism here, I mean Don Quixote only gets 5 stars, and maybe alan mendelsohn the boy from mars.)"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Not sure how, but I read the book before I saw the movie, a long time ago. The book was profoundly moving to me, but I never read it again until the other day, when I saw it in a used book store for 25 cents, many years later. Well, its just as meaningful as ever now, and maybe even more so. Told by the son Bob, an adult now but looking back on his experience, it mixes a youngster's awe and naivete with a grown-up's perspective and understanding of subtlety.Very short (119 pages) and concise, it gives us a symbolic, archetypal, mythic hero in a realistic setting. Shane is too good to be true, but that's how a young boy would see him. He's a combination of a Christ-figure and a great warrior as well as a hardworking, able ranch-hand. Extremely competent and sure of himself in any setting, he seems superhuman to the wide-eyed Bob. His mother Marian likes Shane no less, and in fact falls in love with him, a fact that Bob's father Joe accepts because he too admires and respects Shane and loves Marian so much that he wants her to be happy whatever she chooses. But Shane is far too noble to take advantage of the situation because he loves the Starretts no less than they love him.Shane himself is deliberately kept as mysterious as possible, but we get hints here and there about his past. One good example is his treatment of Chris, Fletcher's cowhand. Shane is clearly seeing a reminder from his own past when he looks at Chris and is as kind to him as possible under the circumstances. He had no doubt started out as a good man but probably became very much like Stark Wilson, the hired gun, and been repulsed by his own actions, finally ending up at the Starretts' ranch very much in need of redemption. The family's acceptance and love deeply impresses him and finally leaves him with no choice but to sacrifice himself for them. All this despite the situation being the ideal set-up for him - all he has to do is let Joe go to town and get killed by Wilson and he will have everything he covets. Joe actually makes it clear that he wants Marian and Shane to be happy together and consummate their feelings for each other after he's dead, and Bob would certainly accept Shane as a father in that case.But Shane is a very complex, albeit shadowy figure and so he steps in for Joe and faces Wilson - and he's the only man who can. This book is also deceptively complicated and is about lots of things, not just homesteaders standing up to a cruel cattle baron. Its about honor and courage and integrity and different kinds of love and is seen through the hero-worshipping eyes of a young boy. The movie was great, too, but in a different way. Alan Ladd was too Roy Rogers-ish for me in his physical appearance (nothing against Roy, that's for sure); he just lacked some of the darkness and moral ambiguity that I pictured in Shane when he first arrives in the book. Ladd looked more like a trick-shot artist from a traveling Wild West show than a sinister gunfighter. Don't forget, on the very first page of the book he rides up to a fork in the road - the left branch leads to Fletcher's ranch and the right to the homesteaders, and he thinks it over before making his choice. But there's no question that Ladd did a fantastic job in his own style and its a classic western film - maybe the best ever. I just imagined Shane as being very much like the Jack Palance character, only heartsick and ashamed of what he had become and anxious for another chance, which the Starrett family gave to him so freely and unconditionally.Anyway, this book is a small gem that packs a lot of different themes into a short, seemingly simple tale. I can't recommend it highly enough. I'm a grown man and it still makes me cry."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I just recently finished 149 page book that you could say has taken me 30 years to finish and is considered by many to be the best Western novel of all time, Shane by Jack Schaefer.Shane was actually the first book I'd ever read that had no illustrations. I can't remember why, but one time in 5th grade, a few us had to stay in upper-grade classroom, and with nothing better for us to do, the teacher had us grab a book off the shelf to read. So basically I read the first few chapters and those first few chapters have always stuck with me and I always meant to go back and finish. It's weird how these things work -out sometimes, but I finally did. All I can say is; what the heck took me so long! For its size, Shane is one of the most well written and emotionally impacting books I've ever read.Mr. Schaefer's skill at projecting emotion and his ability to just \\"imply\\" what's going-on with out actually telling the reader is nothing short of amazing. Many mysteries are teasingly never solved in the story but the conclusion still has no less of an impact.Shane should be considered a modern classic. It's a must read for fans of Western fiction, a great first Western for any new-comers, and should definitely be on the list for literary scholars."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Unlike most students, when I read this novella in 8th grade I actually liked it. We were required to read a book in a genre we ordinarily avoided. I chose the western genre, which to this day I dislike.I believe the success and failure in popularity of Shane is due to breaking of genre lines. The description of this novella sounds like the archetypal Western. You have a lone gunman, a battle that can't be avoided and the inevitable showdown. Yet Shane refuses to fit the Western mold.The action sequences are few and most of the written word is devoted to description of the relatively few characters involved. Even when action occurs, it isn't described in scintillating, pulpy detail.Partly this is a result of the author's chosen protagonist. This novella is less of a Western and more a coming-of-age story. We see the events unfold through the fuzzy and at times myopic lens of a young boy. Shane is a vehicle used to challenge Bob's understanding of right/wrong, and the makings of a \\"good\\" man.Readers have complained that Shane's past is never fully explained. There are many reasons for this. It isn't necessary in the development of the plot concerning Fletcher. It also isn't necessary for the plot concerning Bob's psychological journey into young adulthood. Most importantly though, is the fact that anything Schaefer might have written would pale in comparison to our own imaginations. Most of Shane's impact comes from his mysterious past. Illuminating it would decrease his affect on the reader.Shane remains one of my favorite books today. I encourage young people to give it a try with the above caveats in mind. This isn't a mindless adventure. Shane requires a lot of effort on the part of the reader. In particular the infamous \\"stump\\" scene comes to mind. I've read a number of different analyses of that scene and my own is slightly different still. That is part of the wonder, the joy, and yes the frustration of reading Shane."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Since this book was written, all westerns since have tried to capture its power.

The characters play out their roles in a story as old as time; one of choice, the power of good and evil, and making one's own way in the world. Young Bob must learn that with every conscious decision, comes an element of responsibility. This responsibility is not only to oneself, but also to those who depend on and surround the decision maker. Shane is a man who has learned to live with the results of his decisions; Joe is a good, solid man, a good father and great role model. And Bob's mother, Marian, makes a serious decision as well, regarding her own life, and how she chooses to live it. On the surface, this is a story of ranchers v. cattlemen, but symbolically, it is more a story of choices, of love, and of self-reliance. Good book. I teach it often to my students, and they have always enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Most of us know \\"Shane\\" from the excellent movie that remains a high-water mark of realistic depiction of the Old West. Better than the novel could, the movie conveys the dust and grime, the slower pace of events, the backbreaking work of a kind no one in America knows anymore -- and the ways confrontations were handled before the arrival of law and order.Commonly a book excels its movie, and this one is no exception. The story proceeds as a brewing range war between a Wyoming rancher and small farmers toward the end of the 19th Century. Ironically, in the never-ending struggle between \\"the old ways\\" and modernization, the small farmer here represents modernization - and small farmers themselves no longer exist.The principal characters embody themes as old as literature. Before farmers ever got there, the rancher Fletcher cleared the range of marauding Indians by whatever means worked. In a might-makes-right situation, it probably needed such men to lead the westward migration. Fletcher certainly considers himself wronged as farmers begin taking over the land for which he put his life on the line. That the law favors them doesn't matter; Fletcher respects force and little else.Joe Starrett emblemizes the civilizing virtues: energy, intelligence, sense of community and honor, moral and physical courage, self-discipline, belief in family and self. In a later Schaefer novel Starrett reappears as Chet Rollins. His very physique - large, awkward, physically powerful - stands as a bulwark to which his fellow farmers repair for advice and leadership. Especially in lawless circumstances, such men represent the institutions of civilization to the less sturdy.Shane is many things, all of them complex. The book cover caricatures him as a gunfighter who can't escape his past. Shane is more than that; he's a white knight, his life echoing the Greeks who said that character is destiny. A man of substance who disdains the company of most, Shane honors substance in the Starretts. They take to each other immediately.But Shane has another side that he keeps on a leash: the inner leopard, the big cat that lives and hunts alone, striking fear in those around him. \\"Bad ones like him are poison,\\" Starrett observes. Shane unhesitatingly takes on hugely uneven odds against Morgan and his gang in the saloon, and it isn't just, or even particularly, courage or heroism. He instinctively relishes combat, violent action, dominance, perhaps even cruelty. The leopard blood passion -- and control of it - occupy Shane's core. He cannot be imagined without both.Shane brings to mind another hero who entered American consciousness 13 years before this book appeared: Rhett Butler. Rhett has more rebellion in him, but shares with Shane an unerring sense of himself and the milieu in which he moves. Both manifest extraordinary physical ability and competence. As Rhett truly respects only Melanie Wilkes, so Shane only truly respects Joe and Marian Starrett. Neither man feels threatened at knowing \\"women's stuff\\" such as ladies' hat styles. Both understand the crucial importance of role models to kids. We know more of Rhett than of Shane, but we do know that Shane somehow let himself down in the past, as Rhett before joining the fight against the North.At a deep level, this story concerns free will and its consequences. It deals with the choices men make and how the con-sequences of these condition further choosing. Men are tested constantly, and must constantly choose the moral tenor of their response. A man who yields to cowardice, in the many ways that can be done, does irremediable violence to his soul. Once done, it can't be undone and he can't be who he was. Good men have always known this; it's why honor matters, projecting their sense of themselves as moral agents. What others think also matters, but secondarily to their self-opinion.This theme bears directly on another, that of heroes: what a hero looks like in real life and how he affects others. Schaefer doesn't want us to miss this, so he provides a stark contrast with Shane in the person of Stark Wilson, a man with whom Shane has a great deal in common. Wilson, too, is a leopard. But while Shane puts his leopard passion in the service of principle, Wilson indulges his passion. With jungle mentality, he lives for the kill. These men made different choices along the way, and those choices conditioned all that followed. One can imagine Shane degenerating morally into a Wilson, but cannot imagine Wilson, all moral decay and depravity, evolving into a Shane.Hence Schaefer, perhaps without realizing it, posits morality as evolutionarily selected. Yet neither Shane nor Wilson marry, and indeed one can't imagine either of them domesticated. They are curiously sexless. But Shane will have progeny in the persons of those who idolize and model on him. Wilson's blatant evil drives others away. He lives solely for himself, so much so that he has nothing to give anyone. His role in the world is to serve as a bad example.Six years before this book appeared, Ayn Rand brought out one of the great novels on the theme of heroes. The Fountainhead explicates the philosophical issues, but lacks the balance and realism of Shane. In Rand's pantheon, Shane would fit right in while Joe Starrett would barely merit mention. Her heroes never have children, the reason FOR civilization. Yet in everyday living we seldom encounter a Shane while running into Joe Starretts often. Starrett is the enduring hero who has much more to lose (hence to win) than Shane does. Shane is Michael Jordan, magnificent in action, stirring and memorable, the apotheosis of excellence, showing what's possible. But that level of excellence is physically beyond most of us. It's for admiring rather than emulating.The day-to-day heroes matter more. Joe Starrett needs Shane, but everyone else needs Joe Starrett. Shane knows this. His role is to step in as needed and then, work done, to move on. As he does in this interesting and most excellent short novel."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Today's thriller writers could take a lesson from Jack Schaeffer.

I used to play The Virginian on NBC television, for those of you who can't remember that far back. It's that time again, time to read Shane. I'm only into it up to chapter six, and already those old memories have flooded back, and I recall why I love this book so much. It is timeless, to use a perhaps overused word. It is nearly a flawless book, although for the first time I've noticed that a few of his time elements are incredible, such as, for example, the time it takes Marion to bake a pie in the book. But this is such a good book that things like this don't matter. The only Western author I can truly say I enjoy as much as Jack Shaefer is Kirby Jonas, a young author whose books I read on audio for Books In Motion, who can be located at Booksinmotion.com . But in my opinion Shane can never be topped nor matched by anyone. If you are a young person and feel forced into reading this book, I wish I could tell your teachers, &quot;Don't force Shane on anyone!&quot; This book should be read in your leisure time, when YOU want to, to be truly enjoyed. I hope you will give it an honest chance."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"OK, I am only in 8th grade, and I just finished it. Is it me, or is America getting more stupid by the second? This book requires a lot of your brain power. It implies a lot of things. But seriously people, how easy can understanding this be? To any intellegent people out there, this book will suit you fine. If you especially like historical fiction, and westerns also, you'll love this. I don't even like historical fiction, and I liked it! I hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"If you pressed me I could probably go on and on about Shane; in fact I'm sure that my remarks would end up longer than the book itself. But going along with Schaefer's advice that short is much better... I'll just say that Shane immediately became my favorite book when I read it in 6th grade. The copy that I read was my teacher's and I have been searching for one of my own for years... now a freshman in college, I finally have my personal edition of Shane as of a week ago. When I opened the cover, the story completely absorbed me just like in 6th grade and I couldn't put it down until I had finished reading the entire book. It was every bit as good as it was over six years ago. Thankyou Jack Schaefer for writting such an extraordinary book and for those of you who havn't read Shane, I strongly urge you to get out there and search for it. I am certain that it will not be in vain"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"&quot;I had to read it for school. and I hated it!&quot; seems to be the common theme, here. As a middle school teacher, I can vouch for the observable fact that many many children 1. hate to read (sad) and 2. hate to read - even more - what they are told to read. Shane, while now somewhat dated, was a classic in it's time, and often imitated. One direct imitation is the Clint Eastwood movie, &quot;Pale Rider&quot;, which serves as a wonderful comparison piece. As far as the young reviewers not being able to &quot;understand&quot; the novel &quot;Shane&quot;, one can only ask if TV has destroyed their brain cells, or if they can't understand how Shane and Marion resisted their temptation to be with each other at the expense of friend and husband Joe Starret. In today's age, such restraint must surely seem confusing. A fine, easy- to- read book."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I first read this book as a 6th grade reading assignment and found it spellbinding from start to finish. From the dynamic that first develops between Shane and the younger Starret to the final showdown, the insightful reader experiences an emotional euphoria that boxes the compass from joy to sadness. Unlike others that have read the book and seen the movie, however, I must admit that the movie, for me, captures the essence of the eternal struggle between good and evil as well, if not better, than the book. The majestic cinematography and musical score, combined with George Stevens skill at directing the film's superb cast make Shane the standard by which all westerns, past and present, should be measured."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I just finished reading Shane right now. I picked it up at school and I didn't stop reading until I finished, if that tells you anything about it. It's an extremely powerful book. I feel a bit miffed reading other reviews by kids saying it's a boring, stupid book about a stump. Maybe they just skimmed it because they had to and didn't let themselves get involved with it or something because if you let yourself, there's no way you couldn't get involved in it.Shane is a very powerfully written person. You grow to love him and it almost made me cry at his inner torment as he made himself face life head on, no matter how much it hurts, and while he does it teaching a little boy, too.I wish that there hadn't been any killing. Yet, somehow if everything had worked out &quot;happily ever after&quot; the message of the book would not have hit me so hard.This book teaches you so much about life and I can easily give it 5 shining stars.Don't skim the book like a fashion magazine. It's a deep book. Let yourself get lost in it."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I was turned onto this book in an online forum and decided to check it out. I was glad that I did. This book should rank as one of the great American classics. Set in 1889, it tells the story, from a coming-of-age boy's point of view, of how a stranger comes to town and changes everything. The story focuses on a rising conflict between homesteading farmers and ranchers, who see the farmers as encroaching on their lands. On the surface, this sounds like just another run-of-the mill Western. But this is not your typical Western at all. There are no gun fights (except at the very end) or chasing of Indians.I was captivated with the story from the very first few pages and I found it difficult to put the book down. This book - actually a long short story - is tightly written. Not a word is wasted. Though the book was short, I found myself slowing down and absorbing each word, as if I was savoring a fine slab of prime rib. This is not the sort of book you want to rush through.The story conveys some very powerful moral themes but you must read the book carefully to grasp them all. These moral themes are just as important today as they were on the American frontier 100 years ago. One is that it is far better to face danger and risk death than to run from it and not be able to live with yourself afterwards. Another is that pacifism only ensures your own destruction. You must be prepared to defend yourself against your adversaries. You cannot expect to get along with them or allow them to \\"buy you off.\\" For once they do, you have sold your soul to them.The underlying theme of the entire story however is the coming of age of the boy (who narrates this story) and the powerful life lessons that the stranger (Shane) provides to him.I know this book was made into a movie but I have never seen it. Having read the book, I have little desire to see the movie. No movie can possibly surpass the vivid images this book has left in my imagination of what life might have been like on the American frontier in the late 1800s.Lastly, despite the cover art and the poor placement of this book in bookstores (usually the teen section), this is not a \\"children's book.\\" It is very much an adult book. Of course, it can be read by teenagers, but it is much more challenging then Harry Potter and other fare associated with teens today."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"My father named me after the book's main character and perhaps that's what led me to write my own Western novel (&quot;Bounties&quot;). Of course, &quot;Shane&quot; can't be topped and is a unique Western in its own category. While I rely on humor to tell my stories, Jack Schaefer paints a picture of a man trying to escape his violent past and eventually has to accept who he is and that his destiny is something he can't escape. This book is not just a Western but a beautiful tale about growing up, boyhood dreams, and heroes that emerge from wide and unforgiving landscapes. Thanks to Schaefer for giving us a book that continues to inspire so many people."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"When this was made into a movie I was seeing lots of movies, but I never saw Alan Ladd in this. I must have thought it was just a Western and I ordinarily skipped them. Surely a mistake, I now know since after reading the book I surely want to see the movie (rated five stars and &quot;one of the best westerns ever made&quot; in my Video and Movie Guide). I was really caught up in this story, and my attention was held as surely as when I read &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;--also a book told from a young boy's view. I found Shane a poignant, thrilling, suspenseful and satisfying book, and it can be read in a very short time, since it is truly unlaydownable and only 214 pages."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is a great book I would recomend this to anybody who likes adventure and suspens or the old west. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"There is good and there is evil in this world. The good must be vigilant or else the barbarians will rule.

It can be seen as an allegory of our times"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is a brilliant psychological western about the true meaning of strength, integrity, and manhood. It's not just a shoot-'em-up; far from it, it is remarkably subtle for its genre. A great book for intelligent young adult males."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Of the hundreds of books I've read, this is the one that I've re-read the most. To say that this is a classic would not do it proper justice. In a short, compact narrative, Mr. Schaefer manages to convey an unforgettable sense of a time, a place, a man and his destiny in a most accurate, convincing fashion. The movie version, as good as it was, does not come anywhere close to the book, and this is due in part to Alan Ladd's portrayal. Again, Alan Ladd was a great actor, but he carried none of the implied menace that the book's character had. This is a great book for first-time readers, in its depiction of right, wrong and the price each carries. I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I just read Shane for a book report. I think it is a great book. It isn't very long so there can't be any boring parts. The fights were very realistic. Shane was a realistic person. Next to Louis L'Amour's Chick Bowdrie, Shane would be my favorite western character. The setting is like a real community trying to get to be a town in the early 1800's.-J.J. Hendrix"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"It would seem that Shane is too complex, too 'talky' or too deep for many Jr. High Schoolers assigned to read it. I sympathize, I too was forced to read horrid, dull books by teachers. Most notably Hemingway's 'The Old Man and the Sea' and 'Catcher In the Rye'. But then there's something about being *required* to read a book that almost invariably ruins it. Shane may indeed be to 'old' for the majority of the twelve to thirteen crowd. Wait five or ten years and try it again, you may like it - or you may still hate it like I still hate 'Old Man and the Sea' and 'Catcher In The Rye'. I personally read 'Shane' in college thanks to Arthur C. Clark. In his science fiction novel 'A Fall of Moondust' the passengers of a lunar tour bus are trapped in a sea of dust and entertain themselves while waiting for rescue by reading, among other things, 'Shane'. So I tried it and loved it, dispite being no big fan of the Western Genre. It is, quite simply, a wonderful character study."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I don't know how say it but soon as I read the first paragraph I was hooked. I don't like to read that much but this was different. I have seen movies of old westerns that were corny and stupid but this book has taken the old westerns to a different level of thought. I think that Jack Schaefer should of had more credit for the later books that he wrote."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is the quintessential morality play. Good triumphs; mindless evil is defeated by a supreme act of selfless heroism; love is affirmed. One needs not to mix up the book with Gorge Stevens superb movie.The two share many virtues: spare dialog, toughness and tenderness, a clear and simple (but never simplistic) vision. George Stevens should have won an Academy Award for the movie (do you remember what movie won the Best Picture award in 1952?). The movie is one of those rare, wonderful adaptations of a book that is both true to the original and brilliant in its own right.Schaeffer's book is deceptively simple. It records events through the eyes of Bobby (not Joey) Starrett. It is a pre-adolescent coming of age story from a more innocent time. Young Bobby sees his parents and his home threatened. A jaded and blas&eacute; stranger rides into the valley, and finds the family he never had. By (presumably) dying for them he lives on.None of this does it justice; you should read it for yourself (and then watch the movie)."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This book was in perfect condition when it arrived. It even came in earlier then expected.

I bought him the movie because sometimes it helps him understand the book a little better. We all enjoyed the movie as well."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"\\"Tell him no man need be ashamed of being beat by Shane.\\"And also tell him no man ever spoke like that. Some of Schaefer's writing is overly affected like that.

It was really hard to get into and when i did get into it finaly i saw that the book had too much in the lack of themes! Some readers might have liked it but for some reason it lingers on me! Sorry"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Apparently I was tainted by the classic 1952 film before I read this book. In the movie Alan Ladd plays the eponymous hero, and although the audience can see he represses whatever mysterious past he has, the film shows a reluctant gunfighter trying to fit into Homesteader life. The end of the film shows Shane facing down a &quot;stacked deck,&quot; finally revealing how deadly his nature is, as he kills the villains in the story. I love the tension between two personas, as well as the conflict between the Starrett band of homesteaders versus the Rikker cowboys.I saw the movie so many times, I felt it was time to take on the book. The easy reading kept me occupied just over an hour, and was so disappointing. I was expecting more psychological tension between the lifestyles, more insinuated romance between Shane and Starrett's wife; perhaps more build up to the end of the greatest Western ever filmed. Instead I read this ego-trip version of Shane who knows how good he is and doesn't bother with modesty. His stint as a farmer seems more like killing time between gunslinging. The subtle romance of the movie, seems to spawn from the book's adulterous &quot;could-have-been's&quot;. There is this cheezy scene our narrator catches between Shane and Starrett's wife about upholding honor over lust, and respect Joe Starrett as the proper husband. By the end of the book we already know how great Shane is, and expect him to win all the gunfights (though again, I did see the movie first).This book seems to have flat, one-dimensional characters. The plot of a drifting gunfighter landing into the hands of a family struggling against hired guns is still entertaining, but not enough to recommend the book. I recommend the movie, it's much more entertaining and date-compatible."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is the story of a kid named Bob Starret and his family, and Shane, and how that connection there helped changed everyone in their town's lives.The Starretts and the other local farmers had claimed their stakes of land, as the government deemed proper, but free-ranger Fletcher is losing his because of their 'squatting' and has been trying to get it back. Then, Shane enters, a mysterious old-gunman who has ended his shooting days, only to become stuck in the middle of this ensuing property battle that could bring him back to the steel.In my opinion, the book as a whole is not that bad, and thus I understand why some English teachers have their students read it. However, this is also not a fine piece of literature, as some make it out to be. Too much emphasis is put on Shane being almost a deity, with everything happening because of course, he is Shane. And the whole time I was reading this book, I felt that the over-use of description was merely compensating for the true, and often apparent lack of story.In the end, I believe the message gets across, but if you're looking for some good westerns, maybe not as heartfelt, then I'd recommend any of Louis Lamours books. Because when it comes to a story, Shane has the potential for emotion and excellent plot, only to fall short."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I'm reading this book right now, and I find it confusing. Maybe it's because it's not the type of book that I would like to read normally. I'm sure if I were into these kinds of novels, then I would enjoy it more than I am."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane: Dangerous and ConfusingIn the summer of 1889, a mysterious man named Shane rode into the Starrett's town in Wyoming. He was strange and dangerous however Joe and Marian Starrett took him in and gave him shelter. He began to work for them and was soon a farmhand, but he was not welcomed as warmly by some of the other townsfolk. They knew he had secrets, secrets of his past, and in a small town like that secrets weren't welcome. However Joe and his son Bob grow very close to Shane, and he and Joe develop an unbreakable relationship so close they seem like brothers. Things couldn't always be perfect and when someone from Shane's past rides into town, there wasn't enough room for both of them in town. Bob loves Shane like his dad, but he must grow up and make a decision for better or for worse.I'd say that in this book I was very similar to Joe Starret. He and Shane connected effortlessly, and that is how I am with other people. I make friends very easily and I have a couple of friends that I'm very close to. However I'm not a huge fan of secrets, and I'm very keen to know the answer to people's secrets. That is very similar to how Joe acts when Shane rides in, he is a puzzling man with an unknown past, and Joe wants to what his story is. I also love mystery, and this book was a western, but there was a dash mystery in the plot.If you read the book The Rangers Apprentice: The Ruins of Gorlan on its surface level, you would most likely see no comparison to Shane. However since I have thought about their plots and what the characters in each book meant, they are actually very similar. In both books there is a stranger in town, and there are two little boys that at first are curious of the strangers and develop a liking to that person. They quickly grow closer together and they work together through the thick and the thin over the story. Anybody that reads Shane and actually likes it will love The Rangers Apprentice: The Ruins of Gorlan. I just kept reading Shane and The Ruins of Gorlan kept popping into my head because of the parallelism between the two.Shane was a good book, but it wasn't one that I would read again. At some points the book was hard to follow; they would talk in old west terms and reference things that I didn't know about. There was very little action towards the very end, but until then there was almost no action. The narrator, Bob Starrett, shares his emotions a lot and I felt it was kind of a soap opera/western theme. Also in some parts he's best friends with Bob the Joe and so forth. There were some things that Bob thought about Shane that confused me, and his changing attitude and opinions also threw me off track. It is not a book I would recommend a friend to read."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Ok, I am kind of stuck. I am trying to find the real meaning of &quot;Shane&quot;, but with no avail.

Does it show that Joe and Shane work well together?) PLEASE help me! email me or something. I am in 8th Grade and I just got done with the book. help."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The critical edition of Shane contains the novel, which is good, and severl reveiws, which is so-so. The novel is fascinating to read, and it varies significantly from the movie screenplay. The interview statements by the author, Shaefer, and the reviews are of modest value.There are four or five interesting ideas, such as: westerns like Shane may reflect American foreign policy in the 50's and 60's, the western heroes like Shane are Christ (with six-gun) figures, sort of old testament-new testament hybrids, the author could not write such an innocent story again, because of his cynicism about what the \\"homesteaders\\" eventually did to America (his politics are unclear and he seems to blame Babbitt and not the oil barons), the novel first person is an older son looking back at his childhood with Shane instead of the movie's first person protagonist being the young boy, and, the other really good western is The Gunfighter. The obvious oedipal projection, which no reviewer but me has noted, is vivid in the film and only hinted at in the novel.It is too bad for those of us who have seen the movie first; we can only compare, and can't see the novel's images free of Alan Ladd and Jack Palance. The movie could have been better (maybe with Randloph Scott after intenstive acting lessons, or Palance instead of Ladd) since Shane was written as a super-humanly lethal and fearsome man. But, Ladd gives the right voice to the character, and with the special effects the movie works.Shane is \\"pure\\" western myth. (It was always a myth, there never were any such characters in the west except in 19th century newspapers and tabloids.) There are only white Nothern European Christian men and few wives and kids; no Mexicans, no African-Americans, no Native Americans, no dance hall girls, not even any cripples. But the novel and the movie try to answer the essential question raised in every good western: what price will you will pay for the most expensive of American luxuries: fairness, justice and honor.If you are fascinated by the film Shane, as I am, the critical edition of the novel is worth taking a look at."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I am new to the Western genre but I love it. I heard Shane is considered to be the best western novel ever. I just read it and although I understand that there is so much more to western stories than is displayed in this short book, but in the AMAZING way that this one was written, I can see why it is so beloved.I enjoy Louis Lamour and am looking forward to trying other authors who have received good reviews such as Elmer Kelton, Kirby Jonas,Glendon Swarthout and Mike Blakely among others. Shane is soo ENGAGING. Honestly, the best way to describe it is UNIQUE. Get it !!!!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I first heard of &quot;Shane&quot; in the 50's when Alan Ladd made a movie of the book. While I in general liked the movie (who doesn't like westerns), I didn't care for the casting of the supporting stars, in particular Brandon DeWilde, Jean Arthur, and Van Halen (?). I didn't read the book until the 70's and was totally blown away by way it was written. In my opinion, Schaefer dwarfs both L'Amour and Grey. The lead character shows that he is subject to all the strengths and weaknesses of all men, but unlike weaker men, he is able to overcome his weaknesses to ultimately achieve his ideals in the end. The final shootout was an excellant climax for the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone whether they like westerns or not."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I understand completely why kids assigned this reading for school did not enjoy it. Though told through a young boy's eyes, the writing style is mature and uses many descriptive paragraphs. Though sometimes impatient with description, I loved the story all the more for the details; but some pre-high-school kids will become bored.It's true that Bob's introspection is unusually discerning for his age. However, some remarks indicate that he could be writing this at a later time in his life, looking back on what happened with a wiser perspective. Either way, the author's depth of observation from an unlikely character can be forgiven as he elicits reader sympathy and understanding. Bob's view of his world may not always be reliable (especially when referring to his hero as \\"invincible\\"), but he is always endearing. Reading about Bob's nave, honest idolization of the mysterious gunman, I wanted Shane to stay, too. And looking beyond Bob's innocent perspective, the mature reader sees things that Bob does not, understanding his parents as well as Shane even better than he does himself.This work of art manages to stay short (120 pp.) without losing the substance and quality of much longer novels. Any shorter, and something would be missing. Any longer, and the added words or events would be unnecessary, lessening the \\"punch\\" that perfect length gives this tale. If all Westerns are as captivating as this jewel, maybe I'll try another one sometime!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is my all-time favorite western, as there is so much in this book if you just look deeper. Shane is not only a tough guy, but he is able to discuss fashions with the wife, and so he shows that being tough doesn't mean you can't be sensitive and observant. He wasn't afraid to show what being a man is all about."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"As some of the reader reviews indicate, _Shane_ will not satisfy you if all you want is wild, gun-slinging action, or if all you want is to find out Shane's mysterious past. These are superficial aspects of the story. If you want to enjoy it, you need to turn your focus elsewhere. You need to look deeper. Schaefer writes with such great economy and integration, there is meaning in every word. The book is not pointless, as some here (apparently high school students) have called it. It is simply wonderful (an evaluation other reviews here have already elaborated upon)."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is an inspiration to me. To those of you who are inspired by the heroic, I highly recommend this book. In Shane, Jack Schaefer portrays man as a clean, uplifted being who is capable of achieving great things."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"In skimming the reviews below, it appears most of the negative ones are from adolescents and/or semi-literate readers. &quot;Shane&quot; is a classic story, a nearly pure good-vs.-evil myth.It's interesting to compare the Shane of the novel with the portrayal by Alan Ladd. There are some marked differences, but both the book and movie versions seem appropriate to the overall mood of the story."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The movie was outstanding, , ,the book is ???What is greater than outstanding???Uuhhmm??

When the livelihood, and even the lives, of his friend and employer is endangered by an unscrupulous rancher, Shane sets out to right the wrongs, and he becomes a tragic hero. It's a suspenseful, emotional read, with all the cheesy melodrama one expects from a Western. If you ever only read one in your life, Shane should probably be it."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Did you like the movie &quot;The Man From Snowy River?&quot; If so, you owe it to yourself to buy and read SHANE, Jack Schaefer's first novel. As is so often the case, Hollywood's version of this beautifully written classic does not begin to capture the integrity of the characters in this book, nor the relationships which develop, nor the love and respect an &quot;ex-gunman-on-the-run&quot; engenders in a Wyoming sodbuster's family, and in any reader with a soul. This book is short, because it contains not one extra or unnecessary word. Every description -- from Shane's posture and dusty clothes as he rides up to a log farmhouse, in the shadow of the Grand Tetons, to the looks of unstated understanding which pass between a boy's father and a stranger who stays for supper, and then stays even longer to help a valley of farmers in trouble -- is poignantly clear and crisp, yet almost understated. Few Westerns have ever gained the degree of admiration that's been s! ! howered on SHANE, and justifiably so. After reading the paperback edition you may even be moved to buy, as I did more than 10 years ago, the &quot;collector's edition,&quot; also available through Amazon.com. And once you've read it, you may also find it makes a great gift ... for children of all ages!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is a good book.

You will like Shane, too."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I would recommend this book to someone else because it is very exciting and interesting. The characters were well constructed throughout the book and it had a lot of unusual twists to it. This book was very easy to read and it's a good book to read especially if you like western stories."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is a book that I have always heard about, but never bothered to read until this week. It's a story that seems familiar even though I have never read it, no doubt because it is a classic that has been emulated again and again. All too often when I pick up a classic, it ends up being a boring read or so out of date that its not worth picking it up again. Shane reads like a modern story even today, and its themes and language are as rich as ever.Things I liked about this book:* It's a dark book, with dark themes - not at all what I expected. Told from the perspective of a young boy, there is always a veneer of innocence on everything in Shane. Despite that, you will be aware of several dark undercurrents beneath the surface. Suspenseful and powerful.* One of the best hero books I have read.* Necessary violence explored in eye-opening ways.* Author has a gift for putting reader in the story.* Filled with symbolism and story, but still moves fast.Great read, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Jack Shaefer's western novel is a well-written and interesting tale of a gunman who learns something of himself when confronted with the problems of a pioneer family. The story is told by the son of that couple, so much is seen through his young eyes. There are minor differences from the famous 1953 film starring Alan Ladd as the title character, e.g., in the book he is dressed entirely in black, which would've labeled him as a bad guy in the Hollywood of the 50s. At 150 pages, it's a quick read, but none the less enjoyable."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"As soon as I finished reading the first page, I had to put the book down and reflect on how Jack Schaefer could convey so much with so little. Simply put, not a single word was wasted.Shane reads quickly which is it's only downfall (I wanted it to go on and on and on) but when you finish, you feel as though you have just returned from a very long trip back in time.A slow simmering tension (both violent and oddly sexual) builds between Shane (the gunslinger with a shady past) and the Starret family. An unexplored and unspoken relationship between Shane and Marian (Joe Starret's wife) offered me the most insight into my own expectations and desires.Though the story is told through the eyes of Bob a 10 year old boy, you get the feeling that there is so much there, so much that Bob simply does not understand. This tool utilized perfectly by Schaefer created a story that had many layers.All in all I will recommend Shane to anyone with an ear to listen."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"this story is of course a classic, one of the finest western novels ever written and is interesting as it is written from a young boys point of view of the adult world around him"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Spare, evocative writing by first-time author Schaefer accompanied by a selection of analytic articles give this edition depth.

I try to read what he reads so we can discuss it & I can see what he is getting out of his assignments. I got hooked on this book & ended up reading it straight through. It's a cute little story, but I think the best part is that it leaves so much unsaid that the reader gets to add his own impressions to the story. We know nothing about Shane but we appreciate his loyalty to the family and his kind and gentle way with Bob. It is implied that Shane has a \\"history\\" but what it is, is for us to decide. Even the ending is a bit unclear. I suppose it ends however we choose to believe. It may not go down as one of the classics but in my opinion the author was genius. It is probably one of the most well written books I have ever read. Even if it's not exactly my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Hello everybody out there. I'm one of those &quot;pre-high-school kids&quot; who read Shane in class. And, though I don't like to be cliche, I hated it.Somebody said before that this novel had little character development. I have to agree. Jack Schaefer is excellent at fight and appearance description, but our characters are left as empty clothes waiting to be filled. We know Shane is a tall, dark, and handsome gunslinger trying to escape his past, but we don't know what he's escaping from or anything else about him. And his character seems to change dramatically throughout the text. When he first arrives in the valley, Shane is hesitant to involve himself with anything, wanting only to stay at the Starrett's for a night. Joe persuades him to stay and work on his farm, and as time passes Shane gradually becomes more involved in the valley's affairs. I can see this happening. But Shane seems always quiet and, yes, still hesitant. I can't see Shane losing his cool in everyday life. This is supported by his actions throughout the book, especially by his tenderly wiping the blood from Chris's face after breaking his arm. But after Johnson's bringing the news of Wilson's arrival, Shane pushes past him saying roughly, &quot;You'll only ever be a farmer.&quot; I can't see Shane doing this.Another point my friends and I poke fun at is all the violence. Schaefer describes, in detail, each punch landed and each bone splintered. I can see how this adds to Shane's prowess in fights, but I find it overly descriptive. There is no point in, for example, telling us how Joe's shirt rips off his back and reveals bulging, rippling muscles. I find this unbelievable, unnecessary, and revolting.So to anyone out there, be you English teacher, avid book reader, or a Western fanatic, I advise you to stay away from Shane.Second thought--you Western fanatics might like it. *shrug*"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This book is about a guy named Shane who rides into Wyoming who is very mysterious.

I've recently read, Charles Portis', True Grit. With respect to the Western context you can see where Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars and High Plains Drifter came out of, though that has been as much attributed to Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest. And although I wanted to like this book as much as my vague memory of it suggested, I found it to be slow going, with it's unengaging prose style, exacerbated by the first person retrospection of the main character, which was too detailed to be convincing for a boy so young. A characteristic not unique to Jack Schaefer for this kind of book. Sure the story was good, heavily viewpointed, and moralistic, but that kind of thing is done better now, as in the Star Trek tie in books by the likes of L.A, Graf, and K.W. Jeter. It seems to me that Shane is a book of its time, which is unfortunately not this one, with respect to the younger audience it was originally intended for.For me it's the style of Shane more than anything else, that leaves me unenthusiastic. But it should please others."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I read this book few months ago this a book about a guy who is atough guy he is hard worker and strong he never tells any body about himself he just say &quot;call me shane&quot;. once he went to valley and he settle thier with Joe starret as a coworker than see what's next....."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane, by Jack SchaeferJack Schaefer writes a classic western tale of a gunfighter in the late 1800's moving through town and who gets attached to a rural ranch family, the Starretts. Mr. Schaffer really reaches the levels of Louis L'Amour and other outstanding writers of their time in the western genre. Shane helps out on his new friends land and at the same time deals with an increased emotional tension with the ranch owner's wife like the true professional that he is. This is similar to Clint Eastwood's character of Preacher in the always outstanding film, Pale Rider.The book goes into great detail of the tools of Shane's trade, his custom tuned Colt 1873 Single Action revolver chambered in .45 Colt. You can easily visualize the revolver from the well written description. His draw is fast as lightening and his instinctive honed aim is thoroughly true. A gunslinger that handles himself coolly when facing danger and blowing off taunts and attempts of those that have an interest in sparking violence... unless violence is the only cure for the towns ailment.Shane is read in many middle schools and even had a pretty good film based on it starring Alan Ladd. I read the book first prior to seeing the film back in middle school and so sadly the major issue I always had with the film is that it wrecks the image of Shane (only in that in the book he dressed more like a southern gambler and less like a frontiersman in buckskin), but at the same time casts a good actor to play the part. It is no surprise that this book was chosen for a film adaptation. A great story not overly drawn out and fast paced. A nice short read at 160 pages.For another great look at this book read the #1 2003 review by Jeffrey Leach here on Amazon. He really breaks it down well.If you like this book you are in luck because Jack Schaefer wrote other great westerns; like the one called First Blood... yes, the same title as the David Morrell book. What are the odds of two books with the same title written by good authors and both end up being great... truly awesome!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I'm having a really tough time writing a review for Shane.

The book was so influential on other westerns that any summary will now sound like a pile of clich&eacute;s: A mysterious drifter arrives in a settlement in 1890's Montana and becomes enmeshed in a fight between settles and the big rancher who craves their land. It would be an easy book to dismiss based on such a summary, but it would be a mistake.The book was very well written. This isn't so much a novel about a heroic drifter who arrives in town and saves the day. That is the spine of the story, but the focus on the book is on the effect Shane has on the Starrett family and the effects he would like them to have on him. Shane isn't just a cipher of a character. Though we never learn much about Shane's past, it is clear that he enjoys his time with the Starrett family and would like to be able to settle down to their way of living. I was reminded a bit of Unforgiven, as Shane is clearly a gunfighter who would like to escape that lifestyle but knows he will most likely be unable to.The Starretts felt real and it was nice to read about a truly functional family. Young Bob idolizes his father, Joe, a good man who is trying to make a go of his farm. Marion, the mother was believably portrayed. Through the course of the novel you can see that she is developing feelings for Shane, though nothing overt is ever stated in the novel. The only time it felt overly clunky would be when the mother and father would have discussions about how Shane affected their lives. I just couldn't see two people having conversations like that.Otherwise Jack Schafer does a very good job. The book is written from the point of view of Bob Starrett, a man reflecting back on this time in his childhood. The author does a very good job with Bob's narration. The way it is presented allows for Bob to discuss situations both as he saw them at the time and with the maturity he's gained since then.Overall, Shane was a very satisfying read. Quite a bit better than I bargained for."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I first read this book a couple of years ago, and remembering how beautiful it is, I wanted to read it again. I just finished reading it for the second time, and I am re-doing my review. (But I don't think I will ever read it again - it is too hard emotionally, even though I fully understand why what happened to Shane had to happen.)This is the most beautiful, delicate, sensual Western you will ever read. The book is about Shane. He is a mystique who rides into a Wyoming valley in the 1800's. He has an eery air about him that everybody seems to unspokenly respect. He is straight-to-the-point, sure, steady, confident; not cocky or unnecessarily arrogant or insecure. He is strong and practical, swift and quick.But this book isn't only about Shane. It is also about the people he impacts. He stops in at Joe Starrett's ranch and works for him. Joe and his wife, Marion, and son, Bob all love and respect Shane. Shane becomes a part of them; the little family feels Shane is indeed one of them. Sometimes it is the silence, the unspoken words, the body language, the air, the way things are carried, that speaks the most volumns. Shane and the little family understand each other, sometimes just by the silence. There is so much love in this book, it can literally be sliced with a steak knife.And the book isn't just about Shane and the people he impacts. To me, it goes beyond that into something personal. I love the West; I have been there as a child/teen. I've been to the mountains. This book reminded me of the summers I was there in the Wyoming and Colorado mountains (but this book is only Wyoming). I always felt a \\"belonging\\" to the West. It always felt like \\"home\\" to me. That fact made the book extra special to me.Joe Starrett loves and respects his wife and son. It is felt; the love drips off the pages. The mother loves her husband and Shane and little boy. I love it when the mother holds her little boy tight in her arms, plays games with him, and treats him with tender love and respect.This book is told through Bob's eye's. Bob \\"narrates\\" the story after he becomes a man, looking back at it as it happened when he was a small boy. The words and writing are so beautiful, breathtaking, and delicate. This author is amazingly talented.This book is set in Wyoming; settlers from out East coming West and homesteading. Bob's family is a homesteader. There is a greedy man, Fletcher, who wants all the land, and wants the homesteaders out. Will Joe Starrett, out of fear of being killed by Fletcher or his men, give in and give Fletcher his land? Will Shane allow it? Joe is worried about losing the place, but Marion is determined not to lose it. It is home to her. She doesn't want to go back out East, or anywhere else. She wants to stay in Wyoming. This is her home. Her home, her husband, and her little boy. She is a strong-willed woman, a good cook, a hard worker, an awesome mother and wife. I admire and love her.Shane is determined to allow Joe and Marion to keep their land, their home. Is he strong, swift, sharp, and courageous enough to protect them and their land from Fletcher?Shane gave Bob a piece of advice that needs to be given to all children/people: \\"It's up to you now. Go home to your mother and father. Grow strong and straight and take care of them. Both of them.\\" No matter what a person's situation is, whether you are stuck out in the WIld West, or the innter East city, if a person would take that advice, things would be a lot better for everybody. If kids would grow straight. If they would take care of the parents. That advice really touched me. Of course, it was coming from Shane, and look at his caliber.I think it is hard to read this book with totally dry eyes. And the ending is so sad, it was really hard for me (even though I had read the book before, and I knew how it was going to end). It was really tough for me. I can't say much about the ending, as to not spoil it, but I will say it was personal for me in another way too. I will not tell you what happened to Shane, but I will tell you that he reminded me of my best friend who died in Colorado. She is gone, but I can feel her presence, as if she is still here, still alive. It is usually like she has never died. I feel her and sense her in everything.Oh, this book is so beautiful and awesome and magnificent, and I'd better quit writing - I can't take it any longer. It is as beautiful and breathtaking as those Rocky mountains that look like a slice of heaven. 11-14-2011."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"the unforgettable novel of a boy's love and a gunman's struggle to escape his past."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"It is the summer of 1889, and young Robert McPherson Starrett (Bob) lives with his father Joe and mother Marian in a little valley near a small town in the Wyoming Territory. Up to the Starrett's farm rides a mysterious stranger all dressed in black. When asked his name, he simply says, \\"Call me Shane.\\" There's trouble in the valley. A rancher named Fletcher used to use the whole valley to raise cows, but then settlers moved in and established legal claims to various portions of the valley. Now Fletcher has a new contract to provide beef for the government and wants to be able to use the whole valley again. The farmers stand in his way.Shane decides to stay and work for Bob's dad, especially since Fletcher had run off another young man named Morley who was helping the Starretts. Shane helps to remove a huge tree stump that's been particularly stubborn and then builds an addition on the corral. And he works with Mr. Starrett in the fields. However, as autumn comes, the situation in the valley begins to heat up as Fletcher returns from signing his contract and brings a hired gun named Wilson to help intimidate the farmers. They goad one somewhat hot-headed farmer named Ernie Wright into some rash actions by which he gets shot to death. The other farmers are somewhat scared and don't know what to do, but Joe wants to stand up to Fletcher and Wilson. A couple of fights have already occurred between Shane and some of Fletcher's men. Is there anything that Shane can do to assist the Starretts and their friends?The 1953 film starring Alan Ladd that is based upon this book has become a classic Western movie, but I have never seen it. From what I had heard, I would never have imagined that the book would be considered to be for children, but according to the publishing history a \\"Juvenile edition\\" and an \\"Educational edition\\" have both been published. My conclusion is that while the tale is narrated by a young boy it is most likely not a book intended for youth. There is a fair amount of cursing, with the \\"h\\" and \\"d\\" words used somewhat frequently (once the \\"d\\" word is preceded by the name of God), and there is some profanity with the name of God used as an exclamation. Also some of the fighting and shooting scenes are detailed enough that they might be bothersome to sensitive youngsters. Otherwise, it is an interesting story that is probably quite typical of the modern \\"Western\\" genre."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"When my teacher first told us that we were going to be reading the book Shane i had never heard of it. Then when she said that it was a western it made me want to read it less. But once i started reading in i started to enjoy it. The further in the book the more I liked it. I think it is a very good book and that it should be read by all."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Not many western novels have been said to be a classic, but Shane is one of them Simmons 1). For not being from the West Jack Schaefer seems to have a commendable grasp on it (Tibbets 200). I believe Schaefer seems to have a deep understanding about the West and what went on in it. The selection of Wyoming for a setting also made the story relate to the West (Platt 1). Although Shane may not follow the traditional western fiction style, it has a different message, which is the fight between good and evil (Simmons 2). PS-Mr White is my favorite teacher in the world! And he really wants to give me the last day off!!!(PLEASE). MR.White...you are the coolest!! In this book Shane handles an ax, his fist, and gun with accuracy and thought, just as Schaefer handles his words (Platt 1). Because of this thoughtful writing, I think a variety of things in the book have a symbolic meaning, including the characters. Shane is a character that is hard to understand at first, but makes the story more interesting (Simmons 2). He represents what is done to prevent the bad things from happening (Platt 2). He keeps Starrett away from the having confrontation with the homesteaders by handling the conflicts himself. He may seem simple but he is actually a complex character (Simmons 3). Starrett represents what is good and right about America (Platt 2). He is loving and willing to fight for his family safety. The story is more entertaining to me knowing that there is a larger meaning. I believe Shane should not be read as a simple western story. It insists a deep response from the people who read it (Simmons 1). Although there is a lot of symbolism throughout the book, there is one main underlying theme (Simmons 2). I think that it is the theme that out of all of the corrupt things in the world eventually something good will come along. Shane has a universal meaning behind it and can be related to the entire world (Simmons 1). The struggle for peace is the fight for the farmers to grow and the homesteaders to decrease (Platt 1). Just as in the world we strive for good to prevail and evil to lessen. Shane is the type of book that will be read from generation to generation (Simmons 3) because of it's universality and grasp on the West. His writing was so well and honored in 1985 by the Western Writers of America because of his great understanding to the myth of the west (Tibbets 200). I liked reading a western that did not follow the traditional method but understood the concept of a western. PS-Mr. White is my favorite teacher and he wants to give me the last day off for this awesome paper!(PLEASE)"},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Grail","review":"Andrew Sinclair obviously knows his material and I found the book excellenty researched with tons of facts, names and dates. it did tend to drag sometimes but never for any long period of time. My only problem with the book is that the author tends to dismiss some alternative theories a little too easily."},{"Title":"SEAL MORNING.","review":"I came across Seal Morning many years ago, even then I had it with me for a long time before I read it. I found it by fate, when I was going through old unused lockers in my old school. I didn't know why I kept it but after DEFINITELY more than 2 yrs then was I compelled to read it. It is a book that brought joy &amp; sadness all the same. It appeals to all of us who love animals. The way it was written without any chronological contraint, is refreshing. It comes across as an account, or maybe as a documentation but rarely is it anonymous as there're many poignant moments Rowena shares with us. Her animals were her friends &amp; she was theirs, &amp; in the solitude of the hills this couldn't be more true !!"},{"Title":"SEAL MORNING.","review":"I loved this book! It gives the reader a wonderful taste of the wilds of Scotland and of &quot;croft life.&quot; I like to imagine living like this. Though this book tends to jump around, that makes it more interesting.

I read it many years ago and found I could order it. And I did. This is a story of moving back to nature,back to the earth. Rowena Farre and her Aunt Miriam moved from near London to a small croft located in Sutherland, Scotland. Their closest neighbor is nine miles away. The mail is delivered every two weeks. The only people the pair come into contact are an elderly, single man living by himself, an older couple, plus the mailman. But there are plenty of animals. The retired school teacher and the young girl loved animals. The birds loved Miriam since she was a small child. From her early childhood, birds flocked around her, recognizing her as a friend. Rowena was ten years old when she moved to Sutherland. She did her schoolwork at the croft, and seemed to do quite well. She was seventeen when she left. The winters in Sutherland are long and cold; during winter most of the day is dark. But summers are nice, but short. The pair live on what they can grow, can, preserve much like American pioneers. They made do. Every two weeks they went to the store for a large amount of groceries. They had two goats to provide milk, a pony to pull the little cart, two squirrels, a rat, two otters and Rowen's favorite, Lora, her seal, who was the best pet and friend Rowena would ever have. There were other animals who came to, then left the croft.Rowena begins studying animals, their likes and dislikes, their abilities. Lora is very musical. Miriam supported herself by painting and decorating wooden bowls and plates. The unadorned dishware was shipped in, Miriam painted and decorated them, and sent them south to be sold. Rowena's father, who lived in India, sent Miriam money for Rowena's support. In both cases, both could live on what they were given, but it seems a strange way to live, especially in an area that is treeless, bleak, cold, unihabited, dark. Both loved this lifestyle and stayed in Sutherland for seven years. In part of the book, Rowena takes a walking trip across the land. She carried meager provisions. But then, both lived on not much and different food.Limited diets, but healthy. Parafin lamps were not turned on until later in the long dark nights. During winter, the two stayed in bed until nine thirty, then went to bed at nine o'clock.There is a lake on the property, Rowena loves to row her boat, Lora and the otters love to swim. Rowena and Miriam would have picnics. Once in a long while people would visit the croft.During the winter, there is much winter, the birds would roost in bird houses provided by the pair. There is always food left for them. Miriam would take those that were sick from the cold and doctor them much like a veteranian.Rowena had a different childhood than most children. Interesting book."},{"Title":"SEAL MORNING.","review":"This is a wonderful read for anyone and at any age.

My granpa was so proud of the man that took his own family and life by surprise, deciding to leave everything to fight for things he believed in. I used to dream of this courageous man who left a small town and a poor family in the Italian countryside to fight the Mexican civil war without blinking. I re-lived his life through my grandfather's words, his travels through Eastern Europe in an era when no one dared to do so, marrying a Polish Countess and taking her along to Asia; i went through a rollercoaster of emotions imagining trains blowing up, real james bond type action, a glamourous life and such an un-glamourous death. I read the letters Amleto Vespa wrote his family back in Italy, his fear of being killed without seeing his loved ones. My great grand uncle lived his to the fullest and travelled distances to realize whatever his dreams might have been.

It is by no means a complete guide but has some of the more popular areas to hike, some focusing around the Tufenkian hotels (Jeffery is the nephew of the famous carpet producer James Tufankian).

Come to Armenia and bring this guide-book with you.Hiking in Armenia is an adventure. Eco-tourism is new and the land and mountains are still untouched. The Adventure Armenia guidebook is a perfect way to explore and experience a way of life that is vanishing in many parts of the world. About the book: I have found both the directions and options (once on the hike) incredibly accurate. I tested the book out five weeks ago on a hike to Mt. Hattis. We found our destination with no difficulty, had an interesting chat with a old woman at the shrine (start of the hike), and found ourselves in good company with shepherds and their flocks of sheep and goats. The shepherds were curious about us and often stopped us to ask what time it was (more for conversation, of course). We had spectacular views of Mt. Ararat and Mt. Aragats and were the only people on the mountain (other than the shepherds). The book itself is light-weight and provides one with plenty of pictures, recommendations, and practical advice about Armenia and getting around in Armenia.I would highly recommend it to anyone coming to Armenia or living in Armenia that would like to see more of the country and experience first-hand the beauty of the country and its ancient sites."},{"Title":"Cotton comes to Harlem (A Dell book)","review":"I wondered if the book could be as wonderful as the movie. Often, it's the other way 'round, but in this case, the movie featured an unforgettable and hilariously heart-warming, if not gut-busting cameo appearance by Redd Foxx as \\"Uncle Bud\\". There was also that fabulous Galt McDermot sound track (buy it!), and the whole existential bit of being one of the first -- and best -- flicks of its genre.So, after hearing the soundtrack online recently; purchasing it; and then ordering the video from the public library, I wondered, \\"will the book, by Chester Himes (a Clevelander, by the way) be equally nifty? Will it be worth reading in its own right?\\"It certainly is!Chester Himes is an accomplished and talented writer who developed his authentic style and abilities by a means every bit as ingenious as Hunter Thompson's retyping of Hemingway's \\"All Quiet On The Western Front;\\" or Kerouac's sticking together a 120 foot tracing paper scroll upon which to type his stream-of-consciousness style novel, \\"On The Road.\\"In Chester Himes' case, while serving time for armed robbery, he started writing for publication as a way to earn respect from the guards and avoid violence. It not only worked, but it helped Himes develop into an authentic, fascinating, and very readable author who's style is of a type you'll rarely find among people with advanced degrees or gigs as critics on the staffs of notable literary publications.\\"Cotton Comes to Harlem\\" offers a spirited, spunky, and gamey look at life in Harlem in the 60s, tying together a plot filled with realistically-depicted Harlemites from all walks of life, including the two protagonist black detectives, Coffin Ed and Grave Digger. Read a Himes bio or two online if you must; and whether or not you've seen and enjoyed the 1970 movie, you'll probably relish this book."},{"Title":"Cotton comes to Harlem (A Dell book)","review":"I picked this book up on a whim at a local library and tossed it in a bag filled with other 'light' summer reading. I had no expectations for the book, other than vaguely knowing that Himes was an African-American crime writer. About two paragraphs into the first chapter, I realized this was something special -- a detour into '50s/'60s-era Harlem that is sly, ribald and pulsing with life. I read it in every spare minute I had over 1 1/2 days and at the end, I knew I wanted to read more Himes. It's funny, dark, erotic, skanky -- not at all perfectly crafted (a few scenes are over the top), but that is part of its charm. This is a very human book and you feel the very real, human personality of its author, who sometimes can't help indulging in parody to make some scathing points about racism.How can you a resist a book one of whose opening scenes features two con men cutting out the back of a \\"church lady's\\" Sunday dress & black undies while she's praying, to get at the money belt wedged under her gut?Agatha Christie this ain't."},{"Title":"Cotton comes to Harlem (A Dell book)","review":"Chester B. Himes wrote a series of \\"Hard Boiled\\" detective novels set in Harlem during the the 1950's and 60's. His two main protagonists were \\"Coffin Ed\\" Johnson and \\"Grave Digger\\" Jones, a couple of black police detectives operating in the seedy underworld of Harlem and New York City. Himes himself had served time for armed robbery in Ohio. While in prison he first read the works of Dashiell Hammet(\\"The Maltese Falcon\\",\\"The Thin Man\\",etc.)and decided that he could write similar fiction set in Harlem's vibrant African-American culture. He moved to France after his prison release and then began to write (in French!) his own brand of mysteries set in the New York City section that had become world famous for it's culture, nightlife and intellectual renaissance. The first of these mysteries was \\"A Rage in Harlem\\"(first published in French as \\"For Love of Imabelle\\" in 1959). Coffin Ed and Grave Digger were only minor characters in this first novel, but by the time of the 5th novel \\"Cotton Comes to Harlem\\" they were the stars of the series.In \\"Cotton...\\" a ex con named Deke O'Hara scams $87,000 from a group of families who want to go to Africa to start a new life free from segregation and prejudice. Before O'Hara can abscond with the money a group of white gunmen steal it in the middle of the \\"Back to Africa\\" rally O'Hara is hosting and then escape. All this takes place in the first few pages, and the action only steps up the pace from that point on. Cotton Ed and Grave Digger are assigned to the case, and their brand of brutal, violent police work may not be always legal, but they have their own code of honor, which demands that they do all in their power to see to it that the families get their money back, as in most of the cases it amounts to their life savings. Through a maze of deceit and treachery filled with white supremacists, voluptuous women, scam artists, underworld informants, and real to life street people the two cops thread their way with both violence and guile. I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say that Himes delivers.The book was made into a movie in 1970 which played up the humorous aspects of the book. While there is much mordant and cynical humor in Himes' writing, the book is much more than that, and deserves a place in the \\"Hard Boiled Detective\\" Hall of Fame. If you like this one I would recommend Himes' other works, especially \\"The Real Cool Killers\\".A definite 5 stars."},{"Title":"Cotton comes to Harlem (A Dell book)","review":"This book blew me away. If you like Harlem this book is for you. Read them all. I'm on my 5th book by Mr.Himes."},{"Title":"Cotton comes to Harlem (A Dell book)","review":"More good fun from Chester Himes. On the plus side, he finally includes some entertaining sex. On the other hand, one of the main bad guys here (the \\"Colonel\\") is particularly flat and unbelievable. Also, as usual, the end is much less satisfying than the ride to get there."},{"Title":"Cotton comes to Harlem (A Dell book)","review":"... The book doesn't concern Bible Flowers. It's about the efforts of two black detectives, \\"Grave Digger\\" Jones and \\"Coffin Ed\\" Johnson, to recover $87,000 in money stolen from a con-man/storefront preacher in 1960s Harlem. Along the way, Grave Digger and Coffin Ed encounter a few murders, a southern colonel, and a 50-pound bale of cotton.Raymond Chandler wrote that detectives must walk the mean streets, but they must not themselves be mean. Well, Grave Digger and Coffin Ed walk the mean streets just fine, but the \\"not being mean\\" part gives them trouble; they doubt the feasibility of solving a case without, say, slapping around a few witnesses or firing a few shots into a crowd. Despite the detectives' unhesitating brutality, this novel compares well to the best of Raymond Chandler and Robert B. Parker. This is due not only to the spot-on dialogue and the stark, vivid character depictions, but also the detectives' uncompromising determination to bring justice to Harlem. The plot is better, i.e., less predictable, than any of Parker's, and Himes's depiction of 1960s Harlem is so bizarre, yet compelling, that it invites comparison to Carl Hiassen's Florida rather than Chandler's LA. Add to this Himes's unique, excruciatingly honest depiction of race relations in the 1960s, and you have one of the best detective novels I have read in years...."},{"Title":"Cotton comes to Harlem (A Dell book)","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I genuinely admire the works of Chester Himes.

I had been paying more attention to JPII as his body began to fail. I thought JP II, during the many audiences he had granted, was struggling to make it throughout many (not all) of these meetings ; but he also appeared to have this aura of total peace and I could see his lips continuing to move after he had met this dignatary or that one. After reading his book (and several others) I learned that his life was a constant prayer with God. This news gave me hope, maybe I haven't lost my faith, I carried on a regular conversation with God all the time! JP II has helped me feel better about the direction my thoughts and feelings were heading...he gave me some of His Peace. I don't remember which verse states, \\"Peace, not the peace of this world, but the PEACE I give you.\\"So strongly did I feel the words of JP II, that I let go of several issues that were draining my limited energy, taking time from the people I love, and left me feeling exhusted all the time. I was able to give these issues to God. Some of the issues were over 30yrs old, some were less than a year. Each time I happen to look to my bedside table with this book sitting on top of a few other books I am using together to re-learn what I truly do know, I see this smile in his eyes (it's a really small twinkle) and I feel that both Pope John Paul II and God nodding to each other as if God was to say, \\"I told you that you would continue your good works through death\\" and JP II saying ,\\"yes Lord and another is coming right behind her.\\"I definitely \\"got\\" quite a bit out of this book, even as small as it is...we all should sit silently and just listen sometime, because HE is talking back. Pope John Paul II taught me this, in this small book of occasional twisting sentences and powerful paragraphs.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope that this book might touch you as it has me."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"It's nice to read the words of Pope John Paul II, because it's a nice way to view his own life.

It's also nice to read what all he went through during his priesthood."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"the Pope writes about the many people who saved him from death during the Nazi occupation of Poland. he saw God's hand in this preserving him for a greater priestly role. he also is full of gratitude to the many people who helped him along the way.what seems to be missing from this work is a commitment to working towards a world of peace, in which the horrors of the Nazi era will not be repeated. the Pope has an almost ho hum attitude: God saved him from the nightmare, now he must get on with his priestly duties. it seems almost like a kind of denial.perhaps the psychological scars he bears were so great that he could not confront the beast head on but rather escaped into the solace of the spiritual fantasy land of the Vatican. who can know?recently a priest on EWTN spoke of the abuse of Catholic clergy more comfortable on the golf course than in church. the Pope writes here that all priests take a vow of chastity, poverty, and obedience, no matter what order they are in. If that is true, how do Catholic priests manage to spend time on golf courses? Do they actually own their own sets of clubs? I know that whenever I hear a Protestant pastor mention the latest churchwide golf event, I kind of wince. Did Jesus say take up your wooden clubs and follow me?also, I have been reading a book about Catholic radical activists in the 1960s, called Catholic Radicalism - Hardcover (1970) by Gray, Francine du Plessix. It profiles Emmaus House, the Berrigans, and Ivan Illich. It also mentions Dorothy Day.While I have heard Dorothy Day mentioned by people like Scott Hahn and EWTN, they never inform us that she frequently was imprisoned for acts of civil disobedience. I never knew this at all!Why and how did Catholicism (and religion in general in the US ) become so complacent and reactionary? Is it a result of the hysteria generated by 9-11, or by the economic woes that have descended upon so many people, or both?It is both amazing and sad to me that the spirit of social ferment seems to have completely vanished from the vision of American Christianity. and nothing epitomizes this kind of disturbing reactionary complacency than the Vatican hierarchy, which the Pope's book does not even begin to address."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"'Gift and Mystery' is indeed an affectionate gift from Pope John Paul II to all those who pursue a priestly vocation. It is the story of his own priestly call which is a Divine gift as well as a great mystery. On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of his priestly ordination, the Pope reflects on his own growth in his vocation to priesthood and his ministry as 'a shepherd of God's mysteries'. We follow him through his college studies, his job in the stone quarry, his love for the theater and his theological studies to his ordination to priesthood. His deep faith and reliance on God, his gratefulness and kindness towards others, his devotion and dedication to the priestly commitment are all laid out before us with clarity and love. As he himself says, what is related here belongs to his &quot;deepest being&quot; and &quot;innermost experience&quot;. Every priest and seminarian should read this and draw energy and inspiration from this 'Holy Father' and spiritual giant of our day."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"The image of JPII is so prevalent in this world that he, like Mao or the Statue of Liberty, would be ever in danger of becoming a hollow icon. But it is JP's expressions of both his humanity and his humility, in works such as this book, that saves this man from becoming a mere all-pervasive image. Reading this book is like taking Communion with him. Filled with precise recollections of special people and places, we see how JP was affected by Krakow and the war, and begin to see what might be a very modern, human expression of &quot;survivor's guilt&quot; emerge in him in the postwar years. We also see special glimpses of the manifestations of his faith in the course of simple acknowledgements. We learn from whom he learned his famous &quot;ground-kissing&quot; gesture, for which he has become especially known. We read of how important it was for him to say his first Mass in a place filled with historical significance for Poland. We learn of a wild, mysterious man of 19th century Poland and JPII's great respect for him. He is gracious and generous in his acknowledgements to everyone who has helped to set him on his path to a priestly vocation. An unusual but very touching addition to this book is the appended Litany of Jesus Christ, Priest &amp; Victim. It is a Litany with which I was not familiar, but which seems especially appropriate for the incantations of 20th century priests of Poland. Catholicism is universal, but JPII always finds a way to make it an individual, internalized spirituality, and then takes the astounding creation of the individual being and renders it once again meek before God. JP walks a path that celebrates the unbelievably good grace God has given to us in life and the unattainable degree of thanks we should return to God and Christ in return for the favor of living."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"As you might expect from such a great person, the Pope's book provides few insights into the Pope himself. He does show how our own lives can influence others, especially in a cumulative way, as the he tells of all of those who influenced his entering the priesthood. He cites the religiosity of his father; the holiness of Jan Tyranowski; the writings of St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila, and St. Louis Marie de Montfort; the devotions in his parish, to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and of the brown scapular. The reader can't help but wonder if there is a link between the lack of devotions today and the lack of vocations today.A priest's life is challenging. He must be attentive and sympathetic; critical and watchful with regard to historical developments; a giver of Christ; a spiritual father -- especially in the Confessional; holy; constantly training, studying and updating; promoting the family; defending mankind; in dialog with the youth; in dialog with the culture; intellectual and scholarly; and living the Gospel.But a priest's life is most rewarding. The priest is \\"a steward of the mysteries of God.\\" An essential part of his mission is fulfilled in the Confessional. The priest is an essential being in the only suitable offering that man can make to God, the offering of God-made-man, an offering made at every Mass. The priest is so united to Christ at Mass that he is \\"in the person of Christ.\\" What a beautiful reflection on the Mass is offered by the Pope!The challenge of the priesthood seems overwhelming. It would be without God. It is \\"a mystery of divine election.\\"Every parent of a potential priest should read this book."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"Pope John Paul II examines the course of his life from a war-torn Poland, to the halls of The Vatican. At the end of the book, the reader is sure to realize that most of the time, the greatest gifts in our lives start off as mysteries. We start off in the fog, and as we live, we begin to see the path unfold in front of us."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"This vocation story of Pope John Paul II is a truly inspiring tale of how he came to his decision of answering his vocation to the Priesthood. He shares how the different factors of his life and different people in his life helped prepare him for the Priesthood, and benefit his spiritual life. This is a great book for those, such as myself, who aspire the Priesthood."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"The words of Pope John Paul II have always captivated me, however, this particular book is very touching because we see first hand his humbleness for the people that shaped him into the priest he became. A man of such global stature writes thoughtfully about the individuals that helped lead him into the priesthood, protect him from the Nazis, and urge his following of Christ. This is a great read for Christians and non-Christians, or even students that are doing a report. John Paul was one of the most inspiring human beings to ever live, and continues to inspire even after his death. His books and thoughts are highly reccommended...it helps any reader to better understand this complex and delicate soul."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"Pope John Paul II will be regarded by history as one of the great Popes in the modern history of the Church. This book is a translation of his \\"testimony to his priestly vocation\\" on the occasion of the golden jubilee of this ordination as a priest in Poland in 1946. To me, this was a powerful testimony of the walk of faith of a man who has left a lasting and postive imprint on the face of our Church.I was most moved by the influence of his father that how his deeds, not his words affected him. As a father of two young children myself, this anecdote from the Pope certainly will influence further and provide more incentive to raise my daughters in the faith and that through my actions (prayer and striving to live a holy life), I can make the same impression on my children as John Paul's father had on him.This also has the history of John Paul's religious education and how the Second World War affected his education and shaped it. The man we knew as Pope John Paul II was certainly shaped by those events. They apparently made him a better man.Pope John Paul the Second is an inspiration to millions around the world, both to Catholics like myself as well as to non-Catholics. The combination of wisdom, intellect and faith possesed by the late Pope is matched by few in the history of the world. This work shows just a small portion of all three. While it is a pretty easy read, it is most certainly worthwhile. Reading about the great men of the faith is as vital to the ongoing catechizing process that all adult Catholics must constantly engage in to grow in knowledge of the faith."},{"Title":"Gift and Mystery","review":"This book serves as a companion to Rise Let us be on Our Way, but it also stands quite well on its own.

They're really well done, though I've never listened to any other audio production of a novel to know what to judge it against. Sometimes the tapes have unintentionally cheesy moments, but you laugh so hard it actually makes the tape more worth it.My favorite moment is in tape 1 of \\"the Fellowship of the Ring\\" where the once menacing Ring Wraith talks to Ham Gamgee about whether Frodo is \\"here\\". The whole conversations funny but the end where the Ring Wraith loses every hint of mysteriousness and darkness by very politely asking Ham \\"Can you take a message?\\" leaves me rolling every time.P.S.-To people only familiar with the films, here's my biggest beef with them. Frodo does NOT, I repeat, does NOT tackle Gollum over the edge of Mt. Doom! Anyone who believes so, and to my chagrin that seems to be nearly everybody, (thanks to Peter Jackson-who didn't think Tolkien's climax was good enough), needs to read up."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Dramatization (12 Audio Cassettes-Gift Boxed Edition)","review":"This drama comes on twelve audio tapes and lasts about twelve hours. It was produced by The Mind's Eye and comes in a nicely carved wooden box. The narration has been for the most part nicely performed. Many of the voices have American accents, which sound rather out of place in the British speech of the book. The acting has generally been well-done, but there are a good many corny portions. Some of the voices, such as Samwise Gamgee for example, sound cartoonish. Frodo sounds like an ordinary grown man who could live anywhere in the USA, but his faithful friend and servant Sam sounds like a cartoon figure who sucked a couple of helium balloons before acting. Merry and Pippin have been done well. They have British accents and cartoonish voices. Sauron sounds absolutely terrible. The actor sounds like he is talking while breathing in and trying to become a baritone, which he is obviously not. Treebeard and the Ents, although rather corny, do a great job. Tom Bombadill is, as is the case in the book, quite jolly and merry, but he puts on a VERY, VEEEEEEEERRY corny act. Goldberry can't sing. The Elves have human voices, although they all do a nice job. Galadriel has a soft voice, but she seems to be reading from a script rather than sounding natural. The hobbits have diverse voices. Hamfast Gamgee the Gaffer has a quaky, quavering voice. Some hobbits have voices like Bugs Bunny and his pals. Some have accented human voices. Saruman does NOT have the regal, low voice that he is supposed to have. Christopher Lee would have been a far better choice. However, there are many great actors. Aragorn, Gandalf, Th&eacute;oden, &Eacute;omir, Denethor, Bilbo, Gimli and Legolas all do a nice job. Gimli has a somewhat deep and gruff voice. Gollum or Sm&eacute;agol is something altogether different. The actor who plays him does a nice job, but his voice sounds just a tad too human. He sometimes outdoes his own voice ability through having to scream, hiss and weep so much. The music is Classical in nature. The main problem lies in the fact that there was little music produced. It was cut and pasted all over the place. I guess there might be a half hour to an hour of music all told. Because of this there is very little theme development unlike in the BBC dramatization. This is rather disconcerting for those who like a good sound track with lots of strong thematic development and emphasis. Many of the sounds have been used over and over and over again. The same battle cries are heard at Helm's Deep, Rohan, and Minas Tirith. The same Orcs must have been at all the battles too because the same sounds of laughter and yelling are heard in most of the battle scenes. This also applies to natural sounds. The same sounds of birds are used in numerous places. I don't know if this is the case for all the tapes, but some of mine have little background noises and tone distortions that are not easily noticeable but that can get annoying, so that's something to beware of. Some of the names and places have been mispronounced. I understand that many of them are difficult to get out, but there is a specific way of saying them. The main problem with this set is that it has been over-abridged. The full-length unabridged reading of the LOTR, which I would also highly recommend, spans over forty cassettes, but this is only twelve. Tolkien wrote in extreme detail, all but describing every rock and tree and feature of the world he imagined. Only the most important details have been kept. Many scenes that are not critical but that sure do help have been deleted, which causes problems. Sometimes things happen that were deleted but later are referred to. For someone such as I who has read the trilogy many times over and knows exactly what's going on this is not a problem, but someone who knows little or nothing of the events chronicled in the books may have some difficulty in figuring out what's going on. Despite its drawbacks, it is a wonderful performance in a case that would look splendid on anyone's shelf. It is a bit pricy, but it is worth it. It has brought me lots of listening pleasure and helped me to get through many tough research papers. I would recommend it to those who don't mind a mixture of complete corniness and wonderful battle scenes."},{"Title":"Semio Physics: A Sketch","review":"The title of this book obviously has its origins in &quot;semiotics&quot;, a school of philosophy and linguistics of French origin, and the author, being French himself, is clearly influenced by this school (although in this book no admission to this is made). He does however discuss why he chose the name &quot;semiophysics&quot;: namely to seek out &quot;significant forms&quot;, and to build a &quot;general theory of intelligibility&quot;. The author attempts to show in the book that there are only certain elements of reality that really make sense and only these can be used as a basis for a meaningful linguistic description. Thus one must find &quot;stable elements&quot; or &quot;salient forms&quot; which the author contends have the shape of balls, and interact like living beings. Mathematically speaking, the &quot;balls&quot; are bounded closed sets of maximum dimension (three in this case). There are then &quot;pregnances&quot; which propagate from one salient form to another. The form can then change its state, and can re-emit the pregnance, the latter of which may or may not be changed in the process. The author endeavors to combine this approach with what he had discovered in the works of Aristotle.Those readers who know of the author's work in mathematics, particularly in differential topology, may perhaps be surprised by the content of this book. There are some interesting concepts elucidated in it, but as a whole the wording and argumentation are rather difficult to follow. Catastrophe theory, a theory developed by the author in the 1960s, is used here in an attempted justification of the Aristotelian notion of &quot;continuity&quot;. Thus the book could be viewed as an interpretation of Aristotle from the viewpoint of catastrophe theory. The concept of continuity is primordial for the author, for he believes that discontinuity, which is modeled by the formalism of catastrophe theory, requires continuity for its definition. Most interestingly though, the author holds that all epistemology must be &quot;genetic&quot;, for it must, in his words, take into account the the effect of evolutionary alterations that humans have been subjected to for many millenia. But he still presupposes, and says so explicitly, the Euclidean nature of space-time, asserting that the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry and general relativity are irrelevant to the problems which he is going to discuss. These discoveries, he says, belong to the &quot;ontological region&quot;, and lie outside the cognitive activity of ancient man. The goal of the book is to take concepts from the &quot;exact&quot; sciences, such as the notion of a field in physics, phase transitions (implying discontinuities), and the notion of individuality. These notions are then extended to abstract spaces of a semantic character (this move clearly overlapping what is done in semiotics). Chapter 8 of the book, entitled &quot;Aristotelian Perspectives in Language Theory&quot; is another example of the influence of semiotics on the author's project.There are some discussions in the book that reflect the time of publication. For instance, the author speaks of the replacing of a point by a small oscillator that duplicates itself, and remarks that this concept may be useful from a quantum mechanical standpoint. But string theories were definitely around at the time of publication, and the replacing of point particles by strings that oscillate, and are created and destroyed, is an example of what the author is asserting (but does not elaborate on in any detail). Also, the catastrophe theory of the author was supposed to model the (discontinuous) processes of cell division, or &quot;morphogenesis&quot;. He remarks, interestingly, that &quot;not much is known about the internal structure of the cytoplasm&quot;, and so &quot;any attempt at symbolizing cellular dynamics can only be speculation&quot;. But since the time of publication of this book, the mathematical modeling of cellular dynamics has really taken off, and there is now a large group of researchers that are attempting to create a comprehensive mathematical model of the cell. Most of these developments do not involve catastrophe theory, no doubt because of its qualitative emphasis.Thus as a whole the book is highly speculative and pre-scientific. It might be difficult to appreciate by the general scientific crowd, for one must have a background in both catastrophe theory and Aristotelian philosophy in order to follow it. My opinion is that the current emphasis on quantitative mathematical modeling in all of the areas that the author discusses will continue to be the dominant one as we move further into the 21st century. All of this effort requires meticulous validation and experimentation, especially in the medical and biological areas. The truth of these efforts will thus be defined by the success they have on human health, and, with the exception of problems in medical ethics, &quot;philosophical foundations&quot; will take a back seat. Science does not need such a foundation."},{"Title":"The Laws of Cool: Knowledge Work and the Culture of Information","review":"In this book, Liu makes a persuasive argument that knowledge workers can resist the dominant postcapitalist business ideology from the inside by developing an \\"ethos of the unknown.\\" The argument is dense, both philosophically and historically, but the book provides one of the best summaries available of the development of knowledge work and its relation to \\"cool.\\"This survey is framed by a larger argument, however, which seeks to establish a place for the arts and humanities in the information age.

First off, the newest copywrite is 2000. This book has very few spelling or grammatical mistakes. Chapters are very short and don't go deep enough into each subject and don't provide enough examples. Each topic is covered in only a few pages, so don't look here for in depth coverage. I found the exam drastically different from this review guide. The exam has changed alot since 2000 and this book should be updated to reflect that fact. There are lots of questions on the exam dealing with digital systems and signal processing that aren't even mentioned here. The two practice exams were way off from the test itself. You'll notice the author has tons of questions on the practice tests about computers, their memory, etc, yet hardly any of that was on the test. I recommend that if you are still in school and have recently had courses in communications, digital systems and signal processing, consider taking the EE part of the afternoon exam. I've been out of school for a year now and really should have taken the general version of the afternoon exam.

With detailed accounts of individual cases, along with the 'how to's' of quick efficient capital punishment (15 seconds from opening the cell door to dropping the condemned man was considered a slow time), it's an invaluable account of recent history in capital punishment."},{"Title":"The Hangman's Tale: Memoirs of a Public Executioner","review":"Syd Dernley is not nearly as well a known name amongst British hangmen as are those of Albert Pierrepointe or John Ellis. He was employed as such for just 4 years or so and only assisted at just over 20 executions. His book, co-written with Davis Newman, is, however, one of the better ones on the subject. It is not merely a dry recitation of facts about a series of executions but is a good chronicle of the life and times of one of England's judicial hangmen. There is lots of colorful detail from the author's own life and plenty of anecdotes and interesting information about some of his colleagues and some of the people he helped hang. It is a short little book but very entertaining."},{"Title":"Batman","review":"The War Games crossover suffers from problems carried over from most large stories: way too many characters thrown in to one expansive tale just for the sake of having them there. But ignoring this, War Games actually stands as a very strong Batman story in many ways more interesting and imaginative than the extremely entertaining but somewhat hollow \\"Hush\\" storyline by the great Jeph Loeb. In this volume the premise kicks into a higher gear with the storyline's main nemesis, Black Mask, who has proven in his Red Skull inspired revamp to be a truly sick, great villain in Batman's rogues gallery. The volume's most captivating and disturbing scenes involve the deliciously evil madman torturing the misguided Stephanie Brown with power tools. But it never steeps into all too common and often ridiculous splash panels page after page in a desperate attempt to try and evoke some emotion. The story carries itself as dramatic utilizing simple technique. It comes with a high reccomendation."},{"Title":"Batman","review":"Great novel, definitely would reccomend this book which is the second in the trilogy.

This collection of stories, mostly short but one long, covers Montana, Texas and maybe a couple other states too. All are worthwhile.What struck me though was that for the first time I found a common thread of love lost/life lost that I had not noticed before. Maybe it was there in the earlier writings, but I hadn't seen it. This time, in Lives of Rocks, there are some truly heartbreaking scenes, especially in the title story, where what could have been is rather forcefully struck down and replaced by a future that looks to be much more prosaic than the wonderful interactions between the characters that have taken place.A friend of mine is a full-out supporter of the \\"bleak is beautiful\\" concept in novels, to the extent that he is reading Bleak House now and loving it. I have difficulty enjoying bleak novels, and this collection of stories is not bleak, but perhaps somewhat tragic, and as one of the Greek writers I was exposed to in high school said, tragedy allows us to experience emotions that we might not otherwise feel.This, then, is a collection of stories that is good for you, even though many are sad."},{"Title":"The Lives of Rocks","review":"Classic Rick Bass. Now of course I read them in South Texas instead of Alaska so stories like \\"Pagans\\" really hit me where I live. Always in the Bass stories, I find people I wished I had known and events that I wouldn't have missed. The best characters since \\"Platte River\\" are here."},{"Title":"The Lives of Rocks","review":"If you liked Rick Bass' earlier writing, this collection will ratchet your appreciation even higher. Along with McGuane, Ivan Doig and the other \\"Stegner School\\" of writers, Bass creates a human condition and a sense of place with prose that touches your heart. And with this writing, place moves out of the west with no loss of impact. Sentences garb you and make you reread them just for the sheer pleasue of their compact, lyrical beauty. I just finished it and will reread it for no other reason than to experience it once again."},{"Title":"The Lives of Rocks","review":"Rick Bass is a unique individual, a unique writer, and this is a unique book even for him. He lives in the Yaak Valley of Montana, part of which is protected from development but not enough to keep the area from being ravaged by exploitation. Rick has helped lead a defense based on gaining wilderness designation for a sufficient amount to ensure retaining the natural values of this remote corner of the United States. That effort has been successful to the extent of avoiding further loss of the environment, but has so far failed in gaining the overall objective. The immediate threat to the Yaak is only moderate, and the opposition to wilderness designation has been primarily generic, but it has failed to get enough interest in Washington DC to receive the necessary legislative action. Rick has written articles about the cause, has addressed it in books, and has at times expressed considerable frustration in the lack of achieving a permanent solution.This book is a collection of stories. The closest to non-fiction is \\"Fiber\\" which ends with a plea that someone help save the Yaak. A common denominator in the stories is some form of nature, and it is usually under attack. As other reviewers have said, the stories are \\"dark,\\" some almost desperately so. Intended, or not, I see this as a metaphor of Rick Bass' frustration with the effort to protect the Yaak.Another common denominator is that every story involves a study of an everyday human emotion. Several involve interaction between lovers, family members, or close friends. \\"The Lives of Rocks\\" is a compelling study of interaction across generational and religious lines. After reading the book jointly with another individual, I found that we spent more time discussing each story than it took us to read it. This would be an interesting book to share in the right type of book club."},{"Title":"The Lives of Rocks","review":"Rick Bass is a skilled writer of character-driven drama, and his works are defined by how his characters develop via their connections, or lack thereof, with the natural bounty around them. Bass can make this work in surprising ways, particularly via the eccentric personalities and ravaged outdoor environments encountered in \\"Yazoo\\" and \\"Goats.\\" The winning story here is \\"The Lives of Rocks\\" in which a hardy woman must admit that she needs help living off the land when she becomes terminally ill, and must work with neighbors who have a different outlook towards nature. One weakness in Bass' writing is that his developments in plot and characterizations are very verbose and languorous, which is a feasible way to illustrate communion with nature, but which some readers might find sluggish and unsatisfying. This weakness all but wrecks \\"Pagans\\" and \\"The Canoeists,\\" in which the plots go nowhere while the characters ponder themselves. And this collection is damaged by the hugely disappointing \\"Fiber.\\" The disappointment is due to the fact that the story starts very strongly, with an environmental vigilante atoning for past excesses, only to shift abruptly to a non-fiction tirade from Bass in which he blasts certain environmental organizations for not paying more attention to his (adopted) home area in Montana. Bass has a very unique outlook on the human condition and his stories pack a very subtle yet insistent punch. But this collection has a few weaknesses that hold it back from true greatness. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"The Lives of Rocks","review":"The stories in this collection largely take place in two settings: Houston and Montana. Since Bass was born and raised near Houston but now lives in Montana' Yaak Valley, that's not too much of a surprise. The themes often begin with questions of youth or aging, and the youthful stories are often set in Texas. However, we do meet one female character in both youth and old age, in both cases in a place much like western Montana (though not identified as such). Again, it's not surprising that an author of a certain age would be interested in playing with themes from his own youth in Texas and his middle age - - and coming senior years - - in Montana.All the characters and stories connect closely to the land. Around Houston, this land is often poisoned, sterile, overworked. In Montana, that's never true. In Texas, Bass also juxtaposes a gritty realism and bleak surroundings with elements of the surreal, a kind of Texan magical realism. That's doesn't seem necessary in Montana, where the characters are much better grounded in the land and in themselves.Thus, intertwined with youth and age are different environmental landscapes, the freshness of Montana and the sterility of Texas. Even when the title story focuses on a character confronting death in Montana, the story is full of life, while sexual coming-of-age in Texas is bleak and loveless. Altogether a remarkable collection."},{"Title":"The Lives of Rocks","review":"Rick Bass is a marvelous writer with a true gift for the language and a conservationist's heart.

His coverage of the action at Diepenlinchen, Germany in September, l944 is most outstanding.

Coffman selected the title for his personal memoirs, little did he realize that this title would attract the attention of many WWII veterans who had the same thought as they were processed by their Draft Boards.

His description of action from D-day forward, through France, Germany, and the post-war occupation of Germany make interesting reading, and alone, would make the writing of the book a success. The he goes ahead with his service in the Korean War. Then on to the war that is still fresh in the minds of those who served, Viet Nam. He includes enough stories to give strong clues to his early boyhood and to the equally difficult hardships and sacrifices of service wives and families.

(By the way, my heartfelt gratitude to those soldiers for that privilege!) Another aspect left out of the history texbooks today is how people existed before the invention of cell phones, computers, satellites, etc. Thanks to Warren for those kind of details included in this book - I recommend this book to everyone in their 30s and younger, who yearn for those kind of stories.

The train is bombarded in a Russian air attack, in which several of the German platoon members are killed. Later, when they arrive at the barracks, they face another attack by the Russians in which more of the platoon members are killed. Then, out on the battlefield, in foggy weather blinding all those who tried to fight, the Russians come at them again with tanks and other weapons that end up killing even more of the few remaining soldiers in Erik's platoon. Under the influence of extreme fright and confusion, Erik ends up behind enemy lines and has to scavenge the uniform of a dead Russian boy to avoid getting killed when the other Russians looked for German survivors. He was recognized as a wounded Russian and was taken to a hospital where he fell in love with the nurse: Tamara. Then the hospital gets attacked by Germans who force all those inside to evacuate, including Erik and Tamara. They run away from attacks in different countries, until they find a German woman who takes care of them for a while before they end up in an American hospital.

In Soldier X their are two main characters. One of the characters is a German boy in the army his name is Erik. The other is a girl that is helping out by being a nurse for the Russian army and her name is Tamara. This book is taking place during world war two and the two characters must travel by foot over Europe to safety.In the book \\"Soldier X\\" Erik is fighting on the German side but has to act like a Russian soldier after the Russians over ran his trench if not he will be shot. He gos to a hospital and him and Tamara must get away from all the war and go to Switzerland. But they must make it there first. On their way they encountered many challenges one of which was if discovered by either side Russian or German they would be shot and While walking in the cold wet rain they got very ill and was hard for them to move on. I liked the book Soldier X because it was action packed and you never could tell what was about to happen next. I also thought that is was cool how like they had a German befriend a Russian since their countries were at war with each other.I would recommend this book to people that like war and action and a lot of like suspense because you could be thinking that one thing is about to happen but then something else happens.

He realizes that you have to \\"kill or be killed.\\" When he is close to the last moments of his life he figures out a new way to survive.Throughout the book, Erik goes through many obsticles that are truly just unimaginable.

Readers intrigued by this novel should prepare to experience a \\"behind enemy lines\\" perspective of World War II. This book would best be read for leisure, on a reader's own time. If Soldier X is assigned or chosen for academic purposes, moral and ethical questions that Wulffson exposes may interfere with quality, content, or ability for fulfill the respected assignment. Erik Brandt, a teenage soldier for Hitler's army, finds himself trapped behind enemy lines. Which challenges his loyalties for Germany when he is forced to confiscate a Soviet uniform, and join the Soviet Army. This not only challenges Erik Brandt, but also may challenge a reader's idea of his or her own loyalties. Wulffson used WWII and a life or death situation as a setting to approach this otherwise incomparable ethical loyalty, and succeeded because WWII stories impact readers enough to create personal contradiction. This particular story of Erik Brandt is the perfect scenario to place the ethical question of loyalty, because of the life or death situation. As a reader, I put myself in Erik Brandts position, and realized that I would have done the same. Which raises the question of how loyal can one be. Reading this novel, personally taught me about morals, and loyalty toward anything I believe in, but most importantly taught me my personal appreciation for human life, and the actions I would take to preserve or protects my own."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Soldier X, by Don Wulffson is an exciting look through the eyes of a young German soldier.

The main character, Erik Brandt is fifteen years old, turning 16 when he is drafted to fight for the German army. Soon after being drafted he received his mission briefings, and was sent to re-supply, and reinforce the 15th Rifle Corps of the Forth division at Tarnapol. Once he arrives, he is sent down to the front lines. Here, a day later the Russians broke through the lines, and took over the fort. Erik was badly wounded, but since he knew how to speak Russian fluently, he dressed in a Russian uniform and went over to the Russian soldiers. He was then taken to a makeshift hospital where he regained his health and eventually fell in love with a nurse by the name of Tamara. At the hospital, Tamara also finds out that Erik is German. Soon, the war's fighting comes into the city, and the hospital is forced to evacuate. One of the trucks taking the wounded is destroyed by a rocket shell, and because of this Erik, Tamara, Tamara's stepmother Zoya, and a soldier assigned to guard the hospital. During the attack of the city, both Zoya and the Soldier were killed by mortar fire, and just Erik and Tamara had to survive wandering through the forests of Russian, Germany, and Czechoslovakia. They decided that they wanted to go live in America. While traveling through Germany, they encountered a large German platoon that was supposed to stop the Russian offensive. After escaping the platoon, they came accross a town where American soldiers were positioned. The soldiers biacidentally shot Erik and Tamara, and took them to an American hospital. After partially recovering, both Erik and Tamara are reunited, and as the book comes to an end; Tamara begins to cry, and looks past Erik being German. I would recommend Soldier X to teens, and adults of all ages. The intensity of the story allows you to become a part of World War II, and I truly believe that it gives new meaning and insight to the actual events that took place during the war."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Soldier X by Don Wulffson is a suspenseful book about World War II and the different countries involved in the war. Erik Brandt, the main character, is also called X. Wulffson writes a great story about courage and bravery when Brandt is forced into the Nazi army and is later put into Russian hands.When Russians invade the German camp, Brandt becomes stuck under a tank with a dead Russian soldier. Brandt speaks Russian fluently, because of his family background, and soon becomes this Russian soldier so no one recognizes him as the enemy. In the hospital Brandt is being taken cared of, he receives his nickname, X, from a man in the bed next to him. Over the weeks X meets new people and really becomes a Russian. When the hospital is bombed, both X and Tamara, a lovely nurse X is in love with, must flee for their lives.Wulffson does an excellent job explaining the hardships they go through together. By reading this book, not only do you learn about things you might not have known about World War II, but you also learn some of the German and Russian languages. I believe this book may be a little too depressing or descriptive for some, but otherwise I found it to be a very interesting book, full of new facts and trivia.I think this book is directed towards a more mature audience because of the topics discussed. This was another superb book by Don Wulffson who has already won the Distinguished Achievement Award for his educational writing. Soldier X is a historical fiction book that parallels many German soldiers during World War II on the Eastern Front.In this serious but suspenseful and even entertaining novel we can learn more about the hardships of World War II."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Soldier X by Don L. Wulffson is a historical fiction novel about a sixteen-year-old boy named Erik Brandt. Erik is drafted into the German army without really knowing what he is fighting for. After being wounded, he finds his way behind enemy lines. If you read this book, you can find out how he struggles to survive with his Russian friend, Tamara.This book is set in the first person view, with Erik narrating. I did have a few questions about this book when I was finished, but I couldn't tell you them without spoiling the plot.I thought this book was a bit boring at times, and I was expecting something with a bit more meat, especially since this is a war novel. I however would recommend this novel to any teenager who enjoys war novels."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Solider X is an astounding book. It follows the journey of a young German solider who has life changing experiences throughout his time in Poland. He leaves his grandparents house at the age of 16 and aboard a bus of about a dozen or so young men, he finds that he is not the only one who is scared. After six weeks (it is not specific) some trails and tribulations come upon our young solider and he is put in a Russian hospital. While he is there he falls in love with a beautiful girl named Janice. He learns about their lives and how they prepare each day while in war. When the solider is healed, a bombardment hits the tiny hospital, and the people inside have to leave. Janice and the solider run away from the solider together. As they wander the unknown land they are in, they find it hard to survive with the little they have, until they come upon a nice lady who takes them in and cares for them. The rest you will have to read. It is a very attractive book and deals with a lot of war issues. Has moderate profanity and strong violence, so I wouldn't recommend it to children under 12. This book is set apart from other war books because the author tells a true story of him and his war story. He paints a wonderful picture of how he lived through this tragedic time period. All in all I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Soldier X is about a fifteen year old Russian drafted into Hitler's army. He went to war and they started to fight. A bunch of Germans were dead on the bunker and then a tank drove over it. Russians were stabbing people on the ground wounded or not. Eric switches uniforms with a dead Russian. He's taken to a hospital and when recovered he becomes a nurse. The war was headed their way so they moved. He and Tamara go a long way, then work in a German hospital. They get wounded and go to an American hospital in Germany and finally move to America.I liked four things about Soldier X. First, I liked that Eric could speak German, Russian, and American. Second, I liked that Eric helped out at the Russian hospital. Third, I liked that Eric went back to helping his own army in the hospital. Fourth, I liked that he and Tamara stayed together. And finally, I didn't like that Eric betrayed his own army."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"\\"I was trapped behind enemy lines. If discovered, I would be killed. Even playing dead would not save me; even dead, once found, I would be skewered on the end of a bayonet. I had only one chance, I knew, to save myself. The dead eyes of the blond Russian boy seemed to be watching me. With my fingers, I closed the lids. Strange though it may seem, I did not want him looking at me and what I was about to do.\\" Sixteen-year-old Erik Brandt has just gone to war for the Nazis, during World War II. After a violent battle, he wakes up in a Russian camp. Erik traded clothes with a dead Russian boy, and gets into a hospital. Erik already knows the Russian language; that will not be a problem. Erik gets to know other injured soldiers and has his eye on a nurse. Her name is Tamara, and Erik thinks that she is wonderful. Tamara later learns Erik's secret, after a burn on his arm. After a violent attack on the hospital, Erik, Tamara, and a security guard run off. The security guard is killed by German troops, but Erik and Tamara keep on. They continue through Europe meeting people, X even loses his left arm! At the end, they get married and later move to America. The book is suspenseful and the story is realistic. Soldier X has many unique characters too.The book is suspenseful, one time being when X ends up across enemy lines and is close to being caught. Another time was when Tamara finds out that X is a Nazi back at the hospital, also when Tamara and X are in Klatovy and the Nazis attack.The story is realistic, for one reason, because it is not a perfect story. Some of X's friends die, X loses an arm, and there are many attacks on places where X ends up in.Soldier X has many unique characters, like Erik for instance. Erik, or X, was born in Russia, moves to Germany when he is young, fights for the Nazis, then ends up back with the Russians. X is very kind and smart too. Another unique character is Dobelmann, X's platoon leader when he is with the Nazis. Dobelmann has a scarred up face, is bossy, brave, but afraid to go back home looking the way he does. The last unique character is Tamara, the beautiful Russian nurse. Tamara helped nurse X back to health, and is very kind, great to be around, and smart. Tamara is unique because of everything she does for her friends. She is a good helper and a good spirit. Tamara runs off with X after an attack on the hospital, and they end up getting married.Soldier X is a great read, very suspenseful and realistic, with many unique characters.-E.

By this time, Germany is losing ground on both the Western and Eastern fronts, and Hitler and the Nazis are throwing whatever \\"manpower\\" they can into the war machine in order to try deny the inevitable.As the officers remark, these are children being sent out as cannon fodder, ill-equipped, and barely trained to hold a weapon, much less go out to battle. The main goal for most of these kids is to try to get home alive, though everybody knows that there will be many, many who will never get to do that. Although it's illegal, Erik takes a chance to \\"blend in\\" as an Russian soldier -- thanks to the uniform of a dead Russian boy, and his proficiency in the Russian language due to his mother's family's influence.This book made for a good read. The first part of it dealt with Erik's experiences as a Nazi conscript. As someone who has done a fair amount of reading on WWII, I know the situation there was desperate, but something in this part of the book rang a little bit hollow. Maybe it was the fact that in trying to mention all the horrors that were going on, it felt like instead of Erik exactly experiencing everything, it was more of an introduction to the many horrible things happening on the Eastern front for somebody who wouldn't know anything (or very little) about it. However, this was just a minor detraction.The book really took off in part two, describing Erik's experience impersonating a wounded Russian soldier, and his and Tamara's journey westward across Europe in the final, insane days of the war.Although billed as a work of fiction, the author claims that this novel is based on a true story, and that certain names and events were changed for the sake of the book. This story is certainly compelling enough that if it is true, it would be interesting to learn more about real story behind the book."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Soldier X is a very good world war two story telling about a German boy drafted into the Hitler Youth Group and was heading into a Russian battle field.

X has nothing to do except throw grenades at tanks and shoot his rifle.

It was so touching and realistic that I actually cried during parts. But even though it was sad it was still exciting and interesting! It was well written and it captivated my attention right away. I just couldn't put it down! Everything was so realistic. X was extremely lifelike especially since he and Tamara were created in the image of real people.

He says its a fantastic book, one he could not put down."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"My family bought this book with the older cover a while ago. I loved this book, even though it scared the heck out of me. The plot has twists and turns that will keep you reading to the last page. For me it was scary to think of someone my age going through the horrible events of war. But it also shows that even the Germans, who we Americans think were the badguys, most of them were kids and teens who were being duped by their government. I would suggest you read this before you give it to a younger kid, there are a lot of horrific war scenes, and a lot of other violence, but all in all it paints a realistic picture of refugees from World War II."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Soldier X Review By Arthur H. 4 April 2011This book is an exciting tale with an interesting twist in it.

After his encampment is overrun he makes a bold choice to switch uniforms with a dead Russian soldier. He goes to a Russian hospital and meets a nurse named Tamara. The town that the hospital is in gets engulfed by the battles of World War Two, and Erik and Tamara run away and try to find a safe place. This book was exciting with lots of twists and cliffhangers.

This book I give a perfect 10/10 because it is exciting and I could not find any plot holes."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"bought this as a replacement for a lost book. It was a favorite classroom book. My son couldn't put it down-except when it was lost on the plane! LOVED it!"},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Can you even begin to imagine what must have gone through the minds of very young soldiers who fought in Hitler's army as Russia began its overwhelming repulsion of the Nazi war machine from Russian soil? I could not until I read Soldier X: Trapped behind Enemy Lines.Young Soldier X finds himself alone--but alive--in a long deep trench. Aware that the Nazi war front is crumbling in Russia, he continues to obey military instructions imbued with the idea that he must fight to the death for his mother country. Vaguely aware of the atrocities committed against Jews, he has been brainwashed into believing that Jewish people are a stumbling block to the Nazi ideal of world conquest. Yet, in spite of this Nazi upbringing, Soldier X's conscience begins to challenge those beliefs.As he sits in his trench fully aware that the approaching Russian tanks and infantry are unstoppable, he questions why he must remain in this forward position. His commanding officer has instilled an appalling fear in his heart that if he dares to run or retreat he will be killed by his own officer. Such is the loyalty to the Nazi war effort led by notorious Hitler and his regime.Overrun in his trench, he stays in place. To his good fortune, a Russian tank stalls directly over his trench caught up in volumes of barbed wire placed by Nazi retreaters to stop the onslaught of the, now, Russian offensive. Every Nazi soldier around him is dead. What saves Soldier X is the stalled heavy Russian tank sitting direct above his head.With no alternative, Soldier X exchanges his Nazi uniform for that of a dead Russian soldier. Then, when he hears the battle distancing itself away from his position, he abandons his trench with a large piece of shrapnel embedded in his leg, a piece large enough that he cannot remove it. Seen in his Russian uniform, a dying German commander shoots Soldier X and he goes downWithin minutes as a Russian speaking imposter, Soldier X is hauled off by Russian infantry for immediate medical aid as a heroically wounded fighter. After surgery, he finds himself in a Russian hospital nursed back to health by a young nubile Russian girl. Ever so slowly they fall in love, yet ever so slowly, she wonders about Soldier X's background. He claims amnesia, but she begins to have doubts.In a counter attack against the Russians by the Nazis, Soldier X and this loving nurse are forced to desert their hospital. They flee eastward. As the land beneath their feet exchanges \\"ownership\\" several times, these two loving individuals find themselves trapped in the killing fields between the Russians and Germans.What ultimately happens to these two unlikely lovers--Soldier X, a Nazi German, and his loving companion, a Russian Jew--I will leave to the reader. In this story you cannot help but become involved in their lives. In spite of how you probably feel about German soldiers during the Nazi attempt to strike out at the world, still the lives of these two brave, pitiable youths trying to keep one another alive in the killing zone between two powerful military forces will seize you, haunt you, possess you, until you find out if either, or both, or neither survive their horrific environment.This is an extremely easy to read book. It is relatively short and would make an exceptionally good book for high school students to read and discuss among themselves if led by an enthusiastic teacher. What the Nazis did to the civilized world has changed forever the thinking of decent human beings.But the feelings of Soldier X can at least give us a glimpse of what a demonized hatred-cult can do to euthanize a young mind. More importantly, it can show how the human spirit, in spite of intense brainwashing at a young age, when left to its own devices, this spirit can recognize that it is the soul of each person--be they German, Jewish, Polish, Russian--that makes them worthy of the title, \\"Human Being.\\"One might think this book is for the younger generation of males. Wrong! I would recommend it for everyone because if we are not to repeat history's past mistakes, we must recognize the thinking that caused them. Soldier X reveals the mental torture one youth suffered as he deals with his own misled thinking.Other interesting reads:Retribution: The Battle for Japan, 1944-45 (Vintage)We Were One: Shoulder to Shoulder with the Marines Who Took Fallujah"},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"This book was very horrifing.

It makes the horrors of war standout strongly, almost everyone dies. When you are about to like someone boom their dead. Don also put a great love story in the plot. I don't reccomend this book for young readers, of all the death and the way Eric(the main Character) describes the way his friends die.It has a strange twist near the end that might make you cry.This book makes you think about your loyalty to your country, and might even make you uncomfortable.This book(in my opinion) is not good for young readers, or people who don't like violence or blood.It's educational too, you learn about gangrene , and at the end you might know some Russian or German.All in all this is an extraordinary book, with many subjects and issues you don't feel comfortable with."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Xciting,Xplorational,XtremeThis book is about a soldier who is from Russia but his family immigrated illegally to Germany.

Last but not least but not least this book had a great theme about the horrors of World War 2.I think that the best part of the book was when X was in the frontline of the war in Germany. He was sent from the stationary bunker in the heavily guarded area, to the front lines to face the enemy head on. It was the time in the story when most of his friends died, except for one which he never saw again.One time in the story that was most vivid was when X saw his friends die. It was the way that he explained it, just seemed very graphic. Like one time heard an artillary round coming so they all ducked. When they all got up he saw his friend dead."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Soldier X is a bone-chilling tale about one young, brave, German soldier known only as X fighting in the front lines of World War II. While on his first post, the Russian army launches a full scale attack on the German front, yielding deadly success. He fires everything he has at the millions of Russian soldiers and tanks, but is not successful. Suffering major concussions, X opens his eyes to find himself in a very shallow ditch covered with a ten ton disabled Russian battle tank. Having a Russian background, he hears a enemy general barking orders at the mechanics to get the tank operational again. Frantic, he quickly surveys the ditch, noticing a dead Russian soldier only a few yards away. With much difficulty, he strips himself of his German uniform and quickly puts on Russian's uniform. The tank becomes operational, and the wounded German soldier is spotted. He is taken to a local hospital, and is now deep behind enemy lines. After a few days, the hospital is bombed which forces him and the nurse he is in love with, Tamara to flee in panic. For the next few months, they traveled through forest after forest, field after field, not knowing where they were going or how they would get there. The journey was not easy, but after being thought of as spies and teetering on the edge of death, the finally made it back to Germany. Two years later on X's 18th birthday, he would marry Tamara."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Erik Brandt was drafted into the German Army. He was from Russia but moved to Germany when he was young. He does not know a lot of information about what is going on in the world. He finds out for the first time that Jews are being brutally treated. He did not know what was happening when they were being removed from his town. He was sent to the front lines to fight. He was separated from the rest of the Germans after shrapnel had hit him. He was the only German around so he found a dead Russian Soldier and changed into his uniform and cut holes where he had been hit by shrapnel. He went to a Russian hospital and was treated. He could speak some Russian so he did not talk a lot to escape the chance of getting discovered. When he was released from the hospital he went back to fight for his country in the war they were loosing. For the rest of the story you should read the novel which I recommend to people who like to read about actual events with fictional stories. Although it is a war novel it has a lot of meaning to it about loyalties. I would not recommend this book to people who do not like gore. This book is appropriate for people ten and up. I think that it is more a book for males. I thought that this was an excellent book. It is only 226 pages so it does not drift off of the subject. I like how the mood is described in great detail so that I can feel like I am actually there. I think that this book is a good book because it has meaning instead of complete books about things that will never happen."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"First, on the cover of the first Scholastic printing version it has a picture of a soldier that doesn't resemble a German soldier at all. Secondly, the book states on pages 63-64 that he counted out his four shots from his semiautomatic Mauser and later four more without reloading. The Germans used a 5 shot bolt action Mauser 98k! The author must have made the grievous error of confusing the American semiauto 8 shot M1 Garand with the German Mauser 98k.

I want you to not think about the Americans but the German soldiers. Many were forced to go to the lines at the age of sixteen. Many of the soldiers hardly had any training. This is a story about a German soldier who fought for Germany. Originally he was from Russia but his family moved to Germany. He was forced to fight at the age of sixteen. During a battle his life changed. Before he knew it he was in a Russian hospital. No one knew he was a German. There at the hospital was a beautiful lady he fell in love with, Tamara. Fighting was getting closer to the hospital. People were forced to leave. Soldier X and Tamara were left behind to fend for themselves, to cooperate, and work together until the end of the war.I really liked the book. If you like war stories this is the book for you. It's like a survival and war story in one. What really amazed me was how the hospitals were run. Anyone who was able to help would help at the hospital. I felt like I was right beside Soldier X the whole story. There where no dull parts it seemed. I really enjoyed the book and learning about history.I recommend this book to someone who likes war or survival stories. This book was really neat. I haven't read anything close to it. You realize how though war is and what a person will do to survive. The details were amazing. To understand better of what I'm trying to say, read the book.

The problem? With the front shifting weekly due to offenses and counteroffenses, Erik/Aleksandr finds himself confronted one moment with one side, one moment with another, as he is torn loose as a refuge after graphically-described attacks.Interesting? You bet. As a war writer, Wulffson has done his homework. The tale of a boy forced to be a man is common enough in this genre, but this particular boy (who adopts X as a nickname) is an especially compelling case, and Wulfsson's afterword tells us it was based on a real case. Certainly the history he cites is accurate, and the descriptions of trench warfare are eerily realistic as well.Eventually this war story morphs into a war/love story with the introduction of Tamara, whom X works beside in a makeshift Russian hospital. But the spirit of the book remains with the war, and the theme is deeply entrenched in the ironies of a soldier who can not only fight equally and reasonably for BOTH sides, but can befriend citizens and fighters for both sides as well. The enemy, then, is war itself -- war and the hell it unleashes.This book has little profanity but much violence. Still, it is well-written, and reluctant readers (especially boys) who are interested in history and war will quickly become spellbound by the narrative. The novel can be enjoyed by adults as well as teens. A real winner, X marks the spot -- and if you had any misconceptions about war being a romantic and exciting thing, SOLDIER X will strike it out of you forever."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"The book soldier x is about a 15 year old half russian half german boy named Erik, who was forced to join the german army. During the war towards the end of the book he gets his arm blown off. I recomend this book with five stars. The book is action filled and each wound that Erik gets is gory and well decribed. The background was easy to see because of the detail,such as when they are in an army truck going to a town they are attacked by four russian planes and a boy sitting in front of Erik gets shot in the face and Erik is sprayed in the face with brain juice. Another time when he and his girlfrind are in a russian town American soldiers mistake them for german soldiers and shoot the girls in the head and Erik in the elbow and mouth, that is when they have to amputate his arm. This is one of the best books I have ever read and anyone that says that it is a bad book is insane, at least if they like war books."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"This is another good book which I read recently. It is stated as a children's book for those aged 9-12. Indeed, the book was written in such a way which is easily comprehensible. However, I do not think that a 9 or 12 year old kid would understand the horror of war itself or the feelings of losing their friends and parents during a war unless they are very smart or they live in war-torn countries like Afghanistan. Their great grandparents would definitely do. The book also contains some passages which are very bloody and brutal for kids to read.I strongly believe that the book should not be treated as a kid's book. If the author is right in his claim that &quot;the story is not only true, but also loosely parallels the experience of an estimated thirty thousand German soldiers during World War II on the Eastern Front&quot;, which I have no reason to believe otherwise, this book should be treated as a war memoir of a former Hitler Youth member whose name is &quot;Soldier X&quot; and not as a mere fiction."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"This is an outstanding book for young adults. It is also a great book for parents to read along with their kids, hopefully inciting discussion about the book's profound themes. For a book dealing with weighty issues, the tone of the book is not patronizing toward its young readers and the author deals with the issues of patriotism, nationalism, heritage, war, and first love subtly and thoughtfully. &quot;Soldier X&quot; is a carefully crafted book that is a real page-turner!"},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"This book is an amazing book. I couldn't put it down and I would recommend it to anyone. I don't want to spoil anything in it so I won't go into detail. But it has everything in it.

I read this last year when I was a 14 year old boy in 8th grade I got it from my English teacher and i plan on buying it to read it again. I normally hate reading books but this book is even worth reading more than once. But anyway I hope you like my review and I hope you enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Soldier X is a powerful and gripping tale of the hard times of a boy named Erik Brandt who is drafted in Hitler's army and is aboard a train with about a dozen other young men on their way to war. The train is bombarded in a Russian air attack, in which several of the German platoon members are killed. Later, when they arrive at the barracks, they face another attack by the Russians in which more of the platoon members are killed. Then, out on the battlefield, in foggy weather blinding all those who tried to fight, the Russians come at them again with tanks and other weapons that end up killing even more of the few remaining soldiers in Erik's platoon. Under the influence of extreme fright and confusion, Erik ends up behind enemy lines and has to scavenge the uniform of a dead Russian boy to avoid getting killed when the other Russians looked for German survivors. He was recognized as a wounded Russian and was taken to a hospital where he fell in love with the nurse: Tamara. Then the hospital gets attacked by Germans who force all those inside to evacuate, including Erik and Tamara. They run away from attacks in different countries, until they find a German woman who takes care of them for a while before they end up in an American hospital. Erik ends up getting one arm amputated and marrying Tamara.Overall, this is a great book to read whether you're looking for a complex story to keep you enticed for hours, or you want a book that portrays a real life situation in full drama. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Soldier X","review":"Erik Brandt, having barely turned 16 and is half German half Russian, has to go to war for Germany.

Another reason I loved this book was that the characters were described beautifully, you really feel as though you were actually there.

And having to switch from a German soldier to a Russian soldier after being shot, sliced, and ending up with a concussion? Having to change names and lives with a dead man in order to survive? Speaking a language your not used to speaking and saying that you're Russian? Then getting your arm chopped off and finally trying to escape to America with a woman you hardly know? All these events occur in SoldierX by Don Wulffson.Don Wulffson has hit the jackpot after writing SoldierX.He explained it in a way so it seemed you were actually in world war two trying to survive and escape Russia. SoldierX may not have won a medal or an award but this book is sure on my list.SoldierX is a book about a Nazi soldier Erik Brandt (X) getting drafted to war on his seventeenth birthday. He has to pull many extreme stunts to survive World War Two like switching from the Nazi side to the Russian side and getting a dead man's name of Aleksandr Dukhadov. Luckily his grandfather was Russian and had taught him how to speak Russian too. After being shot a couple of times he realizes he he's to escape so he tries to go to America with a girl he had met Tamara a Russian hospital. On their journey to America they meet a German lady named Amelia to rest for their long yet exciting journey.The part in the book that got me excited to read this book was the battle of Tarnapol. All the excitement and commotion in the battle got my mind racing out of control. Even though Hals Willi and Oskar (X's acquaintances) had died and X got a sliced head and got shot in the knee it was a very exciting part of the book.The main idea was about a young man trying to survive the troubles of world war two.

I like history so it suited me well. It's not a long book, but it took me at least a day to it. The author puts very good detail into the scenery, and events.

World War Two that is and on Germany's side. The awful Nazis side. The sad part is is that Eric doesn't even agree or believe it is right what the Germans are doing to the rest of the world. But he really has no choice. On the way he confronts feelings and emotions of confusion, sights of young friends screaming and dying, and the physical pain of the torture of war burning your skin.Later on(not giving the story away), Eric meets a young girl...can you conclude the rest?Overall, this book should be rated a 5 out of 5 in everyones mind.

I have just two complaints, and I'll get them out of the way quickly: 1. The sex scenes are hokey. And 2. At one point a horde of bats attack our heroine in a cave. Not likely. We don't need more bad publicity for our furry, little friends. Almost all of them mind their own business, and they are vital to the ecosystem. Even vampires sneak up on their sleeping victims. They do not attack en masse.But, I digress...our cast includes Catherine Alexander, a good, beautiful, naive woman; Noelle Page, a bad, beautiful woman, really dreadful; Bill Fraser, a great guy who deflowers young Catherine (but that's OK with her); Larry Douglas, a debonair flyboy with nary a scruple in his handsome head; and Constantin Demiris, a Greek billionaire with a definite taste for revenge! I'll say no more.Here's the deal: Catherine and Noelle are both born in 1919. Catherine, from Chicago, grows to young adulthood, somewhat naive.Noelle, from Marseille, France, grows to young adulthood somewhat naive too, but early on she falls in love with Douglas, who inadvertently twists her. He beds her and dumps her, and she never recovers. She turns into a cold-hearted Harpy...plotting revenge for years! Catherine, on the other hand, falls in love with an older man, Fraser, a stolid Washington bigwig, but she too later falls under the hypnotic spell of the devilishly passionate Douglas who, by the way, is an ace fighter pilot in WWII. How romantic for a tender, impressionable young woman! No wonder they can't resist: a fighter pilot with handsome, chiseled features and a devil-may-care attitude. A male fatale.OK, so we have parallel stories for a while. Caring Catherine and Fraser in Washington. Noxious Noelle, who becomes a famous actress with a string of influential lovers, in Europe. But remember this: Noelle is plotting revenge on Douglas, the cad. Noelle finally takes up with Demiris, and maneuvers Douglas into being hired as the Greek's personal pilot. At this point, the two stories move closer, ending in Greece, spiraling down a slippery slope of murder schemes, failed plots, romantic nights, successful plots, mountains in the clouds, rickety foot-bridges, bottomless volcanic lakes, terror in dark caves, hokey sex, stunning Mediterranean vistas...all that stuff.It's a well-crafted yarn, and it has a dilly of an ending. Certainly blindsided me. Probably will do the same for you, but maybe you're sharper than I am. It's possible.We have some good secondary characters, the best of whom is Colonel Mueller, a bald, albino, homosexual Gestapo officer. Unlike everybody else, he was not blinded by Noelle's charms. Of course not, he's gay. Did she escape his clutches? You'll just have to read the book and see. I recommend it to you.

Before he turned to penning purple prose, author Sidney Sheldon was an Academy Award winning screenwriter in the 1940's and 50's, and he not only knows how to keep a story moving, but how to milk big, melodramatic scenes and plant great twists in the plot.Fabulous is the only word to describe this tale of lust, revenge and murder...there's even a little Nazi intrigue thrown in for good measure. Face it, most of us don't have very exciting lives, or at least they're not exciting 'round the clock. Well, not so with Sheldon's duo heroines Catherine Alexander and Noelle Page. You have the choice of identifying with either French movie star Noelle (she of the blonde hair, violet colored eyes and awe inspiring sexual technique) or spunky career gal Catherine (the sharp brunette with great legs and comebacks). Noelle is the ultimate mistress, shrewd and inscrutable, while Catherine is the ultimate wife, determined to hold her man by any means necessary.There's always been a snag in the plot that's bothered me, though, and I've spent far too many years obsessing about it. (Do not scroll further if you haven't read the book.) Larry -- dashing, decorated pilot Larry -- meets young Noelle in WWII Paris and they have a blissful affair. When he has to ship out, he gives her money to buy a wedding dress, promising to return in a few weeks time. Needless to say, he doesn't. But if Larry had no intention of seeing Noelle again, wasn't there an easier way for him to ditch her? Raising Noelle's hopes by sending her off to buy a WEDDING DRESS makes Larry seem sadistic, when he's only supposed to be a devil-may-care type rogue. It also bugged me that when the lovers cross paths years later, Larry can't even remember luscious Noelle, or her now famous violet eyes. (The whole point about Noelle is that she's not like you or me, but unforgettable!)Anyway, this little snafu aside, \\"The Other Side of Midnight\\" is pure, spun candy perfection. It's surprising that the 1977 movie version was so weak, because the plot is blazingly widescreen, both physically and emotionally. (The clothes, by \\"Mommie Dearest\\" costume designer Irene Sharaff, and Susan Sarandon's performance as a brisk Catherine are the best things about it.) Sarandon complained in an interview at the time that the story was only soap opera, and yet the producers were treating it as if it were Chekhov. Yes, Susie, it's soap opera...but it's the ULTIMATE soap opera, bar none! Read it and weep, then continue the spree by running to the library to check out \\"The Two Mrs. Grenvilles\\" by Dominick Dunne..."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This book is so bad, it's good. The writer obviously doesn't take himself seriously. He is writing schlock, knows he is writing schlock, and is having so much fun writing schlock that his delight is infectious. When some conniving wretch reaches a dramatic resolution, one can almost hear the welling orchestral accompaniment. Great fun.It is refreshing to read a book that refuses to take itself seriously. Rather than masquerading as Something Deep, this book flouts its trash pedigree boldly. \\"Dahhling... have you ever met anyone so deliciously WICKED as Noelle? In the next chapter, we'll see just how much more WICKED Noelle can GET.\\" This book is campier than a pot-boiler on bennies.Books like this must be written over-the-top, or they don't work at all. The characters have to be caricatures, the setting has to drip with decadence, the plot has to twist and plunge like a runaway roller coaster and the prose has to reach such heights of garish camp that the reader gets nosebleed.And Sheldon delivers all this by the barge full.The manipulative witch, the love'm-then-ditch'm playboy, the wide-eyed innocent and the implacable billionaire, all have their respective moments. But they aren't just moments, they are Moments - teary-eyed (or steely-eyed) close-ups - the pores hidden with pancake makeup.While this type of camp-glam amusement isn't really my thing, I can understand its appeal. It takes personality types, pumps them full of steroids, then throws them into ridiculously overwrought situations to generate exactly the exaggerated absurdities that keep the pot burbling. If you like this sort of thing, Sheldon hits all his targets with the skill of an Olympic fencer."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"The Other Side of Midnight - Sidney SheldonA ReviewKnow this, reader, before you dare read this book: Once you start reading this book, your attention will be on it alone, and you will, without a doubt, be reading it to the exclusion of all other activities until it is finished. This general rule applies for all of Sidney Sheldon books, and with good reason.The first Sheldon book I read, Rage of Angels, became my favourite single book of all time. At the time, I was a fantasy genre only fan, but as soon as I read it, I knew that fantasy would not be the only genre I would read. Well, that was only several months ago, and now I'm reading other books by Sidney Sheldon, and others such as Michael Crichton, Nora Roberts as J.D. Robb, Anne Rice, Janet Evanovich, and Iris Johansen. Since Sidney Sheldon was the first author that got me into all books non-fantasy, I highly respected him and his writing.After reading Rage of Angels, I read four other Sidney Sheldon books. (His newer ones, none of his older ones!) They were all good, but none of them compared to, what I thought, was the best book of all time, Rage of Angels. Recently I purchased the Other Side of Midnight to discover what his other older novels were like.I just finished The Other Side of Midnight last night (I stayed up reading until nearly midnight, even when I wasn't supposed to!), and I am speechless. That night, I nearly cried in awe of how sad but great the book is. Truly, Sidney Sheldon is a legend and a prodigy of literature.The Other Side of Midnight is not just a book. It is nothing short of an epiphany. Reading it, I kept on forgetting that this book was written nearly three decades ago! (!973). This book is a flawless work of art, a masterpiece of writing and up to this day still one of the best fiction books of all time.Part of the reason I liked Rage of Angels so much was because Sheldon writes in a fashion so that one is really emotionally attuned to the main character. TOSOM was mildly different. When (Name removed so that no spoilers are given) dies near the end, I sighed in a depressed way, and continued on. That was all. But that alone gives some indication towards how powerful this book is. When one reads as much as I do, one becomes almost indifferent to the joys, struggles, and deaths of characters in books.When I reached the end of TOSOM, I shrugged and put the book back on my shelf. I wasn't tired, but I didn't want to wake up anyone else in my house by selecting another book to read in the morning. And then, as I lay in bed with the lights out, I reflected on how incredible this book is. It is flawless, and without a doubt, a contender against Rage of Angels for my favourite book I've ever read. One cannot begin to imagine how emotionally powerful this book is. Or should I say powerfully emotional? Both.What are my complaints? Well, like all Sidney Sheldon books, I hated the cover art. (Okay, let me explain something: nearly every Sheldon book has two different kinds of covers: one with the predetermined, default artwork on it. This artwork is usally made up of various objects reflecting elements in the book: roses, glasses, needles, etc. The other type of cover is a cheap, uncreative picture of a woman lying sideways, facing the reader, but in black and white, and very indistinguishable as to appear in some way, enigmatic.) The cover of my copy of TOSOM was as such. Why did I particularly despise the cover? Well, earlier this year one day, when I was looking at Sidney Sheldon books in a second hand bookstore, (Don't worry, I would never get any second-hand books!) I saw a really old copy of TOSOM. And yet, if I saw it again this day, I would buy it in an instant. Barely and vaguely I can recall the cover art (The shadows of two individuals, a woman and a man, against a sun rise/set, in a very beautiful setting!) And yet clearly I can remember the art to be undetailed and simple. I think this art was done with the movie in mind. (Yes, there is a TOSOM movie. Yes, it came out a while ago. No, I have not seen it. Yes, I am going to see it.) After reading the book, and bringing that cover art back into my mind, it sort of influenced my mind in a peaceful, serene, blissful even!, but sad way.There is nothing left for me to say, except that this book and Rage of Angels are the two most influential books I've ever read. What one reads slowly changes that one's outlook and perspective on things, and although some books do it less or more than others, TOSOM is possibly out of all the books I've read the one that has had the most profound effect on me.I'm not even enjoying writing this review by now. To me, it seems that my review interferes and violates the near-holy sacredness with which I now worship this book. That is because I feel my own writing talents, even though I am only writing a review for the book, cannot begin to accurately describe how unbelievable TOSOM truly is. This book is undeniably powerful to a nearly overwhelming extent.All I can say is that one, after fully reading this review, would be an utter fool not to read The Other Side of Midnight, if he or she has not already read it."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT is silly, insipid and over the top. A mess of a book. But an enjoyable mess. So much so it is unputdownable. Sheldon never falters from his high-gloss, nonstop suspense formula and delivers the melodrama goods with panache and style. His unidimensional characters may go through every impossible situation known to man but, boy, are the chapters engrossing. His scenes are as tight as his heroines' perfect attributes. He may not have written the All-American novel, but he has winningly delivered a bubble gum treat worthy of any beach read seeker.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"I really enjoyed this book and plan to read the sequel to it. If you have NOT read the book do not read the review from Signora_Inzaghi@Yahoo.com from England , July 24, 1999 below because she totally ruin the story by telling you what happens at the end. That reviewer ruined the book for me but I still read it knowing the ending."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"I don't why they bother giving the Nobel Prize for literature to the bleak plays of Harold Pinter (2005) or the dreary novels of Kanzaburo Oe (1994), when we've had such a great writer as Sidney Sheldon around for the past four or five decades. This is one writer who deserved the ultimate prize, although now it is - alas - too late.\\"The Other Side of Midnight\\" is perhaps his masterpiece. It is the story of Noelle, a naive young French girl who falls for a handsome American aviator during World War II. But when the war ends, Noelle waits in vain for her handsome flyer to return. Alone and abandoned, the young lady finds that she has to make her way by selling her body. She quickly discovers that she can make her sex appeal pay off and sleeps her way into movie stardom. All this time she keeps tabs on her aviator, who has returned to the US and started a family.Several years later, when he loses his job, Noelle, now wife of a Greek millionaire, arranges to hire her former lover as her private pilot. Not recognizing his wealthy boss as the fragile young mistress he knew during the war, he is bewildered by Noelle's cruel treatment of him. This game of deception leads them both into very deadly territory.A great book makes you want to read it. At the end of the day, that's the only prize worth struggling for: the prize of being read again and again and, in Sydney Sheldon's case, again and again and again and again..."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"I have read this book countless times. Reading books more than once is unusual, but this was intriguing. Sheldon did research for this book and pays off when the storyline takes you to the occupation of Paris during the second World War. What amazing detail! It really made me feel like I was living through that time. Don't miss the part when Noelle tries to help her friend escape the Nazis!! It had my heart pounding!! If you saw the movie and didn't like it, DO NOT skip the book. The movie left out the best parts!!"},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"Great read; couldn't put the book down. After reviewing other books by Sidney Sheldon, I saw there was sequel which is Memories of Midnight which also is a MUST READ. Look forward to reading more of Sidney Sheldon's books."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This book may never have won the Pultizer Prize or be labeled the best book of all time like Ulyssess - but its everything most of us want when we spend precious time on a book - it captivates from the moment you pick it up and read about beautiful Noelle and brilliant Katherine. It has everything - great characters, mystery, love, sex, killer ending, twists and turns. It has life of the rich and famous, a bit of life in Nazi France and outsmarting the Nazis. All in all - it entertains to the utmost. I listened to the audio - and had to keep driving around until I could get myself to stop long enough to park the car and get out. Loved it and can't wait to read/listen to the sequel."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This one's a winner, folks. If you're looking for a riveting story, here it is. Sheldon has a real talent for not only keeping you turning the page to find out what happens next, but also for creating fascinating characters. Psychologically healthy characters, no-- healthy people don't create (melo)drama. And Sheldon elevates the melodrama to an art form. Which it kinda already is, except not.The histories of Noelle and Catherine, our two leading ladies, really made sense of what they became later on in life. Again, excellent characterization. Surprising in this genre of fiction. Never did I feel the book got boring or dragged, nor were there characters whose scenes I looked forward to more than another's. I'd no time to look forward, as I was so absorbed in what was happening now (or then).I kinda sorta did see the ending coming, but I probably wouldn't have had not I saw the name Sidney Sheldon was synonymous with surprises/twists. Now that I've finished the book, it really seems to have gone the only way it could have gone, even though while reading it there seemed to be other possibilities. To make the reader feel that not a thing should or could be changed, that takes talent."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"I read TOSOM back in the day. It's one of those tales that has stayed with me over the years. I, personally, thought it was a brilliant plot.

Little did I know that earlier in his career he wrote the screeplays for two of my movie favorites and he was behind several great 1960's TV shows. Although the name is the same on all different media, I never made the connection until later. A very talented teller of stories, indeed!

It was great! I want to read the sequel. Great plot, twists and turns."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This is definitely a Sidney Sheldon masterpiece. I got so totally hooked by this story that I had to go buy the DVD and can't wait to watch the movie. Sheldon takes us through the time span of 1919 to 1947 and the lives of two women, Noelle Page and Catherine Alexander. We recognize how their characters were formed as children and the subsequent actions and reactions of their life experiences resulting in the amazing tale of money, power, intelligence and revenge. The focal point of their lives is summed up in the character of Larry Douglas, American WWII pilot, honored for his heroic efforts in the war. Prior to the War, he met Noelle and she fell head over heals in love with him. He promised to marry her, encouraged her to go buy a wedding gown and then never returned, initiating in Noelle, a lifelong desire of revenge. Larry moves on to become a hero as a fighter pilot, attaining the status of Captain and loving and leaving practically every woman he makes contact with. He meets Catherine Alexander in Hollywood, posing as an actor in an Army recruiting film. So enthralled by his charm, Catherine ends up marrying him very quickly. She is lured by his man-of-the world charisma and Larry uses her naivet&eacute; as the tool of conquest to take Catherine away from Bill Fraser, the man she is seriously involved with and a true friend to her as well. Larry has always enjoyed the hunt more than the kill and Catherine, in this case, became the \\"hunt.\\" Once the war is over, Larry is bored with his wife and his many routine piloting jobs which he cannot hold onto mainly because he can't deal with taking orders and following rules. Noelle has been following his every move through a private detective agency over the course of seven years, and decides this lull in Larry's career is the perfect time to seek her revenge. Sheldon is an amazing author taking the reader to France to tell Noelle's story, and then Chicago, Washington and Hollywood for Catherine's. Their lives merge in Athens, Greece where they all become connected to the Aristotle Onassis of the tale, Constantin Demiris. The climax and conclusion of this story takes so many twists and turns and of course hits the reader hard with the finale. I am on my way to order the sequel, \\"Memories of Midnight.\\" My cousin read this book 30 years ago and remembered what a masterpiece it is to this day; she recommended it to me. The fact that a story can stick with a person for so long, explains the greatness of its content and the magnitude of its author."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite books.

And considering the fact that I actually saw the movie first, (which was awful) that's really saying something. I felt for Noelle. It explains why she is so cold and uncaring to men. You really get in her head. And Catherine is easy to like also. Creating empathy for two rival women is a tricky thing to do, and Sidney Sheldon delivers with a punch. He is one of the greatest novelists ever. Don't pass up this book. The part where Noelle helps her friend who is a leader of the French Resistance will keep you on edge. This book is a great ride.

Noelle is an unforgettable character Sheldon created for us to love."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"The novel is excessively long. The first fourteen pages deal with the introduction of the trial in Athens, and the last sixty seven pages deal with the trial and the execution of Noelle and Larry. That leaves over five hundred pages to describe how the lives of the three main characters intersect. In order to fill those pages with content the author has chosen to vividly paint the sexual exploits of his players.Sometimes those details are borderline pornographic in content and certainly not called for to achieve the purpose of sketching a persons character and their motivations in life. For example, do we really need to know that Noelle rubbed cream on the p***** of one of her many lovers that caused his organ to experience heat while she had sex on top of him? Or would it suffice to say merely that she had developed expertise in bed?The novel has five hundred and twenty pages devoted to the sexual exploits of one or other of the characters, and very often it is not even germane to the story. For example, Noelle decides, during the Nazi occupation of France to assist the escape of a wounded resistance fighter by using an admiring and obsessed German general. This escapade, although mildly amusing due to its cartoonish portrayal of the Gestapo, has no bearing on the intersection of the three characters and how they become entangled in 1947.The novel also introduces some very annoying writing techniques that only break down story credibility, such as a co-pilot who declares that he pooped himself based on a landing in the fog. But weren't we told that he was a fighter pilot in WWII earlier? How can he be a brave fighter pilot with decorations in one passage and then a co-pilot who cannot retain his bowels in another? Wasn't England foggy during the war?This Sheldon effort is replete with these inconsistencies too numerous to mention and they merely serve to remind us that we are reading fiction. One last comment about this novel - the cover on my copy has a picture of a person in the 1980's walking through a gas station past a van identifiable as a late 1980 vintage, which is baffling, since the story is set principally circa 1940 and ends in 1947. This anachronistic error represents much of this overly long, flawed work."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This is standard Sheldon fare - cutthroats and graphic albeit cliche bedroom scenes. Same old story.Set during the 1940s, this book contains all of the ususal Sheldon fare including some poor editing. An example of poor editing was in the case of a character named Israel Katz, who had an amputated leg. Early in the book, it was his right leg and later in the book, his other leg was identified as the amputeded limb. Inconsistencies like that are inexcusable.Dramatis PersonaeCatherine - a silly, starry-eyed girl who has pie in the sky hopes like her dreamer of a dad. She has a crush on a boy in her senior class and when he somehow manages to convince her to spend a night with him, she makes bizarre comments and kills off a possible conquest.She drops out of college to work and becomes involved with one William Fraser, who is the only likable character in the book. A truly nice man, he has her interests at heart.Larry - a cruel, indifferent man. He manages to convince Catherine to marry him instead of Fraser. He would later jilt her for one Noelle Page after making attempts on her life so he can remarry. An erratic pilot, he is sacked from several airlines and mail runs before being hired as the private pilot for a Greek tycoon.Noelle Page - Catherine's foil; her opposite number. Noelle is a ruthless barracuda who was encouraged to believe she was born into a noble gentry. Instead, she was born in a fishing village in Paris, the daughter of another barracuda and an unknown sailor. The man she recognizes as her Papa sells her when she reaches puberty. She then goes on to seduce men and sharpen her teeth and claws.A Greek tycoon named Constantin Demiris who bears more than a passing resemblance to Ari Onasis takes in interest in the young barracuda. He woos her after a callous pilot named Larry who jilted her.These three lives collide. Larry supposedly kills Catherine and is executed in a trial after her disappearance; Noelle and Larry reconnect and Noelle meets a grim fate as well. A tale of revenge and excess, this one shares a place with other Sheldon novels. This is just too trashy for me."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"The book is almost 500 pages and it took about 250 to get to the intersting parts. The character development is incredible but the whole time you're like \\"well, when are they gonna be connected?\\" I previously read \\"Rage of Angels\\" by Sheldon and enjoyed that a thousand times more. I was a disgusted by Larry and especially Noelle. Adultury is a SIN!!!!!!!! I was disappointed to see Sheldon make it seem like it was no big deal. Not everyone has affairs and it is not normal.

Even though Noelle and Larry were completely immoral, despicable people, I could not help but feel sorry for them at the end of the book when they meet their ultimate fate. There were many twists and turns in this book and it really held my interest all the way. But if you think this book is good, read the sequel Memories of Midnight which is even better than TOSOM(if that is even possible) I highly recommend both of these books; Sheldon is an unbelievably gifted writer.(fyi, he is the same person who gave us the tv series &quot;I Dream Of Jeannie&quot;!!)"},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This book was yet another good one from sidney sheldon.The story is about two women ,Noelle and Catherine who both fall in love with the same man Larry.Larry promises noelle that he would marry her but then he has told it to many women.Noelle beleives him and then realises what had happened and then seekes revenge on Larry who is married to Catherine in a different country.Another important character in this story is that of Constantine Demeris who is a very rich Greek man and Noelle uses him without his knowledge to destroy Larry.Also I would like to point out the mistake that Sidney Sheldon has made : on page 246 in 'the other side of midnight it is told that Melina (Demeris's wife)told her outraged parents that Demeris had many affairs. But in ' memories of midnight' (part two in this two part series) on page 47 it is told that Melina lost both her parents when she was thirteen .

Noelle, a French girl, passionately falls in love with a soldier named Larry Douglas who is stationed in France. Noelle and Douglas passionately fall in love and decide to get married on his return from duty. They set a date and a special place to meet to get married but the soldier doesn't show up. Noelle, waits and waits and waits....feeling abandoned, and pregnant, Noelle realizes she's been jilted and plans her gruesome vengance. In the meantime, on the other side of the world, Catherine, an American girl who is somewhat naive, is engaged to marry a soldier, Larry Douglas - yes, the same man Noelle is in love with. Just when you think the story can't get any better, the story REALLY starts grabbing your attention. Every other chapter is about Noelle and Catherine and Sidney Sheldon masterfully intertwines the two characters love interests in such a way that keeps the reader wanting to know how the vengance of Noelle is going to come to fruition. It is not a surprise there was a sequel novel written (\\"Memories of Midnight\\"). I read \\"The Other Side of Midnight\\" over 30 years ago (published by Warner Books) and it is STILL my most favorite novel of all time. This was the first book I ever read by Sidney Sheldon and it was this book that convinced me to read all his other novels. \\"The Other Side Of Midnight\\" was made into a movie and I was pleased to see the producers followed the storyline to the letter with the exception of the color of Noelle's and Catherine's hair - which was more to my imagination. I also recommend reading \\"Master of the Game\\". It's another one of Sheldon's masterpieces."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"The master of insipid novels wrote his ultimate masterpiece (if we can call it by this name) in 1973. THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT is a real page-turner, you will read it in two days maximum... Of course, the usual Sheldon's flaws are all there for everyone interested to see (read) them, but I think this book is the benchmark for the expression \\"guilty pleasure...\\""},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"Atfirst I thought it was just going to be one of thoes mushy goshy romance novels, but once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! It is just full of suspence and it keeps you on your toes. You can really feel for both Noell and Cathrine. I love how you just just feel the jelousy and greed. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This book was very intriging without being bloody and gory. Each character had substance, either you loved them or hated them. Larry Douglas and Noelle Paige were definate &quot;hates.&quot; Also, I learned a great history lesson, too. Sheldon certainly did his homework on this one. Good til the end."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This book is awesome. Sidney Sheldon's absolute masterpiece. I've read it countless times and it grips me every time. And considering the fact that I actually saw the movie first, (which was awful) that's really saying something. I felt for Noelle. It explains why she is so cold and uncaring to men. You really get in her head. And Catherine is easy to like also. Creating empathy for two rival women is a tricky thing to do, and Sidney Sheldon delivers with a punch. He is one of the greatest novelists ever. Don't pass up this book. The part where Noelle helps her friend who is a leader of the French Resistance will keep you on edge. This book is a great ride. I can't praise it enough."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This is such a wonderful book I have read it about 5 times already. You can never put it down because you never know what is going to happen. As you read you learn so much about the characters and learn to love or hate them. Sidney Sheldon does an excellent job potraying each of the charcters own traits. Everyone should read this book because it has something in it for everyone."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"I might be only 18, but I thought this book was totally great and Iv'e read it about 40 times already! It's hard to describe as theres so many things in it! I like Noelle - she sounds really sexy and I like her character. I like the way she just dumps her men and walks out. Its also good at the end where she dies. Although, I don't think she should have died! It made the sequel more boring. Although it was good! If Noelle had stayed alive and Costas (the Greek one) had arranged for her to be 'let off' she could have caused all sorts of trouble in the sequel. Also, it's sad the way she dies when she remembers when she remembers when she was young in Marseilles, looking at the ships. This book should be read by everyone and everything. It's so gripping and memorable and Iv'e never read anything like it. I reviewed this book for my college course and I did so well in it, I got top marks and just talking about it makes me want to go to my room and pick it up again..... it's the only one by Sidney SHeldon I have, apart from 'Memories Of Midnight' and I would be delighted if anyone could tell me about his other books."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"Sheldon builds up the story in such a way you are really rooting for a different kind of ending, I was not prepared at all for the depressing ending...couldn't he have saved one of the characters, made him/her happy??? Very disappointed with the ending. Otherwise a good read."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"The story is about a beautiful French actress, a woman whom no man can resist. As she makes her way upwards using and bewitching people, she has only one thing in mind - revenge. This quest of hers takes her to different parts of the world, like Washington and Greece. It's a story about love, revenge and innocence. The end is totally unexpected and shocks you. Personally, I wish that the end was a little bit better. But the book is really enjoyable, and I agree that it can be your first if you haven't read Sheldon's books so far."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"All i have to say is that this book kicks ass. One grows up with the characters from whence they were kids, hence being able to identify with certain aspects of their character."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"Sheldon's classic. If you have never read one of his book, start with this one. You won't be disappointed. More than 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"Don't start reading this book unless you have enough time to finish it because there's no way that you can put it down once you start it. It has everything you could want in a story, comedy, sex, deceit, revenge, and a story that will stay with you throughout the years. I have all of Sidney Sheldon's books, and have re-read them throughout the years. But having loaned this one out and never getting it back, I was glad that I could still get a copy on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This is my first Sheldon book and I have already purchased four other Sheldon titles. For years I always thought Sheldon was synonymous with 'girlie' love stories until a friend recommended I read Other Side of Midnight. Boy, was I wrong. Too bad it took me 25 years to find out but great that I now know. This particular book has instantly shot up to my all time favorite list. And, gauging from other reviewers comments I won't be disappointed with his other books either."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"I was very pleased with my book even tho it was used. I would recommend anyone who is interested to order from your site. It is very convenient and my order was handled quickly and very well."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"What can one say about authors like Sidney Sheldon, Harold Robbins and the like? Their novels, while difficult to classify in a specific genre, would make fantastic made-for-tv movies. The Other Side of Midnight is no exception.The story of Noelle Page, a humble fisherman's daughter who became one of the most famous, powerful women in the world. A short affair with Larry Douglas leaves her pregnant and desperately in love, waiting for him to return to marry her. Larry, however, has completely forgotten his promise and moved on. Noelle vows then and there to spend the rest of her life seeking revenge against Larry.This long, sometimes confusing story entwines the lives of Noelle, Larry, and his wife Catherine. The opening scene reveals that Noelle and Larry are on trial for Catherine's murder.... the rest of the book deals with how they got there, starting with Noelle's childhood. It's a gripping read, definitely difficult to put down for more than a few minutes. The worst part, I think, is never being entirely sure who to feel sorry for. None of the characters are entirely evil or without some redeeming qualities, except maybe Larry.Ironically, this was made into a movie by 20th Century Fox. They expected it to be a hit, while Star Wars (made and released at the same time) was expected to be a dud, so they marketed the films as a package deal (theatres that wanted to book The Other Side of Midnight had to contract to book Star Wars first). Well.... it sort of backfired. Star Wars, as everyone knows, took off like a shot, and The Other Side of Midnight floundered and has long been lost to obscurity. The book was definitely much more poignant than the film. I'd recommend it highly as a distraction-read, but literature it ain't."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"I have been an avid reader for most of my childhood, teenage and now &quot;adult&quot; life but never have I read such an exceptional piece of fiction.

The best, I must confess, would have to be the sexual behaviors of Noelle! Man, I wish she were my girlfriend! I wonder if she got any fries to go with her shake! But on a serious basis, Sidney Sheldon is one of the best writers in the nation. &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot; is the book to surpass all books. I could hardly put it down. Whoever doesn't get this book, I say &quot;How weird art thou not to love this book?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This was the first book by Sidney Sheldon I ever read. And I think the best! I have read other books of his, but this one and its sequel are by far my favorites! I have read them over and over again! No others compare to them. The way he writes is so wonderful and flowing I could read it all day, and often did! I found it very hard to put down. He has a way of making you love Noelle, even though she has done some cruel things. And the shocking ending leaves you hungry for more! Sidney Sheldon is my favorite author and I hope he keeps turning out the books for years to come!"},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"I read this book about 16 years ago I'd say and it has been a novel that I have not forgotten.It has love, betrayal,revenge and it has a surprising ending.I find Sidney Sheldon's earlier work much more entertaining and more effort put into the characters and story line.His later work seems like everything is written too quickly and not as much time has gone into planning his storylines and characters.But it has been a while since I've read his newer books so maybe I should pick one up.He still is an author that I enjoy.This one and Master of the Game are two of his very best."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This is an incredible novel that I've read twice.

It was exactly as advertised and is a nice addition to my library. Great purchase!"},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"When I picked up this book for the first time, I was a little unsure about reading Sidney Sheldon's books. I was unsure because my only favorite author at that time was V.C. Andrews and I had never read any of his books. However, when I started to read this book, I realized that his style is nothing like Andrews. He has much more tension and backstabbing in his book.Anyway, I read this book when I was in high school and I still think about it today. I was not very happy when Larry decided to cheat on his wife with Noelle."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"Although I enjoyed this book, I had the misfortune of reading the sequel before the first volume. I discovered that you can save some money if you just purchase the sequel because he retraces every event in the first book so utterly thoroughly that it almost (ALMOST, mind you) gets tiresome."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"This is a book you could live without it. Sheldon describes the characters' lives from the very beginning, very well as a matter of fact, but the whole story is not that interesting."},{"Title":"The Other Side Of Midnight","review":"I didn't realize that the book was an old library book. I purchased it for a friend who loves this book but I am too embarrassed to give it to her because of the awful smell the book has.

There is so much information within these pages. These patents have been meticulously researched by it's author, who is also a professor at a well known university.

The amount of information is fantastic, and it's a great research tool. I'm delighted to have it in my library. But it was also a disappointment. It seems inconceivable to me that anyone would go to the enormous effort that went into compiling this information, then publish the book with only a handfull of patent drawings. That's the meat of the material, and it's in painfully short supply. It would have been most valuable as a resource if it contained a comprehensive set of drawings to accompany each of the patent descriptions. Without them, it's usefulness is greatly reduced. Still, I recommend it highly. I just hope there will be a second, more complete edition."},{"Title":"American Photographic Patents: The Daguerreotype and Wet Plate Era 1840-1880","review":"After reading the editors note on this book one is lead to believe that this book will give you information on 19-century photography.

His high-speed prose makes you dizzy with its name-dropping, pyrotechnics and barbs. Part farce, part satire and part pathos, The Chrysanthemum Palace, Wagner's fifth novel, secures Wagner a top spot in the pantheon of Hollywood novelist all stars, right up there with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Nathaniel West. As he ably demonstrated in first Force Majeure and again in his triple-play \`cellular trilogy,' I'm Losing You, I'll Let You Go and Still Holding, no one does Hollywood quite like Bruce Wagner.As The Chrysanthemum Palace opens, we meet the self-dubbed \`Three Muskateers.' There is Clea Freemantle, the fragile daughter of a long dead, once ravishing movie star of a certain era (reminiscent of Judy Garland). Then there is Thad Michelet, the rakish, 54-year-old Off-Broadway actor/straight-to-remainder novelist/\\"guest star on just about every CSI permutation to date.\\" Thad is the sole surviving son of \\"Black Jack\\" Michelet, a womanizing literary lion without peers. And finally, we meet Bertie Krohn, our narrator and the only child of Perry Krohn, the incredibly rich and successful creator of \\"Starwatch: The Navigators\\", the longest running, wildly popular, beyond cult status TV space soap. These three scions of the rich/famous/borderline immortal, are about to co-star together in a special episode of \\"Starwatch\\".Yes, nepotism is alive and well, and the trio of friends has Bertie's father to thank for their forthcoming celluloid adventure. One can not help but wonder where any of the three would be without their famous parent. How does one escape the shadow of \`genius?' Can one ever live up to an icon? These are questions that have dogged Clea, Thad and Bertie for a lifetime. Bertie notes in one of his many asides, \\"Sorry, folks, but it's true-at the root of everything is the need to please one's parents.\\"Open the book to any given page and you will find it studded with bon mots-the Hollywood / LA variety. No one on the literary or Hollywood radar screen, living or dead, is out of reach of Wagner's skewer. Here is Thad's mother, a photographer of sorts who is putting together a vanity coffee-type book of literary greats (which will most definitely not include her son), telling Thad who she's off to shoot next:Wallace Foster or Foster Wallace teaches nearby. Relatively. Someplace called Pomona. A lot of these colleges pay, Thad. Irvine too. Big, big budgets. They're going to drive me. Evidently they give him millions to teach. You know, he was a great fan of Jack's-they used to chat on the phone at indecent hours. Alice Sebold teaches there too. Her husband's quite well known, as well. A novelist. They're both bestsellers. I'm going to do both of them, then fly to San Francisco for Eggers and Michael Something.\\"Chabon?\\" Thad replies. His mother answers, \\"Yes\\". He won the Pulitzer. And I believe he makes quite a living writing screenplays.\\" To which Thad mutters, \\"Jesus. Mr. Spider-Man 2!\\"Or consider the exchange that occurs between Thad and the lawyers after the death of Thad's father and the reading of the will. It should come as no surprise that \`Black Jack' is still calling the shots even after death, having willed Thad $10 million dollars with one tiny provision: one of Thad's books must appear on the New York Times bestseller list. As the first lawyer explains to Thad, \\"I guess your father's intentions were that you use your gifts to write something either very commercial-a John Grisham, or what have you-a Da Vinci Code-or something artistic, with crossover appeal.\\" To which Thad retorts, \\"Bergdorf Blondes?\\" A second lawyer chimes in, \\"Not Bergdorf Blondes. Like The Corrections. Remember the guy who pissed Oprah off? Didn't that make the list? Some years back? I'm pretty sure it did. My theory-it's only a theory!-is that Jack was thinking of this as an incentive, a goal to work toward. A reward, if you will.\\" But inspiration soon strikes and Thad and his cohorts may very well have the last laugh.We trail the narcissistic trio through two weeks of filming as they hatch their plan to fulfill the codicil. From the \\"Starwatch\\" set to The Shutters Hotel to Disneyland, the three fast friends ricochet through the story-all the way to the Bun Boy Hotel and the novel's tragic desert denouement.The self-absorbed wannabes, the white wine swilling, the pill-popping, the AA meetings, the pitches, the agents, the lawyers-it's all there, and then some. Buckle up. You're in for quite a ride, and bring along a tissue. All but the most jaded will need it by the end."},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"I really wanted to hate \\"Chrysanthemum Palace\\"-the plot description and Bruce Wagner's penchant for punning titles had me ready to read it and rant. The first few pages didn't help either, full of relentless wordplay and pop culture trivia-why read something like this when I can watch \\"The Simpsons\\"? But somewhere around page 5, Wagner reached out from between the lines and absolutely grabbed me. He's some kind of genius-in only a few paragraphs he can sketch a character, weave him into a plot and weave the plot into a brutal critique of modern life, all while making you laugh and really feel for his creations. The pop culture patter updates some very serious and classic themes of family and friendship, yet he can let go with incredible bits like \\"a controversial, all-white version of 'A Raisin in the Sun.'\\" He's as close as I've seen to a modern-day Dickens, and \\"Chrysanthemum Palace\\" is as good a book as I've read in...weeks. Well worth a try."},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"does herself in? Thad -- well. The world was not worse off for such a morose beast in it, but tell me why I care about these characters?This is Gatsby in Hollywood, or Gatsby's grandchildren, mooning after what is lost, without anything elegaic or acknowledging in the doing of it. I didn't put the book down, but I didn't come away feeling I'd done anything more than survive Bruce Wagner's ennui.& I got enough of that on my own."},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"I am biased in that Bruce Wagner is one of my favorite writers, and this may be his most perfectly realized work. In the past his novels have alternated between the scathing and the poetic; this gem is for the first time a finely-wrought mixture of both: the scabrous and the elegiac, the hilarious and horrifying. The story of three friends working on a modern-day Star Trek-like TV series, in a Hollywood that is captured by sharp eye and pitch-perfect ear, it's a haunting and heartbreaking meditation on the wounds that leave their mark in art and how those symbols pulse and persist through the years, eventually to reach their targets. It ended too quickly and I only wish I didn't have to wait for Wagner to write another one. (And I can't believe I beat Harriet Klausner.)"},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"This book is written from the perspective of Bertie, an almost-middle-aged Hollywood actor and son of the fabulously rich creator of a Star Trek-like television program. Bertie wanders through his LA life with his childhood friend Clea, actor/ daughter of a Hollywood iconic star; and her older boyfriend Thad, a writer/actor also second-generation to fame and fortune. The group barely functions as they careen off Southern California landmarks, dropping names and going to the gym and hanging at the Chateau Marmont and AA meetings.At first, I thought the book was badly written and a little too Hollywood insider for me. There's Nick Nolte at Book Soup! Here's an anecdote about Brandon Tartikoff's funeral! I felt a bit stupid, like it was a book written for someone far hipper and cooler than I am. I was sure I wasn't getting the jokes because I'm outside that world. And besides, I wasn't sure I liked the characters, all trying to develop HBO series and make money and get recognition. The characters all have deep sadness in their lives. They're complicated people but a day at California Adventure gets as much attention in this book as a father's funeral.Yet, within a few chapters, I was enthralled. These characters are so vain, so delusional, trying so hard to stay on top of the pop-culture wave du jour, that I couldn't help feeling amused at their lives and conversations. They weren't smarter than I. I finally got the joke.This book is hilarious, a little sad, but definitely captivating. At the end, Bruce Wagner had me exactly where I believe he wants his readers. It's an amazing and deft work that makes a stark commentary on pop culture, fame and relationships."},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"So many authors have tapped into the seemingly unquenchable thirst of audiences eager to vicariously partake in the lives of the celebrated that it is easy to become blase about yet another venture. But wait, Bruce Wagner is a talented author and he puts his own stamp on the genre. I enjoy indulging in the Hollywood novel every now and again and this novel's up to the minute take on Hollywood is entertaining.Filled to the brim and practically overflowing with the requisite references to the famous hotels, streets, restaurants, mansions, movie stars, authors, etc., this book more than satisfied this reader's delight in reading about the familiar and famous.Wagner cleverly intertwines the real with the fictional.The story is told in the narrative voice of Bertie, an actor who is writing this, his very first novel. Bertie is telling the troubled tale of his own life and those of his two friends. All three are the children of the uber famous and successful. Each of them is haplessly striving to attain the approval of their dominating and oppressive parents through their own artistic ventures. Unfortunately, none of them can adequately measure up and all fall woefully short in their endeavors.This is not a book that one can haphazardly glide through. The excessive use of unusual and esoteric vocabulary is positively heady. The narrative exposition is rather convoluted and choppy. The prose is positively gymastic in it feats. However, where perhaps 10 somersaults would have been more than adequate the writer insists on doing 20! I was certainly entertained by the clever wordplay, theirreverent humor, the insider knowledge of Hollywood and the book world as well. There is a self conscious, look at me quality to the writing that is intended to impress and by golly it does.I will let the writing speak for itself in this abbreviated sampling:...\\"his father happened to be none other than that titan of our time, the singularly profane, lavishly gifted, beguilingly protean, salaciously elegant, carnivorously charming novelist who I presume was and is still known to most readers of these pages as both giant and giant-killer Jack Michelet - Michelet of the three Pulitizers and perennial Nobel short list, Michelet of the Lannan Prize...Michelet of the eight novels, countless screenplay adaptations, and three Academy Award noms...Michelet of the outrageously trenchant, scabrous, scholarly, dashed-off feeling yet meticulously crafted op-ed pieces....Michelet the now-and-then classically outrageous, outrageously classical rethinker, rewriter, and rearranger of Chevhov, Ibsen and Moliere....Michelet the mythic lion in winter of whom biographers and journalists high and low had gleefully written did not go gentle into that good night.\\"Whew! Are you having fun yet or are you becoming just a tad irritated? Speaking for myself, I need to consult my dictionary!"},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"This is a genuinely fun read for those who want to experience a rather jaundiced view of the inner workings of the entertainment industry, and author Bruce Wagner has a swaggering, scabrous writing style perfect in providing this perspective. Filled to the brim with his insider knowledge about Hollywood, Wagner's novel focuses on three friends who have grown up as the progeny of legends, spoiled misfits really, and now are fully ensconced in what remains of the dream machine.First, there's Bertie, who acts the part of a cocky pilot on a long-running \\"Star Trek\\"-like show called \\"Starwatch\\", created by his father Perry. But he is tired of what he considers hack work and tries to create his own show for HBO, an unpromising soap called \\"Holmby Hills\\". Then there's Thad, a hugely successful Robin Williams-type comic actor in his fifties, who is overshadowed by the far more serious reputation of his legendary novelist father, Jack Michelet, a three-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Thad's father is larger than life, to put it mildly, fulfilling his macho archetype by living a hedonist lifestyle, maintaining a high standing among the literati and being psychologically abusive to his son, whom he unfavorably compares to his dead twin in an \\"Ordinary People\\"-style twist. And finally there's Clea, Bertie's old friend and Thad's current girlfriend, who is the daughter of American screen icon Roos Chandler, who has achieved the unprecedented feat of winning three consecutive Oscars. Clea accepts Bertie's offer of work as an ingenious alien mechanic on \\"Starwatch\\" as a way of keeping ahead of her addictions.What Wagner picks up on quite accurately is the way everyone speaks in that cynical, campy, self-conscious language of Hollywood that you suspect real people there are really talking. It's all about one-upping the other person with a gallows humor laced with a patronizing, know-it-all attitude. They celebrate their hypocrisy when justifying why they would accept a job working on a commercial movie, even though they know they need to develop indie cred to develop the image they want. In fact, the three friends all have projects in development that they believe will stir their creative juices and bring them the respect they feel they deserve. The funniest is Clea's plan to develop a Seinfeld-type show about show business children starring herself and Thad, of course. On the other hand, Thad naturally wants to mount a one-man autobiographical show directed by Mike Nichols (just like Whoopi Goldberg). Your enjoyment of this book will depend on your interest in getting intimate with Hollywood studio politics and the lifestyles of the privileged Southern California ennui set. Despite such alienating trappings, Wagner actually makes us care about these quirky, never-satisfied characters, while giving us ample opportunity to laugh at their exploits. A great commuter read."},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"While not quite up to the standards of 'Memorial' his most recent (?) and definitely best book, 'the Chrysanthemum Palace' once again reveals Wagner's acid wit, viscious satire and fantastic writing. It can't be easy to create a book with 3 main characters who are all basically unappealing people, yet make you despartely yearn to find out what happens to them, and Wagner deserves credit for that. This is a well-written book about Hollywood, but not just about Hollywood. Definitely recommended, 'Memorial' is his high bar at the moment, although that is an incredibly dense and long and intricate work, this is a little easier to absorb, but still quite good!"},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"Bruce Wagner has bigtime talent. This book confirms the depth of his insight to motive, behavior, and the inner life of his characters. But this is a literary novel, and it contains the formulaic cancer of most literary novels. The cancer cause is 10% foreign language quotes, 10% esoteric/arcane references, 15 % authorial riffs (go on for pages sometimes)and 65% story with an ambivalent ending. Best novel ever, with none of these: The Horse's Mouth (ca 1945)by Joyce Cary (he's a guy, folks)."},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"I was preparing to fault Bruce Wagner for his swaggering, smug narrative voice in THE CHRYSANTHEMUM PALACE. But then I realized that pretension is more virtue than fault in this type of Hollywood insider novel. I haven't read anything else by Mr. Wagner, so for all I know the voice is more his than Bertie Krohn's, his protagonist. But it doesn't really matter. Here, at least, voice and subject matter form a perfect union.The same cannot be said of Mr. Wagner's m&eacute;nage a trois of central characters and any of the people in their lives. And that's a problem. It's a hard sell trying to engender any sympathy for the disgruntled, vacuous spawn of the rich and famous. Not impossible, but definitely not easy. And for me, the few attempts at pathos fall universally flat. I simply didn't care much.On the plus side there is much inventive word play and sharp humor. And Mr. Wagner is certainly au courant with our cultural benchmarks. Names are dropped on nearly every page and much of the roasting is right on target. But could it all be a little too hip and too trivial for its own good? It's too soon to tell, for example, whether the next generation of readers are going to remember Alice Sebold or Cameron Crowe, MILLIONAIRE or FAHRENHEIT 9/11. I suspect THE CHRYSANTHEMUM PALACE will have a short shelf life.What we are left with is a book that rates a solid three stars which, with limited time and an abundance of five star materials to choose from, just isn't good enough for me."},{"Title":"The Chrysanthemum Palace","review":"After reading Wagner's other work, and especially after reading Carolyn See's enthusiastic review in the Washington Post, I had high hopes for this book. But The Chrysanthemum Palace was a disappointment, a thin sketch of a story with weak, unlikable characters and a Hollywood backdrop that many writers -- including Wagner himself -- have made much more vivid. At about page 140, I skipped the next 50 pages or so and read the last 15 or 20 pages, none of which made me want to return to the part I passed over.Wagner is a talented writer and adept storyteller, so I'm rather baffled by this tepid effort. Maybe this was just one of those mistakes that writers occasionally make in selling an idea to a publisher, then finding that it really doesn't engage them or that they can't flesh it out well enough in time for a deadline.

But years passed and my life changed. More than that, my spiritual life took an unexpected turn. I had begun what I would now call a Gnostic journey. I wondered why my religion taught me (and my fellow followers) that the informed consciences of authority figures within the church were wiser than MY or (or others') informed consciences. Moreover, those authorities had the power to withhold certain religious consolations from me if I (or others) didn't adhere to their dogmas. While I questioned those teachings, I did not question my faith, many aspects of which were taught to me by the church. That is when I began to read Elaine Pagel's books on the gnostic gospels and discovered that there have always been seekers like me, and my discomfort with having to accept the dictates of someone else's conscience was neither new nor a sin. Eventually, longing for more prayerful reading, I remembered that I already had June Singer's \\"Gnostic Book of Hours\\". fThat was when every word in became enlightening. It provided teaching that I needed and direction that promoted spiritual growth rather than obedience. It helped me to shed negative feelings about myself and my journey. It has become one of my treasured devotional books. I have read it through four times and plan to continue reading it. I don't follow the traditional \\"hours\\" but read what I can each day. I would recommend this book to anyone who believes that wisdom is often found in one's own heart and yet who feels in need of some direction from ancient, time- honored sources."},{"Title":"A GNOSTIC BOOK OF HOURS","review":"The book of hours divides the day into eight periods of guided meditations designed to remind us of the divine presence in our everyday lives. Each period includes seven brief excerpts from Gnostic scripture - one for each day of the week - and is followed by Singer's sage commentary.Read daily at random, or straight through from beginning to end, these readings and reflections challenge, inspire, and comfort as they call forth the \\"sparks of divinity\\" present, though perhaps unrecognized, in every person."},{"Title":"A GNOSTIC BOOK OF HOURS","review":"I think any book that helps you build a habit of meditation and prayer is useful. Still, I was disappointed in this book. I was excited by the idea of it: excerpts from gnostic gospels and other ancient texts organized by the \\"hours.\\"The book is thus divided Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline, with each section containing a different reading in the same text for different days of the week. (Thus Matins contains readings from the Apocryphon of John for Monday, Tuesday,...) If you're practicing just one of the hours, say Matins, then you'll have a certain continuity as you move through the week.The selected texts are very good, although Singer sometimes lumps two or three separate pieces together for one day (especially with the Gospel of Thomas in Sext) which makes the experience more distracting than meditative. Unfortunately, each text is followed by the editor's reflections, which are not scholarly nor illuminating nor (for me anyway) particularly inspiring. At times she seems to fall into the old anti-Semitism that is the original sin of Christianity, at other times, to flatten out the rich textures. Maybe Singer's analysis is just dated (the volume was first published in 1992).Do use this book to inspire you to make your OWN book of hours."},{"Title":"A GNOSTIC BOOK OF HOURS","review":"This book is a jem.

As an Episcopalian, I am always looking for ways to deepen my spiritual experience, but I think, after reading these and the author's reflections, I am more convinced to remain in the mainstream, non-gnostic faith tradition. In true fashion like many other gnostic books, readings are very cryptic, up to any interpretation, and borderline being a bunch of boring, spiritual mumbo-jumbo. Basically, we have a divine spark, people. That is not hard to understand. We are sacred, we are created beings. We don't need the likes of Valentinus, Mani, Mandeans, Sethians, etc to tell us that, and \\"reveal\\" some grand truth that is hidden beneath everything. God did not put us here to confound us, but to love and enjoy us, as we need to enjoy Him (or Her, whatever your taste). I think many Gnostics, like the author, tend to be frustrated spiritualists, looking for new and different ways always to entertain their spiritual boredom. At risk of becoming as spiritually arrogant as doctrinal reformists, the Gnostics seem to be pretty sure of a lot of things. We must remember, however, just like many aspects of mainstream Christian theology, Gnostic beliefs are heavily influenced by convergences and asyncretizations of pre-Christian, hellenic, mythological, platonic insights and most definitely - human archetypes and attributes. The sacred is within. Celebrate it, seek it.

This is what you will find in this book. More accessible than the monumental 'Sartor Resartus', but at the same high level. I strongly recomend that book as a way to enter into the vivid world of Carlyle."},{"Title":"Past and present, (The modern readers' series)","review":"A review of Carlyle's Past and Present written in Carlylese (he's much better at it than I am...)This book could change the whole Western world, if only men would read it, and believe it! -We could have several Utopias springing up in North American and throughout Europe within the space of five years! So here you are. In this work, Carlyle criticizes the social, economic, and political arrangements in England of the 1840s. I will not bother to explain what those arrangements were; I will only say that his criticism is as relevant to us now as it was to the people of his own time. My friends, very simply put, then as now, we have 'parted company with the eternal inner Facts of this Universe, and followed the outer transient Appearances thereof...[we] have forgotten the right Inner True, and taken up with the Outer Sham-true.' Yes Carlyle's English is a bit strange, but try not to be distracted by outer appearances, that is his point! In many aspects of our Western life, we have forgotten what is true and at the heart of the matter, and taken up with superficial nonsense.Let's begin with economics. In Carlyle's day, the Industrialists were trying their damnedest to figure out a way to make the production of cotton cheaper. This is a sham! Instead, figure out a way, with all your cotton cloth, to 'cover all the backs of England.' How like our present day Global Economists, wracking their brains trying to get the poor fools of the Third World to buy our products. Why don't they stop a moment and see if everyone at home is yet sufficiently provided for. Do your own fellow citizens need what you are producing, or have they enough of it, need they some other product which it is in your power to produce? And what is this of Advertising? Carlyle remembers a hat-maker who built a seven-foot hat of wood and plaster; wheeled it about the streets of London to attract customers to his shop. Does this improve the quality or utility of your hats, man, or does it only fool people into thinking that you have done honest work? I begin to think that more money is made in Advertising in these times of ours than in any other enterprise. What are our cities but places to tack up Billboards, to display Clothes in shop windows, to produce commercials for television, all to fool people into buying rubbish they don't need. Don't Advertise, Just Work!Religion? Why all the silly ceremonies, the controversies, feuding between different sects. Do we need absurd ceremonies and idolatrous rituals to believe in a Divine Power? True Religion is 'Moral Conscience, Inner Light' 'All Religion [is] here to remind us, better or worse, of what we already know, better or worse, of the quite infinite difference between a Good man, and a Bad, to bid us love infinitely the one, abhor infinitely the other, to strive infinitely to be the one, and not the other.' A Religious man is he who makes his whole life an appeal to Heaven, to Divine Justice, to Goodness, and who cannot be happy if he do not always choose the right thing for his family, his country, his God and himself.Politics? Why do we continue to elect Bill Slicktons and Tony Blears, vicious Garry Condits and brainless Bushes, when these rotten Governors have in their own souls nothing to govern by. They are play-actors, nothing more, and very poor ones at that. Behind the smile, the make-up, the $400 hair-cut lies only one thing: 'impudent dishonesty--brazen insensibility to lying and to making others lie' Look into the souls of such men and what will you see: 'a general grey twilight, looming with shapes of expediencies, parliamentary traditions, division lists [like opinion polls], election-funds, leading articles...' The true leader, on the other hand, is a hero: he wants none of our material rewards, fears none of our punishments, believes that there is such a thing as eternal justice, will stop at nothing until he has made life better, happier, more fruitful for his fellow citizens. How do we elect such a man, instead of another politician, that is, another professional liar, wood and plaster dummy? We as voters must cease to vote wrong! How is that to be accomplished? Well that is not so easily done. We must all awaken from this state of enchantment, says Carlyle, must begin to learn to distinguish just and unjust, admirable and despicable in our fellow men, and in ourselves.

Also, the CreateSpace edition is physically attactive both inside and out, with an easy to read, clear typestyle and layout.A classic."},{"Title":"Past and present, (The modern readers' series)","review":"Carlyle begins Past and Present by noting that England has the economic paradox of possessing great wealth in the aggregate but little that filters down to the common man: \\"England is full of wealth, of multifarious produce, supply for human want in every kind; yet England is dying of inanition.\\" He sees that England's poorhouses are full of out of work and homeless families. He uses the word \\"enchantment\\" to describe the look on their faces as they tell him a collective tale of economic and domestic woe caused by job loss. The inability to maintain a satisfactory life style is not limited to the poor; the rich suffer as well though certainly they have a safety buffer of long standing savings. Carlyle counts more than two million who are forced to live in these poorhouses with no hope: \\"They sit there, pent up, as in a kind of horrid enchantment; glad to be imprisoned and enchanted that they may not perish starved.\\" Carlyle tells of a Tourist whose daily peregrinations take him past one such poorhouse. This Tourist is horrified at the mute, stupefied looks he sees printed on each unhappy face. The sheer numbers of those living there are staggering in their implications for the future of England: \\"You have to admit that the working body of this rich English Nation has sunk or is fast sinking into a state to which all sides considered, there was literally never any parallel.\\" Carlyle asks rhetorically: how did England come to such a sad state?Part of the answer lies in the nature of the hard to locate wealth, which he labels \\"enchanted.\\" It is everywhere but nowhere, he adds paradoxically as if its enchanted status is explanation enough. Carlyle suggests that the missing wealth is not missing in the physical sense since after all it must lie somewhere even if fallow. It is what its users do with the wealth that marks its utility and hence its presence. As far as the wealth is concerned, \\"What increase of blessedness is there?\\" He questions the happiness that wealth ought to provide. A man may have possession of money in his pocket but not have access to the goods that he might otherwise purchase. This lack of access is what makes his wealth seem invisible. Thus, when he again asks rhetorically, \\"To whom then is this wealth of England wealth,\\" he can lament only, \\"As yet no one.\\" In the midst of seemingly unlimited resources, there is a \\"fatal financial paralysis spreading inwards from the extremities.\\" He closes by alluding to Midas who was punished by the gods for arrogance. Whatever Midas touched turned to useless, and thus, fatal gold.When Carlyle wrote Past and Present, England was experiencing a severe economic downturn that would continue for nearly a decade. High unemployment was rife and hundreds of thousands were rendered homeless. Events continued to worsen until Carlyle felt that he had to do something to halt the slide. He had been working on a biography of Cromwell but due to this crisis, he shelved this project to write with amazing speed a book whose purpose it was to \\"shake\\" England out of its doldrums so that he could apply his various philosophical tenets as a cure. Past and Present was written as four books, with Book II dealing with events from England's past (hence the title). The other three focused on the present such that Carlyle could expatiate on what was then plaguing England and what cures he could offer. The problems were the same that he addressed in his other books: creeping capitalism, enervating moral degeneracy, a vanishing belief in matters spiritual, a growing trend to accept conspicuous consumption, and the lack of a Great Leader to set things aright. The cures were also recycled from those very same books: a focus on duty, work, and obedience to a Great Leader. In \\"Midas,\\" Carlyle alludes to the economic depression that he saw as tearing apart the British social and spiritual fabric. His grasp of economics is faulty in that he assumes that the root cause of England's various woes was due mostly to a shortage of goods to purchase rather than a lack of money to buy them. He implies that the blame for this belongs to those who were then suffering the most. Hence, there was a growing need for a Great Leader to arise to force the common man to plan his affairs with more prudence. Carlyle would spend the remainder of his life justifying this search for a Great Leader.Carlyle introduces one of his favorite themes: that the love of money is the root of all evil. But he does so in a roundabout way as he first discusses Heaven and Hell before he connects them with his theme. He writes that Hell is a concept that varies from culture to culture and individual to individual. For England, Hell is the gospel of Mammonism, which simply means that the desire to earn money trumps the need to help one's fellow man. \\"Verily,\\" he notes, \\"Mammonism is a melancholy creed.\\" Carlyle uses the murder of Able by Cain to illustrate the perfidy that wages allegedly played in the killing.The forced paying of unneeded money is the equivalent of going to Hell. An employer may pay lawful wages to an employee but the concept of paying more, say for maternity leave, would consign that employer to the darkest recesses of Hell.Carlyle is upset with any \\"ism\\" that threatens to supplant belief in a Higher Power. Should such one belief misdirect men away from their pre-ordained creed, then it follows that malicious cant becomes the order of the day. And if cant be the coin of social interaction, then there can never arise the true hero as a counter weight: \\"For if there be no Hero and the Histrio (loud orator) himself begin to be seen into, what hope is there for the seed of Adam here below?\\" The result can be none other than \\"We are the doomed everlasting prey of the Quack.\\" Such a Quack may maul and consume any man, but Carlyle is determined not to acquiesce passively: \\"Though he slay me yet will I not trust in him.\\" The world is replete with false heroes, quacks, moral dissolutes, and pre-converted Teufelsdrockhs. Carlyle tells an anecdote of a poor widow who needed medicine for a fever. She made the rounds of her city's welfare agencies, all of which rudely turned her away. She died in agony, but before her death, she passed on to others her contagion, killing seventeen of them. One doctor posed the question: \\"Would it not have been economy to help this poor Widow?\\" It was not simply a balance sheet thought process that denied her aid. She was turned away because those who could have and should have helped her had long since lost their souls. Carlyle's conclusion: The misuse of money is but the external manifestation of those who resemble human beings in all aspects but lack an immortal soul.Carlyle saw England in the economic bear hug of a capitalistic philosophy that required all concerned to value things over people. As soon as the majority of the populace accepted that world view, then it became inevitable that this culture was crumbling under the weight of its own excesses. The failure of man to help his fellow man opened the door to other equally invidious evils, one of which was the rise of the Quack. Carlyle held several spots open in his heart for the damnation of specified groups of miscreants. Chief among these was the Quack. As long as the Quack held sway, then the Great Leader could not arise. It became necessary for Carlyle as the Knight to slay the Quack-dragon, hence his willingness to postpone his beloved book on Cromwell for the moment. In the \\"Gospel of Mammonism,\\" Carlyle identifies and tries his level best to marginalize such false prophets. He would spend his lifetime doing so."},{"Title":"Past and present, (The modern readers' series)","review":"This is for sure a great book, if you have the ability to concentrate for more than five minutes, unlike the majority of the Herd, in mean people, of today.

Malcolm Dome's feuilletonistic writing style really takes away from the reading experience. Why does he have to refer to Ac/Dc as Acca Dacca throughout the book? That was extremely irritating.Also, all the research for this book stems from the files of either Sounds mag or Kerrang mag, sprinkled with some eyewitness accounts of AC/DC shows the author himself attended in the early 80's. That, to me, is just plain lazy. And even though the facts given in this book are acurate it still leaves you unsatisfied for the lack of detail.Overall I must say that it DOES show that the book was written by the editor of a modern day Rockmusic mag. It reads much more like an enthusiastic review of a scribe who wants to make sure to stay on the good side of the band for future advance copies of the 'next' record than the writing of someone who takes an actual interest in cold hard facts and real roadstories.

It does not mention the fact that,a long a show, it seems that drummer Phil Rudd, bassist Cliff Williams and Malcolm Young are having no fun at all.Also, it simply does not have the nerve to talk the truth: after Bon Scott's death, the band entered a never ending decline in terms of creativity, only bypassed by the majestic debut of Brian Johnson, BACK IN BLACK. Even if songs like WHO MADE WHO and HEATSEEKER made it to the charts, and that some album had good material, it was always below par comparing them to Bon's albums, always.The chapter about Bon Scott's death is full of wrong information.About Phil Rudd return's to the band, there's onnly a brife phrase stating that he came back to the band after \\"a four-year break\\"... Well, Rudd left the band in 1983 and returned in 1995. For me, it means a twelve-year break...There's also the caption of a photo saying it was taken in Cambridge, 1980.

Rather, this is Sproul's rejection of the soteriological portions of recent documents signed by prominent representatives of the Roman and Protestant churches in an attempt to bring unity between the two. He argues that despite claims on both sides that an accord on the subjects of justification, sanctification, faith, grace, etc. has been reached, no true unity has been attained - the two sides are still in disagreement over the nature of Christ's saving work.Further, Sproul argues that this attempt at harmony is damaging to the knowledge and spreading of the true Gospel as communicated in the Bible. He chastises Protestants for not knowing how to precisely and accurately put the Gospel into words and calls them to correct that problem before more damage is done.Don't let the other reviews fool you - this book is an excellent exposition of the Biblical position of the nature of mankind's salvation through the work of Christ. The series of Affirmations and Denials that constitute a majority of this book are one of the clearest defenses of this position you can find. But for those who are still not convinced or for those who seek to read even further regarding the Biblical and historical errors of the modern Roman position, see Robert L. Reymond's \\"The Reformation's Conflict with Rome: Why it Must Continue,\\" ISBN 1857926269."},{"Title":"Getting the Gospel Right","review":"This is a book that every evangelical who thinks Roman Catholics might actually be real Christians seriously needs to read! It is a sequel to Sproul's earlier book FAITH ALONE. While FAITH ALONE dealt with the controversial document EVANGELICALS AND CATHOLICS TOGETHER (ECT), this book analyzes, point by point, the more recent (Oct. 97) and similar document called THE GIFT OF SALVATION.Sproul does an excellent job of showing how two groups can agree on the wording of a statement yet at the same time have almost opposite views of what is actually meant. Although many &quot;politically correct&quot; people today wish to believe that Roman Catholics and evangelicals are both real Christians and saved, while only differing on minor points, the fact of the matter as Sproul shows, is that they are two divergent religions with two different gospels. Despite the good intentions of those who call Roman Catholics their brothers and sisters in Christ, they are actually doing them far, far more harm than good--just like a doctor who tells his patient he is fine when in fact he has terminal cancer.In the last section of the book, Sproul analyzes the document, THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST: AN EVANGELICAL CELEBRATION which he, helped draft. It uses more precise language both to affirm and deny what the real gospel is, including statements on sola fide (faith alone) and imputed righteousness. This document has been endorsed by over 100 evangelical leaders, including Charles Stanley, Charles Swindoll, John MacArthur, Jerry Falwell, James Kennedy and others including Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, Anglican and Pentecostal leaders.My primary criticism of this book is that it tends to read more like a report rather than an expostion of the gospel; nevertheless it's content is substantive. Sproul's other book FAITH ALONE goes into the history of sola fide (faith alone) and is more interesting to read in my opinion, but both are worth reading."},{"Title":"Getting the Gospel Right","review":"\\"Getting The Gospel Right\\" is R.C. Sproul's sequel to the popular book \\"Faith Alone: The Evangelical Doctrine of Justification\\" and is a thorough treatment of the subject of Christian unity. It is essentially a response to a document that tested the boundaries of unity between Roman Catholics and Evangelical Protestants: \\"The Gift of Salvation\\" (also known as ECT II) which was released subsequently to the original \\"Evangelicals and Catholics Together.\\" These documents were both written and signed by leading members of Evangelical and Catholic churches as a means to promote unity between the churches. They chose to find common ground and unite on that basis rather than focus on the differences that separated them. Sproul and several other prominent Reformed Christians stood against this document, insisting that it did not form an adequate basis for unity with the Roman Catholic Church.The book is divided into three sections. The first is entitled Controversy Concerning The Gospel and provides background to the importance of Christian unity in traditional Evangelicalism. The section functions almost as an introductory course to Christian doctrine regarding unity. Among other topics it discusses the distinction between the visible and invisible church, the marks of a true church and Christ's desire for unity.In the second section Sproul provides the complete text to \\"The Gift of Salvation\\" and then provides a thorough examination of each paragraph. His amazing depth of knowledge allows him to delve deeply into the document and point out many problems with it. He shows where the language is ambiguous and goes into lengthy explanation about the differences between the Catholic and Protestant views on soteriology. His conclusion is that the two systems of theology are so far removed that they cannot be brought into harmony. \\"The Gift of Salvation\\" does nothing to remove the doctrinal chasm created by the simple word \\"alone.\\" Until Rome concedes on the \\"solas\\" of the Reformation, there can be no unity. Further, unity on such terms as outlined in this document is damaging to the Evangelical churches as it undermines critical theology. There can be no unity without unity in the gospel, which means there certainly cannot be unity at the expense of the gospel. The unity expressed by the signatories of \\"The Gift of Salvation\\" is empty since it denies the importance of obvious and insurmountable differences in doctrine.The final section is an examination of a document drafted by Sproul and other leading theologians entitled \\"The Gospel of Jesus Christ.\\" They feel this document should provide the basis for unity among Evangelicals. \\"The Gospel of Jesus Christ\\" carefully and consistently lays out the foundations of Protestant theology, leaving absolutely no room for ambiguity. As with the previous document, Sproul examines it paragraph by paragraph, explaining the meaning and importance of each of the affirmations and denials. Sproul says that \\"[the affirmations and denials they list] are the foundation that expresses the mission of the church. For the church to be faithful to the Great Commission, we must get the gospel right. When we do, we will both energize the church's activity and encourage deep and abiding unity among Evangelicals.\\"This book is as good a treatment of the subject of unity as I have read. While deeply theological, it is also very readable. Sproul has a gift for presenting deep truths in a way that is easy to understand. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning what the Bible says about unity, and further to people interested in an overview of the doctrinal differences between Protestants and Catholics."},{"Title":"Getting the Gospel Right","review":"This is a *MUST READ* for any Christian who claims to be an EVANGELICAL. Baptists &amp; Presbyterians, Reformed &amp; non reformed brethren can find the truths in this book to be non negotiable. Boice was right when he said &quot;This is a must read for all who care about the ospel truth in an agae of theological compromise and confusion.&quot;This also helps to see the differences between Protestants and Catholics on what the Gospel really is."},{"Title":"Getting the Gospel Right","review":"It should be noted from Art Sippo's review that he is strongly Roman Catholic, so why should we be suprised that he does not come to the same conclusions about the Gospel as evangelicals do? What we should be suprised by is the fact Mr. Sippo could be so blind that he could see right past the cover where it says &quot;The Tie that Binds EVANGELICALS Together&quot;. He is right about the fact that this isn't a defense of sola fide. But then again Dr. Sproul makes it quite clear that it isn't intended to be. This is a call for evangelicals to get their acts together. Mr. Sippo's anti-evangelical bias was the sole basis for his reveiw. I suppose my frustration towards Mr. Sippo was mine. Dr. Sproul couldn't make it clearer in the opening pages that this book is for the evangelical community. Mr. Sippo's review is essentially irrelevant for that reason."},{"Title":"Getting the Gospel Right","review":"I can sum this up pretty quickly. This book explains the importance of getting the Gospel right, the unity found in the Gospel, and the particulars of the Gospel. It was written in reaction to the Gift of Salvation document between some Catholics and Evangelicals. Sproul is a master of easily explaining rich theological issues. Very compact and straighforward. I used this as a primary source when I gave a lecture on &quot;what is the Gospel.&quot; If you like this, I would suggest getting Sproul's &quot;Faith Alone.&quot; Also take a look at John MacArthur's &quot;the Gospel According to Jesus.&quot;"},{"Title":"Getting the Gospel Right","review":"Sproul demonstrates that Roman Catholicism and Evangelical Protestantism are simply not in agreement when it comes to the essential issue of how a person is justified before God--and both ways cannot be correct. At one time in church history, both sides recognized this and felt passionately about it. Now, fuzzy theology and \\"spiritual\\" experience has tended to blunt the sharp edge of biblical and theological truth.Readers in either camp should be happy that the issue has been clarified. The quest for unity at the expense of truth--or even truthfulness about the positions in question--is not helpful. Let each side figure out what they believe and try to convince the other--but let us be done with saying that we all believe the same thing when there are clear and critical differences!If you want help in understanding those differences and in understanding how you can be sure of your eternal destiny through faith in Jesus Christ alone--and not having to wait for some final judgment you have no hope of surviving--read this book and anything else Sproul has written along with the New Testament.Grace alone, faith alone, Christ alone!"},{"Title":"Getting the Gospel Right","review":"I normally really enjoy reading Sproul, but the Catholic-bashing and slamming of those friendly to the Catholic Church in this read is just too much. I have to say, my view of Sproul has changed a good deal after reading this, and not in a good way. If I could give it zero stars, I would."},{"Title":"Getting the Gospel Right","review":"THis book is probable the best written on the subject of the gospel.

Sproul is one of the finest preachers in the nation! His books are even better! Agree with nearly everything he says in this delightful, easy-to-read book."},{"Title":"Getting the Gospel Right","review":"This is a very disappointing book. Sproul correctly identifies the important distinctions between the Traditional Christian position on justification and the innovations of the 16th Century Protestants. What he fails to do is to show why we should believe the Protestants instead of the traditional position held by the Eastern and Western Churches. Sproul treats the opinions of the Protestants as if they were infallibly true and does not allow the possiblity that they could have been wrong. He is so busy stating that the Catholic Church has not changed her position on this matter that he does not honestly tell us why she should. In the light of modern Biblical scholarship, it is no longer possible to maintain that Luther and Calvin were interpreting the Bible correctly in this or other controversial matters. In fact, the Traditional Christian opinion is clearly more faithful to that of St. Paul than the positions taken by the Protestants. Sproul needs to read some recent literature and stop defending the errors of the 16th Century.Arthur C.

Also, the overuse of ninjas and Godzilla are further anachronisms in a novel that is fruitlessly trying to be relevant, daring, and realistic.Simply the worst book I have ever seen. I wish I were blind."},{"Title":"The phenomenology of mind (Library of philosophy)","review":"I just noticed the other review of this book, giving it one star and claiming it is not worth the effort; I wanted to add something to counterbalance that review. First, the other reviewer is right that this is a very difficult book to read on your own, especially if you don't have a significant background in philosophy. But that is not necessarily an objection to the book. It would be silly for me to criticize a book of theoretical physics just because I didn't have the background necessary to understand it (and wasn't prepared or willing to learn from others who do). In spite of the difficulty, this is a very important book. In terms of scope and level of insight it is almost without parallel in the history of philosophy.The argument begins with an investigation of the experiential basis of objective knowledge, proceeds to show that our experience of objects is rooted in our understanding of ourselves and that this is inseparable from our relationships with other people. The text aims to show the interconnections between a wide range of social and historical or institutional forms of knowing and acting, and concludes with a demonstration that thinking is inseparable from the intersubjective and socialized formations of reality it aims to describe (and that the history of these formations is essentially a history of the thinking that gave rise to them, i.e. that \\"thinking and being are one\\").On another note, it is worth celebrating the fact that Baillie's translation is now back in print and being published by Dover. While not technically as accurate as the more popular Miller Translation of the Phenomenology of Spirit, the Baillie version is a nice complement that in many cases reads more clearly than Miller's and serves as a helpful tool to illuminate difficult or obscure passages (Note that in spite of the apparently different title, this is the same book as the Miller translation that Oxford publishes under the title \\"The Phenomenology of Spirit\\" -- just a different translation choice for the German word \\"Geist\\" = \\"Mind\\" or \\"Spirit\\"). There is, though, no getting around the fact that this book is in many places difficult and obsure, and becomes clear only with great difficulty. The payoff for such effort is enormous. (A helpful guide to reading Hegel, called \\"Reading Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit\\" by John Russon, was recently published.)"},{"Title":"The phenomenology of mind (Library of philosophy)","review":"I took an undergraduate course in social and political philosophy at Penn State in 1968. The syllabus listed four books as required reading: Marcuse's One-Dimensional Man, DeBeauvoir's The Ethics of Ambiguity, Plato's Republic, and Hegel's The Phenomenology of Mind. None of the books was light reading, and findiing common themes that intimated their kinship for inclusion on the same reading list was not at all easy. Of the four, the one that was far and away the most difficult was Hegel's Phenomenology.Fortunately, the instructor and his teaching assistant took Hegel very seriously, and they spent a good deal of time helping their students understand his extrordinarily convoluted and determinedly dense prose offerings. Otherwise, I can think of only one member of the class of about thirty students (definietly not me!) who would have been able to get through The Phenomenoloy with even a modicum of understanding.As it was, I still had trouble grasping the way the instructor wanted us to understand crucial ideas such as the unhappy consciousness and the master-slave relationship. Nevertheless, perhaps because I was majoring in sociology and had taken a couple of courses in social psychology, Hegel's treatment of the emergence of an individuated self struck me -- and still strikes me -- as simply brilliant. In the beginning, one experiences one's self as everything. There is no other. Inevitably, however, resistance is encountered, and the notion of an other -- something alien to the all-econmpassing self -- becomes apparent. This, in its most basic Hegelian form, is alienation, meaning in the abstract, the reality of otherness. The dialectical process, involving repeated encounters with, and accommodations to otherness results in the emergence of a concrete, self-aware, and individuated consciousness that knows that alien social terrain is inescapable.The very idea of an individuated self and the necessity of its emergence had not occurred to me before I read The Phenomenology. It is, after all, something we take for granted, recognizing it unself-consciously, but without awareness. The fact that Hegel could use the dialectical method to identify and explain its emergence was, in my view, a manifestation of unqualified genius in speculative philosophy.It remains true, however, that those who complain that Hegel could have written with much greater clarity, making The Phenomenology accessible to a broader eighteenth century (and now a twenty-first century) audience have a point. Perhaps Hegel anticipated that his only readers would be scholars such as himself, but even in his day, that was not the case. After all, Kant had earlier written the Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics to assist readers with The Critique of Pure Reason.As it is, I cant imagine getting though The Phenomenology without a good deal of help. Having come to terms with The Phenomenology, however, one will recognize Hegel's influence on important twentieth century authors, such as Geogre Herbert Mead and Muzafer Sherif. Their understanding of the emergence of an individuated self is deeply indebted to The Phenomenology of Mind.Exposure to the difficulty of using the dialectical method, even before Marx made it an instrument of philosophical materialism, is also informative. It makes it easier to see why Lenin said of the brilliant Bukharin, \\"he never understood the dialectic.\\" The dialectical method is definitely elusive, slippery, and at odds with usual ways of thinking. Even for brilliant people the dialectical method can pose problems.Hegel's later work is easier to read, but it is, I think, of mainly antiquarian value, especially for those interested in studying German idealism. With some assistance, however, The Phenomenology of Mind will leave a lasting impression, providing insights that will inform the rest of one's life."},{"Title":"The phenomenology of mind (Library of philosophy)","review":"For some reason an Author alphabetization on my Kindle places this item under \\"Georg\\" instead of under \\"Hegel\\"."},{"Title":"The phenomenology of mind (Library of philosophy)","review":"and also with understanding.Without referring to prior reviews (see GUIDELINES) I wish to thank the learned professor for indicating why this is the most important book to read.And I thought that was Finnegans . . .

I finished it a week ago. I turn to the back pages where my notes would be to find I made none. If anyone other than me ever tells you he read this opaque monstrosity, this Finnigans' Wake of philosophy, he is almost certainly lying. I dog-eared the bottom of a few pages, which is my way of signaling that there is something there which may be interesting but not succinctly quotable. Rereading those pages in preparation for the fulfillment of my promise, I still find little to distill.From page pages 399-401:\\"If we put both sides of the universal ordinance over against one another and consider them, we see that this later universality has for its content restless individuality, which regards opinion or mere individualism as law, the real as unreal, and the unreal as real. That universality is, however, at the same time the side of realization of the ordinance, for to it belongs the independent self-existence (Fursichseyn) of individuality. The other side is the universal in the sense of stable passive essence; but, for that very reason, the absolutely non-existent, but still not an actual reality, and can itself only become actual by canceling the individuality, that has presumed to claim actuality. This type of consciousness, which becomes aware of itself in the law; which finds itself in what is inherently true and good not as mere individual, but only as essentially real; and which knows individuality to be what is perverted and perverting, and hence feels bound to surrender and sacrifice individualism of consciousness - this type of consciousness is Virtue.\\"...\\"The mood of moral sentimentalism is reduced to confusion and contradiction: but the subjective individualism in which it is rooted is not yet eradicated. Individualism now takes refuge in another attitude which claims to do greater justice to the inherent universality of rational self-realization.... The World's course is this to owe its goodness to the efforts of the individual. A struggle ensues, for the situation is contradictory; and the issue of the struggle goes to prove that the individual is not the fons et origo boni, that goodness does not await his efforts, and that in fact the course of the world is at heart good; the soul of the world is righteous.\\"The attitude analyzed here is that of abstract moral idealism, the mood of moral strenuousness, the mood that constantly seeks the improvement and perfectibility of mankind. It is found in many forms, but particularly wherever there is any strong enmity between the \\"ideal\\" life and the \\"life of the world\\".A mere 179 pages later I found this gem:\\"As everything is useful for man, man is likewise useful too, and his characteristic function consists in making himself a member of the human herd, of use for the common good, and serviceable to all. The extent to which he looks after his own interests is the measure with which he must also serve the purpose of others, and so far as he serves their turn, he is taking care of himself: the one hand washes the other. But wherever he finds himself there he is in his right place; he makes use of others and is himself made use of.\\"Different things are serviceable to one another in different ways. All things, however, have this reciprocity of utility by their very nature, by being related to the Absolute in the two fold manner, the one positive, whereby they have a being all their own, the other negative, and thereby exist for others. The relation to Absolute Being, or Religion, is therefore of all forms of profitableness the most supremely profitable. . .\\"Belief, of course, finds this positive outcome of enlightenment as much an abomination as its negative attitude towards belief. This enlightened insight into absolute Being, that sees nothing in it but just absolute Being, the etre supremen, the great Void - this intention to find that everything in its immediate existence is inherently real (ansich) or good, and finally to find the relation of the individual conscious entity to the Absolute Being, Religion, exhaustively summed up in the conception of profitableness - all this is for belief utterly and simply revolting. This special and peculiar wisdom of enlightenment necessarily seems at the same time to the believing mind to be sheer insipidity and the confession of insipidity; because it consists in knowing nothing of absolute Being, or, what amounts to the same thing, in knowing this entirely accurate platitude regarding it - that it is merely absolute Being, and, again, in knowing nothing but finitude, taking this, moreover, to be the truth, and thinking this knowledge about finitude as the truth to be the highest knowledge attainable.\\"the juice not worth the squeeze"},{"Title":"Conversations With Neil's Brain: The Neural Nature of Thought and Language","review":"Conversations with Neil's Brain By Calvin &amp; Ojemann.Reviewed by Dr. Charles FinlayThis is a trip through the brain, &quot;Neil's Brain,&quot; Traveling through dendrites, axioms, and the web of the neuro-cortex into a better comprehension of what the brain does.

And cake. Readers will delight in the hometown feel of the book's pacing and long for the simple life, with a few mysteries thrown in, such as that in the much-loved Mayberry RFD scenarios. Only instead of the Carolina's, David's Bridge is a small town in Virginia; and as in all small towns, its residents, their individual habits, hobbies and quirks define the character of the place. David's Bridge is no exception.Bailey has inherited her father's investigating business, as well as the law enforcement relationships he built. As her father's daughter, Bailey not only continues to fill her father's shoes, but adds a feminine flair as well. Single, smart and savvy, this heroine is ripe for romance and intrigue-but she also enjoys hot cocoa and spending time with her cat, Eddy, when he's not destroying her favorite bunny slippers.The \\"mystery\\" of David's Bridge is multi-layered, beginning with a simple set of background checks on candidates for Jaqueline Ranier's personal assistant. Ranier, along with her husband, owns Triple Oaks, a wealthy horse farm.A bigger mystery is uncovered, though, after torrential rainfalls reveal the bones of a long-missing womanizer whose favorite prey were the women of the area estates. How do background checks on prospective employees tie in with an unsolved murder? This question keeps the pages turning in David's Bridge.The candidates seem simple, at first. Grace, an 18-year-old local airhead with no experience, except in the field of man shopping; Tammy, a shy but talented seamstress and typist, and a horse lover to boot; and Valerie, presently employed as a personal secretary at another large horse farm near Charlottesville.As Bailey begins her investigation, unusual facts about each candidate become known and pique her interest to go a step further and find out the underlying motivation of each of the applicants. Bailey becomes curious, careful..., and conniving when a series of hang-up calls, a misspelled warning note and a threatening photo of Eddie the Cat follow one another early in the investigations.Pros: Interesting mysteries and a well-thought out twist tying them together. Characters are believable and interesting.Cons: Dialogue is a bit overdone (common in first novels) and unnecessary information slows the pace of the story. The back cover blurb should have guided the book's plotline-the touted mystery is not introduced until two-thirds of the way through. A flip-flop of the plot line could easily solve this problem.Recommendation: If you like quaint, hometown intrigue, this is the book for you, and more will follow. If you like fast-paced, sophisticated intrigue along the lines of Grisham and Sanford, this is not your cup of tea - but give it a try anyway, for a change of pace.Bottom line: This is an author to watch as she works out the kinks in plot development and writing style. With a few minor touch-ups, such as switching around the plot line and tightening the dialogue and narrative, The Mystery of David's Bridge is a more than a worthwhile read. It is a jewel to treasure and take out to rediscover time and again. I predict the next book in the series will be faster moving as the author has introduced the backstory in this first of the series. I will be reading the next book to follow Bailey Ferrol's escapades."},{"Title":"They Mystery of David's Bridge","review":"There is so much intrigue and mystery in The Mystery of David's Bridge it is just amazing.

Some of Mutt's antics were particularly hilarious. As far as dog memoirs go, however, this was not one of my favorites. It did not feel very cohesive - more of a collection of \\"Mutt's Best Moments\\" than a true story of the relationship between a Mowat and Mutt. It was entertaining, though, and some of its most interesting parts were the glimpses into 1930s Canada."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"This is a beautifully told story of a boy and his dog, but it is the reminiscence of a grown man, and thus the literary style may be too advanced for a child. For instance, a dust storm is described in the opening paragraph: \\"the earth had obliterated the sun . . . lifting high on autumnal winds, the desecrated soil of the prairies drifted northward; and the sky grew dark.\\"I purchased the \\"school and library binding\\" edition and was disappointed, since it was intended as a gift. The book is very small and the paper is not of high quality.

Farley Mowat is a great Author."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"The Dog Who Wouldn't BeBy: Farley MowatReviewed by: Catherine LiThis book describes the life of a boy (Farley) with a dog named Mutt. Mutt was adopted by the author's mother when he was a puppy and was found by a boy who was selling baby ducks. Mutt was a very unique dog because he had excellent hunting skills. He could dive really deep to catch ducks under the water. Whenever the author's Dad fired his gun to hunt birds, Mutt could always retrieve a bird back even if the author's Dad missed his shot. Besides his hunting skills, he had ability to walk on fences, ladders, and trees - just like a cat! The first time he tried to walk on a fence he fell, but he kept trying until he was able to master his balancing skills on a narrow fence. Mutt was a very determined dog.I really enjoyed reading this book because the writing describes a lot of details. The writing is very descriptive, and I could picture all the events in my mind. I love the huge vocabularies the author uses to make the sentences complex. \\"A swirl of muddy water marked his passing, and in the center of the swirl thee was a whitish blob that twisted back and forth lethargically.\\" The author writes lengthy and quite difficult sentences. I remember when I tried reading this book a year ago, there was at least five to ten words I did not understand.The author described the hunting skills and tricks Mutt could do in very expressive writing. Each chapter was extremely long, however I never got bored and kept reading. The events the author chose very amusing and thrilling. For instance, \\"The last jump took him well into deep water, and he began churning forward like an old-fashioned stern-wheeler.\\" This book is so descriptive that it make the readers feel like they were really living in the Canadian plains.I found this book very fascinating, especially when Mutt learns how to climb ladders, trees, and fences. My favorite section of this book is when Mutt climbed on top of a tree and there was a group of firefighters surrounding the tree. This section of the book is amusing because everyone thought it was a huge monster in the tree. Two people were holding guns and they called the firefighters to this event. It is a book worth reading. It has humorous stories and touching events. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"This is a light-hearted book by Farley Mowat, a writer with whom we normally associate more serious texts. Yet Mowat is just as fun-loving as the next person and it comes out in this collection of stories about his youth in Ontario and Manitoba. Mutt, the dog of the book's title, is a dog who very reasonably refuses to act like one. So he won't hunt ducks properly or do much else that is reckoned too dog-like, at least while anyone's watching. Mutt was Mowat's constant companion throughout many boyhood forays into the wild country around wherever he happened to be living. On the prairies in the 1920s and 30s, he says, it was easy to get out in the bush, because it started right where the town stopped. You just had to walk out. So began Farley Mowat's lifelong love of the natural world. Indeed, he made a pretty good naturalist by the age of ten and earned himself a minor living for a time, through the dubious activity of collecting birds' eggs. This is an easy book to get along with and one that would probably be enjoyed by children. Indeed, I assume it may well have been intended for Mowat's own children. I thoroughly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"Farley Mowet's mom bought a dog from the milk man.

Chapters were doled out carefully and we each had our favorite. Mutt's determination to level the playing field by fence walking like the neighborhood cats, was my favorite.Yes, you could call this book dated. It was written about a time in the past (1930's in Saskatoon, Canada) but it has the universal themes of relationships, discovery and the sadness of parting. That is what makes it relevant to young readers today. Set aside your 21st century 'tsk, tsk' about things like hunting, leash laws and the role of women. It brings readers to a time when life was not measured by potential limitations and dangers, but by anticipation of adventure and unregulated childhood. It is a simple story about a real boy and a real dog in a long ago time. They loved each other and that's what mattered.The good news is my sister has purchased this book for her grandsons, who love it. It has sparked conversations about the ways in which life is different now, but the bottom line is the boys love the book and their dog and that's all what matters to them."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"This is THE GREATEST BOOK to ever be written by any Canadian author.

But the tales of Mowat and his companion are hilarious and even inspire some thought provoking discussions in a classroom setting. A good read for the 10-and-under crowd."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"\\"The Dog that Wouldn't Be\\" by Farley Mowat is both a memoir of youth during the 1930's and personalized history of his dog Mutt. Like the best of Mowat's writing, this book focuses on a particular period of the author's life with irreverent humor and bitter sweet nostalgia. Many of Mowat's books concern animals and he is very much able to articulate how important pets can be in the life of a family. His writing is anthropomorphic in its ability to place human characteristics into a variety of animal species. All pet lovers feel how animals become part of the family and take on personality all their own. Mowat's writing shows how even the lowliest of mutts can live a full life and effect all those who come into contact with him.Another strength of this book is its appeal for all ages. It takes quite a bit of talent to write a family appropriate book while keeping it interesting for older readers. Mowat's humor is his main capacity that enables him to do this. As he looks back on his youth the reader can feel both the excitement and innocence of childhood and how Mutt was such a part of the author's maturation.Mutt's beginning was quite ignoble as he was simply given away to the Mowat family. He got himself into all kinds of mischief in the various towns the author lived in during the 1930's. Through Mutt, Mowat explores his formative years on the Canadian prairies and the various adventures and travels he undertook with his mother and father. The Canadian wilderness also features prominently in the book as Mutt is Farley's constant companion as he increases his knowledge of the natural world and grows into adulthood. You might also say that Farley and his dog \\"mastered\\" their surroundings, both in the countryside and in town.Besides Mutt there are several other characters that play into the book. The Mowat's were certainly nature lovers, often to the point of absurdity. Farley amassed such a collection of wild critters and pets in his house that they often butted heads, which provides the book which a lot of comic relief. Though there are numerous asides with various gophers, squirrels, owls and cats, Mutt is the author's prime companion. Whether its on the hunt, or playing pranks in town (such as climbing fences and ladders after cats), Farley and mangy Mutt are inseparable.This is quite a short book which can be read mere two or three days, yet it radiates warmth and the fondness for a childhood well lived. Although Farley was often socially awkward on account of his diminutive size, he found a sanctuary in naturalism which is fully described in this book. Despite is playful tone, the book ends quite sadly (as life often does), and heralds the coming of the Second World War, as Mutt's passing coincides with the onset of \\"the darkening tunnel of the years\\", as Farley calls it. Quite an enjoyable and eccentric read."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"When I read this book, I laughed so hard that my belly hurt! I heartily recommend it for anyone who needs a break from the serious realities of life..."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"My family discovered Mowat when I was in my teens and we read as many of his works as we could find.

In addition, the setting provides a great glimpse of life in early 20th century western Canada"},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"Farley Mowat is a fine story teller. He presents an excellent story with an enjoyable insight into his relationship with various animals in addition to his dog, Mutt. His honest affection for all living things is apparent in all his writing. There are some folks that may have different opinions about the interaction of the critters he chooses to portray, but no one can deny the reality of those encounters. Mutt is an amazing dog, possessing almost human traits. That is something all of us see in our pets or other animals we observe. Farley Mowat has the ability to capture and portray those traits. Whether we agree or disagree, he presents reality honestly and skillfully. The author gets five stars, but the hard cover on low quality paper takes away from his masterpiece. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has ever observed animals, or had a pet."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"Anyone who loves dogs should read this book. Hands down, this is the funniest dog book ever written. I've read The Dog Who Wouldn't Be at least a dozen times over the years and it still makes me laugh. Farley Mowat really knows how to tell a story and you'll come to wish Mutt had been your dog. He was one of a kind and the episodic tales will have you in stitches while shaking your head in amazement. One of my high school teachers commented about the title, \\"It should have been called The Dog That Wouldn't Be because 'Who' only applies to a person.\\" I had to disagree and so will you: Mutt deserved to be called a Who.I was happy to find a hard cover edition because I have already gone through 3 paperback copies -- although one reason is that some were loaned out and never came back. Sorry, friends, but this copy is now part of my permanent library. Get your own. This edition is missing the illustrations (one per chapter heading) but still deserves five stars.

Quite a few. The book is about a number of the animals Farley kept at his home as a youngster, but mostly about Mutt, the family's dog, who WAS a mutt but exhibited some amazing abilities and did some very strange and hilarious things. The book is a great read for anyone high school age through adult, I would say. It is easily read (a few big words will keep you on your toes), can be read a chapter at a time and then put down, would be perfect for anyone who is ill and needs cheering up, and is a must read for an animal lover."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"I remembered reading this book as a kid and wanted to read it again (I'm 50 now). It was still funny enough to make me laugh out loud. The author uses very vivid descriptions that create a great mental picture.

Obviously society's ideas about the norms for dogs have changed since then (dogs no longer roam at will in most areas) but that did not detract from the story at all. As a person who has read many a dog memory book I have to rate this one up there as one I will remember in detail for a very long time.

So what is the hold up?"},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"Summary: The true story of naturalist Farley Mowat and the first love of his life, his dog Mutt. Mowat relates excerpted tales from his childhood, most of which center around his unusual dog, Mutt. Mutt seems to be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of dog, whose unusual personality manifests itself in everything from duck hunting to cat chasing. Towards the end of the book, with the majority of Mutt's exploits behind him, the book expands to include stories of other pets, most notably a pair of great horned owls. The final chapter has the inevitable death of Mutt, although the details of his demise under the wheels of a runaway truck aren't given graphically.The Good and the Bad:I didn't really enjoy this book very much, although my age might have something to do with it. Actually, I don't even believe that because the completely unnecessary verbosity asks for a certain amount of sophistication from the reader, and anyone smart enough to swallow the big words is probably not going to be open to the message. The grand verbiage is related to my other big problem with the book, which is that the mythic legends of the dog are almost certainly inflated. Mowat instills his dog with so much human character and emotion that it would have been more believable if it turned out to be a man in a dog suit. Yet, he pooh poohs another naturalist for \\"presuming to know what an animal is thinking,\\" with no apparent irony. Also, Mowat's sense of humor and self-importance are both extremely irritating. The humor is like a broad physical comedy in its lack of subtlety, and it's couched in so many words that it sounds like a foppish English gentleman failing miserably at a dinner conversation.On the positive side, it did seem like Mutt was a special dog, hyperbole aside, and it was interesting to get slice of life stories about a budding naturalist in Canada in the 1930s."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"This is a tale that couldn't happen today. Dogs don't have the lifestyle they did in the 1920's and 1930's in remote Canada, and sadly, boys don't either.Mutt is a fascinating mutt with a mind of his own; halfway through the book I realised he must be part Siberian Husky with his deafness, his love of roaming and chasing and need to attend to his own desires.Farley's mother demonstrated an act of faith- as well as the desire to save [money amount]- when she purchased Mutt as a puppy from a starving duck seller. Farley's dad wanted a hunting dog; Farley's mom didn't want to spend a lot of money on a dog during the Dust Bowl years, living in Saskatoon.Dogs roamed free, boys roamed free. Boys weren't sent off to summer camp to keep busy- there was enough to do with their own imaginations, their friends and their animal companions. Attitudes towards cats were cavalier; some parts are very hard to read if you appreciate cats. Thankfully that attitude has changed over time.The stories of the father's boating attempts are hilarious. I don't like boats, but am inspired to read \\"the boat that wouldn't float\\" by the same author. I live in the western US and have a vague understanding of how difficult it would be to navigate some of these rivers so I appreciated the delusional voyage of The Coot.Farley paints his parents as people who had their own interests and needs, but also understood the needs of their son and his dog. They understood that living in a city wouldn't work for them, after several years living in the sparse western provinces. Farley's imagination was clearly nurtured and allowed him to become the prolific writer he became. Even the car (Eardlie, a Model A) has a character and idiosycrasies that add to the story.My dog, too, is geriatric so I read the final chapter sadly. Mutt's demise will give fuel to the arguments of people who believe completely in leash laws.Yes, this is a fantastic story of a dog, but it is also a wonderful story of life in a more free time, for children. Farley skips over most of the drawbacks of that time and paints a wonderful portrait of childhood."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"I read this for the first time when I was in about 6th or 7th grade and loved it. It was my introduction to Farley Mowat and since then I have read many of his other works.This book is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. I loved it 30 years ago when I was a kid (maybe 11 or 12) and I enjoyed it again last year.The story is about the life and times of Mutt, the dog that entered the Mowat family and grew up with Farley. Mutt is all dog and a little more. Frustrated with the local cat population and their dominance of the fencetop and rooftop world, he learns to walk fence tops. He develops hunting and retrieving techniques that are the talk of the country -- literally! Each chapter is a new story, a new adveneture into the life of Mutt."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"This is one of the funniest books that I have ever read. Mutt, the dog, comes to the family in a basket filled with ducks. The father in the story wants an expensive pure bred dog for hunting. However, mother circumvents this by plucking out the dog, paying one cent, and saving lots of money. There are plenty of misadventures in the story, from mutt retrieving a stuffed pheasent in the city (after father pointed his shotgun and said bang), to climbing a ladder into the eccentric womans house filled with 50 cats. There was the encounter with the skunk (in the basement of the house) and the time father accidentally used bluing to clean the dog. The part about the owls is funny and interesting as well. Needless to say, Mutt has many adventures, all of them hilarious I have read this book many times."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"i am reading this book with my dad and having a fun time.mutt,comes to this family for only a penny but brings a millon laughs.he did not think he was a dog so he did not ACT like a dog.when he didn't want to do something he pretented not to hear it.he would put on an expression that said,''i'm sorry,were you speaking to MOI? my two favorite parts are when the dad turns mutt blue and when the dad shot his gun and fell into the dich.you will have to read the book to find out the rest."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"When my daughter was small, her repeated request was 'read about the skunks, Daddy.'

(I just cracked up writing this.)This is a book for anyone who has ever loved a dog or a squirrel or a chipmonk or a garter snake or ever rode a two wheeler and pretended it was a horse or walked in a field or wished 'why didn't I ...'No child should be forced to grow up without watching their parents snort coffee through their nose while trying to read 'The Dog Who Wouldn't Be.'"},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"I first read this book when I was twelve, on a lazy day, at my grandparents house.

The &quot;yarns&quot; and stories in this book may give you some clues. Don't believe for one second that all the adventures related in this book are strictly true. Mowat is a great storyteller and he, like Mark Twain, took his memories and made from them something great and wonderful.This book declares war on all of the cats of the world, as one of my fellow reviewers has correctly noted. Cat lovers beware! You won't like this book. For everyone else who wants an idealized window on the lives of boys growing up in the 1930s and 40s, take a look.

Mowat is, no doubt, an excellent naturalist, and many of the adventures described in the book are very entertaining. However, I am very disturbed that, although the author is ready to defend HIS pets with his shotgun against other animals, he pretty much gave his own animals not just free rein but also encouragement to kill the pets of others. Mutt the dog is deliberately set on a woman's cats, and the &quot;secret cemetery&quot; of neighborhood cats filled by his pet owl is described with almost pride.Also disturbing to me is the author's attitude toward women. Any complaining woman is described as &quot;spinsterish.&quot; The &quot;Cat Lady&quot; whose cats the author set his dog on to attack and kill was described as harboring &quot;yearning hope&quot; for a male intruder to come and presumably do things to her that I don't want to refer to in a review that children may read -- the implication is pretty strong, with a reference also to the Sabine women.I may get flamed for this review, but I feel that these are very poor attitudes to be subtly or unsubtly conveying to children. I find it very unfortunate because I endorse the author's work as a naturalist."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be","review":"This book had me laughing out loud time after time.

Livingston has proven to be a valuable resource. It provides an in-depth analysis of the Modern period from the Enlightenment through the nineteenth century in a clear and concise manner highlighting exemplary figures such as, Kant, Schleiermacher, Mohler, Newman and Ritschl. I recommend both Volume One and Volume Two of \\"Modern Christian Thought\\" to both students and teachers who have a passionate interest in the historical, theological and philosophical development of Protestant history."},{"Title":"Modern Christian Thought: The Enlightment And the Nineteenth Century","review":"Livingston does a masterful job of summarizing Christian thought in the west from Kant through Nietzsche. Each theologian is well summarized and located within the various movements of Christian thought. Many of today's religious issues have their antecedents in the 19th century: individual autonomy vs group solidarity, reason vs tradition, and the objective vs subjective aspects of reality."},{"Title":"Modern Christian Thought: The Enlightment And the Nineteenth Century","review":"James Livingston chose to write Modern Christian Thought because he recognized a growing \\"need for a text that covers... the important intellectual developments in the history of modern Western Christianity.\\" His purpose in writing this textbook is to attempt \\"a study of the major figures and movements in both traditions in Europe and America since the beginning of the Modern era\\", encompassing both Protestant and Catholic figures (xiii).Written as a textbook for Modern Christianity from the Enlightenment to the Nineteenth century, Volume one of Modern Christian Thought is primarily geared towards students of theology and any other audience interested in the development of modern Christian thought. Livingston does not intend his book to be a comprehensive survey, but rather chooses to focus on both key influential thinkers and recurring controversial themes in theology, philosophy and apologetics.Comprising of a preface, introduction and fourteen subsequent chapters, volume one of Modern Christian Thought covers key influences and turning points in Christian thought from the Enlightenment all the way to Kierkegaard and Neitzsche.As newcomer to the study of contemporary Christianity, I found Livingston's organization of each chapter to be helpful, as he presents informative biographies of key theological and philosophical thinkers, explains their contribution to a particular movement or time period, and then summarizes their overall impact on Christianity. At times, the reading was dry and the terminology was confusing. Having no knowledge of historical figures from the Enlightenment or the various issues involved, I found myself struggling to understand such terminology as \`constructive Deism' or \`rational supernaturalists', and the differences in their thought. Although Livingston does define such terms, their definitions were lost amidst the myriads of columns and information; therefore, I would suggest that Livingston put such terminology in bold and provide a definition of terms section in the back of the book. Such an edition would be an immense help to his audience, as theology students like myself could be new to studying modern Christianity.In trying to expound important intellectual developments, key figures, and movements in America and Europe over a large time frame, Livingston put forward such a plethora of information and interrelationships that the reader be left with their head spinning. Furthermore, although the author's preface specifies he will focus on influences in both America and Europe, he provides little in regards to key figures or movements in America.For a more detailed book review, see my website at: http://members.shaw.ca/angelamccormick"},{"Title":"Fashion Means Your Fur Hat Is Dead: A Guide to Good Manners and Social Survival in Alaska","review":"When my wife and I first moved to Alaska in 1987 we wanted to find out what Alaskans were like so we could try to fit in.

So now I have all this stuff in my driveway - so my house will look like a real Alaskan home - and what am I going to do with it all? So beware! Reading this book is not for those who want real advice. It is instead a book joking about some things some Alaskans do, but not how you should really try to live just to fit in. But if anyone reading this would like to buy some stuff for your driveway - please give me a call!"},{"Title":"Fashion Means Your Fur Hat Is Dead: A Guide to Good Manners and Social Survival in Alaska","review":"If you have ever gotten the chance to meet or visit with the folks from rural Alaska you will know these are facts of live.

In fact, I like it enough that this is the book I use with my banjo students. I particularly like how the lessons progress in a logical way. Each lesson seems to pick up from what you've just learned and then adds something to it. But what's probably even more important is that quite often there's a little bit of text reminding you what you've already learned. For example, in a piece of music there may be a notation that \\"this measure uses a forward roll\\". Then, \\"This measure uses a mixed roll\\". Or even, \\"This is a mixed roll but you've move one finger to a different string\\". That kind of teaching reinforces what you've already learned by reminding you later on as you use it in a slightly different way.I havn't found a need to use the CD, but I've been playing guitar, mandolin and banjo for quite a few years. However, it has helped some of my students to learn a tune when they can hear how it's suppose to sound. So I think the CD is a valuable addition.Yes, the cover's a bit goofy. If you're an adult student it can feel a bit silly to be working from what looks like a little kids coloring book. But the material inside is really solid. This is very much a case where you shouldn't judge the book by it's cover. It's a much better book that it appears to be."},{"Title":"Mel Bay You Can Teach Yourself Banjo (You Can Teach Yourself)","review":"I started banjo about a year ago, and bought other books first- Peter Wernick's BlueGrass Banjo in the Oak Publications series, all of which books are great; Tony Triska's book and video, also very good; and Earl Scrugg's book, essential reading for bluegrass pickers. I just got this book yesterday and started looking it over. I now wish I had started with this one.Janet's teaching style is to progressively teach fundamentals and immediately apply them to repertoire, which is more fun, satisfying, and reinforcing than just reading about them and using them in a smaller number of songs. There are a lot of tunes in here! When you finish you will be able to play a number of tunes for yourself, family and friends, and with others. I can see progressing much more quickly with this book than the others because of that.There is enough material in here to keep a beginning student busy for at least 6 months to 1 year I think. You also get up the neck and melodic style introductions in addition to Scruggs style. And definitely get the CD at least-not only does it illustrate what these licks and songs are supposed to sound like, but contains teaching explanations, and it has both slow and fast speeds so you can judge your progress. The advantage of the CD is also motivational- you can listen to the lessons ahead of working them, and think \\"soon I'll be able to play that!\\"- and with practice you will be able. If you are lucky to find a guitar student or player to back you up, you will have loads of fun!Yes, it IS a beginner's book only- read the title- \\"You can teach yourself banjo\\". For more advanced techniques and material, you can and should look elsewhere. Forget the cover, and rip it off if you have to- there is good beginning fundamental material in here in a friendly and workable approach!"},{"Title":"Mel Bay You Can Teach Yourself Banjo (You Can Teach Yourself)","review":"Well, after short-cuts and fooling myself I was learning, this book set me right on track. Its clear, easy, and the progress is very well charted in order to advance steadily without any boredom. I set myself a comfortable timing, and work each lesson until I'm ready for the next, and it works. I can recommend this for an easy and real fun start to pickin a banjo. Thanks to Janet Davis"},{"Title":"Mel Bay You Can Teach Yourself Banjo (You Can Teach Yourself)","review":"Recently purchased a Banjo and it came with this book and DVD. Have been playing guitar for years but thought would like to have something different to play on occasion and always liked the sound of a banjo. Didn't want to buy a Banjo-guitar which uses guitar chords but wanted the \\"real\\" thing. And the \\"real\\" thing means I needed a good book to get me started. Have had the banjo for around 3 weeks now and it has really been a fun instrument. Janet's book was exactly what I needed. She makes it easy to understand and takes you through progressively more difficult activities as your skill improves. Also like the DVD that came with it as her style is very low key and encouraging as she explains the secrets of playing a banjo. Her demo's of the 4 types of rolls and explanation of your hand and finger postions is essential to getting you started correctly. She makes it sound simple and it is in concept, but getting your fingers to move correctly takes a lot of practice. I generally do not like the Mel Bay music books but this one I can strongly recommend for the beginning banjo player. Also read some reviews by others who thought the book was too simplified and easy but I would bet that none of them can play any of the songs in this book well. Sort of the same type of individuals who talk up a great golf game but when you see them actually play they can't play worth a darn. Yes the cover is rather dorky but then this is a great example of why you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Buy it and have some fun with the 5 string banjo."},{"Title":"Mel Bay You Can Teach Yourself Banjo (You Can Teach Yourself)","review":"I tried several instructional dvds before I found this one. They were confusing and did not go at a beginners speed. I decided to try Mel Bay's book and I am glad I did. Janet Davis is a great teacher. You have a dvd that comes included with the book to watch her play a slow version and faster version of many songs(not all songs are on the dvd). The beginning of the book shows you the basics like hand placement and lap position for your banjo. After you have learned this you learn to play roll patterns which are the most crucial element in learning to play banjo. Once you have mastered the most popular roll patterns you move onto chords, licks, slides, pinches and pull-offs. You will be surprised at how easy Janet Davis makes it to play banjo. I have playing banjo now for 4 months and I can already play a number of songs including; cripple creek, cumberland gap, blackberry blossum, good night ladies, boil them cabbage down and she'll be comin around the mountin. If you want to learn the banjo quickly and effectively you have to purchase this book. You will not be dissapointed.

Students of art history will find valuable material concerning the production techniques of ancient Oriental wares. This book is the most extensive and complete, with the most photos, of any book I've found so far on Japanese ceramics."},{"Title":"Spiriting Around","review":"The first thing that immediately struck me while reading \`Spiriting Around' was author Martin \\"Mark\\" Tomback's ability to access the issues, focus in on the appropriate bullet points and articulate his thesis with such amazing clarity. His approach to living life in the spirit is practical, easy to grasp and holistic, leaving little out in this fascinating blending of the sacred and the mudane as it applies to all facets of our existence on this planet.The author wastes no time in identifying his mission and how we can utilize the provided knowledge. As he says, \\"95% of life is common sense\\" so most of the answers already lay dormat within us.A Few of the Provided Ways to Begin Are:-Write a Mission Statement-Take a personal inventory-Identify your goals-Focus, move forward and exude positive energy-Define what is the truth?Tomback moves fluidly from personal concerns; wealth, love, divorce, weight control, on to more global issues; violence, animal rights, environmental concerns, abortion, genetic engineering, mercy killing, etc. Admittedly this vast array of topical issues discussed here are only touched upon briefly, but Tombeck does a masterful job at placing them all within a well-conceived framework that can be easily accessed and explored at a later date. He doesn't claim to have finished the job of finding ourselves, that's your responsibility. What he has done is provide a solid foundation from which to begin. To be completely honest I don't agree with everything the author has to say (do we ever, or should we ever?), but his line of reasoning is always coherent and consistent. It's difficult to find fault with his enthusiasm or thorough presentation.While I believe \`Spiriting Around' target audience is primarily mid-teens on the verge of adulthood, the ideas presented within this 304 page paperback are something that would be beneficial for adults of all ages. After all reflection, assessment and honesty with ourselves are an essential to adulthood no matter what stage of life's journey we're on."},{"Title":"Spiriting Around","review":"Mark Tomback uses his own background of self-examination as the basis of what is probably one of the better guides for everyone concerned with why the world makes so little sense right now. While others have reviewed this brief but intensely interesting book well, it seems that one of the major drivers in Tomback's sharing his insights is a kind of humanity, a love for living, a caring that eludes us as individuals so stuck in the quagmire of 'living'.What makes Tomback's book so refreshing is his straightforward approach to spiritualism: for him God is a part of everything and everything is a part of God. But this is not the 'God' of other writers' evangelical type, the omniscient being who holds the strings of the many variation puppets of 'religion', be those Christian, Muslim, Buddhism, etc. This is the God within. Tomback encourages the reader to start afresh, to observe the way things really are, to approach friendship, love, morality, all forms of sexual/political/philosophical/livelihood being with a connection from within each of us that bonds us to the spiritual, i.e. the truth.'Thoughts are things. Thoughts have form and structure. Thoughts have power.' 'Traditions are links in the chain of time that join generations together. Traditions can be the wisdom of lessons learned to a maze of ancient fears.' These are only some of the many simple statements Tomback shares so liberally. This book has something for everyone no matter their level of enlightenment or progress toward maturity. And that is why this brief book is readable, is valuable, and is different from those self-help books that make heavy the shelves of bookstores. It stimulates growth by discovering who we are and why we are.

I would like my teenage children to read it and suggest it as a great gift for high school graduates starting out in life. The author does a great job exploring the topics of pursuing your passion, searching for God, managing money, and finding true love. Also in the chapter on conflicts and conterversies he explores every major topic that our young people will have to search their souls and form an opinion about like drugs, war, politics, charity, and many more.You will walk away with some great teachings from this book, here are some examples:\\"Things change but happiness is your goal, not any particular situation\\".\\"We sabotage ourselves when we choose the easy way instead of doing what's right\\".\\"Wherever you are you control your happiness\\".\\"While self doubts are only opinions, they are the most important opinions in the world\\".\\"Quality in living isn't about having the most. It's about having enough of what's important to you\\".\\"The seed of every moment holds your future\\".No greater wisdom has ever been written. Let this book help you along your path to happiness and spiritual fullfilment."},{"Title":"Spiriting Around","review":"This book offers thoughtful advice and direction to others in order to help uplift the world, one person at a time. The author's warmth and sincerity are apparent on the pages. Rather than being full of information and how-to advice, Tombeck steers the reader to find truth and meaning from the context of one's own experiences and find ways to live a life guided by positive values."},{"Title":"Spiriting Around","review":"Spiriting Around is basically a guidebook for growing up - for men, women, and children of all ages. Teens and young adults make up the book's primary audience, but Martin \\"Mark\\" Tomback's insights into life are beneficial to all. After all, how many of us adults are truly happy and at complete peace with themselves? Many an adult gives up on the quest of finding oneself as the burdens of work, family, and responsibility tie us down - but Tomback reminds us that it is never too late to become the person we truly want to be.I'm not a fan of traditional self-help books. Like many a young person, I still stubbornly rebel against anyone telling me what I should do or what I should be or, especially, what I should think. This book is different; it's a guidebook, not a set of instructions from some blowhard or academic. Tomback doesn't write down to the reader at all, nor does he pompously lay down a strict set of instructions for the reader to embrace. He's one of us, a veteran and survivor of the great and confusing conflict of life itself. He's no academic spouting book knowledge; he's in the trenches with us, trying to help us avoid the mistakes he made in his own life. In other words, he knows whereof he speaks, and that, combined with his engaging writing style, makes him an especially effective life mentor to anyone who picks up Spiriting Around.One thing this book will not teach you is how to avoid conflict and problems (life is hard, and that's just the way it is). Quite the contrary, it stresses how important conflict and problems are in the individual's journey to self-awareness, maturity, and self-esteem. Tomback paints problems as opportunities to learn and grow. When it comes to controversies, he explains how important it is to take them head-on, for you can't advance to the point of respecting yourself if you don't even know what you believe in. Don't be afraid to be the odd man out, he stresses, for it's much more important to be yourself to the utmost than to bow to peer pressure or simply shy away from divisive issues.Speaking of divisive issues, Tomback devotes a significant amount of time to giving the reader a run-down on just some of the conflicts and controversies he/she may well face at some point. You have the real biggies such as abortion, capital punishment, education, insurance, immigration, marriage, divorce, politics, race relations, suicide, etc. He also throws in some subjects you might not expect to see here: the question of extraterrestrial life, manners, zoning, and the list goes on. His take on humility, embarrassment, and humiliation is particularly memorable, mainly because he explains how humiliation can actually be good for you. His main point throughout, however, is that we can't truly discover ourselves if we shy away from potentially bad outcomes and decisions, that these are the very things that help us mature into happier veterans of life's exhausting race.The core component at the heart of Tomback's entire message is spirituality, finding one's inner spirit. As a part of this, he talks a lot about God - trusting God to help you if you only ask, etc. It's not a religious argument at all, except in a New Age sense (Tomback's views have been shaped by many years walking many a spiritual path); in fact, the author says that spirit is your birthright no matter what kind of God you believe in. I don't happen to share his views on the nature of God and spirituality. In the end, though, it doesn't really matter all that much because he's really talking about empowering yourself to live the life you want to live. It's all about you taking responsibility for yourself - and this book is pretty darn effective at showing you how to go about doing that very thing."},{"Title":"Spiriting Around","review":"\\"You created your world and you can change it.\\" ~ pg. 30Spiriting Around is an empowering book designed for teens, but also seems to be a comforting read for anyone facing life's complexities.Martin \\"Mark\\" Tomback's thoughtful exploration of life presents powerful thought provoking topics. Discussions on patience, freedom, faith, goals, barriers to success and money leads into some especially pertinent chapters on vocation, love and conflict resolution.\\"Positive energy creates positive results.\\" ~ pg. 56The idea of finding a mentor is especially helpful at any age and if you are looking for a change in career or want to start your own business, there is information in this book that may be helpful and lead you to a more successful venture. Some of the highlights include:4 Secrets for a Successful MarriageKnowledge is MoneyMoney is ValueBe a Role ModelPrioritiesAspects of Running a Successful BusinessSensible Questions for Developing FriendshipsWhy do people lie - a completely intriguing topic and very enlightening...Real-life issues like drug use, abortion, suicide and violence are handled with sensitivity. The start of the chapter on love and sexuality presents a variety of words and phrases \\"all in a row\\" that the author seems to feel are necessary to address a wide range of topics. Parents may want to look through this chapter if they are giving this book as a gift to make sure this is appropriate for their child's age level.This book does not make any real moral judgments or promote any religions, but instead asks the reader to consider action in the light of complications that could arise. Personal responsibility is promoted and choices are given for consideration. Are you ready to have children? How could your choices on how you escape the stress of life affect your future? Political issues and global concerns are briefly discussed.\\"Spiriting Around Exercises\\" are included throughout the pages and address a variety of topics, mostly with questions. The \\"Think About It\\" sections present a summary of thoughts to ponder.I could see this book being a starting point for discussions on any of the topics included or it could be used by teachers who want ideas for topics teenagers would be interested in discussing. Since children are exposed to so many issues before they are emotionally ready to handle them, this book could be a helpful resource to show the positive and negative sides of lifestyle choices.Personally, I felt this book was a comforting read to remind me of what is important in life and topics like parenting, marriage and career choices still seemed very relevant to me as an adult. As the book progresses it just keeps getting more interesting and I was actually sad it ended. Martin \\"Mark\\" Tomback has a sense of what people want to discuss and he covers topics that really need to be addressed with a sense of understanding. Since many of the choices we make as teens can affect our entire life, someone has to talk about these issues before it is too late.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Spiriting Around","review":"Spiriting Around: A Modern Guide To Finding Yourself by Martin \\"Mark\\" Tomback has as its focus an intriguing philosophical and spiritual conception of dealing with the modern world. Engaging readers with a highly informed and extensively studied documentation of his conclusive vision and understanding, Tomback offers Spiriting Around as an interpretive compendium of societal misleads and individual acceptance. Thoroughly \\"reader friendly\\" with its well crafted text, Spiriting Around is very highly recommended to all readers struggling with their own self-identity issues, particularly with respect to an expansive and expanded analytical understanding of the world's most often difficult objectives, controls, and constructs -- and what influence they might have on the individual."},{"Title":"Spiriting Around","review":"I was pleased to read a book we could give as a gift to growing up teens. On that difficult transition age when some teens usually stubbornly close to most parents positive influences and focus on their own experiences, and peer group influences for guidance to shape their values and make decisions that will have life lasting consequences.\\"Spiriting Around\\", like a light house to mariners, shines a beacon of powerful light to attention-gathering issues, facts of life and provocative ideas, that will help growing up children realize were they are navigating in life and the current standing of their values that will frame their decision making process in this particular time and for the rest of their life.Whether teens care or not for the whole lot of subjects in the book, it's easy to read and jump back and forth between pages. The neither imposing nor dogmatic style of the author makes it more palatable to the inpatient and restless adolescent mind.In my view, the greatest achievement from \\"Spiriting around\\" is to help teens realize not only they not know it all, but also help them put issues in their \\"radar\\", step back and reflect on their morals and were they will stand when life throw them in situations that will demand of them to take decisions. And the character they will be reflecting to society and the men and women they are growing up to be.Many people grow up to be men and women of character and values just \\"playing it by ear\\" as they grow up. \\"Spiriting Around\\" can help see, consider and reflect most moral issues just as they are embarking on the adulthood voyage."},{"Title":"Spiriting Around","review":"Spriting Around: A Modern Guide to Finding Yourself is not the normal run-of-the-mill book about God and spirituality. Martin Tomback wrote the book with teens in mind; he hopes to help them understand various aspects of life and teach them to stand by their choices and be responsible for the choices they make.The book is broken down into six chapters of easily understood, well-written steps in how to work toward goals, find what's right for you and how to follow through to accomplish those goals.Tomback speaks about everything from love to money, marriage to divorce, conflicts and controversies to control and commitment. And he doesn't stop there. Spirituality and God are included in all aspects of the book, but not in a preachy sense; he speaks more in a universal manner with nurturing tendencies.He uses a no-nonsense, common sense approach to speak about growing up and finding solutions to problems and explains how to be patient, persistent and stay focused.Each chapter ends with a \\"Spiriting Around Exercise,\\" or \\"Think About It\\" section, which summarizes the thoughts brought out in the chapter.In Spiriting Around: A Modern Guide to Finding Yourself, Mark Tomback has taken his school of hard knocks and summed them up into an easy-to-read instruction book to help others understand their life's situations and how to make the best of them despite the difficulties in this modern world."},{"Title":"Spiriting Around","review":"Although SPIRITING AROUND is written as a spiritual guide for teens, the knowledge it holds is perfect for any teen, whether or not they're a person of faith. Filled with practical guidelines for getting through life, this book focuses on being patient and persistent, and working towards being the best person you can possibly be.The book contains six main chapters: Start Here; The Reason Why; Money; Love; Conflicts & Controversies; and The Expedition Continues.Each chapter is laid out in an easy-to-read style that contains the author's thoughts, practical wisdom, biblical advice, and actual facts and figures. Each chapter also ends with pointed thoughts to encourage discussion and personal contemplation on what you've read. From figuring out the difference between what you need and what you want, and how to discover your own personal identity, SPIRITING AROUND can help any teen navigate their way through adolescence.One of my personal favorites in the book are the sensible questions for developing friendships. The author puts forth some interesting concepts in learning how to develop friendships that are both fundamental and healthy.Does this person have the same interests I do?Do we have similar outlooks on life?Do we share similar values?Can I trust this person to accept me when I reveal my doubts and desires?Are we both being honest?Do they appreciate me?Do they respect me as well as value me?Are they interested in my thoughts on things?Are they interested in my welfare?Am I interested in theirs?Do I respect them?Regardless of your personal religious beliefs, this is a guidebook for life that every teen will find instructive and valuable.Reviewed by: Jennifer Wardrip, aka \\"The Genius\\""},{"Title":"Jessica's First Kiss (Sweet Valley Twins)","review":"I rated &quot;Jessica's First Kiss&quot; a 7 because the plot was good, but it didn't really get to it until, like, page 70 or something.

The writer is a reporter, so the \\"lively\\" style in descriptions of facts and situations is not new to him. You will probably read the book only in a few hours (I did it in just three-four hours, to my own amazement), and can consider yourself rather well-informed about the general subject of the Hundred Years' War after that. It is an very handy introductory work, covering all the period of the war without omitting any details. By the way, much better than the writer's \\"The Wars of the Roses\\".I gave it four stars and not five only because I do not consider it a must for experts on the 100 Years' War history."},{"Title":"The Hundred Years War","review":"The question is do you want to delve into the Hundred Years War as deeply as Jonathan Sumption's 2000-page trilogy will take you, or do you want only a good understanding, without spending a great deal of time on it? The 300 pages of Robin Neillands' THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR gave me a good understanding without burying me. I do want to read other things.Except for its long paragraphs, Neillands' account is written in prose that resembles modern fiction. It is easy to read with enough background detail to place the war into historical context, but not so much to bog you down. He does give some information about the economies of the time, and about the tactics and organizations of the two militaries. Given the complicated subject matter, much is necessarily said about the politics, and what is said is entertaining. Many characters enter into play, with more attention devoted to the major ones, like Edward III, the Black Prince, Henry V (Shakespeare: \\"Once more into the breach...\\"), and Joan of Arc. Descriptions of the main battles are lively, particularly Cr&eacute;cy and Agincourt.Trees of royal dynasties are printed on the front and back flyleaves. Maps and a few battle diagrams are conveniently interspersed with the narration. Seventeen photographic plates help make the story real. You get a bibliography, but no footnotes. And you get a rudimentary index: each topic is followed only by page numbers, without any subtopics.

They're full of the no-nonsense, boiled down &quot;rules to live by&quot; that so well defined the simpler ages gone by. To agree with another reviewer, this and the others probably would be banned today. But, when you consider who it is that bans books along with what's acceptable and what isn't by today's standards, it might be time to resurrect ol' Munro and let him have another go at our kids.

She started giggling and said that her crying was like one of the Whineys in the book. So, it does sink in, all the while lightening the mood. When a toddler is slightly irrational, its a great tactic to mention one of the silly characters in the book, and for me, it has turned the meltdown around. I cannot recommened it enough.

I really like the cadence and style of the writing and the timeless values delivered in the text.

Reading Manners Can Be Fun with your tots is a great way to show why we need to have good manners and how to have good manners. The illustrations get the point across and are funny.

It's the illustrations, however, which get the point across and hit the reader over the head. No matter your age, the cute drawings really let one see what others experience when you behave badly.The basics of what's important in life are put into perspective and appreciated all over again. Playing, saying \\"hello\\" and so many other topics pertinent to etiquette and consideration are placed on Mr. Leaf's pages in quick, precise prose which encourage action.Munro Leaf's description of The Noisey's, The Pigs, Me First, Whineys, Smash, Rip, Ruin and others assist young and old of what to do around others and what not to do.

It is often considered a children's book, but I fear the language is so old-fashioned children won't take to it. It's a shame, because it really is a great book.Young Jim Hawkins works at the Admiral Benbow Inn when a mysterious sea-captain arrives and tells him to beware of a man with one leg. Hawkins finds his treasure map and he and his compatriots acquire a ship to go after it. And who do they hire for a cook? A one-legged man named Long John Silver. Not only that - they let Silver pick the crew! As soon as they arrive on Treasure Island, the good-guys find that they are sailing with a bunch of pirates who mutiny against them.This is a fast-paced tale with plenty of surprises to keep the young and old interested. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This expertly written adventure tale is still as amusing and &quot;page-turning&quot; for the adult reader as it was when it was first made required reading in junior high school.

If you have ever wondered where our ideas of pirates, adventure, treasure, and the high seas came from, they reside in this book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"You surely don't need me to tell you that this book is deservedly a classic. But what will your young reader think?I've been reading all of the books going into the kids' library, and that has been an eye opener. \\"Robin Hood\\" is really very exciting. \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" is virtually unreadable. \\"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\\" is a hoot and Rebecca is a pistol. \\"Peter Pan\\" is almost creepy around the edges.And as for Stevenson? These books are fresh, exciting, and absorbing, even for kids weaned on video games and short attention requirements. \\"Treasure Island\\" just keeps building and \\"Kidnapped\\" feels like non-fiction. This isn't just high seas and pirates. This is treasure, treasure hunting, running around on an island, hiding out from villains, sneaky nighttime daring-do. This is good stuff, and it still works."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is a awesome book. I like the fast pace of the story. This book is so great that I had a hard time putting it down, so I finished it in a bout one day. I think that this book is way better than the Pirates of the Caribbean series."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"(Author's note: Several years ago I took a course in children's literature at a nearby collage, and one of the novels that I had to study was Stevenson's now iconoclastic novel \\"Treasure Island\\". This is an adaptation of my paper on the novel. You can thank Beatrice Catherino for this. There will be some plot spoilers.)\\"Treasure Island\\" starts when Billy Bones, a weather-beaten, and cranky old sailorman, comes to lodge at the Admiral Benbow, a modest seaside inn. He brings a bit of minor-league chaos with him, but he pays his bills, and takes a liking to young Jim Hawkins. Then one day his past catches up with him, and it brings an end to his life. Bones will die of fear as pirate scallywags raid the inn, forcing Hawkins and his mother, his father having since died, to flee, and Hawkins shows his reliability when he stands by his mother and refuses to abandon her when she is overcome with exhaustion while fleeing.Coming back after the raid, Hawkins finds a map amongst Bones effects, and he recruits friends Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney to go on a treasure hunt. A ship, the \\"Hispaniola\\", will be purchased, and a crew is then hired under the charge of the ever \\"dependable\\" John \\"Long John\\" Silver.Here the novel becomes a rousing tale of adventure and survival as this novel becomes an example of what Joseph Campbell calls \\"The Hero's Journey\\". This is because Hawkins quest starts for one purpose, and that is to get the pirate's booty. The trip seems to be cursed; the mate goes overboard and Hawkins accidently hears about a planned mutiny. Despite great odds stacked against him, Hawkins does the right thing and reports the mutiny, and as the crew mutinies he sticks with his friends, and with a select few he will escape the mutiny to Treasure Island. It is here that they set up defensive encampment inside an old abandoned fortress built by Silver and Bones' original employer, Captain Flint.Tension builds within the encampment, there is a raid, and Hawkins impulsively runs away to set the \\"Hispaniola\\" free to beach itself. It is here that Hawkins is finally forced into an adult situation as he is forced into killing Israel Hands in self-defense. He tries to return to the fortress only to be captured by Silver and his remaining mutineers. Silver manages to save Hawkins life, and as the treasure hunt by the pirates commences, there will be another revolt, this time against Silver, forcing Silver to join the side of the righteous.During the novel Hawkins constantly finds himself confronted with temptations, but he stays on the moral straightaway. He never abandons his friends, always keeps his word, even when it puts him into physical danger. He is a good counterpoint for \\"Long John\\" Silver, a man he constantly looks up to as a kind of father figure throughout the novel. Hawkins constantly stays on the straight and narrow, always treating Silver with respect, even when Silver clearly doesn't deserve it. It is Silver who often comes across the more immature of the two, constantly, and opportunistically waffling, and weaseling his way into and out of circumstances as it pleases him. So erratic is his behavior, at times we are not quite sure how Silver will react in the circumstances that he constantly finds himself.Of course, Hawkins isn't infallible, when Billy Bones dies, Hawkins initially steals Bones' money, but then is forced by his mother to return the money, but by the end of the novel, Hawkins has gone through his trial by fire, and has been forced to mature. Then, when the pirate's booty is found, and it is divided up equally among the survivors, Hawkins manages to let Silver get away with a bag of gold coins.Stevenson also does well in creating some of his minor characters. Take for instance the characters Abraham Gray and Dick. Dick was once a good man, with a strong moral upbringing, who was also literate (he could read), and who had gone over to the Darkside, while Gray was a character who stood on the edge of the abyss, didn't blink, and took the right moral course in life. While these characters take up a relatively minor amount of storytime, they acted as a contrast to the more major Israel Hands/Jim Hawkins conflict, in which Hawkins confronts Hands, is forced to kill him, face the darkness within himself, defeat it, and still keep his moral center.\\"Treasure Island\\" is an early example of the multi-perspective novel. As while most of the novel is told from Jim Hawkins viewpoint, there is a fair share that is told from other viewpoints than his so that the readers can get a more rounded perspective on the events that are happening in the novel.Unlike the more ornamental authors of his (and our) time, Stevenson let the story do the work, and so his story can be read as easily today as it was when it was first published. As you read Stevenson's novel you keep thinking that Jim and his family COULD HAVE owned an inn, they COULD HAVE been raided by greedy pirates looking for a map and for revenge. Jim COULD HAVE fallen into the good graces of several well meaning mentors and gone on a treasure hunt, COULD HAVE survived a mutiny, and COULD HAVE, along with his companions, have found the pirate's booty, and Jim COULD HAVE had the adventure of a lifetime.Such is Stevenson's storytelling skill that this adventure COULD HAVE happened to somebody Jim's age, and social class, even the whole thing IS pretty improbable. As it is seen through the eyes of Jim Hawkins, Treasure Island (the island) is pretty generic, so that even the Treasure Island itself COULD HAVE actually existed. Because even MORE unlikely things have happened, including the fact that there have been female pirates as tough as most of the male pirates.We also never really find out the mystery of what adventure caused events of \\"Treasure Island\\" to happen, and maybe it's better that way, just as Stevenson leaves open the possibility for a sequel. Stevenson was constantly and chronically sick, so that novel was never written, but others have tried their hands at it to various degrees of success.This review is based on a copy is a reprint (a facsimile?) of the original 1911 Charles Scribner's Sons edition, and this reprint is a very attractive book. The print is big and easily read, there are fifteen luscious paintings on glossy paper, by N. C. Wyeth (see customer images for some examples), illustrated endpapers, plus another painting for the cover, a map, and the book opens with a whimsical bit of verse by Stevenson. The book is sturdily constructed and the text is printed of thick, durable paper. This book contains some antiquated phrases however, and if you're not familiar with sailing ships, these phrases may be hard going; so a glossary would have been greatly appreciated. Still, for those who enjoy a great adventure this is a five star package all the way around.Warning. There are various editions of this book on this site, so try to make sure you get the Scribner's Sons edition, with the ISBN number 0684171600."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"My quest through the free Kindle classics continued with Treasure Island.Having never read this book it was all new to me.I found it was very well written as it kept me roped in to the story from start to finish and was perfectly formatted for the kindle.This book should be required reading in school!

If I read this at the age of let's say 8, it would put me off reading for life. And it is so slow to start. I didn't enjoy reading this book and I was very disappointed. The drama is weak, the narrative is weak and boring. I felt nothing for the hero Hawkins. And towards the end it kind of built up to a big climax that never happened.

He had been bugging me to read Treasure Island for a long time because I liked the movie Pirates of the Caribbean, so he thought that I would love this book because of the pirates. I read it and was sooooooo bored! I could not even pay attention it was so boring. For about one page the book was exciting, but then it got dull. I am a freshman in high school, I read this book summer going into 9th grade and was bored to tears reading this! I understood the language, but what was said was boring and my attention wandered early on. I quit reading about three quarters finished. I returned the book, and I could tell Grandpa was shocked I didn't like the book... but I guess honesty is good. A friend of my parents said maybe I was bored because I am older and the book was mean for a lower reading level, but I don't know. All I can say is that this book really sucked.

The telling is sometimes interesting, sometimes functional, and has an oddly sedate tone for a supposed adventure story; the pace is in general much slower than a modern reader might expect, or be satisfied with.That said, the edition assembled here should be reviewed by every single publisher of ebooks ever. The main story is well-formatted and free of errors. Illustrations throughout come from multiple sources, both black-and-white drawings and fully painted scenes (making the Kindle, ironically, not the ideal device to read it upon). Finally, the supplements are a veritable treasure trove of extras: Robert Louis Stevenson's metafictional vignette \\"The Persons of the Tale\\", author biography, list of characters, a timeline of the novel's events, chapter-by-chapter endnotes, various articles and essays, and much much more.Kent David Kelly has discussed his irritation with how the rise of ebooks has led to shovelware epublishers, who flood the market with badly-made classics. Anyone who has scoured through multiple versions of a classic, only to find none to be at all acceptable, can understand his ire. In such a context, the hard work and passion that has clearly gone into this work is awe-inspiring, and gladly appreciated. For that reason alone, I'll be buying every new Kindle Master Edition he puts together, and will eagerly await each new release."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I read the children's classic version of this book back when I was about 8 years old. Since then I had always assumed that somewhere out there lurked the \\"real\\" version, which in my mind was pictured to both look and read similar to \\"The Three Musketeers\\" or \\"Moby Dick.\\" When I finally got around to reading the \\"adult version,\\" I laughed when I realized that this is still a children's novel. It's an old fashioned action adventure clearly written with little boys about the age of 12 in mind.The short summary: Jim, is a preteen who lives with his parents at the little inn and tavern that they own. A rough and unruly customer comes to stay with them, a salty old pirate with inappropriate stories and foul drinking songs. Jim is enthralled with the man and befriends him; the old crusty pirate even pays Jim to \\"Keep an eye out for a man with one leg.\\" When the rest of the pirates locate the inn where Jim and his family live, they make an appearance, demanding something that the old pirate had taken from them. Through an act of both luck and bravery, Jim and his mother escape the pirates and take with them the hidden object - a map showing the location of an enormous buried treasure. Jim, the good Doctor, and a few other individuals from town decide to rent a boat to go after the treasure... but when they start their voyage, a man with one leg joins the boat as the cook and the rest of the crew isn't behaving quite properly. The rest of the tale involves mutiny, back stabbing, treachery, treasure, gunfights, castaways and adventure of the highest caliber.This is one of the most well written adventure novels I have ever read, and I have encouraged my 10 year old son to try to give it a read. Back when this was written, I would assume that every 9-12 year old little boy (and many little girls as well) probably lay in their beds at night reading and dreaming of being whisked away by pirates to find buried treasure. Since then our language has changed so dramatically that I believe that the under 12 crew may have difficulty with some of the phrasing and word choices in this novel. If giving this to a younger child, I would plan to work with them through some of the tougher portions, specifically the technical bits about the ship (explaining what a mizzenmast is) and some of the pirate's dialogue which is often written phonetically. You can solve the pirate problem by telling them to read it aloud and try to sound like Captain Jack Sparrow from \\"Pirates of the Caribbean.\\" My son had a much easier time when I would read those passages to him doing a pirate accent.Even if your much older than 12, I still highly recommend reading this, it is a quick read with a truly fairytale ending. The good guys win and the bad guys lose and the moral of the story is honor, duty, keeping your word, and being a good person will bring you good fortune, whereas acting like a despicable pirate will only bring you down in the end. There also seems to be a fairly strong anti-alcohol message in the book, as the good guys capitalize on the intoxication of the pirates over and over and rarely drink the stuff themselves. It's not beaten over your head... but it might just be strong enough to make the little ones think \\"Well I'm not going to do that!\\"I couldn't recommend this story enough, for individuals of all ages; we are planning on reading it out loud at bedtime so that our 7 year old can enjoy the dreams of buried treasure and pirates. There is a reason this tale has stood the test of time, and I suggest reading it yourself, and with your little ones if you have any.Parent note- in my summary I stated that the Pirate sings foul songs and tells inappropriate stories, these are not related in the book and are only reference in the fact that Jim's mother is horrified that the pirate tells him such things. So you don't have to worry about profanity or any other lewd discussions."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson's _Treasure Island_ sets the standard for books about pirates: buried treasure, intrigue and mutiny, even the ditty \\"fifteen men on a dead man's chest\\" all originate here. The book, simply, is a FUN read.The story is told by Jim Hawkins, a young man who accidentally finds himself in the possession of a map to a pirate's buried treasure. Embarking with a crew of familial friends (and a motley crew), Hawkins soon finds himself in the adventure of a lifetime: battling pirates, stealing a ship, and hunting buried treasure. The \\"sea slang\\" one would expect in a pirate story can be found in abundance, with plenty of swashbuckling to go around._Treasure Island_ is certainly readable for younger audiences, the story is exciting for anyone. Recomended."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is a picture book adaptation of the classic story of adventure, which has been carefully abridged for younger readers. The expressive full-color, museum quality illustrations by the late N. C. Wyeth perfectly complement this great classic by the great nineteenth-century author Robert Louis Stevenson. Treasure Island is very highly recommended for novice readers just about ready to graduate from picture book to reading to more involved and complex stories."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The problem I face with most kinds of classic books is the fact that it is held on such a high pedestal it will never reach the standard that I have imagined it would be, but that isn't the writer's fault. It is the fault of those annoying intellectuals who discuss them in their book groups, and look down on those peasants who haven't been lucky enough to go to university and taught why these books are so great, the (insert your own appropriate description of these people). It is also my own fault, because I'm an opinionated narcissist who scorns any who oppose his views, which is why I hate those people who belittle simple book for being simple and not an intwined conundrum of revealing insights to the writer him/herself, sometimes we just like simple!I picked Treasure Island up after watching the recent version on TV, starring Executive Transvestite Eddie Izzard (well done if you know that joke), and I wondered how far off this adaption was to the book. Previously I had watched adaptations of many books to film, and decided to see if this show had gone the way of The 13th Warrior (watch this film, it is absolutely amazing) or the dark rage filled minutes of the modern Clash of the Titans (a terrible film, watch the older version just for nostalgia purposes). The show was placed in a comfortable middle, not good, but didn't completely ignore the book, and just use the title because Hollywood couldn't be bothered with thinking up their own title and names!!Now my quota of classic fiction is very bare. I have always found the writing dull and sometimes difficult to understand, even though the obvious reason being that is was made in a different age, and I should stop being such an uncouth bum hole and appreciate the genius of the work. However I fear that I have set my bar for classic literature very high due to reading Dumas Count of Monte Cristo, a book I have advised everyone I've met to read, and so far proud of the fact I have made three people read a masterpiece they never would have if it weren't for me. I know this isn't a review of Monte Cristo, but I can't stress enough how amazing this book is, it passes the hate filled cynic part of my brain, and makes me feel that there still is hope for humanity.Treasure Island should be taken for what it is, a boy's adventure. That is the basic plot line of this book, following the adventure of young Jim Hawkins as he searches for the lost treasure of Captain Flint, but faces the survivors of Flint's old crew, led by the original wooden legged pirate John Silver. This book is a amazing tale of swashbuckling heroism of some true English gentlemen as they embark on a voyage that has danger lurking around every corner. Now there are some very annoying aspects of this book, but I fear that it is because it hasn't escape through the misery of my personal being, but these are few and far between. The book doesn't drag out descriptions or dialog like many novels will, nor does it focus on the inner turmoil of the protagonist. What it does it leap and bound between action and adventure like any boyish adventure should. Areas of the novel that some writers could drag on and on, Louis Stevenson doesn't, he writes an excellent book that could be read on a warm summer's afternoon where you could transport your mind away from whatever dull meaningless existence that you are living, to a world of pirates and adventure that you dreamed of when you were a child.The only problem that I do have with this book is that the pirates are held in an almost good light, just as vagabonds or loveable rogues like Silver is shown, when the sad truth of these men is a far darker tale. Now I know that books couldn't be written like they can now and the book was a harmless adventure, but I can't help but like Silver's character, which is I'm sure the aim of the book, but that is what I find the problem. I wanted to hate Long John Silver like I hated Pew, but you find him a nice guy, which we know wouldn't have been the case. However I can't argue with the fact that this book helped spark the love of pirates that every boy has, and because of this book I hopped around on my garden wall trying to impale my brother with a stick demanding him to walk the plank. It is this amazing adventurous spirit that I love about the book, and the reason that it should hold the title of classic."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I saw the original paintings done for this classic at the Brandywine River Museum, and bought the book simply for the Wyeth prints. Found them to be of not the full color scale (probably true to the original publication) which was disappointing. This is a keepsake book but if you want the prints in full color you'll have to go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I'm 34 and somehow managed not to read Treasure Island all these years. Even at the grand prize of $0 on the Kindle I had to think about it for a second. I need not have done that. I am not a pirate nut, but believe me when I say this book is a must read. The vernacular is spot-on, even a century later. The pace is cut-throat fast and the characters believable, none more so than the rightly famous Long John Silver, or Barbecue, and that is the reason for the book's greatness. Here we have one of the most complex, fully developed characters you can find. One that will still ring true, even today. You WILL be swayed by him, surprised by him and ultimately, without giving anything away, impressed by him. Fifteen men on a dead man's chest, Yo ho ho and bottle of rum! Drink and the devil have done for the rest, Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is perhaps THE classic pirate's tale. Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"How can you even review the ultimate pirate book of all time? I read it when I was 9 and loved it. I read it again when I was 34 and loved it again! (Actually, I read it several times between, as well.) Long John Silver is arguably one of the most Macchiavellian characters you will ever find between the covers of a book. (I'm mainly reviewing it to raise the average rating. Anyone who thinks this book is boring has to have a screw loose!) From the arrival of the mysterious Billy Bones, to the attack on the inn, to the sea voyage, to the mutiny, to the battle for the island, to the treasure hunt, even to the final fate of John Silver, this book is a stunning rollercoaster of suspense and adventure! I'd give it ten stars if I could.Here's a bit of information you other readers might enjoy: the meaning of the pirates' song--Fifteen men on a dead man's chest Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!The real-life pirate, Edward Teach (Blackbeard the Pirate) once marooned 15 of his men on a small island named Dead Man's Chest. He put them ashore with no weapons, equipment or supplies--just a bottle of rum."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I am a sixth grade student living in Denver, Colorado. My review analyzes the novel Treasure Island by Robert Lewis Stevenson. Treasure Island was first published as a book in 1883. It has an enormous influence on the modern day perception of pirates, from their association with tropical islands and the \\"X\\" marking the spot where treasure is hidden; to the image of pirates with a wooden leg, parrots on their shoulders, scarred faces, and three cornered hats.Treasure Island is a magical treasure hunting adventure on the high seas. The book is filled with pirates, mutiny and swashbuckling. It is told from the perspective of a boy Jim Hawkins. The story is filled with such unforgettable characters as the pirate Long John Silver, Dr. Livesey, and Squire Trelawney as they sail in search riches hidden on the mythical Treasure Island. The book opens in the Admiral Benbow inn, where Jim lives. Following a series of strange events involving a blind beggar, an old sea chest, and a scar faced old sailor; Jim becomes involved in the sea bound search for Treasure Island. The characters end up on a tropical island but find themselves caught up in a dangerous mutiny. This culminates in a battle with the mutineers in which several of the men are killed. Finally the search for the buried treasure commences. The story ends with the finding of the treasure and the marooning of the former mutineers.Due to the time period in which Treasure Island was written, the language and sentence structure is complex and at times can be difficult to understand. Stevenson writes with a precise attention to detail and plot occasionally gets lost in the minor points of the story. I think that while Treasure Island is a great book, I would only recommend it to older readers owing to the complexity of the story. Although it can be tedious with its long descriptions and many fine points, I really enjoyed reading Treasure Island and would recommend it as a wonderful introduction to more complex novels."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I have a copy of this as well as the one with Wyeth illustrations. I prefer this for the kids as there are more illustrations throughout the book, it is a bit larger and pages printed to give a parchment look. The quality of the illustrations is outstanding. This is a beautiful book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"All four things mentioned above can be found at your fingertips with Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island.\\" Before Johnny Depp stumbled off of the Black Pearl, before Errol Flynn took us on swashbuckling journeys, and even before \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey took to the water, Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins thrilled fans of high-seas adventure. \\"Treasure Island\\" tells the story of one young Jim Hawkins. It starts off in the simple setting of a family-owned inn where we are introduced to Billy Bones, an old seadog who has a secret. After a couple of visits from some strange characters, a confrontation occurs and a treasure map lands into the hands of Hawkins. From there, we set sail on the Hispaniola with Hawkins, the squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, the sea cook Silver, and a whole slew of pirates and scoundrels in general. All are after the treasure of Captain Flint, who graciously marked his treasure map with an \\"X\\" to show the way to the riches.This is a wonderful tale of intrigue, double-crossing, greed, and swordplay. Promoted as a children's book, I'm sure that any adult will find this story captivating as well. Robert Louis Stevenson is a literary legend and deserves that honor based on this book alone. However, if you read this book and are interested to read more of Stevenson's work, check out \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" \\"Kidnapped,\\" and \\"The Black Arrow.\\" He also wrote a number of traveling books which are also fun to read.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I sure hope that kids, and adults too, are still out there reading this book. What an amazing gift to English literature. I can still see in my mind the worn hardback copy of Treasure Island at my hometown library. This is the one book that I can remember reading two or three times over when I was a kid. I recently read it again to my own kids, and delighted in the masterful storytelling and drama of the book. The story is complex but well-known: Jim Hawkins, the resourceful son of an infirm innkeeper, finds himself the possesser of a pirate's treasure map. The benevolent greed that grips the town's merchants who want to exploit the map eventually leads to the malicious greed of a band of murderous and mutinous pirates led by the cunning and deceitful Long John Silver (who would enjoy a second career as a fried fish pitchman). The single-minded pursuit of GOLD leads all of these men to face the sea, disease, and privation, and to kill each other. The story ends well enough from our protagonist's point of view, but it all seems quite \\"realistic\\" and gritty. Don't pass this one over - a classic, richly told and written well, that deserves a place in your canon."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I am dumbfounded by the reviews that my peers have given Treasure Island. This book is a masterpiece of children's literature. It has everything one could hope for: action, intrigue, pirates, buried treasure... What more does it need? I, too, read the novel for my class, but it did not put me to sleep at all. Instead I couldn't put it down and had to read by flashlight after my Mom made me turn out my lights. It was incredible. Long John Silver is a creepy guy! As for the other reviewers who are my age, I hope you adults do not judge my generation by their ignorance and unwillingness to accept anything without man eating dinosurs. Treasure Island is an excellent novel."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I had already tried reading my copy of this book when I was far younger, but I was not as avid a reader as I am these days. Recently, parted from my copy, I picked up an old nondescript hardcover of Treasure Island at the library to complete the book in its entirety.I found the first half of the book highly enjoyable, one that I recalled warmly as I re-read it. But as the book progressed, I was astounded at how difficult the reading was becoming; the pirate slang and their use of strange metaphors obviously grew proportionate to the amount of pirates in the scene. In one of the few moments of humor, the hero Hawkins even says, \\"\`Well,' I said, \`I don't understand one word that you've been saying. But that's neither here nor there[...].'\\" The dialects makes the book that much more realistic; in my mind, however, I wonder if children reading this book fully comprehend it, or were they simply smarter in the 19th century? After spoiling myself with easy modern thrillers, I had to hunker down and really concentrate my efforts in trying to understand the subtext. The rough slang slowed my reading down greatly, but increased my enjoyment. And, of course, having finally completed the book and knowing the true story, my re-read in a few years will be thrice as good!In 1881, while vacationing in Scotland, Stevenson painted an island with his stepson which became the inspiration for the novel. He soon wrote 15 chapters, and completed the rest in Switzerland at the rate of one chapter a day. It was finally published as an entire novel in 1883.Stevenson throws together goods that have become legendary in pirate lore: Pirates with fantastic names, like Captain Flint, Billy Bones, Black Dog, Pew, Israel Hands (based on the real-life member of Blackbeard's crew), and the now-infamous Long John Silver, himself with a parrot on his shoulder; a single treasure map that has three red crosses (designating two piles of treasure, one pile of arms); a beautiful schooner that's put through its paces; a 23 member crew (excluding Jim Hawkins, Doctor Livesey, and Squire Trelawney), most of whom become gentlemen of fortune; mutiny; double-crosses; the shanty \\"15 men on a Dead Man's chest/Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum\\"; the notorious Jolly Roger; spirits, superstition, and lore; and even a skeleton or two.Treasure Island actually refers to the fictitious Skeleton Island---perhaps an inspiration for the children's book The Secret of Skeleton Island (1966)---, a sweltering jungle in the day and eerily submerged in mists in the early mornings. A strange coincidence I found led me to some interesting finds. Stevenson named an anchorage point after the pirate Captain Kidd. In 1935, Harold T. Wilkins published a book entitled \\"New Facts about Mysterious Captain Kidd and his Skeleton Island Chests,\\" in which can be found one of Kidd's treasure maps. Two years after Wilkins's book was published a treasure hunter found an uncanny resemblance between this \\"Skeleton Island\\" and Oak Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. Oak Island's impervious Water Pit is purportedly where Captain Kidd buried part of his treasure before being hanged in 1701 (the Pit is also the main inspiration for the 1998 novel Riptide). In a twist worthy of Robinson himself, despite Kidd's map uncovering some of Oak Island's mysteries, Wilkins eventually stepped forward to admit his maps were fabricated. But was Stevenson alluding to Kidd's connection with Oak Island?Treasure Island is an adventurous classic I heartily recommend anyone to read. I personally advocate reading the book if you're older, or re-reading it, to fully enjoy the environment created through the striking language. A fantastic aid in understanding pirate slang is the online Encyclopaedia Piratica. While you're at it, go to any map engine and plug in the latitude and longitude found at the end of Chapter 6, \\"The Captain's Papers,\\" to see where Billy Bones claimed booty!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Simply put, this is an excellent book! I didn't read it until I was 37, but it was worth the wait. I certainly would not classify this as a children's book at all. In fact, I strongly suspect that the few negetive reviews this book has received here have been due to children being forced to read it in school. My view is if you force a child to read anything, he's going to hate it. The fact that the book was written over a hundred years ago, when people talked very differently than they do today, and novels were written very differently also, spells disaster for anyone expecting a child to understand it, let alone like it. That aside, this is still a wonderful book full of adventure with descriptions that are vivid only if you have a vast vocabulary. If you can get through the first chapter, it gets easier and it's definately worth the time and effort to read. I loved it and plan to read it again very soon. Do yourself a favor and ignore any negetive comments you've seen about this great book. Read it and then judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"RL Stevenson was born in 1850, and died in 1894. \\"Treasure Island\\" was first published in 1883, though was originally written for the amusement of Stevenson's stepson, Lloyd Osbourne.Set in the 1700s, the book's hero is Jim Hawkins. Jim is, apparently, an only child whose parents run the Admiral Benbow - a quiet inn, though with a good reputation, not far from Bristol. His troubles begin with the arrival of a mysterious sailor - a rather intimidating, poorly dressed and generally filthy character, though not one who was short of money. He's reluctant to give his name, though claims to hold the rank of captain, and he generally says little. However, occasionally his tongue is loosened a little by his fondness for rum - upon which he would either burst into song or tell the most terrifying stories. At the mysterious sailor's request, meanwhile, Jim keeps an eye out for another salty old sea dog the nameless captain seems keen to avoid : the unwanted visitor's most notable feature is his one leg.Things change with the arrival of an even nastier sailor named Black Dog. He's obviously acquainted with the Admiral Benbow's resident sailor - whose name, Billy Bones, is soon revealed - though they're not on the best of terms. Things turn nasty, one thing leads to another and before you can say \\"oh, arrr\\", Billy has died of a stroke. Jim and his mother quickly rifle Billy's sea chest - he'd left a substantial bar bill, and Mrs Hawkins meant to collect payment - though among his possessions they also find a mysterious sealed packet. When eventually opened, the packet proves to hold treasure map of a notorious pirate called Captain Flint. Shortly afterwards, Jim joins Squire Trelawney and Dr Livesey on a mission to retrieve the treasure. Unfortunately, their ship proves to be manned by a crew of treacherous pirates - including the one-legged Long John Silver...A very easily read, fast-moving and enjoyable book - and one that (presumably) has had a huge impact on how we still see pirates : lots of songs about rum (naturally with a few yo-ho-hos thrown in), treasure maps where X marks the spot and one-legged salty old sea dogs with parrots that scream \\"pieces of eight\\". Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Published in 1882, this is the adventure story par excellence, and it made Stevenson's reputation as one of the great Victorian storytellers.

Each chapter gets its fair share of events and specific plotline, which really is an advantage to the book all the way along, it, is not boring in any paragraph whatsoever. Each character gets their own individual personality, such as feelings, emotions, and the decision of \\"What would this character do if this happened?\\" It is clearly obvious that R.L. Stevenson spent most time on the character of Long John Silver, whose personality changes from good to bad to good to bad almost within every chapter, and also the character of Jim Hawkins, who finds the adventure just one long disaster after another, finding himself in the most dangerous of situations: Almost being stabbed to death, overhearing a mutiny plan, witnessing a murder and stumbling into the enemy to name a few.

It is easy for that age to understand if it is read aloud but maybe a bit beyond them if read silently.What a great classic story, Long John Silver is only the sea cook until...Jim Hawkins and his now widowed mother run an inn that has a shady character staying there for an extended time. Eventually Jim gets his hands on a real pirate treasure map and the adventure begins.Mutiny, sickness, shipwreck and death all make this a very exciting story."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island / 0-375-75682-5There's been so many movies based on \\"Treasure Island\\" that it's almost impossible not to be somewhat familiar with the story. Stevenson shines here, managing to carefully craft a story for children that will also appeal to adults.The boy hero of the story is respected enough to be included in the plans and tribulations of the adults on board, but is not kowtowed to the point of offending adult sensibilities. The pirates are realistically rendered, but not to the point where real children would likely be frightened - the violence here is fantastical only, of the sort that was seen so vividly in other classics, such as \\"Peter Pan\\". Indeed, I am tempted to categorize \\"Treasure Island\\" as a children's classic, alongside such classics as Barrie's work, but I feel that the slightly dated format and feel of this particular classic might present a barrier to young children. Perhaps this is best read as an adult's guilty pleasure, or as a group reading choice, with the adult explaining the more esoteric references and sea-faring minutia.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is an excellent book. I highly recommend adding it to your classiccollection.It is great reading for older children or adults.

Dr Jekyll is very different, a strange, puzzling, mysterious, symbolic story. The characters in Treasure Island are unforgettable, Jim Hawkins, Dr Livesey, captain Smollet, John Silver, the man without a leg who disappears in Latin America and the pirate Flint, a character who is always present, but only through the dialogues. This is a classic, but a cult novel as well."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"TREASURE ISLAND is quite simply *the* classic pirate story. It is a supremely enjoyable read, an adventure tale with danger, mystery, suspense, and travel to exotic places--not to mention pirates!Robert Louis Stevenson's TREASURE ISLAND tells of the coming of age of the boy Jim Hawkins, the son of innkeepers. One day, Jim's parents take on a strange boarder, the \\"captain,\\" later revealed to be a pirate mate, Billy Bones. The \\"captain\\" kept in his room a chest within which, it is revealed after his death, there is a treasure map indicating gold and silver buried on a deserted island. Jim takes the map to the local physician, Doctor Livesey, and the squire John Trelawney. Spurred to action, Trelawney secures a ship, the Hispaniola, which is captained by Alexander Smolletts. He invites Livesey to serve as ship's surgeon and Jim as cabin boy. Trelawney also hires the crew--most of whom turn out to be pirates associated with the treasure map's original owner, Captain Flint. The pirates are led by the ship's cook, Long John Silver, a wily, one-legged, parrot-bedecked, opportunistic pirate chief. (Stevenson's Long John Silver profoundly shaped later popular pirate lore.) The pirates intend to kill the captain, squire, doctor, and Jim on the return voyage after having found the buried treasure. What follows is Jim's adventure of a lifetime.Though intended to be a story for youth, TREASURE ISLAND's nineteenth-century language, particularly the patois of the sea dogs, will challenge readers under ten. Amusingly, it sometimes also challenges Jim Hawkins, who can't always follow what the pirates are saying. Though the language at times may be difficult, the suspense of the tale will keep propelling readers forward to its exciting and satisfying end.This \\"Whole Story\\" edition is lavishly illustrated with color drawings based on the story. There are also pages devoted to types of sailing vessels, sails, knots, compasses and other nautical stuff. The book also includes a number of sidebar-like illustrated fun facts about pirates and other things only tangentially related to the story. In fact, I often found the additional material not terribly germane and sometimes intrusive and distracting. Still, it makes for a handsome gift book. One simply interested in reading this ripping yarn might choose an edition with simple illustrations or no illustrations at all, save for Stevenson's treasure map."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is truly a treasure that many teenagers do not discover. Its rich language and stunning plot will captivate anyone. Teenagers should take the time and make the effort to become acquainted with this literary classic. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in pirates and this book is right up there with the best of the stories. Full of adventure, treachery, and deceit, this yarn is wonderfully spun. As you read, you go back in time to the years of the pirates. You meet evil, sinister Israel Hands, and honest, innocent Jim Hawkins. It is a fight between good and evil. While the good and the bad are fighting against each other, one man is trying to decide to be good or evil. Long John Silver, the merry, unscrupulous buccaneer cannot decide what side to be on. One day he is a greedy pirate looking for loot and the next he is helping the good guys conquer the bad. Treasure Island is like a study of good and evil with many examples of human nature and the consequences that come from the choices that are made. For anyone who is in need of a great book, Treasure Island is it. The story travels from a sleepy inn disturbed by a drunken buccaneer to the rolling sea and then on to the incredible island. Battles are fought and foes vanquished. The wide variety of characters with exotic personalities will engage a reader of any age."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The book has nice pen and ink illustrations throughout and includes the original Treasure Island map illustration from the original edition. The cover art is by a different artist who has clearly adapted the image from the very familiar publicity photo of Jim and Long John Silver from the Disney film--kind of humorous."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Originally written for Stevenson's young American stepson, TREASURE ISLAND is a lighter read and less mature than his other works. Still, it is a highly entertaining, fast-paced novel that certainly deserves its status as a classic in English literature. Being perhaps the most influential book on the pirate mythos, this is one that you'll find familiar even if you've never read it before. From the one-legged Long John Silver and his motley band of scoundrels to treasure maps where 'X' marks the spot, this is the book that helped shape 'gentlemen of fortune' in many books and stories since then.Jim Hawkins, the young hero of the story, is the principle narrator, telling the story of his adventure in a rather breathless manner. Sometimes obscure details are described while traumatic scenes are sort of glossed over. In this way, the story really takes on a realistic feel, as Jim tells his story the way he remembers it. Unquestionably brave, Jim doesn't gloat on his accomplishments and victories, but relates the story in a modest way, hardly hesitating to describe his fear and admit his weaknesses.The other characters really drive the story. Long John Silver and all the pirates are some of the most colorful characters you'll ever find. Rough, deceitful, and hard, their motivations are never difficult to discern. Their sometimes hilarious manner of speaking displays their character and brings them to life like no amount of purely descriptive writing could. Jim Hawkins' friends are much less interesting as characters, but are nonetheless important. The squire, the doctor, and their men play key parts in the tale but are never really the focus of readers' attention. To be honest, compared to the other characters, they are rather dull.Robert Louis Stevenson's first published work is highly entertaining, but somewhat less mature than his other work."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I missed this one as a boy though I had always loved adventure fiction. So years later, and no longer a boy, I picked it up and tried to read it. But I just couldn't get into it and so put it aside. More recently I picked it up again, this time determined to see it through.Although it wasn't compelling at the start, with the appearance of an old pirate, Billy Bones, at the Admiral Benbow Inn run by young Jim Hawkins' father, it did start to pick up a head of steam as I pushed my way into it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it catching me up with the discovery of the map and the appearance of the pirates in hot pursuit of Billy Bones, and Jim's race to Dr. Livesy and Squire Trelawney to gain their protection. Intriguingly these upstanding English gentlemen, pillars of their community, decide to hunt the treasure for themselves though the squire, at least, lacks the good sense or discretion to keep the project secret. And so young Jim is swept along into the excursion, upon the death of his father, and soon finds himself aboard a suspect ship manned by an even more suspicious seeming crew on the way to a desert island in the Caribbean where old pirate Captain Flint's treasure is purportedly buried.The most interesting character is, of course, the by now famous Long John Silver who has long since entered into the cultural zeitgeist. But Silver's not nearly as charming or charismatic in this book as he has come to seem in popular recollection. Young Jim Hawkins, for his part, is a mischievous fellow who manages to get himself into one scrape after another while always coming out alright, even when he is obliged to face down a treacherous mutineer or when he stumbles unthinkingly into the pirates' own nest.In truth Treasure Island is not quite as exciting or as easy a read as one might expect for all its reputation. Still, it was nicely done and kept me reading to the end (though it did end with something of a letdown, leading me to think it somewhat overrated). It was a boy's book from the first, according to its author and I think it works well enough as that. Still, it's somewhat dated and lacks the excitement we've come to expect in our adventures today. Good but not among the best, in my view. I thought Stevenson's Master of Ballantrae much the better book.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This was a good book because it combined the passion of Shakespear and the adventure of a walk in the woods.- Billy Kidney, age11"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island&quot; is remarkably well written, containing fascinating bits of foreshadowing, a unique and captivating plot, and undying characters that will burn into your mind indefinitely.My personal favorite character is Long John Silver, who throughout the novel seems almost schitzofranic. His one side is well-mannered, charming and witty, while his other face is ruthless, sly and money-driven.In Part One, &quot;The Old Buccaneer&quot;, the strange new pirate pays Jim Hawkins a gold piece daily &quot;to watch out for a one-legged man hobbling down the street.&quot; This is truly good, almost humorous, foreshadowing.The ending is perfectly crafted by Stevenson; it closes with Jim Hawkins describing his predictions for the destinies of the pirates he has traveled with.Thank you, Robert Louis Stevenson, for contributing one of literatures' most amazing works."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I have never been very interested in pirates or plunder or the skull and crossbones flag until I read this book. Captain Long John Silver has been quite a fictional figure not only for my self but for the world (ex. Long John Silver's restaraunts). I must admit that I liked the book, but there was a flaw in it that I found. Jim Hawkins made the plotline a little too obvious at times. In one spot expecially, might I point out, he says that the apple barrel would in time save them all. Now that's a little obvious, don't you think? Perhaps if the author had found a way to avoid these give-aways I would have been more surprised with the story line than was when I read it for the first time. In the end, it's an exceptional piece of work, but the author did make some unforgivable mistakes at making the plot too obvious too soon. Oh well. I do have one more thing to say, though.

Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I read to my 11 and 9 year old daughters, a chapter a night and this one was perfect. It's not only a great story line, but allows children to identify with the main character. The graphic scenes describing various altercations between the crew and owners is relevant and realistic."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This classic purchased for kids intertainment and education on a road trip but adults probably enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Every image I have ever heard about pirates is perfectly captured in this one book and sets the standard for all others to live up to. I wish I had had time to read this when I was younger since it was obviously written with younger readers in mind, but I enjoyed it just as well at my current age, and I look forward to reading it to my own children.Since this was written for a younger reader, there is a lot of foreshadowing, which takes the edge off of the mystery and suspense. I guess Stevenson did not want the younger readers to worry to much about whether the main character is going to be all right, so that they could focus more on enjoying the story.This story has everything. Buried treasure, maps, one legged pirates, people walking the plank, talking parrots, murder, secret islands, hangings, sea adventure, drunken sailors, and songs. I can see where Jimmy Buffet probably got a lot of inspiration for some of his songs.Long John Silver is a despicable character that you can't help admiring one minute, and hating the next, only to find yourself somewhere in between at the end of the story. He's brave and cunning, but very conniving. Jim Hawkins is an excellent young character who has the habit of always being in the right place at the right time. He is young and impressionable, and I'm sure most of the readers can relate to him, and put themselves in his shoes. Captain Flint, who's character is not actually in the book still carries a lot of weight as an evil villain. Other characters not mentioned like the Doctor, Captain Smollett, and the Squire are quite honorable and hold their own throughout the story.No matter how deranged and twisted it might seem, these pirates have their own laws and their own coat of honor which they keep to in one way or other throughout the story. I wonder if Stevenson based this on any actual facts he may have obtained regarding real pirate's or whether he invented it all in his head. Regardless it is fascinating how they justify their actions. This book is on several lists as one of the top 100 books ever written, and I thoroughly agree with their assessment. The images drawn is this particular book were wonderful, and really captured each scene."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"A tale as old as time.

Many twists in the plot and a good outcome. Gives at the same time a look in early 19th c. life and a bunch of less used vocab, including maritime vocab :).The Kindle edition should have links from the table of contents (which was nicely scanned from the printed version), to the various chapters in the book.I remember that I have read (a translated) paper version a long time ago, and that there was a postscript, saying that 'he would not reveal the islands location' or something to that end. I missed that in this edition. Not sure why. Where there different editions originally, some having a epilogue, and some not? Is my memory failing? Something else?

Thank you Amazon for making it available!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I first read TREASURE ISLAND when I was 10 years old, and have not read it since. Now fifty years on I downloaded the novel on an impulse while on a recent vacation -- and was struck by the novel's narrative velocity, the gripping quality of the tale (even though it's now an oft-told variety of story that has been redone, revamped -- and amped up -- all the way up to and through the recent \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" film franchise). The novel is artfully structured -- seamless, in fact -- as it moves briskly from one tense plot point to the next while consistently maintaining a very reasonable level of verismilitude. (Once one gets past the somewhat outlandish premise that a couple 18th century English gentlemen with no experience of ships, sailing, or, moreover, piracy and criminality, would abruptly decide to launch an expedition to an uncharted island in search of loot stolen by a thug generally held to be the most savage pirate of them all. But, that aside ... ) It was a pleasure to take a few hours and read this novel again. Definitely fun, and striking to see how contemporary a feel in language and narrative drive that Stevenson maintained in a book published in 1883. Of note is that this novel was originally published as a \\"story for boys.\\" Indeed -- the only female character of even passing note is Jim Hawkins's mother, and she is left behind early on in the story. These days we would want -- and need -- a female character or two.

Jim and his family live in their inn called the ADMIRAL BENBOW. Captain Billy Bones is a man that holds the map to Treasure Island and the buried treasure. Jim and the crew of the HISPANIOLA head to Treasure Island. That's when Jim gets to know Long John Silver. It just happens to be that Long John Silver takes most of the men and mutinies, in order to take the treasure himself. The others that were mutinied went to the Stockade, a small little cabin in the forest. Jim hid and snuck out with the mutineers. When he got away from the mutineers he found a man named Ben Gunn that was marooned a few years before. Then Jim finally found the Stockade. The rest of the book has multiple twists and turns.This book was a complicated read for me. It has very hard to read the language and it has some very detailed violence. This book is made for readers that love adventure big challenges. This book is made for advanced 6th grade readers or higher. This book had to have taken Robert Louis Stevenson awhile because of the complicated storyline, language and character development. Having a good soul and sprit will lead to wealth in both physically and mentally and that is what this book teaches. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote this book as if it took place in old Great Britain with Pirates. He describes everything so well. Sometimes the descriptions are hard to understand. Robert also makes the book sound exactly like the time he set it in (around the 1700's). If you want a book full of adventure, treasure, pirates, ships and a challenge, then this is the book for you!Chloe 6th Grade"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This was one of my favorites when I was young. I remember reading it over and over again, and even when I wasn't reading it, I would take the book down and look at the wonderful illustrations in it, and be enthralled. I remember that when I got into college, one of the first things I did was write an essay for one of those intro to college courses in which I claimed that I was going to be a pirate when I grew up (I got an A), and of course, the essay was inspired by Treasure Island. I owe so much, including my bright future to this book...Anyway, about a decade after having read it last, I picked this little novel back up. It wasn't as long as I remembered it. And I started to read. And it grabbed me just as much as it had years ago. From the beginning, Stevenson's got you. It's easy to relate with Jim, and the cast of characters still doesn't fail to entertain. It's difficult to imagine any character that captures the imagination quite like Long John Silver does. And of course, Captain Smollet, Captain Flint, Dr. Livesey, Ben Gunn, and all the rest are something else, too. And, of course, the plot's deservedly classic. There are the cliffhangers and other standard adventure devices, and even though they've been used everywhere else, it's still authentic here. Anyway, it's still a great read to me, and I finished it in less than a day.So, it's a great book. Anybody on earth who can read would love it I'm sure.

The sailor -known as Billy Bones -dies in the night. Upon searching the contents of the dead sailor, a map is found - a treasure map no less! From there we follow the adventures of young Jim as he meets the secretive Long John Silver and his insightful talking parrot on the quest for gold. What mysteries and turns of fate lay waiting for them on Treasure Island? This is a relatively short book, but there is great adventure waiting if you are willing to set your sails for this masterpiece.Relic113"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This book is a classic adventure story. I knew and loved it as a child, and as an adult am seeing my children know and love it too. The main characters are complex and intruiging. Long John Silver, while being the quintessential bad guy, still has a sense of honor. He was so good at seeming like a good guy that he had everyone fooled. This book is a stimulating read for grown ups as well as a captivating one for kids. It was written at a time when people didn't feel they had to pander to children by dumbing down their writing. It is a great vocabulary builder for kids also."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This book is great. It is not fast-paced and pure adventure and excitement by current day standards, but it is excellent in it's own way. This is a simple story being told through the eyes of the protaginist, Jim Hawkins. It is rich and lush with descriptions of the seas and of the bizzare and treacherous characters. From the simpleness of the book, I could place myself into the roll of this young boy and my imagination did the rest. It was an extremely exciting book; but, not because of the action packed descriptions. It was exciting because it was a pure adventure on the high seas, and I really felt like I was looking for the treasure and listening to rugged pirates.The villians were perfect. They were not hard-core grotesque characters, but just balanced with self-preservation and greed. They were not rapists and excessive killers, just evil enough to fear them on the open waters.This book is wonderfully told. If you do not really get into books or don't enjoy excercising your imagination, this book is probably not for you. Otherwise, prepare for a wild adventure on the high seas."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"After a former pirate dies at his family's inn, young Jim Hawkins inadvertently stumbles across a treasure map of the notorious pirate, Captain Flint. he, and two others decide to set out to find Flint's treasure, but they are not the only ones who know of the map's existence....Once onboard their newly purchased ship, the Hispaniola, Jim overhears the plans for mutiny by the crew, most of whom sailed under Captain Flint while he lived, and who are led by Long John Silver, the supposed amiable ship's cook.\\"Treasure Island\\" tells of the conflict between Jim Hawkins & co, and the mutineers, and is full of well developed characters, who, while they are not \\"perfect people\\", have good intentions, and act as you would think they would in real life. the pirates are treacherous and double-crossers, who care only to get the gold, and the protagonists are merely trying to stay alive; while this plot may be a little cliched, in some cases, cliches are what work, and I have nothing against that. unfortunately, this book isn't one of them. My only complaint was the overused plot style, which wasn't either original or suprising, as I mentioned earlier, and despite colorful and innovative language and characters, it still follows the simple good vs evil/going on a treasure hunt scheme, which doesnt appeal to me personally.All in all, if you're looking for something new and different, this probably isnt the book, but if you don't mind a return to the classic adventure stories, than start reading!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I compared this large-format abridged edition (retelling by Timothy Mies, original Wyeth illustrations) to another large-format abridged edition, A Young Reader's Edition of the Classic Adventure, published by Running Press in 2002 (retelling by Steven Zorn, original Wyeth illustrations) and I chose this one. For storytelling I preferred the Zorn version in the other edition because the language was a bit more salty and closer to the flavor of the original, although the Mies retelling in this edition is perfectly acceptable. When it came to the illustrations, however, the quality of reproduction in this edition outshined the other to such a degree that this edition won out. The Wyeth illustrations in this edition are simply electric -- large, colorful and very crisp, while in the other edition the same illustrations are dark and blurry."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"A century and a quarter after it first appeared, \\"Treasure Island\\" is still the quintessential story of pirates and treasure, the one that all others are measured against. It is also by far the most \\"readable\\" (if you can handle a little 18th Century nautical slang) of all so-called Literary Classics. If they made you read it in school, try it again; if you missed it in school, give it a try now.What gives this novel its peculiar staying power? Why can it still fascinate a reader (child OR adult) of the 21st Century? Well Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the great storytellers to start with, and since he was writing it for a child, his stepson, Treasure Island lacks some of the Victorian literary fashions that otherwise could have dated it. Also piracy and treasure hunting offer ample opportunities for exciting adventure. In addition Long John Silver is a truly brilliant creation; a character whose conflicted ambiguity has resulted in dramatic interpretations over the years ranging from total villain to foster father.However, I think the forgotten ingredient is simply this: unlike most fictional treasure hunts, in Treasure Island the good guys get to keep the treasure. Stop and think how many treasure hunt stories end instead with the treasure being lost forever or returned to the rightful owners and the heroes ending up with nothing or just a handful that leaves them little if any better off than they were. But the truth is that whatever the dangers of getting rich quick most of us would be willing to take the risk if we could find a treasure that belonged to no one else. Treasure Island feeds this need in a way that very few of its imitators do.As for this edition,Treasure Island (Courage Classics), I like it because it includes the fascinating essay RLS wrote about writing Treasure Island, particularly the genesis of Long John Silver."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Do you love blood thirsty pirates and treasure huntin'? Then this is the book for you. Filled to the brim with pirates, such as Billy Bones, Black Dog, Blind Pew, Israel Hands and even Long John Silver, this suspenseful novel is about young Jim Hawkins who gets Captain Flint's treasure map and teams up with the local doctor and squire on the adventure of a lifetime. As they go on their voyage in search of treasure they are faced with a mutinous crew who served Captain Flint. Even though Captain Flint is dead they all think they have a fair share at the treasure. Read this historic adventure full of treachery and deceit to see if Jim Hawkins and the trustworthy men of the ship survive.I think this is a great novel and would recommend it to any of my friends.

There were some parts that were not as interesting as others and they needed some excitment and at these parts I didnt think that I was going to like the book, but by the end I didnt want it to be over. I thought it was very exciting how they were on the island with all these pirates and how they were both going after the same thing, the treasue.

I was first introduced to this book in the eighth grade (I'm 22 now) and have loved it ever since, even keeping the copy given to me in class, telling my teacher I lost it so I wouldn't have to give it back.What makes this book so fun? Overall, it is an fun adventure, making it a fun read. The main characters are fleshed out well. For example, we the reader feel just as betrayed as young Jim Hawkins when he learns of Long John Silver's plot to steal the treasure.The story itself is broken into nice sections and flows together from start to finish. There is never really a dull moment in the book.Treasure Island is a great read and a classic novel. Just don't confuse it with Pirates of the Carribean."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is a beautifully written classic that can take you to a different world, or maybe two. Set in the time of pirates, this book takes you on a treasure hunt that is full of back-stabbing, loyalty, and adventure. The author keeps you compelled to read on because of his lack of detail for conflicts. You just cannot wait to turn the next page to see why this man is angry, what happened in the past, and what kind of foreshadowing you can get for the future. The only bad part about this book is the extremely confusing language. That author uses the slang and terms that of the time and setting, which is great because it's accurate, but almost annoying because it's hard to keep up with. This book also requires a little back-up knowledge of the story, because the language you read might confuse you, and cause you to not get enough information on the story at hand and characters in it. In this book my favorite character was \\"the bad man with one leg\\" (you'll find out who it is later in the book, I won't ruin it) because even though he's the evil character, he's so wonderfully generated and portrayed. His evil-ness is overtaking the man itself, and while you'd love for Hawkins(the main character) to avoid him, and stay safe, you find yourself also begging for confrontation, just to see what the \\"one legged man's\\" scheme will be. Overall, I think this is a classic for every generation. And unless you're obsessed with love stories, this book will have it all. Also, people who don't even like adventure type books will enjoy this novel too because of the sheer greatness of it all. \\"Treasure Island\\" is constructed amazingly well, with all the good cliff hangers left for you to read and figure out for yourself, and all the parts that \\"make you twitch\\" are in all the right places."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The best book I ever read was Treasure Island. I liked it because it is an adventure story. Adventure books are my favorite type of books! I thought the treasure hunt would be the most exciting part, but it wasn't. The gun fight was much more exciting.This exciting book is about a boy named Jim Hawkins. He lives and works at a hotel. One day a pirate comes and gives Billy Bones, Jim's boss, the black spot. The pirate leaves and Billy faints and never wakes up. Jim found Billy's treasure map. The pirates come back and attack his house.

A very easily read, fast-moving and enjoyable book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is legend. It has defined the stereotypical look of the pirate. Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver are nothing short of immortal. The fish restauraunt can tell you that! This book is the most famous by the GREAT Robert Louis Stevenson; published in 1883, it is one of the landmarks in the late Victorian Age and it still continues to be read and cherished by young and old alike. Going off the subject for a little indulgence, wouldn't it have been genius if there was a biographic movie of the life of Robert Louis Stevenson with the very UNDERRATED actor Donald Sutherland playing the part of probably the greatest author who ever lived? (Robert Louis Stevenson who'd you think AVI?! HA HA! AVI SUCKS LIKE A LEECH!) Since Sutherland looked exactly like Stevenson, the movie could've been gold and there was a golden opportunity for Hollywood to capitalize on, but now, Sutherland has aged and the opportunity is all but gone, sadly.Sorry about that, just something I had to get off my chest because Stevenson and Sutherland look exactly alike. Getting back to the subject (I ramble too much I know. I just love the man Robert Louis Stevenson and his writings of gold. Don't worry folks; I got a million of 'em!) This book is nothing but adventure on the high seas, treasure, pirates, \\"pieces of eight,\\" and pure joy.Getting back to what I said earlier, there is little chance that the \\"pirate\\" would've survived into the culture today had it not been for Robert Louis Stevenson's immortal work.Read this (Would you believe you have been reading the review of someone who is obsessed with Robert Louis Stevenson and has not even read this book yet! I'll be alright folks. Thanks for sticking with me my friends) and you'll be convinced that Robert Louis Stevenson could be the greatest writer who ever lived. If you are not convinced after reading this (very small chance of that. The only way you don't finish this book is if 1. the book is destroyed 2. You go blind 3.You die 4. You forget how to read) check out The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Kidnapped and you too will be a rambling nerd like myself.Answering the question in the title, I would give a rousing, \\"HELL NO!!!!!!!!\\"Robert Louis Stevenson1850-1894"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. I found this book to be not so enjoyable. It begins with slow, hard to follow beginning, and continues with a somewhat sped up middle with many confusing twists and new people. The end I also found to be boring. This just seemed like a short story streched out on many pages lots of new places, characters, or things in between.The parts of this book that I could follow along with were few and even still not inturesting. It took effort to read and keep everything in your head. I had to read over many things twice.Some of the characters are Jim,Jim's mom,Dr. Livesey,Pew, Admiral Benbow,and others. Jim is the boy who goes on the adventures with the pirates. Jim worked an inn with his mom and dad. A sstrangwe visitor came around that was a pirate. Jim's dad died and so did the pirate... which is where Black Dog came and Jim's whole adventure started. He traveled across seas to find treasure, and he thought that the island was scary and haunted.If you are an advanced reader, who can keep up with many things I might suggest this to you. If you are inturested in a fantasy like story with pirates, you also may enjoy this. However if you are an average person who just enjoys casually reading or you like to have a book that leaves you on the edge, I would have to say you would not want to read this."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure IslandA young boy named Jim who has lived all his life with his parents working at the Admiral Benbow had a normal life.

After arriving at the island he encounters more than he bargained for. Robert Louis Stevenson put together a great book that every age would adore. He starts with details to make the story clear and then takes of on a fascinating story. Jim Hawkins & Long John Silver are classic imagination.

Normally that is a good thing, but in this case the Hollywood versions are better. The ties between Long John Silver and Jim were much more tenuous in this book than in more recent portrayals and I think that's not as fun. Because it is a well known story it also lacks the excitement of something really new.That said, it think everyone should read it. It is a fun, short book, easy to read despite some old English and it was a blast to see from where the quintessential pirate and pirate story originated.

It is hard to believe Robert Louis Stevenson published this in 1883. It has suspense and mystery, adventure, and the excellent use of point of view would work for today's novels. I believe the author cleverly moved the main narrator, Jim Hawkins, from one group to another to have first hand point of view. Only once did point of view switch to the doctor. Stevenson also let Jim overhear the pirates in a way to know what was going on. I finished reading it while on vacation in St. Thomas Virgin Islands, not far from where the model for Treasure Island is supposed to be."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is a terrific adventure story. It capitalizes on the romance of piracy, while exposing the moral emptiness in an entertaining way.A story from the point of view of pirates or the ships they attacked would simply be about straight up murder, robbery and rapine. By starting out on dry land, and focusing on the treasure on a tropical island in the Caribbean, Stevenson is able to present the pirates as real, fearsome but pitiable people.Although Jim Hawkins was warned to watch out for the one legged man, he and everyone else falls for the lies of Long John Silver -- one indication people with lost limbs were so not unusual at that time.Long John Silver is capable of absolute moral relativism (in modern terms). He's capable of being pleasant, friendly and seemingly reliable while plotting treachery. When his plans fail (partly because the pirates are incapable of sustained discipline), he switches sides again to sell out his friends and escape the noose, and then slips away at the end.You have to wonder why a fast food chain would be named after him.The author has a keen eye for the fun of a treasure hunt, and even keener eye for the human failings of both the good guys and bad guys."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is a superb book on many levels.

Another exciting book isThe Drum, equally suitable for young readers by AEW Mason."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Pirates, treasure, sea adventures..need there be more? This book is a classic and definitely deserves that claim. It not only was a good read many moons ago, but still today can capture keep the attention of young readers. The storyline and characters are all very believable and followable. With a doctor, a squire, a good hearted kid trying to help his family, lots of pirates, a captain, and an island with treasure, you get entwined with the story from the first page. In it you watch a young boy grow into a young man who has to learn about trust, integrity, adventure, duties, and survival.

The great author Robert Louis Stevenson organized the tales contained in Treasure Island so greatly that putting the book down for even a moment is a shame. Stevenson is a famous author for many reasons, possessing many skills that are necessary to write truly beautiful tales. One of these skills that Stevenson has mastered is the ability to give each and every one of his characters a distinct personality, as distinct as any real person. Throughout his adventurous novel Treasure Island Stevenson impresses his audience with the way he develops each of his characters, as he does, Jim Hawkins, Dr.Livesey, and Long John Silver.We are introduced at the very beginning to our narrator, Jim Hawkins himself. By orders of Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey Hawkins writes down all of his adventures, leaving out only the position of Treasure Island for there is still treasure supposedly buried there.Hawkins is a young boy of about twelve or thirteen living in his family's Inn, the Admiral Benbow, he is (as most young boys are) very relaxed and not very aware of the potential dangers about him. An old pirate Billy Bones wanders into the Inn, throws down some money for a room and makes himself right at home. After many months of terrorizing and staying long past where his money paid for Bones falls ill, at almost the same time as Bone's illness Hawkins father passes as he has been very ill as well. Once Bone's has become well a man presents him with a black spot, or a pirates symbol of guilt or judgment which causing him to have a stroke and die as well.After seeing Bone's die Hawkins seems to mature a bit, suddenly realizing the dangers that could now harm him and his mother. Acting quickly Hawkins and his mother unlock Bone's chest, and escape the Inn as it is being attacked with a logbook and map in hand.Hawkins and his mother meet up with Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney in hopes that they can help with their new found map. They are told that this map is to a huge treasure, assumed to only be a legend. This being where we first meet Dr. Livesey, an extremely responsible and safe man, never doing anything without thinking twice and making sure of that's its outcome is the best it could possibly be. Stevenson, (our author) makes Dr. Livesey personality easy to predict, only in a good way of course. He can be relied on in the heat of the moment to come up with a last minute ingenious plan to save the day.Squire Trelawney quickly rounds up a crew and ship to start an expedition, with a top-class crew they all set off, Dr. Livesey, Trelawney, and Hawkins. Each of them quick to notice that their crew is nowhere near what they expected. Hawkins is stuck with the ships chef, Long John Silver in hopes that this will keep him out of trouble. Sometime into the voyage Hawkins overhears Silver discussing a Mutiny with the other crew members and immediately reports this to the captain and all the trustworthy men. They reach land and the captain gives all the crew some \`leisure time' on shore in hopes to get ride of them. Hawkins follows and after witnessing Silver murder a man of the crew he flees from the pirates coming across a slightly crazy man named Ben along the way, who in the end is a great help. This epic tale goes on into many more betrayals and discovery's to end in a traditional happy ending.From the beginning of the book to the end Jim Hawkins develops from a child to a man, and a strong man at that. He learns to defend what he thinks is right and how to choose the right side in the end. After finishing off his adventures as a one-time sailor he goes back to the Inn with his proud mother, fixing it up of course. Going from a young boy who never knew any better to a man who could do it all again a million times if he had too. His personality never once wavers from what he truly is, always in character. Then there is Long John Silver, although he may switch from side to side throughout the book it is always what you expect him to do. It was in Silver's persona to do whatever it took to get his treasure and not to care what that meant he had to sacrifice.When it comes to making a character with true substance, making it seem like they could step right out of a book, a living breathing person. Only great writer's can make such amazing things come to life, a gift that Stevenson did definitely possess, among many others I'm sure."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I got this movie which motivated me to buy my first book as a kid.

Honestly, it was very underwhelming. The action was bland and the tension between good vs. evil withered away near the end. Also, it was very difficult to fully understand the book without looking up each nautical term and pirate jargon found in every line about halfway through the book.

I've been reading a lot of classics lately and I'm glad I decided to read this one. I read the Kindle version and loved it. This is one that my homeschooled son is going to read this year and I'm looking forward to discussing it with him. It has adventure, suspense, surprise twists and turns - everything you expect in a great book. One of the reviewers mentioned that some of the negative reviews for this book might be because a student was forced to read it for school. He said that if a student is forced to read something then they will probably hate it. I disagree. My son has read a lot of books for school and loved most of them. If you create a love for books when a child is young then he will grow up with an appreciation of great books. This is one of those great books. I will agree with one thing that the reviewer said however. Don't force your child to read it....READ IT WITH HIM! Read it to him. Read it as a family. I think they will agree that it is worth five stars as well."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"What a fantastic book! I still have recollections of reading Moby Dick in high school, and wishing I could have read anything else. It was torture...I know it's a classic and all, but it was so dry and boring. So it was with trepidation that I picked this up, and wow what a difference an author makes! This book was so entertaining and easy to fall into. The action is paced just right, and the descriptions of the various places and scenery is just enough - not too much, not too little. While the characters may seem cliche, it's important to remember that they only seem so because our popular culture has drawn so much from them. Stevenson is to pirates what Tolkien is to fantasy - it is the base-line from which everything else draws from. Keep that in mind and give this one a chance. You can't go wrong with free."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The book itself was good and I read it faster than I have other classics. One thing that bothered me was how short some lines were and how others went the full width of the screen. The lines were laid out in a non-sensical way. In books it is usually obvious why a line would be short but this was just the opposite. It didn't make me want to stop reading because I enjoyed the story but it seemed odd that the ebook would be set up like that."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Note: Letter grades are given at the end of my review ranging from A (highest) to F (lowest).(Sorry, I had to pull this review off Amazon for a few days because I accidentally wrote it on another user's account. I'm also sorry it appears twice. I'm not certain how this happened but I'm unable to get rid of either of my reviews.)Ye be warned: Treasure Island (Robert Louis Stevenson, 220 pages) may leave you wishing that you were living inside it's brilliantly imagined world. Stevenson's lovingly applied detail in describing people, places and things sucks the reader in immediately, and you'll stick around to experience one of the finest narratives in all of sailing literature.It is thus unsurprising that Treasure Island's somewhat visual style inspired several similar stories, mostly films. When I first read it, it reminded me of Indiana Jones 4 mixed with Pirates of the Caribbean and a tiny pinch of the Cohen Brother's True Grit adaption. You can sometimes feel the dry humor of the original Office in there too.The plot involves an old sea dog taking residence in an inn in England, trying and failing to escape his old pirate shipmates, who want the treasure map he has. He dies of alcohol poisoning, and the map is taken by Jim Hawkins, who was owed money by the deceased sailor. Jim and his friends use the map to find an island where pirate gold awaits. The story sounds hokey on paper, but in reality this is the mother of all pirate stories, and it's execution is so flawless any disbelief is quickly and forcefully cast aside.Treasure Island is much about its characters. There are quite a few of them, and Stevenson manages to juggle them successfully and keep all the balls in the air, if you will. There's a few humorous exchanges from Dr. Livesy and Squire Trewalny, who bicker like Holmes and Watson in Sign of Four; there's of course the infamous rogue Silver, who starts off as a cheery cook only to turn the tables and start hunting for our hero's blood. But the real star of the book is Jim Hawkins, an intelligent young boy (probably about 10-12 years old) who narrates the story and carries it along. Jim is somehow simultaneously funny, smart and a little complicated, a lot like Indiana Jones. In certain scenes, however, he displays moments of self-centered eccentricity, which do wonders to humanize him.In film adaption and sequels, Jim is often overshadowed by Silver (who, to be fair, is also an interesting character). This isn't true to the spirit of Treasure Island, however, as Jim is largely the star character and rightfully so. He deserves his place next to Jack Sparrow and Indiana Jones as one of the greatest characters to wear a good hat and go treasure hunting.

It's engaging and I just find the 1700s and pirates/sailing really interesting. It can be a little difficult to understand some of the writing, being as it was written in the 1820s or 30s I think, and sometimes Stevenson uses phrases and figures of speech that are definitely not used anymore, but with context you can usually figure out what they mean. I am well into part 2 (out of 6), and the main characters are right about to leave port for the first time. Even before the actual sailing has started, the book is exciting. If you like adventure or pirates, I highly recommend it.Alex"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I have just finished reading my first Kindle Android App classic, Treasure Island. It was a joy! I had first read the book at age nine without the least knowledge of seafaring or sailing terminology, and with no ear for the lilt of nineteenth century English narrative style or dialogue. From an adult reader's perspective, and with a familiarity with Victorian wordplay and pronunciation, the story sailed along like a schooner on the trade-winds. If you have a talent for a spectrum of British accents and dialects, or the ability to act, read this book aloud to your kids. It is rather gory in places so it is probably not recommended for very small children, but it will be loads of fun for most young adventure-seekers. The story has not lost any of its charm or suspense in over 100 years. As a fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, I noticed a thousand details in the book that had made their way fully intact from Robert Louis Stevenson's nineteenth century imagination into those recent and popular films.

I certainly hope it's the former, I'd hate to think that kids today aremissing out on all the great pirate tales that we used to thrill too. Foremost of these was, of course,Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson.I may well be wrong here, but it seems to me that Stevenson pioneered one of the central techniques ofchildren's literature ; placing a child at the center of what might otherwise be a typical adult adventurenovel. This simple but ingenious idea gives kids a character to identify with and allows the author towrite from the child's perspective.In the case of Treasure Island, young Jim Hawkins narrates the story of how he and Squire Trelawney,Dr. Livesey, and the enigmatic Long John Silver ended up on board the Hispaniola, looking for thelost treasure of the notorious pirate Captain John Flint. Packed with betrayals, battles, mutinies, andeven a parrot squawking &quot;Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!&quot;, the book is the source for many of theenduring and beloved clich&eacute;s of the genre.This is a classic that each generation should discover anew. Heck, if enough kids start reading it again,maybe Hollywood will even take another crack at a pirate movie, this time a decent one.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Written in the early 1700s by Robert Louis Stevenson the old-fashioned style of writing adds to the realism of the adventure.

Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island&quot; is remarkably well written, containing fascinating bits of foreshadowing, a unique and captivating plot, and undying characters that will burn into your mind indefinitely. My personal favourite character is Long John Silver, who throughout the novel seems almost \\"two-faced\\". His one side is well mannered, charming and witty, while his other face is ruthless, sly and money-driven. However, he has been quite a fictional figure not only for my self but also for the world. In Part One, &quot;The Old Buccaneer&quot;, the strange new pirate pays Jim Hawkins a gold piece daily &quot;to watch out for a one-legged man hobbling down the street.&quot; The ending is perfectly crafted by Stevenson; it closes with Jim Hawkins describing his predictions for the destinies of the pirates he has travelled with. On the other hand, Jim Hawkins made the plotline a little too obvious at times. In one spot especially, he says that the apple barrel would in time save them all. In the end, it's an exceptional piece of work, but the author did make some unforgivable mistakes by making the plot too obvious so soon."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The master of this book-Robert L.

One of the things I had trouble with is that his sentence structure would be very jumpy and some times incomplete. For example he would have his characters fighting in the stockade and then the next sentence a guy was dead, shot through the head. My favorite character was captain Silver; he had one crutched leg and a good humor. He was not the main character but he did play a good size part, some of the things he said frequently made me laugh. His book is set in a time of pirates and treasure hunters and Stevenson captured their unique vocabulary, \\"why, shiver my timbers, if I hadn't forgotten my score\\". Some of the most significant events were in the beginning at the Admiral Benbow lodge, when there were a lot of unpleasant visits by an old captain carrying a sea chest, but this is where the main character Jim found interest in treasure hunting.My opinion of this book is that it was too hard for me. I'm a very intelligent student, but I couldn't always follow along with the book. I couldn't remember some of the characters roles as the crew and all the abbreviations were just so hard for me to read. It had good action in it so that definitely made me more interested in finishing it. I would say that this book is most likely to hard for any grade lower than 6th. It is good for any one 12-40. Over all I gave this book two stars."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Just ordered and downloaded this book to my pc. The book is not complete only 27 pages long! What's going on? Granted, I got it for free because it was advertised as a free book, but I really liked this book when I read it in Highschool and was looking forward to reading it again. This was a total waste of time!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Jim Hawkins, a young man living in rural England with his parents, helps run an inn with his parents. His life changes forever when a mysterious dying pirate takes residence at the inn. The shadowy pirate is often on the lookout for strangers who begin to show up in search of the pirate. Rum finally takes its toll on the pirate and he dies, leaving behind a mysterious chest that the strangers are interested in. Upon examination, Jim discovers a treasure map.With the help of Jim's adult friends, a crew is formed to go in search of the pirate's buried treasure on a remote tropical island. The journey is uneventful until, Jim saves the day when he realizes that their crew consists mainly of pirates who hope to cause mutiny upon reaching the island. Ultimately, a raging battle takes place on the island where Jim and his friends must outwit the pirates who are led by the one-legged Long John Silver.For a children's book, this book had a lot of inappropriate material - drinking and violence. I also had a tough time with the old-English writing style and the nautical terms. This book was ahead of its time, though, in terms of the adventure it described, but I was hoping for more. Fans of H. Rider Haggard (ala King Solomon's Mines) will enjoy this book but I was sort of happy to be done with it as some parts were engaging and others were muddled."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The book Treasure Island is an exciting book. It contains mutineers, pirates, and a big treasure. It is a challenging book to read though. There are loops and turns around every corner. Jim, the main character comes across a ship called the Hispaniola, and rode it for the rest of the book. He takes on many troubles throughout the book. At first, he meets a man called Long John Silver. He seems very nice at first but at the end, he finds out something about Silver.There tends to be mutinies when a ship sets off for treasure, and that's exactly what happens.One day, the ship is sailing on and BOOM! There sounds a gunshot! The wicked mutineers attack the ship killing one person, shooting them in the head. But it's not over yet! Three muskets go off at a time and one of the mutineers falls. The fight goes on and it is soon found out that the mutineers had lost more souls then the ships company and that was good for Jim.At one point in the book, Jim comes across a man that was on an island that had been marooned and he had been there for over three years and had to live off eating goat.The sentence structure of the book was a very hard. The sentences were very hard to read and there were a lot of things going on at the same time and it never seemed to end. One reason that the book was so hard was it was almost a different kind of English. The book was written in the late 1800 so it was very hard to understand. The sentences were long and choppy and they went on. But on the other hand some sentences were only two words.The word choice of the book was two ways mostly. That means that some words were long and some words were very short. But the words were switched around so it was even harder to read.The description of the book was not so great. Robert didn't describe the setting too well. Sometimes you couldn't tell where Jim was at some points because of the poor description.My opinion of the book was not so great and it was hard to understand because of the word choice and the settings were very bad at some points. At one part of the book Jim comes off the ship and it doesn't explain what was happening and it seemed there was something missing. And at some points it seemed that the word were too long and you were waiting for something else to happen and it got boring. After some sentences it was so confusing that you had to read it again until you got what was going on. That was hard to do and that's one reason I didn't like the book all that much.I think that the appropriate age for reading this book is about 13 or 14 yeas old. I think that it was not so good for my age because I didn't understand it all that much, and if someone were older, then they have a better learning experience and they can understand the hard words. I am only eleven years old and this book is not such a good book for my age.Ben Schwartz 6th Grade"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Though some people may not find much that this book offers in comparison to more recent books, I think that it meets the goals of its author very well. The book is simply something that has stood the test of time because it is a very simple story. There are no major plot twists or complexities. It is something that could be read to a child (And as a side note, the alchohol mentioned was a common practice of pirates and fully helps to show the baseness of them and show them as having no standards whatsoever, also it was more common in the time period written of that people drank alchohol rather than water for various reasons. The mear fact of that is something that adds an historical aspect to the story). The wording of everything also lends both atmosphere and a chance for a story-teller to embelish on accents and such. Overall, with this book being compared to any of the Treasure Island movies or remakes, you can't beat the original. This story, almost by itself it seems to me, created the entire Pirate Archetype in literature. All the aspects of language set in this book have been followed by later books and movies. So to say this book isn't worth reading is simply a lack of (or for that matter, an excessive ammount of pride in one's) intelligence. It is a simple, good book that is quite a page turner in my oppinion."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Jim Hawkins can't decide who should be his dad, so he skips the question entirely and turns into a man himself. Also, rum."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This book is good, has it's fair share of excitment and adventure, but it being a classic does have it's boring moments. These are the periods that just drag on and on with description or with attempt at building anticipation. This might just be a problem to me because I have grown up in a day and age where the build up has to be darn good to keep the population's attention. All in all, because of it's classic status and it's effect on literature and movies about pirates, I would definatly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is about a boy, Jim Hawkins, who discovered a great treasure by means of a treasure map from an old seafaring man that stayed at his father's inn. With this map he sets off on a voyage with a crew picked by another sailor named Long John Silver, who is the cause of the trouble on the ship.A little while into the voyage, Jim hides in an apple barrel when some of the crew comes into the room he is in, and overhears that Silver has planned a mutiny. The captain and the loyal crew members must decide what to do about the mutiny and how to get the gold back without a ship.This is a classic adventure novel. It will keep you reading until you are done, and then you will want to read it again. I can't see how anyone would pass up the opportunity to read this great book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I didn't really come into the reading of Treasure Island with any expectations even though the tale and characters are iconic. Yes, I knew it involved buried treasure, pirates and Jim Hawkins but was ignorant of the specifics of the plot. All I was expecting was a good tale. I found that the iconic status of the book was more impressive than the actual work, something not uncommon in the digital age.The family of the young Jim Hawkins' runs a not quite prospering inn and everything seems to be going on its drudging way until a man with no name shows up. He bears a scar and a sea chest and comes to be known as \\"the captain\\". He spends most of his time boozing until some shady chracters show up to talk to him. The captain will draw Jim and his family into his past and a violent present after his death and the discovery of a treasure map. Jim's life will speed up to encompass pirates, pursuit, buried treasure, and that mascot of fish franchises, Long John Silver, and his ever-present parrot on his shoulder. No, the parrot's name is not Polly.Treasure Island is a fast moving narrative that keeps on pumping energy on every page. Stevenson has a real talent at keeping you interested. The character of Jim is well-drawn as are most of the main characters. The problems come with the minor characters. The pirates are completely stupid and you wonder how they could have ever earned a living doing it because they are so incompetent. I really don't see why this book has the place it does in the canon of good literature. It's an average young adult novel."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"could be.

Originally the book was serialized in \\"Young Folks\\" between 1881 and 1882, but was then published as a book on May 23rd of 1883. \\"Treasure Island\\" is a wonderful adventure for younger readers, and has had an impact on popular culture. The popular stereotype of pirates, and buried treasure marked by an X on a treasure map, all comes from this story.Most of the story is narrated by Jim Hawkins, the son of the owners of an inn, who becomes involved in a mystery involving sailors and treasure, though there are a few chapters narrated by Doctor Livesey, whom Jim looks to as a trusted magistrate. The adventure takes place at some point in the 18th century, though one cannot determine the exact time frame and regardless it isn't important for the story.This is a great work for younger readers as it is full of adventure and interesting characters, and a young hero in Jim Hawkins. The best known of the characters, though, is Long John Silver. Hired as a cook for the expedition, it is no surprise that Silver turns out to be much more. Silver has much more complexity and depth than any other character in the story, and that is perhaps the main thing that makes the story as engaging as it is. There is no shortage of film adaptations and TV shows based on this work, and though its story is clearly of a time, the enjoyment of reading it is timeless."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"As a child, I only listened to someone reading this adventure to me.

Tremendous book...I recommend it highly...."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Jim Hawkins is the young hero who comes into possession of a treasure map leading to the golden hoard of an infamous pirate. Hawkins enlists the help of a reputable doctor and his servants in going after the treasure, but one of the servants blabs too much, which attracts the interest of the pirate's former crew. The former pirates sign on with Jim Hawkins and company in their new ship and plot to mutiny once the treasure is attained. Due to fortuitous events young Mr. Hawkins stumbles on the pirates' plan and warns his compatriots, and the rest of the book is a tense standoff between honest crewmembers and pirates. I won't tell you who wins, but the most fascinating character in the book is Long John Silver, the pirate captain's former quartermaster, who plays both sides in a constant back-and-forth that ultimately sours Jim on him and earns him the enmity of the honest men in the crew. As the pirates and the honest men fight it out it is never clear who is going to win and who is doomed to fail and be killed or left behind on Treasure Island.This book is a gripping adventure yarn that starts out fast-paced and never lets up. Its terse, tense storytelling style plays pirates against the honest crew members in a series of bloody face-offs that sees many men killed and others greviously wounded. All through the book you wonder if Jim is going to find the pirate treasure or if he's going to get perforated before he gains so much as a penny. Jim takes many risks along the way and gets lucky a couple of times, and in the end he wins through, though not without some scars (physical and emotional) picked up along the way. This tale won popular acclaim in the Victorian age and continues to fascinate today with its bold story and action-adventure, and I can well see it retaining its charm a hundred years from today. It's written for young adult boys but should be appealing for anyone, even younger children, who want an exciting story of piracy and the hunt for pirate gold. The footnotes are of great value with all the pirate-talk, which I otherwise wouldn't have understood, but there aren't a lot of notes and they're easy to pick up on.

It seems to me that this classic novel has done well to satisfy in that role, and I will also add that the Oxford World's Classics introduction, explanatory notes, and other supplements were useful, if unessential.That said, I am afraid there is little to recommend Treasure Island to the modern reader. The story itself has been surpassed many times over, and the archaic maritime language is a double-edged sword of charm and impediment; the writing is fun and quotable for the same reasons that often render it a right chore to comprehend. If one's sole purpose in selecting Stevenson's tale of the stalwart Hispaniola crew's quest for buried booty amid the treachery of Long John Silver upon Skeleton Island is merely to be entertained by a hardy lads' romp, it must be said that many superior (and less frustrating) options have become available since it was published in 1883. You and I are simply too removed from this work by time to enjoy it properly.However, I am ultimately glad that I read Treasure Island. Its historical value is clear both as a genre pioneer and as the origin for so many well-known pirate tropes, and, although it can be difficult in the telling, to be sure, the tale is not an unpleasant one."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed this story the first time around.

So, going in with fresh eyes made the book that much better, in my opinion, and I was able to enjoy the surprising twists and turns the plot took even more. If you have any interest in pirates and good, classic literary works, I think you would enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The pirate theme has always been one of my favorite. I'm a big fan of the Goonies and Peter Pan may be my favorite Disney animation. I even enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, the other two... not so much. The pirate genre didn't start with Robert Lewis Stevenson's classic novel but his is probably the most influential. Treasure Island was written in the later half of the 1800's before \`Shiver Me Timbers' and \`Pieces of Eight' became overused pirate phrases and \`Dead Man's Chest' became the traditional anthem of movie pirates.It isn't a deep engaging story that makes Treasure Island such a classic. Quite frankly it's a pretty straight forward tale involving a treasure hunt and a mutineering crew of pirates. What makes this story a classic is in the storytelling and Mr. Stevenson makes it seem effortless. When I read books of lesser quality I can sense the author chiseling out the words rather than letting them flow. Books shouldn't feel crafted they should immerse the reader to the point where you forget there's even an author behind the story. Movie scripts are particularly egregious in trying to pound out a catch phrase to stick in the audiences mind but I see it in books also. Without even trying Stevenson created or popularized half a dozen or more sayings that have survived for over a century. With Long John Silver he essentially created the pirate template that has been used endlessly from Captain Barbossa to Spongebob Squarepants', Patchy the Pirate. Just don't blame Stevenson for the fact that John Silver has become a clich&eacute;.Young Bill Hawkins is the main protagonist in the story but Long John Silver steals the show. Silver is a wonderful multi-faceted anti-hero that you can't help but root for by the end of the book. This is the kind of book anyone can read but the target audience is probably teen and preteen boys. In fact it is probably the quintessential example of a book that targets young males, a genre that has essentially withered away from its hay day in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Perhaps books like this could inspire younger male audiences to read more than just comic books and video games cheat codes (not that there is anything at all wrong with either pastime).

As a 5th grader it was a bit over his head, but we both enjoyed it very much. This book is the reason I became so fascinated with pirates. It's a story that just sticks with you. There are memorable characters and slippery plot complications that make this literally a genuine trip as you turn the pages. Some may consider this an unnecessary read given its time frame, but put in context, this is a delightful story that should resonate with young boys. It's a classic for the very reason that it endures. It finds a place in that little place in the mind called adventure and wanderlust.Jamestown: Journey Back in Time"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"&quot;Treasure Island&quot; is a classic.

He sails with his adult friends to find this treasure aboard the great Hispaniola. When a dreadful plot of treachery and mutiny is exposed, Jim begins to see how dangerous this sea adventure really is. Once upon the island, Jim and his friends find it harder than ever to keep grasp of life...A truly great book with the classic theme that never grows old.

Long John Silver was a well developed character and really defines the moral struggles of mankind. The outright greed at first and then the ultimate fate he was to endure at the end of the story (no spoilers) was written in a way that I could identify with. Jim was such a strong and courageous character that doesn't seem to avoid confrontation that he keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire book. A few times during the thick of the plot, I actually gasped aloud thinking it may be the end! Altogether, this was a very good and easy read. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a classic sea/pirate/adventure novel and with the lack of foul language it is deemed appropriate for all ages."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Here's a basic fact: I'm the biggest bookworm you'll ever meet. In fact, I'm probably the fattest little worm on the planet, from eating all those stories. So I'm amazed that it took me so long to pick up Treasure Island. I mean, I'm a kid who reads Pushkin, a Russian poet who most people have never heard of, and yet I hadn't read on of the most loved books in the world. So I finally read it, and I realized what I had been missing. This book is exciting. I think alot of kids don't like it because of the way it's written, but really, that's NOT the author's fault! After all, it's written in an old-fasioned way, and that's when he lived. Personally, I think it's pretty cool how he writes.This, along with The Neverending Story, is the best classic I have ever read! I recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I had already tried reading my copy of this book when I was far younger, but I was not as avid a reader as I am these days. Recently, parted from my copy, I picked up an old nondescript hardcover of Treasure Island at the library to complete the book in its entirety.I found the first half of the book highly enjoyable, one that I recalled warmly as I re-read it. But as the book progressed, I was astounded at how difficult the reading was becoming; the pirate slang and their use of strange metaphors obviously grew proportionate to the amount of pirates in the scene. In one of the few moments of humor, the hero Hawkins even says, \\"\`Well,' I said, \`I don't understand one word that you've been saying. But that's neither here nor there[...].'\\" The dialects makes the book that much more realistic; in my mind, however, I wonder if children reading this book fully comprehend it, or were they simply smarter in the 19th century? After spoiling myself with easy modern thrillers, I had to hunker down and really concentrate my efforts in trying to understand the subtext. The rough slang slowed my reading down greatly, but increased my enjoyment. And, of course, having finally completed the book and knowing the true story, my re-read in a few years will be thrice as good!In 1881, while vacationing in Scotland, Stevenson painted an island with his stepson which became the inspiration for the novel. He soon wrote 15 chapters, and completed the rest in Switzerland at the rate of one chapter a day. It was finally published as an entire novel in 1883.Stevenson throws together goods that have become legendary in pirate lore: Pirates with fantastic names, like Captain Flint, Billy Bones, Black Dog, Pew, Israel Hands (based on the real-life member of Blackbeard's crew), and the now-infamous Long John Silver, himself with a parrot on his shoulder; a single treasure map that has three red crosses (designating two piles of treasure, one pile of arms); a beautiful schooner that's put through its paces; a 23 member crew (excluding Jim Hawkins, Doctor Livesey, and Squire Trelawney), most of whom become gentlemen of fortune; mutiny; double-crosses; the shanty \\"15 men on a Dead Man's chest/Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum\\"; the notorious Jolly Roger; spirits, superstition, and lore; and even a skeleton or two.Treasure Island actually refers to the fictitious Skeleton Island---perhaps an inspiration for the children's book The Secret of Skeleton Island (1966)---, a sweltering jungle in the day and eerily submerged in mists in the early mornings. A strange coincidence I found led me to some interesting finds. Stevenson named an anchorage point after the pirate Captain Kidd. In 1935, Harold T. Wilkins published a book entitled \\"New Facts about Mysterious Captain Kidd and his Skeleton Island Chests,\\" in which can be found one of Kidd's treasure maps. Two years after Wilkins's book was published a treasure hunter found an uncanny resemblance between this \\"Skeleton Island\\" and Oak Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. Oak Island's impervious Water Pit is purportedly where Captain Kidd buried part of his treasure before being hanged in 1701 (the Pit is also the main inspiration for the 1998 novel Riptide). In a twist worthy of Robinson himself, despite Kidd's map uncovering some of Oak Island's mysteries, Wilkins eventually stepped forward to admit his maps were fabricated. But was Stevenson alluding to Kidd's connection with Oak Island?Treasure Island is an adventurous classic I heartily recommend anyone to read. I personally advocate reading the book if you're older, or re-reading it, to fully enjoy the environment created through the striking language. A fantastic aid in understanding pirate slang is the online Encyclopaedia Piratica. While you're at it, go to any map engine and plug in the latitude and longitude found at the end of Chapter 6, \\"The Captain's Papers,\\" to see where Billy Bones claimed booty!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island remains, perhaps, the supreme adventure story for boys. It has all the classic ingredients - a brave and reasonably credible hero, pirates, a voyage, treasure, and an uninhabited island. At the same time it is worth reading, even re-reading, by an adult: it treats death and moral depravity realistically, and underneath all the excitement there is a note of sobriety and resignation. What puts it in a class of its own are two elements. One is the chief character, the one-legged pirate John Silver, who is both hugely vivid and psychologically subtle - so that by the end the reader feels he knows him well without fully understanding him, like all the great characters of fiction. The other is the plotting, that is full of brilliant twists that leave the reader gasping (even where they are partly predictable) and produces a series of memorable and well contrasted episodes.This is probably the best of Stevenson's full-length novels. His other two great works, in my estimation, are \`Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' and the \`Fables', which come together in a volume in the old \`Tusitala' pocket edition, which can easily be found secondhand."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is arguably one of the greatest works of storytelling in the English language. Stevenson created other novels, with greater depth and insight, but the highlight of Treasure Island is the combination of color and poetic prose that distinguishes his tale of piracy and boyhood adventure from the rest of the field of other adventure books. The title alone paints an image of suspense, and salty pirates battling over great riches. Most people tend to view Treasure Island as a story for children, but it can be enjoyed by anyone longing for a rollicking adventure. Like so many stories from the 1800s, each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, and once you get used to the language the author's humor shines through."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This book doesn't have to be reviewed. It speaks foritself. I'll just say it's excellent, read it.Frankly I'm stunnedto see what people are saying about this book. I mean, I can understand, sort of, why somebody might possibly consider other excellent books, like &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; or &quot;My Antonia&quot; boring, though I don't. But to find THIS book boring?? What in heck DO people read that's so much more exciting than this? I suppose that if a book has 30 seconds that aren't filled with explosions and poison gas, it's considered dull, huh? Aargh.Well, to each his own, I guess."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I have tried to read Treasure Island numerous times. A couple times when I was younger and once as an adult. Every time I found it to be a bit boring and ended up not finishing it. This time I was determined to make it through it. I made it, and the book was okay but I think compared to modern day adventures the adventure in this book was pretty tame. I read this on my Amazon KindleI think everyone knows the basic story. A young boy and some companions form a company of sailors and take off to find buried treasure on Treasure Island. Ends up part of the company are pirates and mutiny upon landing at the Island. Struggles on Treasure Island commence between the loyal sailors and the pirates.The writing style of this novel has definitely aged with time. It isn't horrible to get through; it's pretty readable and the beginning of the story really grabbed my interest. As time goes on though the story gets bogged down with description and predictability. This isn't a story where characterization or action scenes are a strong point. It is an excellent adventure in the sense that they end up on a tropical island in the middle of nowhere; the struggles they face though are more related to dealing with the pirates than dealing with any trouble the Island throws at them.Maybe this story is just too well known, but for some reason I found it very predictable and this made getting through the lengthy descriptions even tougher. This book does do a wonderful job describing pirates and personifying their characters, but it isn't much fun.I think younger readers will find the story tedious and boring, they may also struggle with the stilted language. Older readers may appreciate the lush descriptions, but will ultimately find the action scenes lacking and the adventure to be not quite as adventurous as in modern day works.Overall an okay novel. Not as exciting and engaging as I had hoped for. Now I can say I read it and move on. I don't know that this is one I will read to my son when he gets older, I think it would bore him. When compared to other classic novels I have read this year, this was my least favorite. I found both \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to be more engaging and interesting."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is the first complete novel that I ever read as a child. Years later when I was traveling around America with my wife and concocting my first book \\"Hobo-ing America\\",Hobo-Ing America: A Workingman's Tour Of The U.S.A.I read this book aloud to my wife before turning out the camper lights every evening.For many years I could only imagine that Robert Louis Stevenson had grown up to be a pirate. How else could he have known the pirates ways so intimately? When I read a biography of Mr. Stevenson and found that he was a sickly child who was often confined to his room for long periods and had thought this whole business up in his vivid imagination, I was more than impressed. I was astounded. As a writer I have always found this fact inspirational.Long John Silver is now folklore like Paul Bunyan and John Henry. And Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the greatest writers ever.Can you believe that the same man who created Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hide also concocted Treasure Island.

Our boys sat through the entire recording in one day!!! That's how much they enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I re-read this recently, after first reading it as a child about twenty years ago. I liked it both times, but enjoyed it more this time. As a child I remember frequently being stalled by the unfamiliar nautical terms, looking them up in the dictionary andfeeling little wiser. Many of them refer to pieces of equipment and, without a picture, the best dictionary in the world isn't going to let you visualise it. But as anyone who's read Patrick O'Brian without being a naval historian knows, all those nautical terms might just as well be made up grobblebems and bindledums, because the story isn't about them. It's about the people, and about treasure, and what people will do to get some, and that's all we need to know about to understand everything that goes on.This time I was more focussed on the colourful characters and swashbuckling adventure. I found I'd almost entirely forgotten the opening chapters, with the inn terrorised by the wonderful horrible old pirate, and the procession of progresively more terrible visitors, but they were one of the highlights on this reading. Long John Silver is by far the most interesting character, narrator Jim Hawkins being something of a colourless \\"good boy\\". And perhaps Jim should be called Lucky Jim, for the chief weakness of the book is the extent to which blind luck saves the day, and the number of times that some inexplicable, irrational act of Jim's turns out to be just what was needed to make everything all right. But all that is more than made up for by the genius of Silver's character, and the unpredictability that he brings to the story.One thing that raises this above a lot of other adventure fiction is that the characters live in a world of economic reality, driven by the need to earn a living and the desire to not have to earn a living any more; whereas so many adventure characters seem to live in a rent-free fantasy world. Possibly this aspect of the book contributes to its greater appeal for me as an adult reader; to a child the pirates were just bad people who did bad things because they were bad, but as an adult who has to earn a living I can better understand why they want that treasure so much."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"\\"Treasure Island,\\" written by the 19th century novelist, Robert Louis Stevenson, is the timeless story about life on the high seas with pirates, treasure, murder, and treachery.When young and naive Jim Hawkins is given a treasure map from the mysterious old pirate, Billy Bones, adventure and trouble are not far behind. Soon Jim finds himself aboard a ship with a villainous crew led by the cunning and mendacious pirate, Long John Silver. Greed and the lust for gold driving the pirates, they have murder in mind when they reach the dubious Treasure Island.Skillfully yet simply written, Robert Louis Stevenson gives us an alluring tale that sparks the imagination. With its dastardly plot and mothly crew of rogues and villains, it entrances the reader, and keeps them wanting more. \\"Treausure Island\\" is the perfect read for anyone just wanting a good, exciting story."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This book is absolutely amazing! The beginning may have been a little dull, but towards the middle I really started to get into it. The story kept me glued to the book. I would get dissapointed when I was told to stop reading. It seemed that every time I had to stop, there was some adventure that had just begun.It starts out with a struggling family who owns an inn. One day, an adventurous seaman, known as the \\"cap'n\\" comes to their inn. Once the pirate dies, the inn owners son, Jim, starts to check out the cap'n's chest that was in his room. Jim discovers a map that leads to Captain Flint's buried treasure. This brings along many adventures, and laughs!Jim and the town doctor and the town squire set out to find this buried treasure. During the trip to Treasure Island, Jim makes the startling discovery that the people working and sailing the ship are planning to overthrow the captain and his men. Once there, Jim, the captain, the doctor and the squire sneak off to the other side of the island. This leads everyone to war as Jim meets a castaway that had been on the island for three years. This man helps Jim and the other men to saftey, while the leader of the pirates, Long John Silver, continues to hunt for the treasure.Jim and the castaway take control of the pirates ship and are soon looking for treasure themselves. Jim, wandering about on his own, falls into the clutches of the enemy. This creates commotion as the castaway and the other men try to free him, but cannot. The pirates are soon out looking for the treasure again with Jim and make it to where the treaure should be. To their surprise, it is gone!The doctor and squire kill the other pirates, except for Silver, and take him and Jim to the castaways cave. The castaway, having been on the island for three years, had found the treasure and carried it all to a hidden cave by the coast. Inside the cave was also meat that the castaway had hunted for. Jim and the others make it to the cave and move the treasure onto the boat.Then they sail away and everyone lives happily ever after (except the pirates)."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"TREASURE ISLAND was first published in 1883 by Cassell & Company, Limited, London, England. Has probably never been out of print since, though first published as a serial in a boy's magazine, it has become a book for almost everyone.Some editions of the book have a map included, others do not. My 1965 edition of Signet Classics does not, but my later Signet edition does. Some readers find the map interesting and helpful, others such as LORD OF THE FLIES author, William Golding, referred to the map, as only an \\"overrated chart\\". When reading introductions or afterwords in the various editions of TREASURE ISLAND one can find almost anything, from praise or lack of praise where Robert Louis Stevenson is concerned. Since I know little of his Scottish background or Calvinism or much of anything else of the man, I find TREASURE ISLAND only a very fine book and am not surprised at all that, though it began its life as somewhat a failure as a magazine serial, it has become a lasting classic.Even should one not have read the book, characters such as Long John Silver, Jim Hawkins, Blind Pew, Black Dog or Billy Bones and various other terms such as pieces of eight, or black spot, are familiar terms in and of themselves. Though some reviewers say the characters are only two dimensional, RLS certainly put enough of them in the book. There are more than enough black hearted pirates to go 'round, and in the character of Long John Silver Stevenson struck pure gold. So much in fact that his original title for TREASURE ISLAND almost was 'The Sea Cook' based on the part ole 'barbecue' (Long John Silver) has aboard the Hispaniola. Yes, Silver is a character well worth his salt, starting out somewhat good, becoming bad, and then morphing back into somewhat good, a character to remain long after the reading. And he escapes the gibbet in the end, not an easy feat in England at that time. Before reading the book I had felt it to be an 'Englishman's' book of England of sorts, yet nothing is farther from the truth, as Robert Louis Stevenson was very much a man of Scotland and the book becomes more of a Scotman's view of the English. Interesting indeed with some subtle truths and asides if one recognizes them.Stevenson started with only the map, one he had drawn for his young stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, yet this map gave birth to the novel. Stevenson's father gave idea to Billy Bone's trunk and its contents, going so far as picking the name Walrus for evil Captain Flint's old ship. From stepson Lloyd we also get the structure and stricture that there be no girls in this book, only male sailors and pirates. Lloyd wanted a boy's book of treasure and pirates. Fortunately girl readers have had as much enjoyment as the boys down through the years.If a reader enjoys a return to their youth of pirate ships, pirates, and an island of treasure to the amount of 700,000, then get on board the Hispaniola and ride with this group to Treasure Island.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Although written primarily for boys, Treasure Island is one of the few books I remember being wildly excited about as a girl. I decided to share it with my 5 year old (who appreciates a pirate adventure) and I am reading a chapter at a time to him at bedtime. Although it is sometimes a little much for a 5 year old (some deaths and pirates with missing body parts) I can read it in a way that interests him. And, it is a great learning experienced due to this \\"enriched classic\\" version. I can tell my son about real pirates (who he now knows were actually \\"bad guys\\") and about the way things were in the mid 1700's.

This book deserves all five stars, it has everything you could ask for such as, suspense, comedy, action, drama and a great plot line. R.L. Stevenson puts a lot of detail into his main characters such as Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins just to name a few. He describes the scenes with such great detail that at times I had to remind myself that it is only a book. I spent more than 2 months reading this book and I enjoyed every part of it. I could RARELY find a paragraph that was dull, the book was very exciting overall. This book is fairly easy to read and I would recommend it to adults and children of all ages. The book moves at a very good pace, not too fast, not too slow. This book is anything but boring, something new happens in every chapter for instance, when Jim witnesses a murder and when he gets into bar fights, those are just some of the many things that happened. I was very surprised myself when I read this book because it seems a little childish but in fact it's quite the contrary.

Every one from the Muppets to Monty Python(Yellow Beard) have drawn upon the characters so richly created by Stevenson. How many truely authentic pirate stories lack a Long John Silver like character with his single leg and a parrot on his shoulder squawking &quot;pieces of eight&quot; or a drunken rendition of &quot;yo ho ho and a bottle of rum&quot;. In fact so many of the striking images associated with tales of piracey on the high seas were created in this book that reading the original almost seems cliche. The mark of a true classic.

However, because of the descriptions, I felt as though I could feel the ocean mist upon my face and felt just as excited when I saw the island come into sight. The words that Stevenson chose were familiar but he used English dialect, so I was puzzled when I came across some of the unusually interesting words for example: noggin, I usually think that that would mean head but he used it to mean a drink. The message in this book is to be careful whom your friends are or who your close companions are because you never know if they are going to stab you in the back (literally).

Though the book had too much description to get to the point, it was a good read. From good guys, to bad guys, sailors, to mutineers, friends to enemies, Treasure Island has it all. The authors' word choice for this book is incredibly sophisticated and makes the book a little more descriptive, ( though I was not always sure what the words meant). Using \\"ship slang\\" and having the characters say just what they need to say at the right time.

Well,if you do,then read Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh.In this book a widowed mouse has to move her and her four children and heal her sick son Timothy,who has pneumonia.This book was geared towards young teenagers.The words are a little difficult for someone younger to comprehend. But otherwise easy to understand.There are no words such as, supercalifragilistic expealidocious,or something absurd like that.Once you read this book it will reel you in with, the mysteries of Nimh, the rats, and how an old man just kicks the bucket in the middle of nowhere.This story also has some sad parts in it.Parts like, the death of Mr. Frisby, Timothy's sickness, the capture of Mrs. Frisby, and the hardware store incident. Many things happen that lead to good or bad things. Dragon is a bad thing (or cat) and the rats are good little rodents.I believe this book is an easy and quick read. It is a drama with a little sci-fi thrown in the mix. You're guaranteed to like this book from start to finish(sorry, no money back guarantee. What can I say, things are'nt ten cents anymore.)The plot and storyline are very creative and sure to get those gears turning.Readers who like rodents, brats, cats, and more are sure to love Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I remember attempting Treasure Island as a young boy and thinking it boring. Clearly I was an undisciplined lout and did not give Stevenson's writing style a chance to take hold. Plow through the first 30 pages and you'll be hooked.This is an exciting adventure story for all-ages (there is a bit of violence but I suspect your boy will not be permanently scarred). Stevenson does an excellent job of catching the reader's imagination and first pulling then propelling him through the many adventures of young Jim Hawkins. It is a quick read and I assure you that you will not miss the evening or two of television viewing sacrificed."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I first read this book nearly twenty years ago (when I was eight, translated in Bengali), and I didn't realise when I had started to see the world more through the eyes of Jim Hawkins than my own, so much so that I never wanted to come out of my day-dreams of adventure.

The names of the characters brought out the story, such as Long John Silver, he had a wooden leg and he was very tall. The author also made me very impatient, because at the beginning I knew that this was going to be a story about a treasure hunt, but I had to read a lot to get to that point. The setting was very evenly set out, like the author talked about the captain in the day, and Long John the mean person in the night. The author made the book exiting by not making the characters sail to the island, then find the treasure, and come home. He made it interesting, while they were sailing, and when the reached the island. The best part of the story I liked was when Jim a young boy, is of to take a tour of the island by himself when he hears shuffling in the bushes, this happens until Jim looks behind the bushes to find his old friend who has been stranded on the island for many years. Situations like that is what made the book Treasure Island a very exiting, adventurous, and enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I really thought it was a good book, and beeing in the 8th grade i think the classes in the future should do a unit on it or maybe just Robert Louis Stevenson.

Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well.

Wilson.One of the most enduring and popular releases from the Heritage Press, this one went through several reprints - reprints that apparently resulted in design changes to the slipcase. This review is based on the 1941 edition in the 1969 release.A solid and surprisingly hefty book, printed on creamy eggshell stock with ample margins. The design is meant to evoke books of the late 18th century with the quarter-cloth faux Morocco binding with maroon and gold details. Amply illustrated with pictorial boards depicting a map of the island and another color map on the front and back pastedowns. Wilson creates well over 50 drawings for this edition, all of them in full color or pen and ink with a single color wash: full page portraits of key characters, full page headings for each Part of the book, and many smaller incidental illustrations.273 pages, in a sand-colored matte slipcase, with the introduction by the author."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I knew my 2 kids had not read this book.

Few adventure stories have had such a wide-ranging impact on storytelling and popular culture.

This book is amazing. Its also amazing what happens to the kid, Jim Hawkins, in this book. He even says so to Long John Silver when hes cornered. Quite the experience; quite the capable lad.Fast paced, believable, action packed.Jim, the son of an inn keeper, meets up with a pirate. And that pirate finally gets tracked down by others of his kind, which means Jim gets mixed up in their business and lands himself a treasure map. He shares the info with a doctor and the local squire and they set sail unknowingly with the previous pirates old crew. There is trickery and mutiny afoot. These are no gentlemen pirates, especially peg-legged Long John Silver. This is where you get the pirate lingo that has been used by our everyday public. Its great to go back to the beginnings of \\"shiver me timbers\\" and \\"sixteen men on a dead mans chest, yo ho ho and a bottle of rum\\".When they get to \\"Treasure Island\\" all their plans, and the pirates go awry.

Stevenson's use of dialogue is what really sets this book apart; you can tell from their dialect exactly what type of person each of the characters is and which group they fit into.The most interesting character isn't the narrator, but Long John Silver, the evil pirate. Silver is eminently adaptable and manages to charm everyone he comes into contact with by telling them what they want to hear; he reminds me of many of today's politicians.Overall, this is definately worth the read."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"If studious youth no longer crave the naivety &amp; adventure that Jim Hawkins, &amp;c. did, they do themselves a disservice.The fact that this book has accreted 45 reviews is testament to influence. What then remains to discuss are its merits.Accessible enough for young people (I first read it when I was eight), even for the refined reader it will evoke that arresting singability that the great adventures from the Odyssey to Beowulf to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea all can &amp; do.It is not high art. Stevenson wrote popular fiction. In order for such higher art to exist it must have a healthy popular fundament to support it, to paraphrase Pound. Treasure Island is such art--fit for the scops, &amp; the ears of the restless.The best support for Treasure Island may be the epigraph penned by its author, which serves as an elegant &amp; frank testimony to Stevenson's feelings about the importance of the folk tradition:&quot;IF sailor tales and sailor tunes, / Storm and adventure, heat and cold, / If schooners, islands, and maroons, / And Bucaneers and buried Gold, / And all the old romance, retold / Exactly the ancient way, / Can please, as me they pleased of old, / The wiser youngsters of today:&quot;SO be it, and fall on! If not, / If studious youth no longer crave, / His ancient appetites forgot, / Kingston, or Ballantyne the brave, / Or Cooper of the wood and wave: / So be it also!

I like this edition because it has a series of post scripts."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure IslandBy Owen MoynihanThe book Treasure Island is a very good book. It is written by Robert Louis Stevenson. The book is about a boy, named Jim, whose family owns an inn for sea travelers. One day a strange sea captain comes and takes a room. Eventually the captain's old crew comes for the treasure map he has. The captain never paid full price for the room he stayed in, so Jim takes the treasure map and calls it even. Then the doctor, the Squire, and Jim decide to find Treasure Island, where the treasure is hidden. They buy a ship and hire a crew. The voyage starts out well enough, then things take a turn for the worse when Jim falls in an apple barrel and hears the crew and the cook, Long John Silver, talking about mutiny, once they found the treasure. Jim tells the Captain and your going to need to read the book to find out the rest!The book was very exciting to read because every time one problem is solved, it wasn't long until a new one comes and the problems get more exciting each time. You almost never could guess what would happen to the characters next and you would need to be very lucky to guess it. You could feel like you were in the book because the author was very good at giving just enough detail to everything, so you could easily picture it. All the characters were incredibly realistic; you could see these people, or people similar, probably walking around during the time of this book. The only time I didn't feel in the book was when the characters talked, because the author wrote it to sound like how people talked back then. That was confusing. The main conflict was very interesting because it just kept changing and each time got more exciting. You would never be able to predict it. The characters were very realistic. The author gave very good detail about the characters and their personalities, so you got to know all the important characters very well. The book's ending was very satisfying and quite funny. It wrapped up everything very nicely and made you laugh quite a bit. I was very pleased the author didn't screw up the ending like other books I've read.The author's voice is first person through the main character, Jim. In a few chapters he switches over to the first person doctor but he tells you so you are not shocked or confused. The author uses the same vocabulary they would during the time the book is set. It is confusing to understand a good portion of the time but he explains some of it and that helps. The author really did capture the way people spoke and used it very well in the book but it was hard to follow. The author was very good at describing and giving good detail to the things important to the story and not too much on minor things. The author uses very good dialogue to advance the plot and let you learn about the characters. Some conversations were a bit hard to understand but it was still a good book. The author gave detailed descriptions of characters and the setting. He never did too much or to little to anything in the book, it was just right. The author's writing is unique because of the reasons above and he made a great story about a boy following his dreams and succeeding against all odds.Compared to other books I would give this book a eight and a half out of ten, only because the conversations were hard to follow and annoying to understand.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books and to anyone who likes book about buried treasure, the high seas, and pirates. Hope you enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. I found this book to be not so enjoyable. It begins with slow, hard to follow beginning, and continues with a somewhat sped up middle with many confusing twists and new people. The end I also found to be boring. This just seemed like a short story streched out on many pages lots of new places, characters, or things in between.The parts of this book that I could follow along with were few and even still not inturesting. It took effort to read and keep everything in your head. I had to read over many things twice.If you are an advanced reader, who can keep up with many things I might suggest this to you. If you are inturested in a fantasy like story with pirates, you also may enjoy this. However if you are an average person who just enjoys casually reading or you like to have a book that leaves you on the edge, I would have to say you would not want to read this."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Bought it because my daughter is reading it in school, and wanted it with the audio link so we could listen in the car.

Author Robert Louis Stevenson draws readers in early as the Captain arrives at the Benbow Inn in Britain, focused on incoming ships, and warning young Jim Hawkins of one-legged visitors. The story picks up as Billy Bones arrives, bringing danger and discovery of the treasure map, a discovery that leads Jim and his companions to risk the long trip in search of riches. I felt the suspense as Jim's group boards ship with a hardened sea crew that includes Long John Silver and other tough cookies. Then the ship finally arrives at the Island, where Jim and his companions must survive treachery and deadly struggles at the fort - before they even see the treasure.I just taught this abridged version to English-literate students at a high school in Latin America; most liked it although some wanted even more action.

As soon as we finished, he wanted to re read it; and we will. In the morning and during the day, he spontaneously talked about the characters and the action and asked questions that he had clearly been giving a lot of thought to. We stopped during every page, sometimes on each paragraph, to talk about words and concepts that were new for him. It was a powerful experience for him in just how great reading can be. It was a great read for me, too. Stevenson is writer with a gift for economy of description who at the same time creates clear pictures and moves his story with striking action scenes. This book is far more gripping than most being produced today to entertain or train children, maybe because it's not a \\"children's story\\"; the author never condescends. I don't see why anyone would bother with any of the abridged or retold versions, if you do, you are cheating yourself and your child. The origianl is not hard to read or understand and it's fun and exciting. For most readers today I think this book will also reconnect to or open up a world that goes far beyond the action of a great story. I recommend this version because I love the Wyeth illustrations; his dedication to creating them just shows the way this book reaches into the hearts of the young and old. We're buying \\"Kidnapped\\" next.Warning, for some children it might be disturbing that Jim's father dies. Also, Jim's mother's portrait is limited and unflattering (though Long John's wife is portrayed as loyal and independent and competent). However, these are not flaws in the novel, but depictions of the world that Jim lived in and part of the underlying, understated, power of the book, which is of a piece with its times. If it were not, why read it?And they never say \\"Aaarrhh...\\""},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"In an effort to add a few classics to our reading list, one of the members of my book club chose TREASURE ISLAND for us to read. Coincidently, I had recently visited a cottage, turned museum near Saranack Lake in New York, where Robert Louis Stevenson spent some time right before he wrote TREASURE ISLAND. It was a timely read for me!I thought that I knew this story, but the years had passed and my memory was not as vivid as I had thought. The story was as fresh to me as a new novel. This is the adventure of young Jim Hawkins who was lucky or unlucky enough to have found himself in possession of a map to Treasure Island. Jim is filled with curiosity and adventure as he sails forth on the ship, the Hispaniola. Jim's friends who are sponsoring the voyage are Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey. Notable crewmembers are Captain Smollett, a no nonsense and very capable seaman. and Long John Silver, a charming, but very cunning man who was hired as the ship's cook. Silver's companion is a parrot that he calls Cap'n Flint.The excitement and danger of pirates, the lust for buried treasure and a mutiny aboard ship makes for an exciting book. TREASURE ISLAND continues to be a great story for any child or adult who savors adventure."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island by Robert Louis StevensonThis is a sea-fairing tale of a boy named Jim finding himself entangled on a considerably large pirate adventure. In the beginning of this sea story Jim and his parents ran an inn named the \\"Admiral Benbow\\" a shady character that ends up being a pirate walks in and that is how it all started. He soon finds himself part of a crew in the Hispaniola, Captain Smollett runs the crew along with a Mr. Trelawny, and the mysterious one-legged chief Long John Silver. Silver and his crew betray the captain with mutiny, and take over the ship, forcing the doctor, Jim, Mr. Telwany, Mr. Grey, the captain and some loyal sailors to ship out in the smaller boat, the Jolly Boat. Being chased by the Hispaniola, the Jolly Boat quickly takes ashore on Treasure Island. This is the last place where a great battle between good and evil takes place just for reckless greed. This book, in my opinion deserves a 5 out of 5 because it has great plot twists devious and memorable characters."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Great book! I recently reread this, about 25 years after I first did as a 10 year old, and, again, enjoyed it immensely!It is a real rip-roaring page turner that I found hard to put down as there is very little let up in the action. It isn't a cheesy fairytale either, with several truly awful people portrayed in it, quite a few of whom die some nasty deaths.It is a riveting read for any body with an active imagination, full of salty sea dogs, piratical sayings, nautical manoeuvering, sword play and double crosses. It's time it was remade as a movie!I recommend this book wholeheartedly to young and old readers!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This book was a good book, but I would only recommend it to middle-schoolers because the plot and sentence structure is complicated. The words Robert Louis Stevenson used in this book were old English and hard to understand. In the book, he used a lot of sailing terms like yard, riggings, hull, bow, etc. He wrote using a lot of description. A picture of whatever he was talking about popped up in your mind. Some significant events in this book were gunfights, fist fights, and mystery. The climax in the book comes relatively early and if you like a lot of action, you should read this book.I gave this book five stars because I like action early in a book. All of the action starts in the middle of the book unlike some others where the action waits for the last pages. In Treasure Island when there is no action the story turns to a mystery. The mystery part in this book is mostly trying to find out why people kill other people. The main character, Hawkins, is a young boy that is seeking adventure and fortune. He is very brave and towards the end grows up into an adult. All in all I recommend this book to anyone who can get their hands on it."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Wow. It may be days until my mind allows me passage back for this memorable island. A part of me may always be marooned there. The words, sentences, paragraphs and chapters of this book were indeed the true treasure.Jim Hawkins was the perfect narrator for this story as I doubt any other character would have ignited my imagination as much as a boy. His naivety earned my heart and he held onto it with his bravery. His tempo was invigorating and captivating. Combined with the simplicity of his age, his account was easily read and brought me many quick hours of turning pages.He also was given an interesting supporting cast, including a \\"Gentleman of Fortune\\" I would dare never forget ~ the infamous Long John Silver.

I found it to be very likable and entertaining even with some of the &#34;Pirate&#34; lingo being hard to understand at times"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The Kindle edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic work, Treasure Island, was a book I was familiar with from school days and now have had the chance to reread and appreciate for its exceptional adventure storytelling. This has proven two things to me, the first being that a great classic work never becomes outmoded no matter how many years may pass, and the second is that to really appreciate a book it ought best to be read more than once, and probably more than twice ... especially if that book is a good book.Treasure Island, as many who read this know, tells the story of Jim Hawkins, who leaves his hamlet in England and goes to sea after a mysterious and violent series of events leaves him in possession of a sea captains chest, among the contents of which is a treasure map for locating buried loot on a remote island. The start of the event triggers off a series of twists and turns that lead to a tale of high adventure and of a boy's coming of age that has been imitated by many but in my opinion, rarely handled with as much verve and creative power as Stevenson's original classic.One of the discoveries, or re-discoveries I made on reading Treasure Island, was that this is more than a mere adventure tale, but a story that deals with a number of issues of central importance to the human condition that are part and parcel of its overall theme. I think one of the main issues that Stevenson is commenting on is the nature of human greed, and the difference between those who are overcome by it and those who aren't. The pirates are depicted as often behaving a lot more like animals than like human beings, by contrast with the captain and crew of the British ship of the line. Another is the value of working together toward a common good versus being motivated by lust for gold or glory, as is also reflected in the difference between the ships' crews.There are more messages, but don't make the mistake of thinking that Treasure Island is a message book. It wasn't back in school, and it isn't now. What it is first and foremost is a top-notch adventure thriller, and for my money as entertaining a tale as any Pirates of the Caribbean adventure which, come to think of it, might profit from a little of the subtext that Stevenson put into his own immortal work."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I have to confess...I never read this as a child and I'm shocked that I didn't.I did read Pirate Brig which is why I probably sail today...smile...This came up on my phone for free so I decided to kill some time to read it; absolutey captured me and took me hostage even though I had a pretty good idea what the end was going to be after so many \\"versions\\" of the plot in cartoons etc over the years.Still a great book to read and a must read for every boy."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Unlike the BBC production which takes liberties with the original story and a Jim Hawkins who sounds about 25 years old, this production by Colonial Radio is faithful to the story. The music is as usual fantastic, and reminds you of those great swashbuckling adventures from the 40's. The actor playing Jim has great energy and I totally believed I was there with him on this perilous voyage. Long John Silver is great, and the on again / off again friendship, or \\"trust\\" ship with Jim is spot on. The supporting cast is also excellent, and I think this is a magnificent audio production of a great classic."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Bought this for a long cross country trip for my husband and I to break up the driving. It was very entertaining and the fact that it used a whole radio troupe and orchestra added to the interest. It is probably geared to a more youthful adience but we had both enjoyed the book when we were young and enjoyed the cd. It wasn't as long as some audio tapes but still worth the money."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"What can you say... This book is a classic for a reason!

It is every bit as good a tale on rereading as it was at first. It has a glossy hard cover, good print and appears to be, perhaps, one from a series of \\"classics\\" for young readers. If you like stories of pirates of old and buried treasure, you will enjoy this at any age. However!A caveat for youger readers. Victorian prose usually has a lengthy development and is often excessively wordy for modern readers. If you're looking for \\"fast\\", you won't find it here, but it is still a good tale and has, I believe, been made into a movie a couple of times, so if you're not into leisurely reading, go for the movie.

The first chapters took me back to comfortable surroundings at the Admiral Bendbow Inn as the pirate Billy Bones first came into the world of young Jim Hawkin's. You will quickly swept up into the land of Black Spots, pirate songs and the blind pirate Old Pew who still scares me.There may be superior abridged versions for younger readers, but I felt this kindle edition is fine and it makes the classic story easy to access."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I hadn't read Treasure Island in many years, but when I saw that it was available for my new Kindle I downloaded it. A good move for me, as I had forgotten how great it is. Although I was a teenager when I first read it, I think I enjoy it even more now that I am over 60.

Yes, the language used takes some getting used to, and it is certainly quite different from what most youngsters are reading these days in terms of the language style and form, but the themes in this literary classic are still relevant today and those who are not put off by the style will appreciate this work. It's disheartening to see many of these literary classics ignored in favor of generic stories which seem to captivate younger readers these days, but I hope making these works available as free downloads will entice more readers to give these classics a chance."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Great read.

Yo ho ho!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I picked this one up for the kids and ended up just reading it to myself one day because I had missed it in my youth. It really is a great story and is well told."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Often considered a children's book, Treasure Island, like all great children's books, can be readily enjoyed by all. Though very different from current children's works, it certainly has much that young readers are likely to enjoy - rollicking adventure, an astonishingly quick pace, great suspense, colorful characters, an engaging young narrator, etc. However, it has at least as many elements that anyone can appreciate, such as deft plotting; few works draw us in so immediately or are as well put together, and the action never lets up. It is very hard to put the book down even after more than a century; modern thrillers certainly have nothing on it. For pure adventure and excitement, it is nearly impossible to top. The plain, straightforward prose is still lucid, and Treasure has the great virtue of being easy for anyone to read. Perhaps what really makes the book, though, are its characters. The notorious Long John Silver is the most famous, a splendid and unforgettable creation; he is one of the most lively and simply fascinating characters ever. Many others are also memorable, not least Jim Hawkins, one of literature's most notable young protagonists and narrators.Treasure belies its children's story origins in several ways, such as strong binary oppositions between heroes and villains in regard to alcohol, religion, thriftiness, etc. However, it has many serious, even thought-provoking themes; for example, it is in large part a very fine bildungsroman, which young readers will certainly appreciate. That said, reading it shows just how much children's stories have changed; such a work would never be considered, much less marketed as, a children's story now. This is most obviously due to surprisingly graphic violence and a strong glimpse or real evil; more fundamentally, it has much to do with moral murk. The good/evil distinction is far less clear than it first seems. For instance, Silver is very hard to pin down; no character can dislike him fully, and much the same can be said of readers. This may go a long way toward explaining the seemingly mysterious fact that he is by far the best-known character, is often depicted at worst as ambivalent, and has had his name used for such things as a fast food chain. He somewhat recalls Shakespeare's Richard III in that we are - somewhat perversely - drawn to him because of his evil, but the issue is very complex and subtle. None can deny that he has several conventional virtues, including bravery, determination, and resourcefulness. Conversely, the heroes' actions also give us much to think about, as does Treasure itself; to begin with, it deals with several important morality questions like justice, law, mercy, etc. All this will more than satisfy those expecting something more than adventure, though the book certainly has plenty of that.Treasure is one of the few books that everyone should truly read. It has become a true cultural institution, still immensely popular and constantly adapted. If nothing else, one should at this point read it just to see its immense effect on the popular consciousness, especially the view of pirates and everything associated with them, which the book virtually invented. There are few books I would recommend unhesitatingly to readers of all ages; this is one, and I recommend it very strongly indeed."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I was not expecting much when I started to read this book. I have a mostly unfounded fascination for contemporary cultural images of piracy, and I wanted to get this under my belt to earn a little street cred. Turns out, it's amazing. It took me a couple of chapters to pick up the rhythm and vocabulary of Stevenson's style, but once I was able to focus on the story itself, I didn't want it to end. Stevenson does a brilliant job of portraying pirates for the criminals that they were, mostly by viewing them through the eyes of an innocent young boy, who overhears a dark conversation while hiding in an apple barrel and also spends a tense scene trying to escape his home with his mother before the bad guys materialize out of the misty night to kill them both for treasure.

The book was published in 1883. The main character,Jim, suffers losses at an early age. This influences him to go on a ship to find Captain Flint's treasure. There are several people on this ship, some that Jim can trust can some that he really shouldn't. Some of these people use others just to get what they want. I did not like the book at all. It could not keep my attention. I found the book quite boring. The wording is confusing and I had somewhat of a hard time reading the story and fully understanding it. It took me a while to finish the book because I just could not read it. Personally it has way too much violence for me. But, it does teach good life lessons such as,be careful who you trust,some people will do anything for money,and many more. All of the problems helped the main character learn these lessons. I would not suggest this book to young children or people who don't like violence and pirates."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Back in the days when young men and women read adventure tales there was none better in the adolescent genre that the imimitable Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-94). Stevenson was a Scottish Presbyterian who was trained in law but forsook it for the sake of fiction. Among his classics are \\"The Black Arrow\\"; \\"Kidnapped\\" and his great novella\\"Dr Jekyll and Mister Hyde.\\" Stevenson was a sufferer of TB and died at the too young age of 44.Treasure Island was published in 1883. It began as a story Stevenson narrated to his wife's son Lloyd Osborne.It tells the thrilling tale of buried treasure on Treasure Island. The island is fictional but Stevenson seems to have located it near the California coast. He lived in California for a time. Jim Hawkins is the teenage narrator. When the old seadog Billy Bones comes to the Admiral Benbow Inn he carries with him a map of Treasure Island. Bones had been a sailor on a sea expedition led by the pirate Captain Flnt; he had just received a black spot sign of death from the blind sailor Pew.Hawkins joins forces with Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey and later Captain Smollett aboard the Hispanolia in search of the buried treasure. On the ship there are 19 mutineers led by the one legged Long John Silver and his famous parrot Captain Flint. After a series of adventures and much violence the treasure of 700,000 pounds is discovered and Hawkins returns home a rich young lad.Stevenson is good in melodramatic action and in characterization influenced by his mentor Sir Walter Scott. Clearly drawn characters such as Silver, Ben Gunn, and the evil Israel Hands are colorfully drawn. The author is adept at word painting excelling in lush descriptive passages of the sea journey and Treasure Island. He has borrowed the parrot from Defoe's \\"Robinson Crusoe. Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\" featuring young Jim Hawkins is not a deep work but is purely and simply an adventure tale to be read and reread as long as the art of writing and the practice of reading are part of civilized life."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"It my opinion that RLS excels in the short story/novella genres, and is somewhat lacking in momentum in longer stories and novels."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Our school was trying to match an existing set of Treasure Island books.These books were exactly what we wanted, and following our order, we received them very quickly."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Perfect condition; great price.

This book delves into the lives of farm animals as they try to create their own perfect society away from the entrapments of man. This book begins with the pigs taking charge, of the pigs two strong leaders emerge Napoleon, and Snowball, and each of them feels they are the best. Eventually, Napoleon chases Snowball off using viscious dogs that he raised from pups so he has the majority of the power. The irony in this book is awesome it comes rushing at you like a flash flood. This book is targeted for young adult readers, and it is a quick read.Anyone would like this book from the fifth grade on up. Allthough it is more suited for raders ages 13-24 due to the subject matter. Animal Farm is based on animals turning a society that was democratic into a communist one. The society that was intended to make life easier actually made it a more miserable existance for all. &quot;All animals that year worked like slaves.&quot;Animal Farm deeply dives into the ideals of a society without flaw, and then slowly turns into communism, and a dictatorship. The writer reveals the irony of the perfect society turning communist brilliantly. The ideals of the animals change drastically in this book, and it is perfectly boud together so that it will really make you think.This book was very well written. It presents a great deal of politics, and the idea of an Utopian Society. Animal Farm slowly reaveals all the animals ideals turning into the very thing they despised on the first place.Young adults will thouroughly enjoy Animal Farm. It shows that there is no such thing as a perfect society , and there is no point looking for one. All in all thi is one deep book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"New folk's coming to rabbit hill and all are excited because these folk's may be \\"plantin' folk's.\\" In this book there are many animal charecters, some of the main charecters are lil'georgie, a rambunctious rabbit with loads of energy.

These books are often found on those hated list (hated by any kid out there) of \\"have to read\\" in any school in the world. One of those books definitely is Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. When you look at the book and its contents wihout joy and with sensations of punishment if you fail to accomplish the task that has been given to you, no book can prove any kind of enjoyment, or artistic eye-opening, whatever you like the best.But, every now and then, when you are older, and you try to remember those dear times that are long gone, and you try to evoke them by any means avaliable, sickness that is peculliar to humankind, sickness that we often call nostalgia, you stumble upon some hidden jewel, and suddenly, that that has been covered in dust for many years, starst to shine with a brilliant light and you cannot avert your eyes.There is great ammount of all kind of adventure books out there today, many of those will never be read, reasons being what they are, and there are books, like this one that will often remain in our memory as brilliant example of something that existed in some other time.Story of Jim Hawkins, pirate Long John Silver and their treasure hunt, story that would be called shallow and naive in these days, is wonderfull adventure novel, with charaters so charming in their naivette, with their archaic english, with sea-faring that evokes waves of never-felt nostalgia, with corsairs, pirates, ruthless crimes, chivalry, cunning and many of those long forgotten atributes of world and novels that are being rewritten (or deconstructed) nowadays.In search for your own treasure, whether the one of your spirit, culture, or what-you-like, you should stare back for a moment and remind yourself of the times when you were kid, and when the world was much simpler than it is today."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This book is at turns dreadfully dull and blood-poundingly enthralling. Be prepared to plow through the mire of overly detailed passages relating tactical events to get to the great character-building climaxes. The people in this story were to me so much more interesting than the plot.It may be my own deficiency that I wasn't able to enjoy the action in this adventure story, but it seemed to drag on and on, and many times I had to force myself to re-read paragraphs to understand the development of a situation. When it comes to the characters in the book, however, I am transported to a movie set in my mind. I appreciate the impact this book has had on swashbuckling tales and our perception of pirate culture. For that we are indebted to Stevenson's imagination. I'd just rather see the film."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is one of the best adventure stories of all time. I really enjoyed all of the characters in this book, although I think a few too many of the good people died. The story starts off a little slow but it speeds up very quickly. I really liked all of the battles they had on the island. I also enjoyed Jim Hawkins sea adventure. Long John Silver is one of the greatest pirates, if not the greatest, of all time.

I have grandchildren and I enjoy reading to them. However as they grow older -5 and 6- their patience is less, but their curiosity, knowledge and imagination still thirst. These types of stories and their presentation quenches this. My grandsons will sit, listen and join in the reading. The book itself is 220 pages long. It is abbreviated and has a black and white picture on alternate pages inviting comment and reading. The presentation of the story and its plot invites understanding and enjoyment quickly. Each chapter is short and builds up the characters and action very well-sometimes I may read 2 or 3 chapters because they don't want to stop If you enjoy reading to your kids and want to introduce them (and yourself ?) to a classic go for this book.

This story was told hundreds of years ago and changed over time. The author was Robert Louis Stevenson. This book had 232 pages of jam-packed action. This story was suppost to take place in the Pirate times. There were lots of characters thruought this stors,y, but the two most important ones were Jim Hawkins, the leader of the pack, and Long John Silver, a kind of two faced person. This book was about Jim Hawkins and his friends going to sail to Treasure Island, hoping to find the burried loot of Captain Flint, the toughest of all the pirates. But they didn't know that the crew of their own ship is made up of Flint's old crew, led by the evil, one-legged pirate Long John Silver.

I think that those people are not use to the dialog in which the author writes in. I admit at that I did find it difficult at the beginning but I got use to it. This story is fill with adventure and suspense from beginning to end. From the time Billy Bone enters the inn to the time the hunt for the treasure was in. My favorite part is when young Jim over hears Long John silver planning the mutiny. I'm quite fascinated by the character of Long John silver.

On my best books list this is definitely in the top 5. The adventure and suspense just makes you want to read more. You're missing out if you don't read this book.

I have only seen Treasure Island movies in the past, and on reading the book I found the story different from what I've known. I am going to tell you a little about the book, I don't want to spoil the story so I won't tell you the entire thing.The story first tells of how young Jim Hawkins got Captain Flint's Treasure map from Captain Billy Bones. Jim found the map in Billy Bones' sea chest when Jim and his mother were looking through the chest for the money that Bones owed them. Because you see Bones had died during his attempt to escape the evil pirates who were after him. So Jim and his mother had to hurriedly look for the money, and while his mother was trying to count out the right amount of money Jim took Captain Flint's map.After the pirates attacked the \\"Admiral Benbow\\" that was the name of the inn that the Hawkins family owned, Jim goes and gets help from Dr.Livesey and Squire Trelawney and together they board a ship called the Hispaniola and set a course for Treasure Island.On board Jim becomes friends with the ship's cook Long John Silver (who owns a parrot named Cap'n Flint after the infamous pirate captain), but little does Jim know that Silver is actually a pirate and an ex-member of Captain Flint's crew. Jim soon learns of a sinister plot being made by Silver to steal the treasure that might endanger him and his friends.I won't say anymore. If you're the type that enjoys stories of pirates, treasure, and a parrot that says \\"pieces of eight, pieces of eight\\" you'll have to read the book. You can also read other Robert Louis Stevenson books like Kidnapped which I haven't read but it's supposed to be good, but the book you'll enjoy most is Treasure Island."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The book Treasure Island was a great read and shall be ever pressed into my memories of adventure.

Fortunately, they escape from the band of thieves and set out traps on the island. After they discover the treasure, Jim and his friends secretly strike a bargain with Silver. The bargain allows them to sail home where Long John can have a fair trial instead of being immediately hung in the gallows. This is a fantastic read for pirate lovers and adventure seekers.

This is a good book but the vocabulary was diffiult to understand because of the time it was written. I recommend this book to people who like adventure stories.

This action packed story takes place hundreds of years ago and the setting goes from a dangerous home, to the sea, and finally to an island. In the story Jim Hawkins finds a treasure map and he says in the book that he will try to get the treasure. The main characters are Jim Hawkins, the young lad pursuing treasure, Long John Silver, the experienced sailor who is the cook, and one of the bad guys blind Pew. This is a book that kids would like but is probably recommended for older people due to its reading difficulty. The sailors and Jim Hawkins try to find an island with buried treasure but first they must overcome many treacherous obstacles. The reason this book blows away the competition is because you will always wonder what will happen on the open seas were rules hardly apply. I cannot be sure of the way sailors used to talk but from what I know the author rights it exactly as it would have been said. The reviewers say, \\"masterfully crafted\\" which is only one of many phrases that can portray the excellence of the book. You have to read this slowly, page by page because it has a lot of information on each page and if you read it to quickly you won't understand what just happened. This is not a book you can read right before bed because it's hard to put it down and you might end up reading all night. This book is like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter because people are out to kill you and this book shows many scenes were the characters make narrow escapes, but sometimes they don't. When you read this book you wonder is like a mix of fiction, non- fiction, and science fiction because the adventures are so detailed you might think you are there but it has many surprising scenes that you wonder if that could happen. Although the author has a slow pace it shows every last repetitive thing you have to do at sea. The author also is good at making it feel real, like you are really there. In away this book is like Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate where at the very beginning the characters are pretty happy but then someone comes and ruins it then that person keeps going at the people for the money that is rightfully theirs. Basically what I have been saying about Treasure Island is that you should read it.-Kyle Watson"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Well done Kindle conversion, good active table of contents, well-spaced paragraphs are easy to read.

I think it's a great book. Some people say it is not very good because of the &quot;ancient&quot; way it is written. Just goes to show how dumb modern man is. Buy it and maybe get a better vocabulary."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The story of Treasure Island takes place during the glorious 18th century, when seamen still sailed the oceans in search of wealth and fame. The most feared enemies were the sea pirates. Young Jim Hawkins discovers a treasure map in the sea-chest of the murdered pirate, Billy Bones. Jim joins Doctor Livesey and Squire Trelawney to form a partnership to search for buried pirate treasure. The presiding genius of their crew is the one-legged pirate turned sea cook, Long John Silver. Long John is cunning and bloodthirsty, without a shred of conscience. But his buoyant humour and vitality are irresistible. Their sea voyage turns out to become quite perilous when the first rumours of mutiny are being whispered on board of the Hispaniola.The point about classics such as Treasure Island is that you cannot doubt the relevance of such a book, since it is still popular more than 120 years after it was first published (1883). Hundreds of books following Treasure Island have used the image of the pirate Long John Silver and made it a universal type. Ask anyone to picture a pirate and in nine out of ten cases you will get something closely resembling Long John.The strongest quality of Treasure Island is that it is still surprisingly fresh. It has a pace that can stand comparison with any contemporary novel. Stevenson did not add a lot of moralising to the story, which is quite remarkable for a coming of age story dated from that period. The character of Long John suffers clearly from a certain machiavellian duality, a topic that will return more prominently in Stevenson's later work: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Giving Treasure Island five stars is like declaring Helen of Troy homecoming queen. It's too little,too late. This is the classic tale of pirates. Its' themes have been worked and worked again,but it remains untouched. Stevenson is a master storyteller at the top of his form. From beginning to end the plot never lags,and the characters possess a richness and depth rare in an adventure story. Every reader of English ought to make their acquaintance--Jim Hawkins,Billy Bones,Old Pew,Silver,and the rest--at some time in his life,preferably when he is young,and his heart still believes it can find that treasure. Treasure Island has been francised,moppetized,filmed,and abridged,but never bettered. Accept no substitues! Read the entire book. There is plenty here for children and adults. Like all great literature,it works on more than one level. Dominating the whole Story is the figure of Long John Silver. As his name implies he has a lunar quality. He is attractive,facinating,powerful,but with a dark side. Again,he is murdering,lying,and infinitly self-seeking,yet like Jim we cannot help liking him and wanting him to like us. At this level Treasure Island is a study in criminality that asks: Why is it that the best,the most full of natural power, often turn their gifts to evil? And why do we find evil so attractive? A word about editions. There are many,but by far the best is the hardcover featuring the illustrations of N.C. Wyeth. No one has succeeded as he has in capturing the spirit of the tale. If you are looking for a cheaper paperback edition that won't blind you with cramped layout, or ruin the whole experience with goofy illustratons,choose the Puffin Classic. It's unabridged,sturdy,and features a beautiful cover illustration."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Please note: This title is heavily abridged and aimed at children but, the Amazon title doesn't tell you this. From the inside cover of the book:\\"This Great classic for Children by Dalmation press has been carefully condensed and adapted from the original version ... We kept the well-known phrases for you. We kept the author's style. And we kept the important imagery and heart of the tale.\\"With its large font and many illustrations the book comes out to 181 pages; whereas, the Sterling Classic unabridged with its regular sized font and no illustrations comes out to 232 pages. This gives an indication of how condensed this version is.This one has its place as a kids version and should be clearly marked as such."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Brimming with danger, suspense, excitement, and adventure, Treasure Island relates the story (in first-person) of Jim Hawkins as he journeys with his good friends, the doctor and squire, in search of buried treasure. He overhears the crew's plans of mutiny, headed by the polite, one-legged &quot;gentleman,&quot; Long John Silver, and is plunged into a world of treachery. The characterization is beautiful: the doctor, shrewd and kind; the squire, fiery and outspoken; Jim Hawkins, quick and intelligent; the crew, sly and devious; and Long John Silver, so unsuspectingly polite, so wickedly sly... A must-read! (BTW, I am 13-years-old.)"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Unfairly dismissed as a writer who wrote simple adventure stories, the popularity and longevity of Stevenson's novels have allowed them to join the literary greats, the most famous of which is \\"Treasure Island\\" (followed closely byStrange Case of Doctor Jekyll And Mr. Hyde (Tor Classics)andKidnapped (Scholastic Classics)). To say that it is a classic is an understatement, as everyone knows of the one-legged pirate Silver, the dreaded black spot, the buried treasure on the mysterious island, the stretched-out skeleton that points the way, and of course that infamous scene of young Hawkins overhearing the pirates from within the apple barrel. Yet, as is often the way with classics, everyone knows certain aspects of it, though comparatively few people have read the book itself. Instead, most are introduced to the story through movie adaptations (and there have been a few, from the memorable Disney classicTreasure Islandto the definitive 1930sTreasure Island, to the inexplicable sci-fi versionTreasure Planet. Heck, even the Muppets got in on the act withMuppet Treasure Island - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition).So, here's your chance to read the original work as penned by an excellent storyteller. Told in first-person narrative by the young Jim Hawkins, we learn of an old buccaneer at the Admiral Benbow Inn, a man named Billy Bones who leaves Jim in possession of a treasure map. It doesn't take Jim long to release that he's not the only one after this map, and together with figures like Doctor Livesey, Squire Trelawney and Captain Smollet, he sets sail upon the Hispaniola as cabin boy to the mysterious Treasure Island. Hawkins makes particular friends with the ship's cook, Long John Silver, a cheerful and quick-witted sailor who is surprising nimble despite having only one leg. But as the ship nears closer to its destination, Hawkins becomes aware of rumblings of mutiny amongst the crew - to kill the officers and snatch the treasure for themselves.Once they reach the island, the plot really kicks into high gear, as Jim is torn between the officers and the pirates, and the race to the treasure begins. On three separate occasions Hawkins acts recklessly, and yet each time his actions take a serendipitous turn and result in favorable outcomes. As such, \\"Treasure Island\\" is just as much a coming-of-age story as an adventure tale for young Jim, as he learns to take care of himself, take the initiative, learn not to judge by appearances, and separate friends from enemies. This is especially true of Long John Silver, easily the novel's most fascinating character. Devious, untrustworthy, charismatic, intelligent and able to switch sides at the blink of an eye, you never really know what to make of Silver, save that you cannot help but admire him. Despite all his double-crosses, he seems legitimately fond of Jim, and even Stevenson himself can't bring himself to send Silver to the gallows. In fact, Stevenson had originally titled the manuscript \\"The Sea-Cook\\" before this was vetoed by his publishers, shedding light on the importance of Silver within the context of the novel.Although it has entirely British cast, \\"Treasure Island\\" has an American dimension to it, perhaps owing to Stevenson's years in California - whatever the reason, it's hard to shake the feeling that the story has been \\"adopted\\" by American culture. Likewise, despite the fact that there is only one female character in the entire novel (Jim's feisty mother), it would be wrong to think it's exclusively for boys. There are plenty of thrills to be had for readers of both genders, and because it is a surprisingly slim volume written in action-filled prose, there's no reason not to think children of a reasonably young age can read it themselves. This edition in particularly is noteworthy, beautifully bound and illustrated - though any unabridged manuscript is more than enough."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"There are few novels that have had as much influence in popular culture as \\"Treasure Island.\\" Pirates with talking parrots, treasure maps, mutiny, deceit, this novel has it all. In spite of this, a great many individuals pass on reading the book because they think it is simply a childrens story. If you are leaning toward this bias, you should know that this claim is not true; the novel is filled with witty and believable characters. It also shows the duplicity of human character when brought about by greed and self preservation. Not only is it a classic for it's influence, it is also a classic for it's depiction of human behavior in abnormal circumstances."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"While Treasure Island may have its detractors (usually those who were forced to read it as children or those who cannot handle the period speech) it is certainly a classic that can delight both young and old. Stevenson make a strong effort to catch the \\"tune of the time\\" and give vivid prose to the tedium of long sea journeys and the rapid pace at which life can offer strange events to deal with, as young Jim Hawkins discovers.The story is set in mid-18th century western England where Jim helps to run a small out-of-the-way inn with his parents. They have a strange boarder: a grizzled sailor very fond of his shanties and rum. The sailor hides a secret map to a buried pirate treasure that comes into Jim's hands. The local squire recruits Jim and the village doctor to join him on a sea voyage to find the treasure for themselves.They obtain a ship and a crew including the most iconic pirate of all: Long John Silver (created well before the seafood restaurant and Jack Sparrow!). Silver eventually betrays Jim, revealing himself as a longtime pirate, but makes good his escape in the end. Stevenson filled Treasure island with all of the--now cliche--paraphenalia: marooning, parrots, and such. The pirates have enough colorful language that even Robert Newton must have tired of it during his enthusiastic performance in the 1950 Disney film adaptation.Perhaps my fondness is newfound since I only read it for the first time this year while I was on a week's cruise in the Caribbean, but Treasure Island now holds a favored spot on my bookshelves."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I remember the first time I got a copy of the book \\"Treasure Island,\\" I was about eight years old. I tried to get people to read it to me, but they always wanted to read something else, something with more pictures, and something with fewer words! It wasn't for several years that I finally got to read the book on my own - it took a while for my reading to advance, but I kept the book with the boy and pirate and the bird on the cover. It looked very interesting, and I knew there was treasure to be had inside of it!The narrator is Jim Hawkins, son of the innkeepers of the Admiral Benbow Inn. A mysterious stranger, Billy Bones, lives at the inn and likes to spin stories, including the one about the one-legged man who he warns Jim to keep a watch for. A blind man appears and so frightens Billy Bones with the black spot that he dies of a stroke. Jim and his mother find Billy's sea chest, and in there is a map.You knew that there had to be a map, didn't you?There were coins and other things, but soon others arrive in search of the map. Jim has care of the map, and takes it to people he trusts, the Squire Trelawney and Doctor Livesey. They recognize the map as a treasure map made by the evil Captain Flint. The Squire purchases a ship called \\"the Hispaniola,\\" hired a crew and a captain, Captain Smollet. The cook is perhaps the most famous name in the book - Long John Silver. He is a one-legged man, too.Jim discovers that some of Smollett's crew were part of Flint's crew, and are plotting to kill them all and take the treasure. Once on the island, most go ashore, including Jim, who discovers in hiding an ex-pirate named Ben Gunn who was left on the island by his former crew. Gunn promises to help Jim and his friends, who have taken refuge in an old fort on the island. The other pirates with Long John Silver attack the fort, but without success in getting the map.Jim manages to sneak into the fort, but the gunfire continues the next day, without success on either side. Jim sneaks out again, takes Ben Gunn's boat stealthily out to the Hispaniola, and cuts its ropes and sets it adrift. The next morning, the sea is rough, and Jim has to fend off the attack of a remaining pirate. Jim manages to get the ship into a cove.The fort falls, and the Doctor gives Long John Silver the map. There is some give and take among the pirates as to what to do with the doctor and Jim. After some tussle, in which Long John Silver almost gets the black spot of death himself, they go after the treasure chest. Will they find it?There is a lot of excitement here. Finding the treasure chest, after all this adventure, turns out to just be the beginning. Ben Gunn has a secret, you see, and the Doctor isn't out of the picture entirely, either. Long John Silver isn't quite the bloodthirsty pirate through and through, and in a strange twist, there is a relatively happy ending.It certainly made for an exciting story for a young boy, and when I re-read portions of it now and then, I get a bit of a thrill again. The characters are brash and well written. Robert Louis Stevenson is a great novelist, knowing how to put together plot and character, and his use of the language gives the reader a sense of the salt air and rough and tumble of the seas."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"For the past two years I have been searching for the perfect adventure book to suit my dreams, and I finally found it, Treasure Island. This story was told hundreds of years ago and changed over time. The author was Robert Louis Stevenson. This book had 232 pages of jam-packed action. This story was suppost to take place in the Pirate times. There were lots of characters thruout this story, but the two most important ones were Jim Hawkins, the leader of the pack, and Long John Silver, a kind of two faced person. This book was about Jim Hawkins and his friends going to sail to Treasure Island, hoping to find the burried loot of Captain Flint, the toughest of all the pirates. But they didn't know that the crew of their own ship is made up of Flint's old crew, led by the evil, one-legged pirate Long John Silver. Once on the island, Jim and his friends must find the burried treasure and escape efore the pirates capture them. I am not going to tell you the rest of the story because it will ruin a great story like this for you. Have fun reading it!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is one of a small number of books that are both for children and adults. The appeal of the book for children relates to the story line: pirates, buried treasure, sea voyages to faraway places, and a boy hero. The appeal of the book for adults is in seeing a wonderful example of how events operate at many different levels. Long John Silver quickly becomes the focus for adults. What is his true nature? What will he do next? Clearly, Silver is one of the most interesting and memorable of all fictional characters.A problem that children will have with this book is that the language is somewhat foreign to them. Some adults and children will find that the book starts slowly compared to newer novels (which often have the equivalent of a chase sequence in the first 5 pages).My advice is to stick with the story for the first 6 chapters, and see how you are doing. By that time, the story will either have cast its spell on you, or you will be able to tell that this book is not for you.A final reason for reading Treasure Island is because the book has been read by so many people. You will find references to the story in other literature and in conversation with others. You will also run into establishments called The Admiral Benbow Inn. It would be a shame not ot know its heritage. Also, finding someone else who likes Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver for the same reasons you do is a great shortcut to becoming better acquainted.Personally, I found the story irresistible. I would have written a very similar book if I had the skill to do so. The plot is nicely balanced, and the characters provide an unusual perspective for what could easily have been a real potboiler with little to recommend it. The book has great charm, given its focus on pirates, which makes it compelling for me. I have now read the book 3 times, and enjoyed it more each time.Have a great read!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"the provider failed to say it was an abridged item and for children. It was a waste of money"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"\\"Treasure island\\" was a hard book to understand at my age (12). Its sentences were written in old English, which got you confused. The sentences were also pretty long. There word choice was hard and confusing. On page 118 the 4th sentence has like three hard words. The description was good but at times the plot was confusing. A significant event that happened was when the mutineers attacked their ship and killed Flint.My personal opinion of this book is I thought it was bad and hard to understand. It was written so far back that the old English was so confusing. It seemed like there were like ten different things happening at one time. So a good age for a reader of this book would be around thirteen and up. Twelve year olds could read it to if you're a good reader. But if your not that great of a reader than you might think the book is confusing like I did. So all in all, I would give the book a three on a one through ten scale."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This book is extremly confusing and i found myself thrusted into a world i had no idea about.

The narrator isn't described, there's no texture, no detail. It just jumps into the story too quickly and I didn't feel anything about the characters or interest in the plot."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"It is no surprise that \\"Treasure Island\\" was written by Stevenson just in a few days as its carelessness and pretty bad style attest. On the contrary, it's really surprising that this poor novel could have been intended to be read in \\"one sitting\\" as it took me no less than five days to finish this bore.One of the main reasons I disliked the book was that I usually prefer \\"clean English\\" to \\"slang\\"; if I read English books is precisely to improve my grasp of the language and this novel doesn't contribute to that at all. There are many dialogues in the story written in a confusing and illiterate \\"pirate jargon\\" which make the novel very annoying to read. I should have bought a translation.But, personal preferences aside, this is not the only drawback because, as I kept reading, between one snore and another, I wondered how repetitive and pedestrian the language was and how unfriendly, conventional and dry the characters were. Even the character of John Silver is scarcely charismatic and flat. The book also struck me as so devoid of substantial and perennial meanings that it is beyond my knowledge why it is considered a \\"classic\\" to this day. For me, the only portion of the story I enjoyed were the first six chapters, where you can perceive that something is brewing up; after that, the novel sinks into tediousness until the end.My final piece of advice would be: don't bother to read this poor example of an adventure novel. There are some other books in the genre which I think excel \\"Treasure Island\\". Try for instance \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym\\" by Edgar Allan Poe, \\"The Boats of the Glen Carrig\\" by William Hope Hodgson, or even the sometimes pedantic but ultimately rewarding \\"Moby Dick\\" by Melville. Although any of these books I've mentioned are exempt from minor flaws, they all leave Stevenson's forgettable romance in the gutter. \\"Treasure Island\\" is just a book more popular than others but nothing else.Uninteresting, and you may lay to that..."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Well on top of it all i didnt enjoy the book well!

During the trip Jim finds out that there are pirates on the ship. They want the treasure for themselves. I believe the theme to this story is expect the unexpected. I believe this to be true because Jim did not expect that he would meet pirates along the way.I got a very good picture of the setting from all the descriptions. Robert Louis Stevenson did not write how the characters felt, which, in my opinion would have been more useful than the descriptions. I could picture myself in the characters shoes and know how it felt. If you like adventure I encourage you to read this book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The book \\"Treasure Island\\" is one of the greatest books ever made! The author of the book, Robert Louis Stevenson, is a literaly genius. His book had all the necessary parts to make the reader read for hours. It is a story of a young boy and a mean pirate, known as Long John Silver, and his terrible band of pirates. It is a story that has a perfect mix of good and evil, which leaves the reader wanting to know what is going to happen next.It all begins when Captain Billy Bones stays at the Admiral BenBow Inn where Jim Hawkins and his mother live. Jim shows the captain to his room and then tells him where the dining room is. When Jim asks for his name, he tells him to call him Captain. A few days later, a man comes to the Inn to visit Bill. Jim tells him there is no one there by the name of Bill, but there that there is someone called Captain. Just then the Captain opens the door and says \\"Black Dog\\". Then Bill asks Jim to leave them alone for a while. A few minutes later, Jim hears a loud smash and runs out to find out what is happening with both of them. Black Dog decides to leave the place after the fight. The next day the Captain faints and Dr. Livsey informs that the Captain has suffered a stroke and is not allowed to drink rum anymore. The next day a blind man comes to the Inn and asks to talk to Bill. Jim tells him that Bill is sick and isn't able to see anyone. The blind man grabs his arm and says he will break it if he doesn't tell him where the captain is. Jim gets very scared and leads him to Bill's room. The blind man gives Bill a piece of paper with a dot on it and on the back it says: \\"You have six hours until we return\\". Bill tells Jim the pirates were coming to the Inn in six hours and, if he didn't live long enough that he should take the key and open up his treasure chest and take the map. Jim doesn't understand what Bill is talking about and, when he turns around, Bill drops dead on the floor with a bottle of rum in his hand.This is just a small part of the excellent book.

So I put off reading this book until the last week before school started and then only picked it up because of my mother's nagging. I dragged myself through the first few pages and then I was shocked (a little horrified I confess) to find myself loving it! I couldn't stop turning the pages. I sucked up the book in a day and enjoyed it all immensely. It changed me. It expanded my &quot;girlish&quot; view of the world. The experience taught me to try books out before rejecting them.

Many of the things we think of today as being trademarks of pirates (buried treasure, treasure maps, peg legs, parrots, desert islands) come more from Stevenson's tale than from history. But this book isn't about history, it's about pirates, adventure, and coming of age, and it delivers marvelously on all of those promises.The narrator, young Jim Hawkins, lives and works at an inn owned by his parents. One day, a mysterious seaman takes lodging there with an equally mysterious chest. After some time, other sailors arrive looking for the first seaman. Out of this, from the seaman's chest Jim manages to find a treasure map leading to the untold riches of a now-dead but still famous pirate named Captain Flint. Jim takes the map to a couple of country gentlemen, who decide to charter a ship to look for the treasure and take Jim along as cabin boy.Unfortunately for Jim and our heroes, but fortunately for the plot, they have a hard time finding sailors, and they turn to their new ship's cook, the one-legged Long John Silver, for \\"help\\" in rounding out the crew. Silver, as is hardly a spoiler, is actually a former pirate and crews the ship accordingly, having heard what they're after and eager to find those riches for himself.The excitement mounts as Jim goes on several daring adventures to save himself and the faithful party, and Silver struggles to keep control of his mutineers, all the while treasure is calling. Jim shows a great deal of growth, taking charge of several perilous situations and demonstrating considerable bravery he never possessed when dealing with the mysterious sailor in his parents' inn. Silver, meanwhile, is a savvy character who's self-interest and ability to play both sides against the middle knows no bounds. If you're looking for a master of duplicity and double-cross, Silver could give Jack Sparrow lessons.Stevenson's writing is fantastic. The colorful language of the pirates, and the refined speech of the gentlemen leading the faithful party, are a joy to experience. The drama steadily rises, despite the fact the book's story is well known and I've read it several times before. It's certainly no accident that this book has had such a powerful effect on an entire genre of fiction even 130 years later.I've also listened to the book as narrated by Ralph Cosham, who I've enjoyed greatly and listened to on several other stories. If you're considering which audio version to listen to, you can't go wrong with Cosham's.Treasure Island is about as easily available as a book can be, as every library will have it on hand, it's on Wikisource for free, Amazon has it for Kindle for free or in paperback for $2, and I've even seen it at Target for $1. It's also only 300 quick pages.

The imagery is spooky, the characters are colorful, and the story is packed with excitement and adventure. It's a fun \\"boy's story\\" almost on par with \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and far better than most of the paperbacks I read as a child in the 90's. (There's far more to enjoy in this single novel than in a dozen of the \\"Goosebumps\\" volumes I grew up on.)The conclusion seemed a bit rushed and was a little pat, I suppose (especially in regards to the fate of Long John Silver). I guess I expected a twist or an open ending, but to be fair, it didn't exactly close with \\"happily ever after,\\" either.As far as pleasant surprises go, I enjoyed the coming-of-age aspect of the story. Though the book spans, perhaps, a year (with the main story occurring over the course of just a few weeks), Jim sees some significant character development. He has to adapt and quickly transform from a scared kid into one daring enough to... well... you should read it for yourself.I wish I'd read \\"Treasure Island\\" around the age of 12 or so, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy reading it as an adult. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for adventure."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"\\"15 men on a dead man's chest...Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum\\"Jim Hawkins is the young son of a poor innkeeper when he meets his first pirate, Billy Bones, who has holed up at the Admiral Benbow, trying to avoid his death at the hands of his fellow gentlemen o' fortune. His fate has already been sealed though and the pirates set upon the inn with violence, seeking the map that leads to Cap'n Flint's treasure. However, in an attempt to make good Billy's debt, Jim has already stolen away with it, not knowing what it is. When he finally learns what he has, he along with Squire Trelawney, Doctor Livesey, Long John Silver, and a mutinous crew depart from the port of Bristol in search of treasure.This is the classic pirate story from which all others follow. Without Treasure Island where would Pirates of the Caribbean be? I adored this story from start to finish. It was easy read, written as it was for a younger audience, but it was just so much fun that it didn't matter. Having previously seen movie adaptations of the story, I already knew what to expect, or thought I did. I certainly didn't expect to enjoy the adventure as much as I did. I read it in two sittings and went to bed dreaming of pirates and treasure. I can see exactly why it is such a favorite of young boys and why the pirate, cruel though most of these were, remains such a romantic figure in the collective psyche."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I never read this book as a kid, and I don't even remember seeing the movie. I have a whole new view on eating at Long John Silvers now!I thought it was an enjoyable story, albeit a bit far-fetched that young Jim was so capable, and that Long John could get around so well on a crutch. Despite that, it was a fun read, and one I will recommend to my kids."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I can now see where Johny Depp gets his inspiration. This is the great granddaddy of pirate stories. Treasure Island cast the mold for all such tales to come. A true classic!

Stevenson's lovingly applied detail in describing people, places and things sucks the reader in immediately, and you'll stick around to experience one of the finest narratives in all of sailing literature.It is thus unsurprising that Treasure Island's somewhat visual style inspired several similar stories, mostly films. When I first read it, it reminded me of Indiana Jones 4 mixed with Pirates of the Caribbean and a tiny pinch of the Cohen Brother's True Grit adaption. You can sometimes feel the dry humor of the original Office in there too.The plot involves an old sea dog taking residence in an inn in England, trying and failing to escape his old pirate shipmates, who want the treasure map he has. He dies of alcohol poisoning, and the map is taken by Jim Hawkins, who was owed money by the deceased sailor. Jim and his friends use the map to find an island where pirate gold awaits. The story sounds hokey on paper, but in reality this is the mother of all pirate stories, and it's execution is so flawless any disbelief is quickly and forcefully cast aside.Treasure Island is much about its characters. There are quite a few of them, and Stevenson manages to juggle them successfully and keep all the balls in the air, if you will. There's a few humorous exchanges from Dr. Livesy and Squire Trewalny, who bicker like Holmes and Watson in Sign of Four; there's of course the infamous rogue Silver, who starts off as a cheery cook only to turn the tables and start hunting for our hero's blood. But the real star of the book is Jim Hawkins, an intelligent young boy (probably about 10-12 years old) who narrates the story and carries it along. Jim is somehow simultaneously funny, smart and a little complicated, a lot like Indiana Jones. In certain scenes, however, he displays moments of self-centered eccentricity, which do wonders to humanize him.In film adaption and sequels, Jim is often overshadowed by Silver (who, to be fair, is also an interesting character). This isn't true to the spirit of Treasure Island, however, as Jim is largely the star character and rightfully so. He deserves his place next to Jack Sparrow and Indiana Jones as one of the greatest characters to wear a good hat and go treasure hunting.

I do wish I had read it when I was 12, but I think there were elements of the book that I would not have picked up on at that age that I enjoyed now. I'll suggest it to my boys when they are old enough to enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"A tale of suspense, filled with pirates, hidden treasure, and a plot not soon forgotten, Treasure Island hits the top of the charts. When Jim Hawkins comes in to possession of the notorious Captain Flint's treasure map, a crew is rounded up and a hunt for the treasure beginns. Little do Jim and his companions, the Squire and Dr. Livesay, know that many of Captain Flint's murderous pirates are part of that crew. That changes though, when Jim hears something not meant for him to hear. He, the Squire, and Dr. Livesay are now unaware of who and who not to trust. It becomes a battle between the good and evil in a race for the treasure. Greed was a major aspect that caused many sailors to turn against what they knew was right; sticking with their captain and boat. But they wanted the treasure for themselves, and their greed consumed them. Just remember though, greed will not get you anywhere, as this book shows. All that it gets you is more trouble than you need. The author, Robert Louis Stevenson, uses foreshadowing, a technique that gives a hint of what is to come, that keeps you wanting more, and creates an atmosphere of mystery. Treasure Island is a \\"must read\\" for all who love pirates, treasure hunts, and a great story."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"A classic Robert Louis Stevens tale written perhaps for children but enjoyable enough for an adult. The words describe a picture in your mind."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"It's a classic ! I love RL Stevenson's writting. The use of some nautical words sent me to the dictionary so it was also a learning experience, (in case I'm ever on a Pirate ship I'll know what they are talking about) !

I was entranced all over again. The isolated inn. The dark night. The blind pirate tapping up the road. The BLACK SPOT! Stevenson was certainly a terrific writer and spinner of tales. Then off they go to the island where that parrot-shouldered, peg-legged character Long John Silver weaves his way from one side of the mutiny to the other.

Anyway, this book gets on the top 5 of my favorite books, among &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth,&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; You cant go wrong with this book.

The first scenes in the inn and on the ship are great and full of possibility, but as soon as the pirates mutinied I lost intrest in it.

More people should read this book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson is an epic story about a mutinous gang of pirates and buried treasure. The classic story starts when a strange man walks in to the Admiral Benbow Inn. He tells a boy named Jim Hawkins a very important warning, to watch out for a seafaring man with one leg. So when Jim found one, he knew not to trust the one-legged man, Long John Silver. Even though I saw all the movies and knew what was going to happen I enjoyed Stevenson's details and the way he turned Jim Hawkins into a spy for his captain."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Michael Prichard's narration is flawless. The story is gripping, laden with suspense, and still fresh despite the events in question taking place in the 18th century. The \\"sea-going man with one leg\\" may even give you nightmares."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"What is every teens fantasy? It's running away from home to get away from parents and rules and homework etc. and to have an adventure like Jim Hawkins. After seeing the movie, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, for the 3rd or 4th or 5th times teens are going to fantasize more about joining a crew of pirates to have an adventure on the high seas. Only there are no longer pirates like those who lived in the 17th and 18th centuries. But teens like me can escape and have adventures by reading pirate books like TREASURE ISLAND and ROBINSON CRUSOE. (The latter is based on a real pirate named Alexander Selkirk who was marooned on an island. Fortunately a ship picked him up in a short time not years later, and he didn't have an encounter with canibals like Robinson Crusoe.) Treasure Island is slow in places, but there's no law saying a reader has to read the slow parts. I just skipped over them and got to the good parts. I've read parts of other true books about pirates. But the modern day one I liked the best was THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO. No, it is not dorky. It has a good story with good characters (slave children) who watch Blackbeard as he holds their city hostage. In the back of the book you can see real photos of pirates, jolly rogers, and slave stuff. There is also more information about pirates of that time, and they weren't quite like the ones in the movies. I recommend everyone read Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe, and that new book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"\\"Treasure Island\\" is the classic adventure novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. Set on the high seas amid treasures and pirates, it is the story of a young boy's adventure. \\"Treasure Island\\" has been done by everyone from Disney to the Muppets. It's been imitated many times and influenced countless books and movies.A mysterious pirate shows up at an inn owned by Jim Hawkin's mother. The pirate is killed by a gang of rogues, but Jim finds a treasure map belonging to the pirate. Jim then embarks on a journey to far away island to find the treasure. Of course, nobody can be trusted - especially the cook, Long John Silver. With his peg leg and parrot, Silver is the stereotypical pirate. Once the island is reached, sides are chosen - the mutinous pirates against the ship's crew. Jim goes on a journey within a journey on the island, going from one side to another, as the treasure is hunted for.Everyone should read this book at some point. It's especially good for young boys, due to the fact that the main character (Jim) is a young boy. It's well crafted, and easy to read. And it's hard to put down once you get going. What else can you ask for?"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is a good book. The story is interesitng but can get confusing.

Long John Silver, peg legged and patch eyed. \\"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest\\", buried treasure, etc. Most of what we think of being \\"pirately\\" (whether accurate or not) came from this novel. This book really doesn't really need another review, it has been in print for a long time which is testimonial to how good it is. I rate it with Tom Sawyer and The Hobbit as one of the most cherished books of my childhood as it really made me relate with the main character. One of those books that leaves you feeling like you've gone on a journey after you've read it.

His experience with the captain leads him on an adventure of a lifetime. He finds hardship, backstabbing (most of the time literal!!) and new enemies. Written with superb vocabulary, Robert Louis Stevenson knows how to attract an audience. The first few chapters were a real bore for me. The rest of the book makes up for the lack of excitement, though. I read waiting in suspense for what would happen next. Another thing I enjoyed was the characteristics of the pirates, from the greediness way up to the drunkenness. All in all, Treasure Island is a book everyone should read if they are looking for excitement, gluttony, survival of the fittest, and treachery."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"TreasurE Island..the author of this book is Robert Louis STephenson.

At times the plot was very confusing. In the book the sentence structuse I think sometimes was very pourly done. I think that because the sentences went on and on but the pharagragh was vey fine sizes.Sometimes the book is very hillarias. Over all the this book was pretty good. I would not recommend this book to younger aged kids because the book uses a couple curse words and some of the words are kind of challenging. When you read the story it keeps you interested, yet it is a good sized book. I think that this book is really interesting because it will keep you thinking the entire time and it relates to other sea books."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The all time worst book a teacher ever made me read I wouldn't make my worst enemy read this piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Well, mates.

It's designed for children to read and think they're reading an adult novel without realizing that that's what they're supposed to think.The problem is, the language and the way they talk may make it hard for children to get through. Basically, Treasure Island has lost its target audience.However, it is still a cute adventure romp that has inspired many of its kind (with or without Johnny Depp). Read it as a classic, not anything else."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"It's too long and boring. I think this book is not suitable for Hong Kong students in primary six. It makes us sleep. There are a lot of difficult vocabulary words. I wish there were more pictures and easier vocabulary words. We shouldn't buy this book. It's more boring than the Bible. I prefer to play computer games."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is the story of a young boy who searches for treasure. The characters are the most memorable thing about this story, including the blind pirate Pew, the passive-aggresive Long John Silver, amongst others. There's some hidden meaning here, but it's pretty buried and probably not noticable if someone doesn't point it out to you.That said, I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone, only adults who are looking for action adventure. The dialog can be pretty tough in places because it's full of slang. The pirates are especially difficult to understand, even the main character jokes about not understanding one of the pirates. There is a lot of violence, and it's pretty realistic, which is probably not ideal for the little ones."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is a good book.

Though the text is hard to understand at points, the humor is to die for. After all, who on earth is afraid of the French. A great read for adults and kids alike."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Jim Hawkins, a young boy, helps to run a family inn and falls into trouble left and right. When Billy Bones, an old buccaneer that lived in the inn, dies and leaves his large chest for claim, Jim snatches the key from his neck and opens his chest. He finds an oilskin package that contained a map to buried treasure and embarks on a journey to recover it. He and some of his companions go to Bristol, set up a crew, and board the great Hispaniola and depart for the island. One of the crewmembers they acquired while in Bristol was the famous pirate, Long John Silver. While on the journey, Jim overhears a conversation between Long John and three other members in which the men prepared plans of mutiny and determined how they would carry them out. They reach the island and the crew begins their corruption. Jim and his companions fight many conflicts while on the island. They are low on supplies, outnumbered, injured, and tired. Jim set out to retrieve the Hispaniola and completes his objective successfully. When he returns to the old stockade, he has a surprise waiting for him."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"A tale of suspense, filled with pirates, hidden treasure, and a plot not soon forgotten, Treasure Island hits the top of the charts.When Jim Hawkins comes in to possession of the notorious Captain Flint&#65533;s treasure map, a crew is rounded up and a hunt for the treasure begins. Little do Jim and his companions, the Squire and Dr. Livesay, know that many of Captain Flint&#65533;s murderous pirates are part of that crew. That changes though, when Jim hears something not meant for him to hear. He, the Squire, and Dr. Livesay are now unaware of who and who not to trust. It becomes a battle between the good and evil in a race for the treasure.Greed was a major aspect that caused many sailors to turn against what they knew was right; sticking with their captain and boat. But they wanted the treasure for themselves, and their greed consumed them. Just remember though, greed will not get you anywhere, as this book shows. All that it gets you is more trouble than you need.The author, Robert Louis Stevenson, uses foreshadowing, a technique that gives a hint of what is to come, that keeps you wanting more, and creates an atmosphere of mystery. Treasure Island is a &#65533;must read&#65533; for all who love pirates, treasure hunts, and a great story."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is one of the most facinating tales of courage and friendship written for children. I have read this book at least five times, and have since lost count. It is a sprited adventure story, that stimulates vivid mental pictures."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This book is great! I loved how it kept you on the edge of your seat. If you like adventure books that you never know what is going to happen next, then read this book. I absolutely loved how Jim did everything that you would never expect. He just keeps you suprised. I like how he helps his friends defeat the pirates. It starts off slow however, but the action heats up in the end. You absolutely MUST read this book it is the best. You'll read all the pages in one sitting if you have the chance. Anyway just read it!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This classic by Robert Louis Stevenson should have a place on everyone's shelf. When we think of tales of pirates and buccaneers, we can not help but thing of Captain Flint and Long John Silver.Why this edition? Although this is by no means a keepsake, it is an inexpensive and well-done edition. It is unabridged and has an illustration of the treasure map as well as illustrations from other scenes in the book (such as Jim Hawkins' meeting Ben Gunn). It is easy to carry around when you are out on vacation or doing some hiking. You can't do that with a keepsake.The story is written in narrative fashion, mostly from the perspective of Hawkins, but sometimes from Dr. Livesey's point of view. Either way, it is fast paced and hard to put down.I would recommend this edition to anyone not willing to invest in a hardcover keepsake. You can not go wrong."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is- I hesitate even to say arguably- the greatest adventure novel ever written. The tale has endured for over a century, and is not likely to disappear from print anytime in the near future. I can only encourage readers to invest in the more expensive Scribner Classic edition, complete with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. An immortal book deserves an immortal presentation, and Wyeth's paintings bring Stevenson's words vividly to life."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"'Treasure Island' is one of those books everybody's heard of, but not everyone has read. I didn't read it when I was a kid, but because it's an all-time classic, I finally read it recently. I'm very glad I did - I thought it was great. It's often billed as a &quot;boys' adventure story&quot;, but it's far more than just that - the superb writing, fantastic characters and exciting story transcend age and gender. Read it yourself, then give it to your kids - an enjoyable book for everyone."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is an exciting book full of action and suspense. The main character, Jim Hawkins, finds Billy Bones'old treasure map. Jim knows that a fortune in gold lies ahead of him. Jim, Dr. Livesey, and Squire Trewlawney round up a crew for there gold-seeking adventure. The voyage goes well until Jim overhears a frightening conversation and learns that their cook is Long John Silver. Worst of all, the crew and Long John Silver are plotting to steal the treasure! If you like, adventure, sail ships, and pirates this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This version contains a functioning table of contents, its proof read, the pictures are beautiful, and there is a reader friendly 'notes' section in the back which gives the reader some context and backstory to the tail. There is also a 'Waiting for Godo' like one act play in the back between Captain Smollet and Silver, which I skimmed through for laughs. If you are going to read this on the kindle, forgo today's cup of Starbucks and buy this version.The book itself was a lot of fun. I am 30 and had never really heard of this book, but I got caught up in the suspense and excitement of it pretty quickly. Its a quick and fun adventure story featuring pirates, and I look forward to reading it to my son when he is about 5+ years old."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island is known and thought of as being a children's classic. And that's fair--the book is a great one for a young boy or girl; it's not too long, has wonderfully vibrant characters, and is filled with action and adventure. I mean, it has pirates!But Treasure Island is also a book that can be read when you're older with no less fun or excitement. Also, if you've never read this classic, you'll learn by reading it exactly why it's such a big part of literary culture, why everyone seems to know at least a little bit about it. Long John Silver is one of the most enjoyable villains in all literature, Jim and his allies are all heroic and likable, and the action sequences are gripping.In the particular edition that I recently read, there was an essay following the story that talked about how Stevenson and Treasure Island are not really respected in the academic community because Treasure Island is, at heart, just an adventure story. But let's not discount \\"just an adventure story\\"--great stories are really the reason why people continue to write books today, and Treasure Island is not \\"just an adventure story\\"--it is a *wonderful* adventure story that will thrill readers, young and old. Treasure Island is well worth the read for adults, and also a perfect choice for reading to your children."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I evaluated three series of abridged/paraphrased classics: Great Illustrated Classics, Stepping Stones, and Classic Starts. I specifically read Treasure Island in all three versions, but also evaluated the Jungle Book and other stories in at least two of the versions.Great Illustrated Classics is in between the others in length and complexity of sentence structures. It's not as easy to read as Stepping Stones but offers a slightly better story by virtue of more adjectives, adverbs and clauses in the sentence structure. The language is still more basic than Classic Starts, and the story suffers some because detail is left out that would embellish it. GIC may be the best series for children readers.Personally, I bought the books intending to read to my kingergarten age children, rather than have them read. We found the Classic Starts to have by far the best versions of the stories, notwithstanding the originals which are just too long for us, in language that is hard to be understood.So far, with the children, we finished Call of the Wild, are half-way through the Jungle Book, and started Treasure Island. Previously we've read books like those of Beverly Cleary and the Little House series, besides hundreds of basically picture books (think Virginia Lee Burton, H. A. Rey etc.) The classics have a little bolder story lines, and these abridged series make them more accessible.Note that the illustrations are poor and don't really add anything. These are just paraphrased classic stories. The illustrations in GIC are the least appealing and not any more frequent than those in Classic Starts. If you want lots of illustrations, try Illustrated Classics (comic book versions). The stories are very poor, but there's lots of illustrations, none of which are fantastic by comparison to a good imagination with an adaquate telling of the story.I recommend Great Illustrated Classics for the avid chapter book reader. For stories to be read-aloud, I prefer Classic Starts."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The book is nice and i enjoy the illustrations. But i really only got it for the audiobook download since you can get this book for free. Turns out the audiobook is just a download from librivox. So kind of a ripoff but oh well."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I've recently read War and Piece and Moby Dick and I found Treasure Island more difficult to read than the former two. Its unfathomable how children around the age of 9 can read this.I do no know whether it was because I kept picking it up and starting and stopping again or if its the style of writing. The book sometimes seems a blur when I was reading it and and cant grasb the details. For instance I didnt realize the main charactor was a boy not a man- I just learned that from a review. There is a lot of sailing terminology which the writer expects the reader to already know, where as in Moby Dick the writer explains. I still enjoyed the story and charactors and it is still worth reading as its only a couple of a hundred pages."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson may not have known what he had created when he wrote \\"Treasure Island\\" for his nephew, but let's hope he had some measure of how many imaginations he would spark with this, the definitive pirate novel.This timeless tale of youthful adventure and derring-do focuses on two characters - the young Jim Hawkins and the dastardly charming Long John Silver. Jim narrates most of the tale, and while he's a young lad of thirteen or thereabouts, he's an adventurer to his core. One of the most exciting aspects of this novel is watching young Jim take on challenge after challenge, risking life and limb, all for what he believes is good and true. Whether it's facing down a murderous pirate, or seizing a ship single-handed, or sticking to his word at the risk of his life, Jim is as much a hero as Bilbo Baggins or Harry Potter.What elevates the novel, though, is the nefarious character, Long John Silver. Every pirate in popular culture stems from this magnificent creation. Profane, noble, violent and gentle, Silver is a man for the ages - a peg-legged brute with a parrot on his shoulder and a cutlass in his hand, Silver is the stuff of nightmares and legends. Playing both sides of the fence in his devious ploy to steal Captain Flint's buried treasure, Silver confounds Jim's moral compass and earns both disgust and admiration - no small feat for any author.And through it all stalks the ghost of the murderous pirate, Captain Flint. Forever offstage but never far from our hearts, Captain Flint terrifies even the hardiest soul.When you close the book after reading the last page, you can't help but drift off to sleep with visions of sailing the seven seas, searching for buried treasure, and hearing that parrot squawk, \\"Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\\"A timeless classic that holds up despite all its imitators."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is a classic book that consists of Pirates, Treasure and much more. It will be read by kids for years to come. It has cleverly thought-out character names such as Long John Silver and Captain Flint. It has an amazing plot line, and because of this, this book has gone down in History. First published as a book in 1883, it also went under the title of The Sea Cook, meaning Long John Silver. It has just kept on gathering steam over the many years, and shows no sign of stopping any time soon. Since the day that this book was published, whenever Robert Louis Stevenson's name is mentioned, people automatically think of Treasure Island. This book is arguably the best of Robert Louis Stevenson's work, and many other people would agree too.The book begins with young Jim Hawkins running into a frightening old sea captain who drinks more rum than water. Jim and the old sea captain get to know each other pretty well, but when the Captain dies, Jim decides to open up the old captain's trunk and finds and old treasure map that begins his entire adventure. Before Jim knows it, he is aboard the \\"Hispaniola\\" with the Squire, the Doctor, and the seemingly pleasant cook Long John Silver, on their way for the treasure. The whole voyage was going very pleasantly, until Jim overhears Long John and the crew discussing mutiny. Jim knew that the Captain of the \\"Hispaniola,\\" the Squire, the Doctor and he were not safe, so he immediately told the Captain. The next day the Captain has the crew go on shore so he, the Doctor, the Squire, and Jim can load the supplies on to a separate part of the Island. By the time the Mutineers figure this out they are safely on shore. Despite numerous attempts by the mutineers to get their hands on the treasure map, they fail each time, and Jim manages to find the ship and hide it safely away from the mutineers. But when he returns, he finds that the doctor gave the treasure map and the stores to Long John Silver. He is then forced to go hunt the treasure with the Mutineers, only to discover that it's not there! The Mutineers are furious and advance on Jim, but just then the Doctor and a Maroon save Jim, and take him away to a cave. It is there that he discovers that the Maroon found the Treasure a long time ago, and had many stocks in his cave, so the doctor decided to give the Mutineers the map and watch them go on a wild goose chase. The only problem is that they think they lost the ship, but Jim tells them that he stole back the ship, and that they can sail home for England!!My opinion of the book was that it had a nice little surprise around every corner. The author described each character very nicely and put a clear picture in your head. It was very clever of the author to use Jim Hawkins as the narrator of the story. He also had the Doctor narrate for a few chapters to show another side of the story. The author usually foreshadowed before a big event, making you want to read on. At first, the language is a little hard to understand, but once you get used to it you cruise along. I thought that the author overall did a great job writing the book. I always wondered how he got the ideas for the plot twists. This book is the kind that will make you wish that there was more after you finished. I think this was a great book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"For those of you who love a good book about pirates, mutiny, treasure hunting and \\"swash buckling\\" in general, Treasure Island is a must read classic by Robert Louis Stevenson.This is about a young boy seeking adventure and a way to help his family. The boy's name is Jim Hawkins. His first idea was to get on a boat and find a secret island, Treasure Island, which was said to have mounds of gold. But Jim's adventure turns into a nightmare as the crew begins to mutiny on him and the captain. The mutiny was led by Long John Silver. Now Jim and some of his fellow sailors must get to the treasure before the rogues do. This struggle to win the race leads to tragedy and a secret. You read along as Jim goes through an adventure of a lifetime. He meets pirates, a lost man who eats goats to stay alive, to name only a few. There were many men who died in these adventures, some trying to save Jim, while others were trying to kill him. This is a great story that captures your imagination with fantasy and adventure in every new problem that needs to be solved. I didn't find the reading difficult to follow. The writing was realistic and the characters almost seemed real. With all the pirate movies out lately, you could somewhat imagine what he was writing about even without a visual. I found the story had mystery and was comical at times.The author's voice is first person through the main character, Jim. There was action, fantasy, mystery, and a swash buckling good time for anyone reading this book. This author also wrote the book Mr. Hyde some years later. I was surprised to find that the author wrote over thirteen novels, poetry, essays and even plays. He wrote this book in 1881 and it was published in 1883. The author traveled many places with his family around the world. I think his travels influenced his writing, especially this book. Given that I enjoyed this book as much as I did, I hope to read more of his books and find out if his other writing is as detailed and full of adventure as this book is.I love reading and this book will be added to my list of \\"read again\\" and make sure I share with my kids the fun and exciting adventures this book offered me. I hope you enjoy the book and find yourself feeling like you are searching the seas for the treasures that remain lost.Philip P - 6th grade"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island Bantam, 1981, 194 pp., $2.25Robert Louis Stevenson ISBN 0-553-21249-4\\"Fifteen men on a dead man's chest.

Unlike some of the reviewers below me, at 9 I had no trouble at all comprehending Treasure Island or anything else Stevenson wrote.Full-blown characters, and what a passel of them. The story runs on from the start like a runaway freight train. The duplicity of Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey versus the cunning of Long John Silver made for excellent conflict. Captain Smollett was the right kind of leavening.And even after all his conniving and treachery, Stevenson was able to give Silver a certain likeability -- I wasn't unhappy to see him sail away, and neither was Jim Hawkins.Of course, even with all his initial innocence, Jim Hawkins came from just the right mold, believably apprehensive and fearful when that was called for, but able to rise to essential occasions.This wonderful story was praised more eloquently than I can by culzean7@cs.com below.It's a pity that school teachers still force-feed good stuff down the throats of kids today, then turn them loose to plaster graffiti all over these review pages.

My only quarrel is I prefer the movie adaptations over the books representation of John Silver. The book had him more dark while movies had him little more likeable.
